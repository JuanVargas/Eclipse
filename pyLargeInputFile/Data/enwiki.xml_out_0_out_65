ymplesiomorphy'' (&quot;shared plesiomorphy&quot;, i.e. &quot;shared close form&quot;), is a characteristic that is present at the base of a tree (cladogram). Since a plesiomorphy that is inherited from the common ancestor may appear anywhere in a tree, its presence provides no evidence of relationships within the tree. The traditional definition of reptiles (the blue group in the diagram) includes being cold-blooded (i.e. not maintaining a constant high body temperature), whereas birds are warm-blooded. Since cold-bloodedness is a plesiomorphy, inherited from the common ancestor of traditional reptiles and birds, it should not be used to define a group in a system based on cladistics.
* {{anchor|apomorphy}}{{anchor|synapomorphy}} ''[[Apomorphy]]'' (&quot;separate form&quot;) or ''derived state'' is a characteristic believed to have evolved within the tree. It can thus be used to separate one group in the tree from the rest. Within the group which shares the apomorphy it is a ''[[synapomorphy]]'' (&quot;shared apomorphy&quot;, i.e. &quot;shared separate form&quot;). For example, within the vertebrates, all tetrapods (and only tetrapods) have four limbs; thus, having four limbs is an synapomorphy for tetrapods. All the tetrapods can legitimately be grouped together because they have four limbs.
* ''[[Homoplasy]]'' is a characteristic shared by members of a tree but not present in their common ancestor. It arises by convergence or reversion. Both mammals and birds are able to maintain a high constant body temperature (i.e. they are 'warm-blooded'). However, the ancestors of each group did not share this character, so it must have evolved independently. Mammals and birds should not be grouped together on the basis that they are warm-blooded.

The terms (sym)plesiomorphy and (syn)apomorphy are relative and their application depends on the position of a group within a tree. An apomorphy of one clade is a plesiomorphy of another contained within it. For example, when trying to decide whether tetrapods should form a clade, an important question is whether having four limbs is a synapomorphy of all the taxa to be included within Tetrapoda: did all the possible members of the Tetrapoda inherit four limbs from a common ancestor, whereas all other vertebrates did not? By contrast, for a group within the tetrapods, such as birds, having four limbs is a plesiomorphy. The fact that ostriches and rheas both have four limbs does not provide any support for putting them into a separate group of 'flightless birds'. Using these two terms allows a greater precision in the discussion of [[homology (biology)|homology]], in particular allowing clear expression of the hierarchical relationships among different homologies.

It can be difficult to decide whether a character is in fact the same, and thus can classified as a synapomorphy which may identify a group, or whether it only appears to be the same, and is thus a homoplasy which cannot identify a group. There is a danger of circular reasoning: assumptions about the shape of a phylogenetic tree are used to justify decisions about characters, which are then used as evidence for the shape of the tree. It has been argued that this kind of reasoning has been used by proponents of the view that birds are nested within the theropod dinosaur clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Pourtless IV|2009|p=25}}: &quot;Synapomorphies are invoked to defend the hypothesis; the hypothesis is invoked to defend the synapomorphies.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology for groups===

Three main types of group can be identified on the basis of their relationships in cladograms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patterson 1988&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;de Pinna 1991&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three can be defined in two different but related ways, as shown in the table below. The first is in terms of the shape of a set of nodes taken from a cladogram. In this approach, an 'ancestor node' is simply a branching point in the diagram; it may or may not correspond to an actual ancestor. The second is in terms of the characters of the taxa being classified and how these characters have been inherited. In this approach, an ancestor is an actual taxon, whether currently known or not.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;

|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Monophyly
| A monophyletic group of nodes in a tree is one which includes all the nodes descended from their most recent common ancestor node, plus the most recent common ancestor node, but no other nodes.
| A monophyletic group of taxa is characterized by one or more '''[[Synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]''': derived characters inherited by all members of the group from ancestors and not inherited by any other taxa. A monophyletic group is a '[[clade]]'. A '[[crown group]]' is an example of a monophyletic group.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Paraphyly
| A paraphyletic group of nodes in a tree is one which is constructed by taking a monophyletic group and removing one or more smaller monophyletic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Many sources give a verbal definition of 'paraphyletic' which does not require the missing groups to be monophyletic. However, when diagrams are presented representing paraphyletic groups, these invariably show the missing groups as monophyletic. See e.g. {{Harvnb|Wiley|Siegel-Causey|Brooks|Funk|1991|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Removing one group produces a singly paraphyletic group, removing two a doubly paraphylectic group, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;) A paraphyletic group is necessarily non-monophyletic.
| A paraphyletic group of taxa is characterized by one or more '''[[Symplesiomorphy|(sym)plesiomorphies]]''': characters inherited from ancestors but not present in all of their descendants. As a consequence, a paraphyletic group is truncated, in that it excludes one or more monophyletic taxa from an initially monophyletic group. An alternative name is an '[[evolutionary grade]]', referring to the ancestral character state within the group. A '[[stem group]]' is an example of a paraphyletic group.
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
| Polyphyly
| A polyphyletic group of nodes in a tree is one which is neither monophyletic nor paraphyletic.
| A polyphyletic group of taxa is characterized by one or more '''[[Homoplasy|homoplasies]]''': characters which have converged or reverted so as to appear to be the same but which have not been inherited from common ancestors. As a consequence, polyphyletic groups of taxa are totally artificial.

===Branch-based definitions of clade===
{{See also|Phylogenetic nomenclature#Phylogenetic definitions|l1=Phylogenetic definitions}}
[[File:Clade types.svg|thumb|250px|right|Three alternative ways to define a clade]]
The node-based definition of a monophyletic group (i.e. a clade) given above regards the lines in the cladogram only as a way of showing connections between taxa. This is appropriate when considering only living (extant) taxa; however, when extinct taxa are to be included in a cladogram, lines correspond to sequences of ancestors. There are two alternative ways of defining a [[clade]] which explicitly take into account the line below the branching point at the base of a clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Queiroz|Gauthier|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions are most notably set out in the [[PhyloCode]].

Consider how a clade combining A and B in the diagram can be defined.

*''Node-based'': The node-based definition specifies A+B as the ''last'' common ancestor of A and B, and all descendants of that ancestor. It thus excludes from the clade the line below the junction of A and B. [[Crown group]]s are a type of node-based clade.
* ''Branch-based'': A branch-based definition specifies A+B as the ''first'' ancestor of A which is not also an ancestor of C, and all descendants of that ancestor. It thus includes in the clade the line below the junction of A and B. (This type of definition was originally called &quot;stem-based&quot;, but this was changed to avoid confusion with the term &quot;[[stem group]]&quot;, which is parapyletic.) [[Total group]]s are a type of branch-based clade.
*''Apomorphy-based'': An apomorphy-based definition specifies A+B as the first ancestor of A to possess derived trait M [[Homology (biology)|homologously]] (that is, [[synapomorphy|synapomorphically]]) with that trait in A, and all descendants of that ancestor. It thus includes in the clade only that part of the line below the junction of A and B which corresponds to ancestors possessing the apomorphy. The process of identifying and naming groups based on apomorphies is the method that most resembles classical systematics, with the proviso that cladistic taxa always denote a clade.

Note that these alternative definitions do not alter the classification of the tips of the tree, and so are equivalent if only living (extant) taxa are being considered.

==Cladograms==
{{main|Cladogram|Polytomy}}
Cladists use ''cladograms'', diagrams which show ancestral relations between taxa, to represent the evolutionary [[tree of life (science)|tree of life]]. Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters, molecular [[sequencing]] data and [[computational phylogenetics]] are now very commonly used in the generation of cladograms.

The starting point of cladistic analysis is a group of species and molecular, morphological, or other data characterizing those species. The end result is a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree-like]] relationship diagram called a [[cladogram]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cracraft|Donaghue|2004|pp=45, 78, 555}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes a ''dendrogram'' (Greek for &quot;tree drawing&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weygoldt|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cladogram graphically represents a hypothetical evolutionary process. Cladograms are subject to revision as additional data become available.

The terms &quot;[[evolutionary tree]]&quot;, and sometimes &quot;[[phylogenetic tree]]&quot; are often used synonymously with cladogram&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|2004|pp=203–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others treat phylogenetic tree as a broader term that includes trees generated with a nonevolutionary emphasis. In cladograms, all species lie at the leaves. The two [[taxon|taxa]] on either side of a split, with a common ancestor and no additional descendents, are called &quot;sister taxa&quot; or &quot;sister groups&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1983|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each subtree, whether it contains only two or a hundred thousand items, is called a &quot;[[clade]]&quot;. Many cladists require that all forks in a cladogram be 2-way forks. Some cladograms include 3-way or 4-way forks when there are insufficient data to resolve the forking to a higher level of detail (see under [[phylogenetic tree]]).

For a given set of taxa, the number of distinct cladograms that can be drawn (ignoring which cladogram best matches the taxon characteristics) is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lowe|2004|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

This superexponential growth of the number of possible cladograms explains why manual creation of cladograms becomes very difficult when the number of taxa is large.
If a cladogram represents N taxa, the number of levels (the &quot;depth&quot;) in the cladogram is on the order of log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(N).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aldous|Pemantle|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if there are 32 species of [[deer]], a cladogram representing deer could be around 5 levels deep (because 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 32), although this is really just the lower limit. A cladogram representing the complete tree of life, with about 10 million species, could be about 23 levels deep. This formula gives a lower limit, with the actual depth generally a larger value, because the various branches of the cladogram will not be uniformly deep. Conversely, the depth may be shallower if forks larger than 2-way forks are permitted.

A cladogram tree has an implicit time axis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freeman|1998|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; with time running forward from the base of the tree to the leaves of the tree. If the approximate date (for example, expressed as millions of years ago) of all the evolutionary forks were known, those dates could be captured in the cladogram. Thus, the time axis of the cladogram could be assigned a time scale (e.g. 1&amp;nbsp;cm = 1 million years), and the forks of the tree could be graphically located along the time axis. Such cladograms are called ''scaled cladograms''. Many cladograms are not of this type, for a variety of reasons:
* They are built from species characteristics that cannot be readily dated (e.g. morphological data in the absence of fossils or other dating information)
* When the characteristic data are DNA/RNA sequences, it is feasible to use sequence differences to establish the relative ages of the forks, but converting those ages into actual years requires a significant approximation of the rate of change&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carroll|1997|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even when the dating information is available, positioning the cladogram's forks along the time axis in proportion to their dates may cause the cladogram to become difficult to understand or hard to fit within a human-readable format

Cladistics makes no distinction between extinct and extant species,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott-Ram|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is appropriate to include extinct species in the group of organisms being analyzed. Cladograms that are based on DNA/RNA generally do not include extinct species because DNA/RNA samples from extinct species are rare. Cladograms based on morphology, especially morphological characteristics that are preserved in fossils, are more likely to include extinct species.

==Cladistics in taxonomy==
{{main|Phylogenetic nomenclature}}

===Phylogenetic nomenclature contrasted with traditional taxonomy===
[[File:Tree of life SVG.svg|thumb|260px|A highly resolved, automatically generated [[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]] based on completely sequenced genomes&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Letunic|Bork|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Most taxonomists have used the traditional approaches of [[Linnaean taxonomy]] and later [[Evolutionary taxonomy]] to organize life forms. These approaches use several fixed levels of a hierarchy, such as [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[Class (biology)|class]], [[Order (biology)|order]], and [[Family (biology)|family]]. Phylogenetic nomenclature does not feature those terms, because the evolutionary tree is so deep and so complex that it is inadvisable to set a fixed number of levels.

Evolutionary taxonomy insists that groups reflect [[phylogenetics|phylogenies]]. In contrast, Linnaean taxonomy allows both monophyletic and paraphyletic groups as [[taxa]]. Since the early 20th century, Linnaean taxonomists have generally attempted to make at least [[family (biology)|family]]- and lower-level taxa (i.e. those regulated by the codes of nomenclature) monophyletic. [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1985 drew a distinction between the terms cladistics and phylogeny: &quot;It would seem to me to be quite evident that the two concepts of phylogeny (and their role in the construction of classifications) are sufficiently different to require terminological distinction. The term ''phylogeny'' should be retained for the broad concept of phylogeny, promoted by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and adopted by most students of phylogeny in the ensuing 90 years. The concept of phylogeny as mere [[genealogy]] should be terminologically distinguished as ''cladistics''. To lump the two concepts together terminologically could not help but produce harmful equivocation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayr|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willi Hennig]]'s pioneering work provoked a spirited debate&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wheeler|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the relative merits of phylogenetic nomenclature versus Linnaean or evolutionary taxonomy, which has continued down to the present;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Hennig did not advocate abandoning the Linnaean nomenclatural system. Some of the debates in which the cladists were engaged had been running since the 19th century, but they were renewed fervor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hull|1988|pp=232–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; as can be seen from the ''Foreword'' to Hennig (1979) by Rosen, Nelson, and Patterson:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hennig|1979|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Encumbered with vague and slippery ideas about adaptation, fitness, biological species and natural selection, neo-Darwinism (summed up in the &quot;evolutionary&quot; systematics of [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]] and Simpson) not only lacked a definable investigatory method, but came to depend, both for evolutionary interpretation and classification, on consensus or authority.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Phylogenetic nomenclature strictly and exclusively follows [[phylogeny]] and has arbitrarily deep trees with binary branching: each taxon corresponds to a clade. Linnaean taxonomy, while since the advent of evolutionary theory following phylogeny, also may subjectively consider similarity and has a fixed hierarchy of [[taxonomic rank]]s, and its taxa are not required to correspond to clades.

===Paraphyletic groups discouraged===
Many cladists discourage the use of paraphyletic groups in classification of organisms, because they detract from cladistics' emphasis on clades (monophyletic groups). In contrast, proponents of the use of paraphyletic groups argue that any dividing line in a cladogram creates both a monophyletic section above and a paraphyletic section below. They also contend that paraphyletic taxa are necessary for classifying earlier sections of the tree – for instance, the early vertebrates that would someday evolve into the family [[Hominidae]] cannot be placed in any other monophyletic family. They also argue that paraphyletic taxa provide information about significant changes in organisms' morphology, ecology, or life history – in short, that both paraphyletic groups and clades are valuable notions with separate purposes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=This section discusses an issue which is contentious among biologists and should ideally be supported by sources from each side in the debate.}}

===Complexity of the Tree of Life===
The cladistic [[tree of life]] is a [[fractal]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mishler|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The tree of life is inherently fractal-like in its complexity, .... Look closely at the 'lineage' of a phylogeny ... and it dissolves into many smaller lineages, and so on, down to a very fine scale.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The overall shape of a dichotomous (bifurcating) tree is [[Recursion|recursive]]; as a viewpoint zooms into the tree of life, the same type of tree appears no matter what the scale. When extinct species are considered (both known and unknown), the complexity and depth of the tree can be very large. Moreover the tree continues to recreate itself by bifurcation, a series of events called fractal evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every single speciation event, including all the species that are now extinct, represents an additional fork on the hypothetical, complete cladogram of the tree of life.

The tree of life is a [[Fractal#Classification|quasi-self-similar]] fractal; that is, the deep reconstruction is not as regular as the shallow reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Albert62&gt;{{harvnb|Mishler|2005|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; By shallow Mishler means the most recent branching toward and at the tips, and by deep the more ancient branches further back, which are harder to reconstruct and are missing unknown extinct lines. In the shallow part of the tree, branching events are relatively regular; it is often possible to estimate the times between them. In the deep part of the tree, &quot;homology assessments&quot; are &quot;difficult&quot; and the times vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mishler|2005|p=62}}: &quot;In deep reconstruction problems, the branch events at issue happened a relatively long time ago and the ... relative lengths of ... branches are often quite different....&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; At this level Eldredge's and Gould's [[punctuated equilibrium]] applies, which hypothesizes long periods of stability followed by punctuations of rapid speciation, based on the fossil record.

===PhyloCode approach to naming species===
A formal code of phylogenetic nomenclature, the [[PhyloCode]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pennisi|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; is currently under development. It is intended for use by both those who would like to abandon Linnaean taxonomy and those who would like to use taxa and clades side by side. In several instances (see for example [[Hesperornithes]]) it has been employed to clarify uncertainties in Linnaean systematics so that in combination they yield a taxonomy that unambiguously places problematic groups in the evolutionary tree in a way that is consistent with current knowledge.

===Example===
For example, Linnaean taxonomy contains the taxon [[Tetrapoda]], defined morphologically as [[vertebrates]] with four limbs (as well as animals with four-limbed ancestors, such as snakes), which is often given the rank of [[Superclass (biology)|superclass]], and divides into the [[class (biology)|classes]] [[Amphibia]], [[Reptilia]], [[Aves]], [[Mammalia]].

Phylogenetic nomenclature also contains the taxon [[Tetrapoda]] (see the diagram under ''Clades'' above), whose living members can be classified phylogenically as &quot;the clade defined by the common ancestor of amphibians and mammals&quot;, or more precisely the clade defined by the common ancestor of a specific amphibian and mammal (or bird or snake). This definition gives us the [[Crown group]] tetrapods (or Crown-Tetrapoda). A few primitive four legged ancestors (the [[Ichthyostegalia]]) fall outside Crown-Tetrapoda.&lt;ref name=Clack&gt;[[Jennifer A. Clack|Clarck, J.A.]] (1997): [http://tolweb.org/Ichthyostega Ichthyostega], Tree of Life website&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative is to define tetrapoda as all animals more closely related to mammals than to [[lungfish]] (our nearest living non-tetrapod relatives). In this definition, the ichthyostegalians are included, together with a host of fossil animals usually classed as [[Crossopterygii|crossopterygian fish]]. This wider definition is termed [[Crown group#Pan-group|Pan]]-Tetrapoda. A third option is to define Tetrapoda according to their [[apomorphy]] (their unique trait, i.e. having feet with toes rather than fins), a definition that yield the same group as the Linnaean taxon.

None of the phylogenetic taxa as described above have a rank, and neither do its subtaxa. All the subclades are contained within one another. The clades are not divided into several non-overlapping taxa (as in traditional taxonomy), rather the clade is split into two clades at the first branching, a process repeated throughout. With regards to the traditional classes, [[Aves]] and [[Mammalia]] are subclades, contained in the subclade [[Amniota]], while Reptilia and Amphibia are [[paraphyletic]] taxa, not clades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tudge|2002|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of classifying non-mammalian, non-avian amniotes as reptiles, Amniota is divided into the two clades [[Sauropsida]] (which contains birds and all living amniotes other than mammals, including all living traditional reptiles) and [[Theropsida]] (mammals and the extinct [[mammal-like reptiles]]). Similarly, Amphibia can be split into the [[Batrachomorpha]] (fossil amphibians more closely related to [[Lissamphibia|modern amphibians]]) and [[Reptiliomorpha]], the latter of which the amiotes is a sub-clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2004}} – see also [http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/benton/vertclass.html Taxonomic hierarchy of the vertebrates]&lt;/ref&gt; Ichthyostegalians and other Stem-tetrapods represent sister groups from splits predating the Batrachomorpha/Reptilopmorpha split.&lt;ref name=Clack/&gt;

==Application to other disciplines==
The comparisons used to acquire data on which [[cladograms]] can be based are not limited to the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Clare|Shennan|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any group of individuals or classes, hypothesized to have a common ancestor, and to which a set of common characteristics may or may not apply, can be compared pairwise. Cladograms can be used to depict the hypothetical descent relationships within groups of items in many different academic realms. The only requirement is that the items have characteristics that can be identified and measured.

Recent attempts to use cladistic methods outside of biology address the reconstruction of lineages in:
* [[Cultural anthropology|Anthropology]] and archeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipo|O'Brien|Collard|Shennan|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compares cultures or artifacts using groups of cultural traits or artifact features.
* [[historical linguistics|Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|pp=290–300, 340–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compares languages using groups of linguistic features.
* [[Textual criticism]] or [[Stemmatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|O’Hara|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compares manuscripts of the same work (original lost) using groups of distinctive copying errors.
* [[Ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jerison|2003|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compares animal species using behavioral traits presumed hereditary.
* [[Astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraix-Burnet|Choler|Douzery|Verhamme|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infers the history of relationships between galaxies to create branching diagram hypotheses of galaxy diversification.

[[Image:Hindu calendar 1871-72.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A page from the [[Hindu calendar]] 1871–1872.]]
A '''calendar''' is a system of [[organize|organizing]] days for social, religious, commercial, or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of [[time]], typically [[day]]s, [[week]]s, [[month]]s, and [[year]]s. The name given to each day is known as a [[calendar date|date]]. Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronized with the cycle of the [[sun]] or the [[moon]]. Many civilizations and societies have devised a calendar, usually derived from other calendars on which they model their systems,  suited to their particular needs.

A calendar is also a physical device (often paper). This is the most common usage of the word.  Other similar types of calendars can include computerized systems, which can be set to remind the user of upcoming events and appointments.

A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a [[court calendar]].

The English word ''calendar'' is derived from the Latin word ''kalendae'', which was the Latin name of the first day of every month.&lt;ref&gt;''New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendar systems==
A full calendar system has a different calendar date for every day. Thus the [[week]] cycle is by itself not a full calendar system; neither is a system to name the days within a [[year]] without a system for identifying the years.

The simplest calendar system just counts time periods from a reference date. This applies for the [[Julian day]]. Virtually the only possible variation is using a different reference date, in particular one less distant in the past to make the numbers smaller. Computations in these systems are just a matter of addition and subtraction.

Other calendars have one (or multiple) larger units of time.

Calendars that contain one level of cycles:
*week and weekday&amp;nbsp;– this system (without year, the week number keeps on increasing) is not very common
*year and ordinal date within the year, e.g. the [[ISO 8601#Ordinal dates|ISO 8601 ordinal date system]]

Calendars with two levels of cycles:
*year, [[month]], and day&amp;nbsp;– most systems, including the [[Gregorian calendar]] (and its very similar predecessor, the [[Julian calendar]]), the [[Islamic calendar]], and the [[Hebrew calendar]]
*year, week, and weekday&amp;nbsp;– e.g. the [[ISO week date]]

Cycles can be synchronized with periodic phenomena:
*A ''lunar calendar'' is synchronized to the motion of the [[Moon]] ([[lunar phase]]s); an example is the [[Islamic calendar]].
*A ''solar calendar'' is based on perceived [[seasonal year|seasonal]] changes synchronized to the apparent motion of the Sun; an example is the [[Persian calendar]].
*A &quot;[[Lunisolar calendar|luni-solar calendar]]&quot; is based on a combination of both solar and lunar reckonings; examples are the [[Chinese calendar|traditional calendar of China]], the [[Hindu Calendar]] in India or the [[Hebrew calendar]].
*There are some calendars that appear to be synchronized to the motion of [[Venus]], such as some of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian calendars; synchronization to Venus appears to occur primarily in civilizations near the [[Equator]].
*The [[week]] cycle is an example of one that is not synchronized to any external phenomenon (although it may have been derived from lunar phases, beginning anew every month).

Very commonly a calendar includes more than one type of cycle, or has both cyclic and acyclic elements.

Many calendars incorporate simpler calendars as elements.  For example, the rules of the Hebrew calendar depend on the seven-day week cycle (a very simple calendar), so the week is one of the cycles of the Hebrew calendar.  It is also common to operate two calendars simultaneously, usually providing unrelated cycles, and the result may also be considered a more complex calendar.  For example, the [[Gregorian calendar]] has no inherent dependence on the seven-day week, but in [[Western world|Western society]] the two are used together, and calendar tools indicate both the Gregorian date and the day of week.&lt;ref&gt;Zerubavel, ''The Seven Day Circle'' (University of Chicago Press, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The week cycle is shared by various calendar systems (although the significance of special days such as Friday, Saturday, and Sunday varies). Systems of leap days usually do not affect the week cycle. The week cycle was not even interrupted when 10, 11, 12, or 13 dates were skipped when the Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar by various countries.

===Solar calendars===
{{Main|Solar calendar}}

====Days used by solar calendars====
Solar calendars assign a ''date'' to each [[solar time|solar day]]. A day may consist of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], with a following period of [[night]], or it may be a period between successive events such as two sunsets. The length of the interval between two such successive events may be allowed to vary slightly during the year, or it may be averaged into a [[solar time|mean solar day]]. Other types of calendar may also use a solar day.

====Calendar reform====
{{Main|Calendar reform}}
There have been a number of proposals for reform of the calendar, such as the [[World Calendar]], [[International Fixed Calendar]] and [[Holocene calendar]].  The [[United Nations]] considered adopting such a reformed calendar for a while in the 1950s, but these proposals have lost most of their popularity.

===Lunar calendars===
{{Main|Lunar calendar}}
Not all calendars use the solar year as a unit. A [[lunar calendar]] is one in which days are numbered within each [[lunar phase]] cycle.  Because the length of the lunar month is not an even fraction of the length of the [[tropical year]], a purely lunar calendar quickly drifts against the seasons, which don't vary much near the [[equator]].  It does, however, stay constant with respect to other phenomena, notably [[tide]]s. An example is the [[Islamic calendar]].
Alexander Marshack, in a controversial reading,&lt;ref&gt;James Elkins, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=5Ku6YdWurMgC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63 Our beautiful, dry, and distant texts]'' (1998) 63ff.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that marks on a bone baton (c. 25,000 BC) represented a lunar calendar. Other marked bones may also represent lunar calendars. Similarly, Michael Rappenglueck believes that marks on a 15,000-year old cave painting represent a lunar calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/975360.stm Oldest lunar calendar identified]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lunisolar calendars===
A '''[[lunisolar calendar]]''' is a lunar calendar that compensates by adding an extra month as needed to realign the months with the seasons. An example is the [[Hebrew calendar]] which uses a [[metonic cycle|19-year cycle]].

==Calendar subdivisions==
Nearly all calendar systems group consecutive days into &quot;[[month]]s&quot; and also into &quot;[[year]]s&quot;. In a ''[[solar calendar]]'' a ''year'' approximates Earth's [[tropical year]] (that is, the time it takes for a complete cycle of [[season]]s), traditionally used to facilitate the planning of [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities. In a ''lunar calendar'', the ''month'' approximates the cycle of the moon phase. Consecutive days may be grouped into other periods such as the [[week]].

Because the number of days in the ''tropical year'' is not a whole number, a solar calendar must have a different number of days in different years. This may be handled, for example, by adding an extra day in [[leap year]]s. The same applies to months in a lunar calendar and also the number of months in a year in a lunisolar calendar. This is generally known as [[intercalation]]. Even if a calendar is solar, but not lunar, the year cannot be divided entirely into months that never vary in length.

Cultures may define other units of time, such as the [[week]], for the purpose of scheduling regular activities that do not easily coincide with months or years.  Many cultures use different baselines for their calendars' starting years.  For example, the year in [[Japan]] is based on the reign of the current emperor: 2006 was Year 18 of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Akihito]].

==Other calendar types==
===Arithmetic and astronomical calendars===
An ''astronomical calendar'' is based on ongoing observation; examples are the religious Islamic calendar and the old religious Jewish calendar in the time of the [[Second Temple]]. Such a calendar is also referred to as an ''observation-based'' calendar. The advantage of such a calendar is that it is perfectly and perpetually accurate. The disadvantage is that working out when a particular date would occur is difficult.

An ''arithmetic calendar'' is one that is based on a strict set of rules; an example is the current Jewish calendar. Such a calendar is also referred to as a ''rule-based'' calendar. The advantage of such a calendar is the ease of calculating when a particular date occurs. The disadvantage is imperfect accuracy. Furthermore, even if the calendar is very accurate, its accuracy diminishes slowly over time, owing to changes in Earth's rotation. This limits the lifetime of an accurate arithmetic calendar to a few thousand years. After then, the rules would need to be modified from observations made since the invention of the calendar.

===Complete and incomplete calendars===
Calendars may be either complete or incomplete. Complete calendars provide a way of naming each consecutive day, while incomplete calendars do not. The early [[Roman calendar]], which had no way of designating the days of the winter months other than to lump them together as &quot;winter&quot;, is an example of an incomplete calendar, while the Gregorian calendar is an example of a complete calendar.

==Uses==
The primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days: to be informed about and/or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has happened. Days may be significant for civil, religious or social reasons. For example, a calendar provides a way to determine which days are [[religious holiday|religious]] or [[civil holiday]]s, which days mark the beginning and end of business accounting periods, and which days have legal significance, such as the day taxes are due or a contract expires. Also a calendar may, by identifying a day, provide other useful information about the day such as its season.

Calendars are also used to help people manage their personal schedules, time and activities, particularly when individuals have numerous work, school, and family commitments. People frequently use multiple systems, and may keep both a [[business]] and [[family]] calendar to help prevent them from overcommitting their time.

Calendars are also used as part of a complete [[timekeeping]] system: date and time of day together specify a moment in [[time]].  In the modern world, written calendars are no longer an essential part of such systems, as the advent of accurate [[clock]]s has made it possible to record time independently of astronomical events.

==Currently used calendars==
Calendars in widespread use today include the [[Gregorian calendar]], which is the ''[[de facto]]'' international standard, and is used almost everywhere in the world for civil purposes, including in the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[India]] (along with the [[Indian national calendar]]). Due to the Gregorian calendar's obvious connotations of [[Western Christianity]], non-Christians and even some Christians sometimes justify its use by replacing the traditional era notations &quot;''[[AD]]''&quot; and &quot;''[[Before Christ|BC]]''&quot; (&quot;Anno Domini&quot; and &quot;Before Christ&quot;) with &quot;''CE''&quot; and &quot;''BCE''&quot; (&quot;[[Common Era]]&quot; and &quot;Before Common Era&quot;). 

The [[Islamic calendar]]  or [[Muslim calendar]] or [[Hijri calendar]] is a lunar calendar consisting of 12 lunar months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used to date events in most of the Muslim countries (concurrently with the Gregorian calendar), and used by Muslims everywhere to determine the proper day on which to celebrate Islamic holy days and festivals. The first year was the year during which the emigration of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijra, occurred. Each numbered year is designated either H for Hijra or AH for the Latin anno Hegirae (in the year of the Hijra). Being a purely lunar calendar, it is not synchronized with the seasons. With an annual drift of 11 or 12 days, the seasonal relation is repeated approximately each 33 Islamic years. 

The [[Hindu calendar]]s are some of the most ancient calendars of the world. [[Eastern Christians]] of eastern Europe and western Asia used for a long time the [[Julian Calendar]], that of the old Orthodox church, in countries like Russia. For over 1500 years, Westerners used the Julian Calendar as well.

While the Gregorian calendar is widely used in [[Israel|Israel's]] business and day-to-day affairs, the [[Hebrew calendar]], used by [[Jews]] worldwide for religious and cultural affairs, also influences civil matters in Israel (such as [[national holiday]]s) and can be used there for business dealings (such as for the dating of [[Cheque|checks]]). The [[Chinese calendar|Chinese]], [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]], and [[Julian calendar|Julian]] calendars are widely used for religious and/or social purposes. The [[Iranian calendar|Iranian (Persian) calendar]] is used in [[Iran]] and some parts of [[Afghanistan]]. The [[Ethiopian calendar]] or Ethiopic calendar is the principal calendar used in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. In [[Thailand]], where the [[Thai solar calendar]] is used, the months and days have adopted the western standard, although the years are still based on the traditional [[Buddhist calendar]]. [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] worldwide use the [[Baha'i calendar|Bahá'í calendar]].

Even where there is a commonly used calendar such as the Gregorian calendar, alternate calendars may also be used, such as a [[fiscal year|fiscal calendar]] or the astronomical year numbering system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/dates.html NASA&amp;nbsp;– Year Dating Conventions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiscal calendars===
{{Main|Fiscal calendar}}
A fiscal calendar (such as a [[4-4-5 Calendar|4/4/5 calendar]]) fixes each month at a specific number of weeks to facilitate comparisons from month to month and year to year.  January always has exactly 4 weeks (Sunday through Saturday), February has 4 weeks, March has 5 weeks, etc.  Note that this calendar will normally need to add a 53rd week to every 5th or 6th year, which might be added to December or might not be, depending on how the organization uses those dates. There exists an international standard way to do this (the [[ISO 8601|ISO week]]). The ISO week starts on a Monday, and ends on a Sunday. Week 1 is always the week that contains 4 January in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

Fiscal calendars are also used by businesses. This is where the fiscal year is just any set of 12 months. This set of 12 months can start and end at any point on the Gregorian calendar. This is the most common usage of fiscal calendars.

==Gregorian calendar with Easter Sunday==
{{Main|Gregorian calendar}}

Calculating the calendar of a previous year (for the Gregorian calendar taking account of the [[week]]) is a relatively easy matter when [[Easter Sunday]] is not included on the calendar.  However, calculating for Easter Sunday is difficult because the calculation depends on the full [[moon cycle]]. Easter Sunday represents the first Sunday after the first full moon after the [[Vernal Equinox]] according to the [[computus]]. But it is defined as the Sunday following a theoretical Full Moon date falling on or after March 21st, and different (though equivalent) calculations are specified by the Papal Bull of 1582 and the British Calendar Act of 1751. So, this makes an additional calculation necessary on top of the normal calculation for January 1 and the calculation of whether or not the year is a leap year.

There are only 14 different calendars when Easter Sunday is not involved. Each calendar is determined by the day of the week January 1 falls on and whether or not the year is a leap year.  However, when Easter Sunday is included, there are 70 different calendars (two for each date of Easter).

==Physical calendars==

A calendar is also a physical device (often paper) (for example, a desktop calendar or a [[wall calendar]]). In a paper calendar one or two sheets can show a single day, a week, a month, or a year. If a sheet is for a single day, it easily shows the date and the weekday. If a sheet is for multiple days it shows a conversion table to convert from weekday to date and back. With a special pointing device, or by crossing out past days, it may indicate the current date and weekday. This is the most common usage of the word.

The sale of physical calendars has been restricted in some countries, and given as a [[monopoly]] to [[University|universities]] and [[National academy|national academies]]. Examples include the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[University of Helsinki]], which had a monopoly on the sale of calendars in [[Finland]] until the 1990s.

==Legal==
{{Main|Docket (court)}}
For [[lawyer]]s and [[judge]]s, the calendar is the [[Docket (court)|docket]] used by the court to schedule the order of [[Hearing (law)|hearings]] or [[Trial (law)|trials]]. A [[paralegal]] or [[Bailiff|court officer]] may keep track of the cases by using [[docketing software]].

{{Cosmology}}

'''Physical cosmology''', as a branch of [[astronomy]], is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the [[universe]] and is concerned with fundamental questions about its formation and evolution.&lt;ref name=GFR_Ellis&gt;For an overview, see {{cite book |chapter=Issues in the Philosophy of Cosmology |pages=1183''ff''|year=2006 |author=George FR Ellis |arxiv=astro-ph/0602280 |isbn=0444515607 |publisher=North Holland |title=Philosophy of Physics (Handbook of the Philosophy of Science) 3 volume set |editor=Jeremy Butterfield &amp; John Earman}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of human history, it was a branch of [[metaphysics]] and [[religion]]. Cosmology as a [[science]] originated with the [[Copernican principle]], which implies that celestial bodies obey identical [[physical law]]s to those on Earth, and [[Newtonian mechanics]], which first allowed us to understand those laws. 

Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the twentieth century development of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] and better [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations of extremely distant objects. These advances made it possible to speculate about the [[origin of the universe]], and allowed scientists to establish the [[Big Bang Theory]] as the leading cosmological model. Some researchers still advocate a handful of [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]]; however, cosmologists generally agree that the Big Bang theory best explains observations.

Cosmology draws heavily on the work of many disparate areas of research in [[physics]]. Areas relevant to cosmology include [[particle physics]] experiments and [[particle physics phenomenology|theory]], including [[string theory]], [[astrophysics]], [[general relativity]], and [[plasma physics]]. Thus, cosmology unites the physics of the largest structures in the universe with the physics of the smallest structures in the universe.

==History of physical cosmology==
{{see also|Timeline of cosmology|List of cosmologists}}

Modern cosmology developed along tandem tracks of theory and observation. In 1915, Albert Einstein formulated his theory of [[general relativity]], which provided a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time. At the time, physicists believed in a perfectly [[static universe]] that had no beginning or end. Einstein added a [[cosmological constant]] to his theory in order to force it to model a static universe containing matter. This so-called ''Einstein universe'' is, however, unstable; it will eventually start [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] or contracting. The cosmological solutions of general relativity were found by [[Alexander Friedmann]], whose equations describe the [[Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker]] universe, which may expand or contract.

In the 1910s, [[Vesto Melvin Slipher|Vesto Slipher]] (and later [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]]) interpreted the [[red shift]] of [[nebula|spiral nebulae]] as a [[Doppler shift]] that indicated they were receding from [[Earth]]. However, it is difficult to determine the distance to astronomical objects. One way is to compare the physical size of an object to its [[angular size]], but a physical size must be assumed to do this. Another method is to measure the [[brightness]] of an object and assume an intrinsic [[luminosity]], from which the distance may be determined using the [[inverse square law]]. Due to the difficulty of using these methods, they did not realize that the nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own [[Milky Way]], nor did they speculate about the cosmological implications. In 1927, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] [[Georges Lemaître]] independently derived the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker equations and proposed, on the basis of the recession of spiral nebulae, that the universe began with the &quot;explosion&quot; of a &quot;primeval [[atom]]&quot;—which was later called the Big Bang. In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] provided an observational basis for Lemaître's theory. Hubble showed that the spiral nebulae were galaxies by determining their distances using measurements of the brightness of [[Cepheid variable]] stars. He discovered a relationship between the [[redshift]] of a galaxy and its distance. He interpreted this as evidence that the galaxies are receding from [[Earth]] in every direction at speeds  directly proportional to their distance. This fact is now known as [[Hubble's law]], though the numerical factor Hubble found relating recessional velocity and distance was off by a factor of ten, due to not knowing at the time about different types of Cepheid variables.

Given the [[cosmological principle]], Hubble's law suggested that the universe was expanding. There were two primary explanations put forth for the expansion of the universe. One was Lemaître's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow. The other possibility was [[Fred Hoyle|Fred Hoyle's]] [[steady state model]] in which new matter would be created as the galaxies moved away from each other. In this model, the universe is roughly the same at any point in time.

For a number of years the support for these theories was evenly divided. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 lent strong support to the Big Bang model, and since the precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] in the early 1990s, few cosmologists have seriously proposed other theories of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. One consequence of this is that in standard general relativity, the universe began with a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]], as demonstrated by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Roger Penrose]] in the 1960s. 

==Energy of the cosmos==
{{Confusing|section|date=May 2011}}
{{Repetition|section|date=May 2011}}
Light elements, primarily hydrogen and helium, were created in the [[Big Bang]]. These light elements were spread too fast and too thinly in the Big Bang process (see [[nucleosynthesis]]) to form the most stable medium-sized atomic nuclei, like iron and nickel. This fact allows for later energy release, as such intermediate-sized elements are formed in our era. The formation of such atoms powers the steady energy-releasing reactions in [[star]]s, and also contributes to sudden energy releases, such as in [[nova]]e. Gravitational collapse of matter into black holes is also thought to power the most energetic processes, generally seen at the centers of galaxies (see [[quasar]]s and in general [[active galaxies]]).

Cosmologists are still unable to explain all cosmological phenomena purely on the basis of known conventional [[Energy forms|forms of energy]], for example those related to the [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion of the universe]], and therefore invoke a yet unexplored form of energy called [[dark energy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/300/5627/1914?siteid=sci&amp;ijkey=eJV6VmToFgZIE&amp;keytype=ref Science 20 June 2003:Vol. 300. no. 5627, pp. 1914 - 1918] Throwing Light on Dark Energy, Robert P. Kirshner. Accessed December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to account for certain cosmological observations. One hypothesis is that dark energy is the energy of [[virtual particle]]s (which mathematically must exist in vacuum due to the [[uncertainty principle]]).

There is no unambiguous way to define the total energy of the universe in the current best theory of gravity, [[general relativity]]. As a result it remains controversial whether one can meaningfully say that total energy is conserved in an expanding universe. For instance, each [[photon]] that travels through intergalactic space loses energy due to the [[redshift]] effect. This energy is not obviously transferred to any other system, so seems to be permanently lost. Nevertheless some cosmologists insist that energy is conserved in some sense.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book | author = Liddle, A. | title = An Introduction to Modern Cosmology | publisher = Wiley | isbn =0-470-84835-9 }} This argues cogently &quot;Energy is always, always, always conserved.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermodynamics of the universe]] is a field of study to explore which form of energy dominates the cosmos - [[relativistic particle]]s which are referred to as [[radiation]], or non-relativistic particles which are referred to as matter. The former are particles whose [[rest mass]] is zero or negligible compared to their energy, and therefore move at the speed of light or very close to it; the latter are particles whose [[kinetic energy]] is much lower than their [[rest mass]] and therefore move much slower than the speed of light.

As the universe expands, both matter and radiation in it become diluted. However, the universe also cools down, meaning that the average energy per particle is getting smaller with time. Therefore the radiation becomes weaker, and dilutes faster than matter. Thus with the expansion of the universe radiation becomes less dominant than matter. In the very early universe radiation dictates the rate of deceleration of the universe's expansion, and the universe is said to be 'radiation dominated'. At later times, when the average energy per [[photon]] is roughly 10 [[electronvolt|eV]] and lower, matter dictates the rate of deceleration and the universe is said to be 'matter dominated'. The intermediate case is not treated well [[analytic solution|analytically]]. As the expansion of the universe continues, matter dilutes even further and the [[cosmological constant]] becomes dominant, leading to an acceleration in the universe's expansion.

==History of the Universe==

{{see also|Timeline of the Big Bang}}
The history of the universe is a central issue in cosmology. The history of the universe is divided into different periods called epochs, according to the dominant forces and processes in each period. The standard cosmological model is known as the [[&amp;Lambda;CDM]] model.

===Equations of motion===
{{main|Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric}}
The [[equations of motion]] governing the universe as a whole are derived from [[general relativity]] with a small, positive [[cosmological constant]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The solution is an expanding universe; due to this expansion the radiation and matter in the universe are cooled down and become diluted. At first, the expansion is slowed down by [[gravitation]] due to the [[radiation]] and matter content of the universe. However, as these become diluted, the [[cosmological constant]] becomes more dominant and the expansion of the universe starts to accelerate rather than decelerate. In our universe this has already happened, billions of years ago.

===Particle physics in cosmology===
{{main|Particle physics in cosmology}}
[[Particle physics]] is important to the behavior of the early universe, since the early universe was so hot that the average energy density was very high. Because of this, [[scattering]] processes and [[particle decay|decay]] of unstable particles are important in cosmology.

As a rule of thumb, a scattering or a decay process is cosmologically important in a certain cosmological epoch if the time scale describing that process is smaller or comparable to the time scale of the expansion of the universe, which is &lt;math&gt;1/H&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Hubble constant]] at that time. This is roughly equal to the age of the universe at that time.

===Timeline of the Big Bang===
{{main|Timeline of the Big Bang}}
Observations suggest that the universe began around 13.7 billion years ago. Since then, the evolution of the universe has passed through three phases. The very early universe, which is still poorly understood, was the split second in which the universe was so hot that [[subatomic particle|particles]] had energies higher than those currently accessible in [[particle accelerator]]s on Earth. Therefore, while the basic features of this epoch have been worked out in the Big Bang theory, the details are largely based on educated guesses. 
Following this, in the early universe, the evolution of the universe proceeded according to known [[high energy physics]]. This is when the first protons, electrons and neutrons formed, then nuclei and finally atoms. With the formation of neutral hydrogen, the [[cosmic microwave background]] was emitted. Finally, the epoch of structure formation began, when matter started to aggregate into the first [[star]]s and [[quasar]]s, and ultimately galaxies, [[clusters of galaxies]] and [[supercluster]]s formed. The future of the universe is not yet firmly known, but according to the [[&amp;Lambda;CDM]] model it will continue expanding forever.

==Areas of study==
Below, some of the most active areas of inquiry in cosmology are described, in roughly chronological order. This does not include all of the Big Bang cosmology, which is presented in [[Timeline of the Big Bang]].

===The very early universe===
While the early, hot universe appears to be well explained by the Big Bang from roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; seconds onwards, there are several [[Big Bang#Standard Problems|problems]]. One is that there is no compelling reason, using current particle physics, to expect the universe to be [[shape of the universe|flat]], homogeneous and [[isotropic]] (see the [[cosmological principle]]). Moreover, [[grand unified theory|grand unified theories]] of particle physics suggest that there should be [[magnetic monopole]]s in the universe, which have not been found. These problems are resolved by a brief period of [[cosmic inflation]], which drives the universe to [[Flatness (cosmology)|flatness]], smooths out anisotropies and inhomogeneities to the observed level, and exponentially dilutes the monopoles. The physical model behind cosmic inflation is extremely simple, however it has not yet been confirmed by particle physics, and there are difficult problems reconciling inflation and [[quantum field theory]]. Some cosmologists think that [[string theory]] and [[brane cosmology]] will provide an alternative to inflation.

Another major problem in cosmology is what caused the universe to contain more particles than [[antimatter|antiparticles]]. Cosmologists can observationally deduce that the universe is not split into regions of matter and antimatter. If it were, there would be [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s produced as a result of [[annihilation]], but this is not observed. This problem is called the baryon asymmetry, and the theory to describe the resolution is called [[baryogenesis]]. The theory of baryogenesis was worked out by [[Andrei Sakharov]] in 1967, and requires a violation of the particle physics [[Symmetry#Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], called [[CP-symmetry]], between matter and antimatter. Particle accelerators, however, measure too small a violation of CP-symmetry to account for the baryon asymmetry. Cosmologists and particle physicists are trying to find additional violations of the CP-symmetry in the early universe that might account for the baryon asymmetry.

Both the problems of baryogenesis and cosmic inflation are very closely related to particle physics, and their resolution might come from high energy theory and [[particle accelerator|experiment]], rather than through observations of the universe.

===Big bang nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Big bang nucleosynthesis}}

'''Big Bang Nucleosynthesis''' is the theory of the formation of the elements in the early universe. It finished when the universe was about three minutes old and its [[temperature]] dropped below that at which [[nuclear fusion]] could occur. Big Bang nucleosynthesis had a brief period during which it could operate, so only the very lightest elements were produced. Starting from [[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s ([[proton]]s), it principally produced [[deuterium]], [[helium|helium-4]] and [[lithium]]. Other elements were produced in only trace abundances. The basic theory of nucleosynthesis was developed in 1948 by [[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Asher Alpher]] and [[Robert Herman]]. It was used for many years as a probe of physics at the time of the Big Bang, as the theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis connects the abundances of primordial light elements with the features of the early universe. Specifically, it can be used to test the [[equivalence principle]], to probe [[dark matter]], and test [[neutrino]] physics. Some cosmologists have proposed that Big Bang nucleosynthesis suggests there is a fourth &quot;sterile&quot; species of neutrino.

===Cosmic microwave background===
{{Main|Cosmic microwave background}}

The cosmic microwave background is radiation left over from [[decoupling]] after the epoch of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] when neutral [[atoms]] first formed. At this point, radiation produced in the Big Bang stopped [[Thomson scattering]] from charged ions. The radiation, first observed in 1965 by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]], has a perfect thermal [[black body|black-body]] spectrum. It has a temperature of 2.7 [[kelvin]]s today and is isotropic to one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Cosmological perturbation theory]], which describes the evolution of slight inhomogeneities in the early universe, has allowed cosmologists to precisely calculate the angular [[power spectrum]] of the radiation, and it has been measured by the recent satellite experiments ([[COBE]] and [[WMAP]]) and many ground and balloon-based experiments (such as [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]], [[Cosmic Background Imager]], and [[BOOMERanG experiment|Boomerang]]). One of the goals of these efforts is to measure the basic parameters of the [[Lambda-CDM model]] with increasing accuracy, as well as to test the predictions of the Big Bang model and look for new physics. The recent measurements made by WMAP, for example, have placed limits on the neutrino masses.

Newer experiments, such as [[QUIET]] and the [[Atacama Cosmology Telescope]], are trying to measure the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the cosmic microwave background. These measurements are expected to provide further confirmation of the theory as well as information about cosmic inflation, and the so-called secondary anisotropies, such as the [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]] and [[Sachs-Wolfe effect]], which are caused by interaction between [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[galaxy groups and clusters|clusters]] with the cosmic microwave background.

===Formation and evolution of large-scale structure===
{{Main|Large-scale structure of the cosmos|Structure formation|Galaxy formation and evolution}}

Understanding the formation and evolution of the largest and earliest structures (i.e., [[quasar]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[galaxy groups and clusters|clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s) is one of the largest efforts in cosmology. Cosmologists study a model of '''hierarchical structure formation''' in which structures form from the bottom up, with smaller objects forming first, while the largest objects, such as superclusters, are still assembling. One way to study structure in the universe is to survey the visible galaxies, in order to construct a three-dimensional picture of the galaxies in the universe and measure the matter [[power spectrum]]. This is the approach of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].

Another tool for understanding structure formation is simulations, which cosmologists use to study the gravitational aggregation of matter in the universe, as it clusters into [[Galaxy filament|filaments]], superclusters and [[void (astronomy)|voids]]. Most simulations contain only non-baryonic [[cold dark matter]], which should suffice to understand the universe on the largest scales, as there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible, baryonic matter. More advanced simulations are starting to include baryons and study the formation of individual galaxies. Cosmologists study these simulations to see if they agree with the galaxy surveys, and to understand any discrepancy.

Other, complementary observations to measure the distribution of matter in the distant universe and to probe [[reionization]] include:
*The [[Lyman alpha forest]], which allows cosmologists to measure the distribution of neutral atomic hydrogen gas in the early universe, by measuring the absorption of light from distant quasars by the gas.
*The 21 centimeter [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] line of neutral atomic hydrogen also provides a sensitive test of cosmology
*[[Weak lensing]], the distortion of a distant image by [[gravitational lensing]] due to dark matter.
These will help cosmologists settle the question of when and how structure formed in the universe.

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}

Evidence from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], the [[cosmic microwave background]] and structure formation suggests that about 23% of the mass of the universe consists of non-baryonic dark matter, whereas only 4% consists of visible, [[baryonic matter]]. The gravitational effects of dark matter are well understood, as it behaves like a cold, [[Radioactive decay|non-radiative]] fluid that forms [[galactic halo|haloes]] around galaxies. Dark matter has never been detected in the laboratory, and the particle physics nature of dark matter remains completely unknown. Without observational constraints, there are a number of candidates, such as a stable [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] particle, a [[weakly interacting massive particle]], an [[axion]], and a [[massive compact halo object]].  Alternatives to the dark matter hypothesis include a modification of gravity at small accelerations ([[MOND]]) or an effect from [[brane cosmology]].

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}

If the universe is [[Flatness (cosmology)|flat]], there must be an additional component making up 73% (in addition to the 23% dark matter and 4% baryons) of the energy density of the universe. This is called dark energy. In order not to interfere with Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background, it must not cluster in haloes like baryons and dark matter. There is strong observational evidence for dark energy, as the total energy density of the universe is known through constraints on the flatness of the universe, but the amount of clustering matter is tightly measured, and is much less than this. The case for dark energy was strengthened in 1999, when measurements demonstrated that the expansion of the universe has begun to gradually accelerate.

Apart from its density and its clustering properties, nothing is known about dark energy.  [[Quantum field theory]] predicts a [[cosmological constant]] much like dark energy, but 120 [[orders of magnitude]] larger than that observed. [[Steven Weinberg]] and a number of string theorists (see [[string landscape]]) have used this as evidence for the [[anthropic principle]], which suggests that the cosmological constant is so small because life (and thus physicists, to make observations) cannot exist in a universe with a large cosmological constant, but many people find this an unsatisfying explanation. Other possible explanations for dark energy include [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or a modification of gravity on the largest scales. The effect on cosmology of the dark energy that these models describe is given by the dark energy's [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]], which varies depending upon the theory. The nature of dark energy is one of the most challenging problems in cosmology.

A better understanding of dark energy is likely to solve the problem of the [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. In the current cosmological epoch, the accelerated expansion due to dark energy is preventing structures larger than superclusters from forming. It is not known whether the acceleration will continue indefinitely, perhaps even increasing until a [[big rip]], or whether it will eventually reverse.

===Other areas of inquiry===
Cosmologists also study:
*whether [[primordial black hole]]s were formed in our universe, and what happened to them.
*the [[GZK cutoff]] for high-energy cosmic rays, and whether it signals a failure of [[special relativity]] at high energies
*the [[equivalence principle]], whether or not Einstein's [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] is the correct theory of [[gravitation]], and if the fundamental [[laws of physics]] are the same everywhere in the universe.

{{Cosmology|cTopic=Early universe}}

In [[physical cosmology]], '''cosmic inflation''', '''cosmological inflation''' or just '''inflation''' is the theorized extremely rapid [[exponential growth|exponential]] [[metric expansion of space|expansion]] of the early [[universe]] by a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; in volume, driven by a negative-pressure [[vacuum energy]] density.&lt;ref&gt;Liddle and Lyth (2000) and Mukhanov (2005) are recent cosmology text books with extensive discussions of inflation. Kolb and Turner (1988) and Linde (1990) miss some recent developments, but are still widely used. Peebles (1993) provides a technical discussion with historical context. Recent review articles are Lyth and Riotto (1999) and Linde (2005). Guth (1997) and Hawking (1998) give popular introductions to inflation with historical remarks.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[inflationary epoch]] comprises the first part of the [[electroweak epoch]] following the [[grand unification epoch]]. It lasted from 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]] to sometime between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. Following the inflationary period, the universe continues to expand.

The term &quot;inflation&quot; is also used to refer to the hypothesis that inflation occurred, to the theory of inflation, or to the [[inflationary epoch]]. The inflationary hypothesis was originally proposed in 1980 by American physicist [[Alan Guth]], who named it &quot;inflation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 17 of Peebles (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also proposed by [[Katsuhiko Sato]] around the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sato | first1 = K. | year = 1981| title = First-order phase transition of a vacuum and the expansion of the Universe | bibcode=1981MNRAS.195..467S | journal = Monthly Notices of Royal Astronomical Society|volume=195| page = 467 | issue = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a direct consequence of this expansion, all of the observable universe originated in a small [[Causality (physics)|causally connected]] region. Inflation answers the classic conundrum of the Big Bang cosmology: why does the universe appear [[Shape of the Universe#Flat universe|flat]], [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] in accordance with the [[cosmological principle]] when one would expect, on the basis of the physics of the Big Bang, a highly curved, heterogeneous universe? Inflation also explains the origin of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]]. [[Quantum fluctuation]]s in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the universe (see [[galaxy formation and evolution]] and [[structure formation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Neil deGrasse and Donald Goldsmith (2004), ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution'', W. W. Norton &amp; Co., pp. 84-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the detailed [[particle physics]] mechanism responsible for inflation is not known, the basic picture makes a number of predictions that have been confirmed by observation. Inflation is thus now considered part of the standard hot [[Big Bang]] cosmology. The hypothetical [[elementary particle|particle]] or [[field (physics)|field]] thought to be responsible for inflation is called the [[inflaton]].

==Overview==
{{Main|Metric expansion of space}}
{{Technical|date=November 2010|section}}

While [[special relativity]] constrains objects in the universe from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, there is no such constraint in [[general relativity]]. An expanding universe generally has a [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|cosmological horizon]], and like a black hole event horizon, this marks the boundary to the part of the universe that an observer can see. The horizon is the boundary beyond which objects are moving away too fast to be visible from Earth.

There are two ways to describe a spacetime with a horizon: global and local. The global picture includes regions beyond the horizon, which  are invisible to us, while the local picture is the picture from one point of view only. These two perspectives are related by a process of extension, wherever there is a horizon, a solution of General Relativity can go on by assuming that nothing special happens there. The local and global points of view have a different notion of time. From the local point of view, time stops at the horizon. From the global point of view, time marches on, and surfaces of constant time cross the horizon. Ignoring quantum mechanics, the two pictures are equivalent: any statement can be translated freely back and forth.

For cosmology in the global point of view, the [[observable universe]] is one ''causal patch'' of a much larger unobservable universe; there are parts of the universe which cannot communicate with us yet. These parts of the universe are outside our current cosmological horizon. In the standard hot big bang model, without inflation, the cosmological horizon moves out, bringing new regions into view. As we see these regions for the first time, they look no different from any other region of space we have already seen: they have a background radiation which is at nearly exactly the same temperature as the background radiation of other regions, and their space-time curvature is evolving lock-step with ours. This presents a mystery: how did these new regions know what temperature and curvature they were supposed to have? They couldn't have learned it by getting signals, because they were not in communication with our past light cone before.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiny&quot;&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102715275 Using Tiny Particles To Answer Giant Questions].  Science Friday, 3 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Faster than light#Universal_expansion]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Inflation answers this question by postulating that all the regions come from an earlier era with a big vacuum energy, or cosmological constant. A space with a cosmological constant is qualitatively different: instead of moving outward, the cosmological horizon stays put. For any one observer, the distance to the [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|cosmological horizon]] is constant. With exponentially expanding space, two nearby observers are separated very quickly; so much so, that the distance between them quickly exceeds the limits of communications. In the global point of view, the spatial slices are expanding very fast to cover huge volumes. In the local point of view, things are constantly moving beyond the cosmological horizon, which is a fixed distance away, and everything becomes homogeneous very quickly.

In either view, as the scalar field slowly relaxes to the vacuum, the cosmological constant goes to zero, and space begins to expand normally. The new regions which come into view during the normal expansion phase, in the global point of view, are exactly the same regions which were pushed out of the horizon during inflation, and so they are necessarily at nearly the same temperature and curvature, because they come from the same little patch of space. In the local point of view, the cosmological horizon still is at the big bang, and inflation is always going on in a thin skin where time is nearly stopped, and the same process produces new regions as it always did, up to small fluctuations.

Inflation from the global point of view is often called [[eternal inflation]]. On a global constant-time slice, regions with inflation have an exponentially growing volume, while regions which are not inflating don't. This means that the volume of the inflating part of the universe in the global picture is always unimaginably larger than the part that has stopped inflating. If the probability of different regions is counted by volume, one should expect that inflation will never end, or applying boundary conditions that we exist to observe it, that inflation will end as late as possible. Weighting by volume is unnatural in the local point of view where inflation is not eternal—it eventually ends as seen by any single observer. This picture gives a meaning to the probability distribution on the [[anthropic landscape]], and naively seems more compatible with the [[holographic principle]]{{Why?|date=August 2010}}.

The theory of inflation in any picture explains why the temperatures and curvatures of different regions are so nearly equal, and it predicts that the total curvature of a space-slice at constant global time is zero. This prediction means that the total ordinary matter, [[dark matter]], and residual [[vacuum energy]] in the universe have to add up to the critical density, a prediction which is very accurately confirmed. More strikingly, inflation allows physicists to calculate the minute differences in temperature of different regions from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary era, and these quantitative predictions have also been confirmed.

===Space expands===
To say that space expands exponentially means that two [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial observer]]s are moving farther apart with accelerating velocity. In stationary coordinates for one observer, a patch of an inflating universe has the following [[polar coordinates|polar]] [[metric tensor|metric]]:&lt;ref&gt;Melia, Fulvio (2007), ''The Cosmic Horizon'', MNRAS, '''382''', 1917--1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melia, Fulvio et al. (2009), ''The Cosmological Spacetime'', IJMP-D, '''18''', 1889--1901.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = - (1- \Lambda r^2) dt^2 + {1\over 1-\Lambda r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

This is just like an inside-out [[black hole]] [[Schwarzschild metric|metric]]—it has a zero in the &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; component on a fixed radius sphere called the [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|cosmological horizon]]. Objects are drawn away from the observer at &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; towards the cosmological horizon, which they cross in a finite proper time. This means that any inhomogeneities are smoothed out, just as any bumps or matter on the surface of a black hole horizon are swallowed and disappear.

Since the [[space&amp;ndash;time]] metric has no explicit time dependence, once an observer has crossed the cosmological horizon, observers closer in take its place. This process of falling outward and replacement points closer in are always steadily replacing points further out—an exponential expansion of space&amp;ndash;time.

This steady-state exponentially expanding spacetime is called a [[de Sitter space]], and to sustain it there must be a [[cosmological constant]], a [[dark energy|vacuum energy]] proportional to &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; everywhere. In this case, the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] is &lt;math&gt;\! p=-\rho&lt;/math&gt;. The physical conditions from one moment to the next are stable: the rate of expansion, called the [[Hubble parameter]], is nearly constant, and the scale factor of the universe is proportional to &lt;math&gt;e^{Ht}&lt;/math&gt;.  Inflation is often called a period of ''accelerated expansion'' because the distance between two fixed observers is increasing exponentially (i.e. at an accelerating rate as they move apart), while &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; can stay approximately constant (see [[deceleration parameter]]).

===Few inhomogeneities remain===
Cosmological inflation has the important effect of smoothing out [[homogeneity (physics)|inhomogeneities]], [[anisotropy|anisotropies]] and the [[shape of the universe|curvature of space]]. This pushes the universe into a very simple state, in which it is completely dominated by the [[inflaton]] field, the source of the cosmological constant, and the only significant inhomogeneities are the tiny quantum fluctuations in the [[inflaton]]. Inflation also dilutes exotic heavy particles, such as the [[magnetic monopole]]s predicted by many extensions to the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]. If the universe was only hot enough to form such particles ''before'' a period of inflation, they would not be observed in nature, as they would be so rare that it is quite likely that there are none in the [[observable universe]]. Together, these effects are called the inflationary &quot;no-hair theorem&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with the [[no hair theorem]] for [[black hole]]s.

The &quot;no-hair&quot; theorem works essentially because the cosmological horizon is no different from a black-hole horizon, except for philosophical disagreements about what is on the other side. The interpretation of the no-hair theorem is that the universe (observable and unobservable) expands by an enormous factor during inflation. In an expanding universe, [[energy density|energy densities]] generally fall, or get diluted, as the volume of the universe increases. For example, the density of ordinary &quot;cold&quot; matter (dust) goes as the inverse of the volume: when linear dimensions double, the energy density goes down by a factor of eight; the radiation energy density goes down even more rapidly as the universe expands since the wavelength of each photon is stretched ([[redshift]]ed), in addition to the photons being dispersed by the expansion.  When linear dimensions are doubled, the energy density in radiation falls by a factor of sixteen.
During inflation, the energy density in the [[inflaton]] field is roughly constant.  However, the energy density in inhomogeneities, curvature, anisotropies and exotic particles is falling, and through sufficient inflation these become negligible.
This leaves an empty, flat, and symmetric universe, which is filled with radiation when inflation ends.

===Key requirement===
A key requirement is that inflation must continue long enough to produce the present observable universe from a single, small inflationary [[Hubble volume]]. This is necessary to ensure that the universe appears flat, homogeneous and isotropic at the largest observable scales. This requirement is generally thought to be satisfied if the universe expanded by a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; during inflation.&lt;ref&gt;This is usually quoted as 60 ''e''-folds of expansion, where ''e''&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;. It is equal to the amount of expansion since reheating, which is roughly ''E''&lt;sub&gt;inflation&lt;/sub&gt;/''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.7 [[Kelvin|K]] is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background today. See, ''e.g.'' Kolb and Turner (1998) or Liddle and Lyth (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reheating===
At the end of inflation, a process called ''reheating'' occurs, in which the potential energy of the [[inflaton]] field is converted into
[[Standard Model]] particles, starting the radiation dominated phase of the Universe. It is not known how long inflation lasted but it is usually thought to be extremely short compared to the age of the universe.

==Motivation==
Inflation resolves [[Big Bang#Features, issues and problems|several problems]] in the [[Big Bang]] cosmology that were pointed out in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Much of the historical context is explained in chapters 15&amp;ndash;17 of Peebles (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
Inflation was first discovered by Guth while investigating the problem of why we see no [[magnetic monopoles]] today; he found that a positive-energy [[false vacuum]] would, according to [[general relativity]], generate an exponential expansion of space. It was very quickly realised that such an expansion would resolve many other long-standing problems. These problems arise from the observation that to look like it does ''today'', the universe would have to have started from very [[fine tuned universe|finely tuned]], or &quot;special&quot; initial conditions at the Big Bang. Inflation attempts to resolve these problems by providing a dynamical mechanism that drives the universe to this special state, thus making a universe like ours much more likely in the context of the Big Bang theory.

===Magnetic-monopole problem===
The [[magnetic monopole|magnetic-monopole]] problem (sometimes called the exotic-relics problem) says that if the early universe were very hot, a large number of very heavy, stable [[magnetic monopole]]s would be produced. This is a problem with [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]], which proposes that at high temperatures (such as in the early universe) the [[electromagnetic force]], [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force|weak]] [[nuclear force]]s are not actually fundamental forces but arise due to [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] from a single [[gauge theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Since [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] Grand Unified Theory is built into [[string theory]], it is still a triumph for inflation that it is able to deal with these magnetic relics. See, ''e.g.'' Kolb and Turner (1988) and {{Cite conference|title=Grand Unified Theories|first=Stuart|last=Raby|arxiv=hep-ph/0608183|booktitle=Galapagos World Summit on Physics Beyond the Standard Model|editor=ed. Bruce Hoeneisen|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories predict a number of heavy, stable particles that have not yet been observed in nature. The most notorious is the magnetic monopole, a kind of stable, heavy &quot;knot&quot; in the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last='t Hooft|first=Gerard|title=Magnetic monopoles in Unified Gauge Theories|journal=Nucl.

A period of inflation that occurs below the temperature where magnetic monopoles can be produced would offer a possible resolution of this problem: monopoles would be separated from each other as the universe around them expands, potentially lowering their observed density by many orders of magnitude. Though, as [[Martin Rees]] has written, &quot;Skeptics about exotic physics might not be hugely impressed by a theoretical argument to explain the absence of particles that are themselves only hypothetical. Preventive medicine can readily seem 100 percent effective against a disease that doesn't exist!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Martin. (1998).

===Horizon problem===
{{Main|Horizon problem}}
The [[horizon problem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The isotropy of the universe | doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/15/2/008|first=Charles W.|last=Misner|year=1968|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=151|issue=2|pages=431|last2=Coley|first2=A A|last3=Ellis|first3=G F R|last4=Hancock|first4=M|bibcode = 1998CQGra..15..331W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtw&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Misner | first = Charles | coauthors = Thorne, Kip S. and Wheeler, John Archibald | title = Gravitation | location = San Francisco | publisher = W.

For example, molecules in a canister of gas are distributed homogeneously and isotropically because they are in thermal equilibrium: gas throughout the canister has had enough time to interact to dissipate inhomogeneities and anisotropies. The situation is quite different in the big bang model without inflation, because gravitational expansion does not give the early universe enough time to equilibrate. In a big bang with only the [[matter]] and [[radiation]] known in the [[Standard Model]], two widely separated regions of the observable universe cannot have equilibrated because they move apart from each other faster than the [[speed of light]]&amp;mdash;thus have never come in to [[causal contact]]: in the history of the universe, back to the earliest times, it has not been possible to send a light signal between the two regions. Because they have no interaction, it is difficult to explain why they have the same temperature (are thermally equilibrated). This is because the [[Hubble radius]] in a radiation or matter-dominated universe expands much more quickly than physical lengths and so points that are out of communication are coming into communication. Historically, two proposed solutions were the [[Phoenix universe]] of [[Georges Lemaître]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemaître|first=Georges|title=The expanding universe|journal=Ann. Soc. Sci.

Their models failed, however, because of the buildup of [[entropy]] over several cycles. Misner made the (ultimately incorrect) conjecture that the Mixmaster mechanism, which made the universe ''more'' chaotic, could lead to statistical homogeneity and isotropy.

===Flatness problem===
{{Main|Flatness problem}}
Another problem is the [[flatness problem]] (which is sometimes called one of the [[Dicke]] coincidences, with the other being the [[cosmological constant problem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dicke |first=Robert H.|title=Gravitation and the Universe |location = Philadelphia | publisher=American Philosopical Society | year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title=The big bang cosmology &amp;ndash; enigmas and nostrums|first=Robert H.|last=Dicke|coauthors=P. J. E. Peebles | year = 1979| booktitle = General Relativity: an Einstein Centenary Survey|editor=ed. S. W. Hawking and W. Israel | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been known in the 1960s{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that the density of matter in the universe was comparable to the [[critical density]] necessary for a flat universe (that is, a universe whose large scale [[geometry]] is the usual [[Euclidean geometry]], rather than a [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] or [[spherical geometry]]).

Therefore, regardless of the [[shape of the universe]] the contribution of spatial curvature to the expansion of the universe could not be much greater than the contribution of matter. But as the universe expands, the curvature [[redshift]]s away more slowly than matter and radiation. Extrapolated into the past, this presents a [[fine-tuning]] problem because the contribution of curvature to the universe must be exponentially small (sixteen orders of magnitude less than the density of radiation at [[big bang nucleosynthesis]], for example). This problem is exacerbated by recent observations of the cosmic microwave background that have demonstrated that the universe is flat to the accuracy of a few percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_matter.html What is the Universe Made Of?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Precursors===

In the early days of [[General Relativity]], [[Albert Einstein]] introduced the [[cosmological constant]] to allow a [[Einstein static universe|static solution]] which was a three dimensional sphere with a uniform density of matter. A little later, [[Willem de Sitter]] found a highly symmetric inflating universe, which described a universe with a cosmological constant which is otherwise empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Willem|last=de Sitter|title=Einstein's theory of gravitation and its astronomical consequences. Third paper|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=78|pages=3&amp;ndash;28|year=1917|bibcode = 1917MNRAS..78....3D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered that Einstein's solution is unstable, and if there are small fluctuations, it eventually turns into de Sitter's.

In the early 1970s [[Zeldovich]] noticed the serious flatness and horizon problems of big bang cosmology; before his work, cosmology was presumed to be symmetrical on purely philosophical grounds. In the Soviet Union, this and other considerations led [[Belinski]] and [[Khalatnikov]] to analyze the chaotic [[BKL singularity]] in General Relativity. Misner's [[Mixmaster universe]] attempted to use this chaotic behavior to solve the cosmological problems, with limited success.

In the late 1970s, [[Sidney Coleman]] applied the [[instanton]] techniques developed by [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]] and collaborators to study the fate of the [[false vacuum]] in quantum field theory. Like a metastable phase in statistical mechanics&amp;mdash;water below the freezing temperature or above the boiling point&amp;mdash;a quantum field would need to nucleate a large enough bubble of the new vacuum, the new phase, in order to make a transition. Coleman found the most likely decay pathway for vacuum decay and calculated the inverse lifetime per unit volume. He eventually noted that gravitational effects would be significant, but he did not calculate these effects and did not apply the results to cosmology.

In the Soviet Union, Starobinsky noted that quantum corrections to general relativity should be important in the early universe, and these generically lead to curvature-squared corrections to the [[Einstein&amp;ndash;Hilbert action]]. The solution to Einstein's equations in the presence of curvature squared terms, when the curvatures are large, can lead to an effective cosmological constant, so he proposed that the early universe went through a deSitter phase, an inflationary era.&lt;ref&gt;Starobinsky, A. A. - Spectrum Of Relict Gravitational Radiation And The Early State Of The Universe - JETP Lett. 30, 682 (1979) {Pisma Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 30, 719 (1979)}.&lt;/ref&gt; This resolved the problems of cosmology, and led to specific predictions for the corrections to the microwave background radiation, corrections which were calculated in detail shortly afterwards.

In 1978, Zeldovich noted the monopole problem, which was an unambiguous quantitative version of the horizon problem, this time in a fashionable subfield of particle physics, which led to several speculative attempts to resolve it. In 1980, working in the west, [[Alan Guth]] realized that false vacuum decay in the early universe would solve the problem, leading him to propose scalar driven inflation. Starobinski's and Guth's scenarios both predicted an initial deSitter phase, differing only in the details of the mechanism.

===Early inflationary models===
Inflation was proposed in January, 1980 by [[Alan Guth]] as a mechanism for resolving these problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLAC&quot;&gt;[[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center|SLAC]] seminar, &quot;10-35 seconds after the Big Bang&quot;, 23rd January, 1980. see Guth (1997), pg 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347 | title = Inflationary universe: A possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems |url=http://www.astro.rug.nl/~weygaert/tim1publication/cosmo2007/literature/inflationary.universe.guth.physrevd-1981.pdf | format=PDF| year = 1981 | last1 = Guth | first1 = Alan H. | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–356| bibcode=1981PhRvD..23..347G }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Alexei Starobinsky]] argued that quantum corrections to gravity would replace the initial singularity of the universe with an exponentially expanding deSitter phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Alexei A.|last=Starobinsky|title=A new type of isotropic cosmological models without singularity|journal=Phys.

Like Guth, they concluded that such a model not only required fine tuning of the cosmological constant, but also would very likely lead to a much too granular universe, i.e., to large density variations resulting from bubble wall collisions.

During cosmological inflation, the Hubble radius is constant. The physical wavelength of a perturbation mode (dashed line) is also shown. The plot illustrates how the perturbation mode grows larger than the horizon during cosmological inflation before coming back inside the horizon, which grows rapidly during radiation domination. If cosmological inflation had never happened, and radiation domination continued back until a [[gravitational singularity]], then the mode would never have been outside the horizon in the very early universe, and no [[causality (physics)|causal]] mechanism could have ensured that the universe was homogeneous on the scale of the perturbation mode.]]

Guth proposed that as the early universe cooled, it was trapped in a [[false vacuum]] with a high energy density, which is much like a [[cosmological constant]]. As the very early universe cooled it was trapped in a [[metastability|metastable]] state (it was [[supercooling|supercooled]]) which it could only decay out of through the process of [[nucleation|bubble nucleation]] via [[quantum tunneling]]. Bubbles of [[vacuum state|true vacuum]] spontaneously form in the sea of false vacuum and rapidly begin expanding at the [[speed of light]]. Guth recognized that this model was problematic because the model did not reheat properly: when the bubbles nucleated, they did not generate any radiation. Radiation could only be generated in collisions between bubble walls. But if inflation lasted long enough to solve the initial conditions problems, collisions between bubbles became exceedingly rare. In any one causal patch, it is likely that only one bubble will nucleate.

===Slow-roll inflation===
The bubble collision problem was solved by [[Andrei Linde]]&lt;ref name=&quot;linde&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(82)91219-9 | title = A new inflationary universe scenario: A possible solution of the horizon, flatness, homogeneity, isotropy and primordial monopole problems | year = 1982 | last1 = Linde | first1 = A | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 108 | issue = 6 | pages = 389–393 | bibcode=1982PhLB..108..389L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently by [[Andreas Albrecht]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]&lt;ref name=&quot;albrecht&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.1220 | title = Cosmology for Grand Unified Theories with Radiatively Induced Symmetry Breaking | year = 1982 | last1 = Albrecht | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Steinhardt | first2 = Paul | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 48 | issue = 17 | pages = 1220–1223 | bibcode=1982PhRvL..48.1220A | url=http://astrophysics.fic.uni.lodz.pl/100yrs/pdf/07/060.pdf | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a model named ''new inflation'' or ''slow-roll inflation'' (Guth's model then became known as ''old inflation''). In this model, instead of tunneling out of a false vacuum state, inflation occurred by a [[scalar field]] rolling down a potential energy hill. When the field rolls very slowly compared to the expansion of the universe, inflation occurs. However, when the hill becomes steeper, inflation ends and reheating can occur.

===Effects of asymmetries===
Eventually, it was shown that new inflation does not produce a perfectly symmetric universe, but that tiny quantum fluctuations in the [[inflaton]] are created. These tiny fluctuations form the primordial seeds for all structure created in the later universe. These fluctuations were first calculated by [[Viatcheslav Mukhanov]] and G. V. Chibisov in the [[Soviet Union]] in analyzing Starobinsky's similar model.&lt;ref&gt;See Linde (1990) and Mukhanov (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=JETP Lett.|volume=33|pages=532&amp;ndash;5|year=1981|title=Quantum fluctuation and &quot;nonsingular&quot; universe|first=Viatcheslav F.|last=Mukhanov|bibcode = 1981JETPL..33..532M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Sov.

==Observational status==
Inflation is a concrete mechanism for realizing the [[cosmological principle]] which is the basis of the standard model of physical cosmology: it accounts for the homogeneity and isotropy of the observable universe. In addition, it accounts for the observed flatness and absence of magnetic monopoles. Since Guth's early work, each of these observations has received further confirmation, most impressively by the detailed observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]] made by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) spacecraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;wmap&quot;&gt;See, ''e.g.'' {{Cite journal|last=Spergel|first=D.N.|title=Three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations: Implications for cosmology|url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/map_bibliography.cfm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis shows that the universe is flat to an accuracy of at least a few percent, and that it is homogeneous and isotropic to a part in 10,000.

In addition, inflation predicts that the structures visible in the universe today formed through the [[gravitational collapse]] of perturbations which were formed as quantum mechanical fluctuations in the inflationary epoch. The detailed form of the spectrum of perturbations called a [[scale invariance#Cosmology|nearly-scale-invariant]] [[Gaussian random field]] (or Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum) is very specific and has only two free parameters, the amplitude of the spectrum and the ''spectral index'' which measures the slight deviation from scale invariance predicted by inflation (perfect scale invariance corresponds to the idealized de Sitter universe).&lt;ref&gt;Perturbations can be represented by [[Fourier modes]] of a given [[wavelength]]. Each Fourier mode is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] (usually called Gaussian) with mean zero. Different Fourier components are uncorrelated. The variance of a mode depends only on its wavelength in such a way that within any given volume each wavelength contributes an equal amount of [[spectral density|power]] to the spectrum of perturbations. Since the Fourier transform is in three dimensions, this means that the variance of a mode goes as ''k''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt; to compensate for the fact that within any volume, the number of modes with a given wavenumber ''k'' goes as ''k''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation predicts that the observed perturbations should be in [[thermal equilibrium]] with each other (these are called ''adiabatic'' or ''isentropic'' perturbations). This structure for the perturbations has been confirmed by the WMAP spacecraft and other cosmic microwave background experiments,&lt;ref name=&quot;wmap&quot; /&gt; and [[galaxy survey]]s, especially the ongoing [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sdss&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=M.|last=Tegmark|title=Cosmological constraints from the SDSS luminous red galaxies|arxiv=astro-ph/0608632|year=2006|month=August|bibcode = 2006PhRvD..74l3507T |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.74.123507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments have shown that the one part in 10,000 inhomogeneities observed have exactly the form predicted by theory. Moreover, there is evidence for a slight deviation from scale invariance. The ''spectral index'', ''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to one for a scale-invariant spectrum. The simplest models of inflation predict that this quantity is between 0.92 and 0.98.&lt;ref name=&quot;myths&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cosmological perturbations: Myths and facts|journal=Mod.

A number of theories of inflation have been proposed that make radically different predictions, but they generally have much more [[fine-tuning|fine tuning]] than is necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;myths&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boyle&quot; /&gt; As a physical model, however, inflation is most valuable in that it robustly predicts the initial conditions of the universe based on only two adjustable parameters: the spectral index (that can only change in a small range) and the amplitude of the perturbations. Except in contrived models, this is true regardless of how inflation is realized in particle physics.

Occasionally, effects are observed that appear to contradict the simplest models of inflation. The first-year WMAP data suggested that the spectrum might not be nearly scale-invariant, but might instead have a slight curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D.

An experimental program is underway to further test inflation with more precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background. In particular, high precision measurements of the so-called &quot;B-modes&quot; of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation#Polarization|polarization]] of the background radiation will be evidence of the [[gravitational radiation]] produced by inflation, and they will also show whether the energy scale of inflation predicted by the simplest models (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;ndash;10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[GeV]]) is correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyle&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tegmark&quot; /&gt; These measurements are expected to be performed by the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]], although it is unclear if the signal will be visible, or if contamination from foreground sources will interfere with these measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Systematic effects in CMB polarization measurements|first=C.|last=Rosset|coauthors=(PLANCK-HFI collaboration)|booktitle=Exploring the universe: Contents and structures of the universe (XXXIXth Rencontres de Moriond)|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forthcoming measurements, such as those of [[21 centimeter radiation]] (radiation emitted and absorbed from neutral hydrogen before the [[population III star|first stars]] turned on), may measure the power spectrum with even greater resolution than the cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys, although it is not known if these measurements will be possible or if interference with [[radio frequency|radio sources]] on earth and in the galaxy will be too great.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A.|last=Loeb|title=Measuring the small-scale power spectrum of cosmic density fluctuations through 21 cm tomography prior to the epoch of structure formation|journal=Phys.

[[Dark energy]] is broadly similar to inflation, and is thought to be causing the expansion of the present-day universe to accelerate. However, the energy scale of dark energy is much lower, 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;GeV, roughly 27 [[orders of magnitude]] less than the scale of inflation.

==Theoretical status==
{{unsolved|physics|Is the theory of cosmological inflation correct, and if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical [[inflaton]] field giving rise to inflation?}}
In the early proposal of Guth, it was thought that the [[inflaton]] was the [[Higgs field]], the field which explains the mass of the elementary particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;guth&quot; /&gt; It is now known that the [[inflaton]] cannot be the Higgs field.&lt;ref name=guth97&gt;{{Cite book

A promising suggestion is [[brane inflation]]. At present, however, whilst inflation is understood principally by its detailed predictions of the [[boundary condition|initial conditions]] for the hot early universe, the particle physics is largely ''ad hoc'' modelling. As such, though predictions of inflation have been consistent with the results of observational tests, there are many open questions about the theory.

===Fine-tuning problem===
One of the most severe challenges for inflation arises from the need for [[fine tuning]] in inflationary theories. In new inflation, the ''slow-roll conditions'' must be satisfied for inflation to occur. The slow-roll conditions say that the [[inflaton]] [[scalar potential|potential]] must be flat (compared to the large [[vacuum energy]]) and that the [[inflaton]] particles must have a small mass.&lt;ref&gt;Technically, these conditions are that the [[logarithmic derivative]] of the potential, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=(1/2)(V'/V)^2&lt;/math&gt; and second derivative &lt;math&gt;\eta=V''/V-(1/2)(V'/V)^2&lt;/math&gt; are small, where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the potential and the equations are written in [[reduced Planck units]]. See, ''e.g.'' Liddle and Lyth (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In order for the new inflation theory of Linde, Albrecht and Steinhardt to be successful, therefore, it seemed that the universe must have a scalar field with an especially flat potential and special initial conditions.

====Andrei Linde====
Andrei Linde proposed a theory known as ''[[Chaotic inflation theory|chaotic inflation]]'' in which he suggested that the conditions for inflation are actually satisfied quite generically and inflation will occur in virtually any universe that begins in a chaotic, high energy state and has a scalar field with unbounded potential energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaotic&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Andrei D.|last=Linde|title=Chaotic inflation | doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2008/03/015|journal=Phys. Lett.|volume=B129|issue=03|pages=171&amp;ndash;81|year=1983|last2=Postma|first2=M|bibcode = 2008JCAP...03..015D }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his model the [[inflaton]] field necessarily takes values larger than one Planck unit: for this reason, these are often called ''large field'' models and the competing new inflation models are called ''small field'' models. In this situation, the predictions of [[effective field theory]] are thought to be invalid, as [[renormalization]] should cause large corrections that could prevent inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Technically, this is because the [[inflaton]] potential is expressed as a Taylor series in φ/''m''&lt;sub&gt;Pl&lt;/sub&gt;, where φ is the [[inflaton]] and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;Pl&lt;/sub&gt; is the Planck mass. While for a single term, such as the mass term ''m''&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;(φ/''m''&lt;sub&gt;Pl&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the slow roll conditions can be satisfied for φ much greater than ''m''&lt;sub&gt;Pl&lt;/sub&gt;, this is precisely the situation in effective field theory in which higher order terms would be expected to contribute and destroy the conditions for inflation. The absence of these higher order corrections can be seen as another sort of fine tuning. See ''e.g.'' {{Cite journal|first=Laila|last=Alabidi|title=Inflation models and observation | doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2006/05/016|journal=JCAP|volume=0605|issue=05|year=2006|pages=016|arxiv=astro-ph/0510441|last2=Lyth|first2=David H|bibcode = 2006JCAP...05..016A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem has not yet been resolved and some cosmologists argue that the small field models, in which inflation can occur at a much lower energy scale, are better models of inflation.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'' {{Cite journal|title=What would we learn by detecting a gravitational wave signal in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy? | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.1861|first=David H.|last=Lyth|journal=Phys.

[[Robert Brandenberger]] has commented on fine-tuning in another situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Challenges for inflationary cosmology|first=Robert H.|last=Brandenberger|month=November | year=2004|booktitle=10th International Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology|arxiv=astro-ph/0411671}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amplitude of the primordial inhomogeneities produced in inflation is directly tied to the energy scale of inflation. There are strong suggestions that this scale is around 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[GeV]] or 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt; times the [[Planck energy]]. The natural scale is naïvely the Planck scale so this small value could be seen as another form of fine-tuning (called a [[hierarchy problem]]): the energy density given by the scalar potential is down by 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;12&lt;/sup&gt; compared to the [[Planck density]]. This is not usually considered to be a critical problem, however, because the scale of inflation corresponds naturally to the scale of [[gauge unification]].

===Eternal inflation===
{{Main|Chaotic inflation}}

Cosmological inflation seems to be eternal the way it is theorised. Although new inflation is classically rolling down the potential, quantum fluctuations can sometimes bring it back up to previous levels. These regions in which the [[inflaton]] fluctuates upwards expand much faster than regions in which the [[inflaton]] has a lower potential energy, and tend to dominate in terms of physical volume. This steady state, which first developed by Vilenkin,&lt;ref name=&quot;vilenkin&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Alexander|last=Vilenkin|title=The birth of inflationary universes | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2848|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=D27|issue=12|pages=2848|year=1983|bibcode = 1983PhRvD..27.2848V }}&lt;/ref&gt; is called &quot;eternal inflation&quot;.

However, unlike de Sitter space, fluctuations in a contracting inflationary space will collapse to form a [[gravitational singularity]], a point where densities become infinite. Therefore, it is necessary to have a theory for the universe's initial conditions. Linde, however, believes inflation may be past eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Linde (2005, §V).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial conditions===
Some physicists have tried to avoid the initial conditions problem by proposing models for an eternally inflating universe with no origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Does inflation provide natural initial conditions for the universe?|first=Sean M.|last=Carroll|journal=Gen. Rel.

D67 (2003) 083515, [http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0301042]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Aguirre, Steven Gratton, ''Steady-State Eternal Inflation'', Phys.Rev. D65 (2002) 083507, [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0111191]&lt;/ref&gt; These models propose that while the universe, on the largest scales, expands exponentially it was, is and always will be, spatially infinite and has existed, and will exist, forever.

Other proposals attempt to describe the ex nihilo creation of the universe based on [[quantum cosmology]] and the following inflation. Vilenkin put forth one such scenario.&lt;ref name=&quot;vilenkin&quot; /&gt; Hartle and Hawking offered the [[no-boundary proposal]] for the initial creation of the universe in which inflation comes about naturally.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hartle and S. W. Hawking, &quot;Wave function of the universe&quot;, ''Phys. Rev.'' '''D28''', 2960 (1983). See also Hawking (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Guth]] has described the inflationary universe as the &quot;ultimate free lunch&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Hawking (1998), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Alan Guth|Wikiquote]]&lt;/ref&gt; new universes, similar to our own, are continually produced in a vast inflating background. Gravitational interactions, in this case, circumvent (but do not violate) the [[first law of thermodynamics]] ([[energy conservation]]) and the [[second law of thermodynamics]] ([[entropy]] and the [[arrow of time]] problem). However, while there is consensus that this solves the initial conditions problem, some have disputed this, as it is much more likely that the universe came about by a quantum fluctuation. Donald Page was an outspoken critic of inflation because of this anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;D.N. Page, &quot;Inflation does not explain time asymmetry&quot;, ''Nature'', '''304''', 39 (1983) see also [[Roger Penrose]]'s book [[The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe]].&lt;/ref&gt; He stressed that the thermodynamic [[arrow of time]] necessitates low [[entropy]] initial conditions, which would be highly unlikely. According to them, rather than solving this problem, the inflation theory further aggravates it &amp;ndash; the reheating at the end of the inflation era increases entropy, making it necessary for the initial state of the Universe to be even more orderly than in other Big Bang theories with no inflation phase.

Hawking and Page later found ambiguous results when they attempted to compute the probability of inflation in the Hartle-Hawking initial state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How probable is inflation?|first=S. W.|last=Hawking|year=1988|volume=B298|issue=4|pages=789|journal=Nucl. Phys.|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(88)90008-9|bibcode = 1988NuPhB.298..789H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have argued that, since inflation is eternal, the probability doesn't matter as long as it is not precisely zero: once it starts, inflation perpetuates itself and quickly dominates the universe.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, Albrecht and Lorenzo Sorbo have argued that the probability of an inflationary cosmos, consistent with today's observations, emerging by a random fluctuation from some pre-existent state, ''compared'' with a non-inflationary cosmos overwhelmingly favours the inflationary scenario, simply because the &quot;seed&quot; amount of non-gravitational energy required for the inflationary cosmos is so much less than any required for a non-inflationary alternative, which outweighs any entropic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Andreas|last=Albrecht|title=Can the universe afford inflation?|journal=Physical Review|volume=D70|pages=063528|year=2004|arxiv=hep-th/0405270|bibcode = 2004PhRvD..70f3528A |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.70.063528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem that has occasionally been mentioned is the trans-Planckian problem or trans-Planckian effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jerome|last2=Brandenberger|last=Martin|first2=Robert|title=The trans-Planckian problem of inflationary cosmology|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=D63|year=2001|issue=12|pages=123501|arxiv=hep-th/0005209|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.63.123501|bibcode = 2001PhRvD..63l3501M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the energy scale of inflation and the Planck scale are relatively close, some of the quantum fluctuations which have made up the structure in our universe were smaller than the Planck length before inflation. Therefore, there ought to be corrections from Planck-scale physics, in particular the unknown quantum theory of gravity. There has been some disagreement about the magnitude of this effect: about whether it is just on the threshold of detectability or completely undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jerome|last=Martin|title=Superimposed Oscillations in the WMAP Data?|journal=Phys.

===Reheating===
The end of inflation is called reheating or thermalization because the large potential energy of the [[inflaton]] field decays into particles and fills the universe with [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Because the nature of the [[inflaton]] is not known, this process is still poorly understood, although it is believed to take place through a [[parametric oscillator|parametric resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;See Kolb and Turner (1988) or Mukhanov (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Reheating after inflation | doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/3/5/011|first=Lev|last=Kofman|journal=Phys.

===Hybrid inflation===
Another kind of inflation, called ''hybrid inflation'', is an extension of new inflation. It introduces additional scalar fields, so that while one of the scalar fields is responsible for normal slow roll inflation, another triggers the end of inflation: when inflation has continued for sufficiently long, it becomes favorable to the second field to decay into a much lower energy state.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Brandenberger, &quot;A Status Review of Inflationary Cosmology&quot;, proceedings
Journal-ref: BROWN-HET-1256 (2001), (available from {{arxiv|hep-ph/0101119v1}} 11 January 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In hybrid inflation, one of the scalar fields is responsible for most of the energy density (thus determining the rate of expansion), while the other is responsible for the slow roll (thus determining the period of inflation and its termination). Thus fluctuations in the former inflaton would not affect inflation termination, while fluctuations in the latter would not affect the rate of expansion. Therefore hybrid inflation is not eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Linde, &quot;Prospects of Inflation&quot;, ''Physica Scripta Online'' (2004) (available from {{arxiv|hep-th/0402051}} )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanco-Pillado et al. , &quot;Racetrack inflation&quot;, (2004) (available from {{arxiv|hep-th/0406230}} )&lt;/ref&gt; When the second (slow-rolling) inflaton reaches the bottom of its potential, it changes the location of the minimum of the first inflaton's potential, which leads to a fast roll of the inflaton down its potential, leading to termination of inflation.

===Inflation and string cosmology===
The discovery of [[Compactification (physics)#Flux compactification|flux compactification]]s have opened the way for reconciling inflation and string theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Towards inflation in string theory|first=Shamit|last=Kachru|year=2003|journal=JCAP|volume=0310|pages=013|arxiv=hep-th/0308055|bibcode = 2003JCAP...10..013K |doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2003/10/013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new theory, called [[brane inflation]] suggests that inflation arises from the motion of [[D-brane]]s&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Dvali, S. H. Henry Tye, ''Brane inflation,'' ''Phys.Lett.'' '''B450''', 72-82 (1999), {{arxiv|hep-ph/9812483}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the compactified geometry, usually towards a stack of anti-D-branes. This theory, governed by the [[Dirac-Born-Infeld action]], is very different from ordinary inflation. The dynamics are not completely understood. It appears that special conditions are necessary since inflation occurs in tunneling between two vacua in the [[string landscape]]. The process of tunneling between two vacua is a form of old inflation, but new inflation must then occur by some other mechanism.

===Inflation and loop quantum gravity===
When investigating the effects the theory of [[loop quantum gravity]] would have on cosmology, a [[loop quantum cosmology]] model has evolved that provides a possible mechanism for cosmological inflation. Loop quantum gravity assumes a quantified spacetime. If the energy density is larger than can be held by the quantified spacetime, it is thought to bounce back. &lt;!-- Scientfic American October 2008, see also [[loop quantum cosmology]] --&gt;

==Adjuncts to inflation==
There are models that explain some of the observations explained by inflation.  However none of these &quot;alternatives&quot; has the same breadth of explanation as inflation, and still require inflation for a more complete fit with observation; they should therefore be regarded as adjuncts to inflation, rather than as alternatives.

[[String theory]] requires that, in addition to the three spatial dimensions we observe, there exist additional dimensions that are curled up or [[compactification (physics)|compactified]] (see also [[Kaluza-Klein theory]]).  Extra dimensions appear as a frequent component of [[supergravity]] models and other approaches to [[quantum gravity]].  This raises the question of why four space-time dimensions became large and the rest became unobservably small. An attempt to address this question, called [[string gas cosmology]], was proposed by [[Robert Brandenberger]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(89)90037-0 | title = Superstrings in the early universe | year = 1989 | last1 = Brandenberger | first1 = R | journal = Nuclear Physics B | volume = 316 | issue = 2 | pages = 391–410 | bibcode=1989NuPhB.316..391B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model focuses on the dynamics of the early universe considered as a hot gas of strings.  Brandenberger and Vafa show that a dimension of [[spacetime]] can only expand if the strings that wind around it can efficiently annihilate each other.  Each string is a one-dimensional object, and the largest number of dimensions in which two strings will [[transversality|generically intersect]] (and, presumably, annihilate) is three.  Therefore, one argues that the most likely number of non-compact (large) spatial dimensions is three.  Current work on this model centers on whether it can succeed in stabilizing the size of the compactified dimensions and produce the correct spectrum of primordial density perturbations.  For a recent review, see&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Battefeld and Scott Watson, ''String Gas Cosmology'', ''Rev. Mod. Phys'' '''78''', 435-454 (2006), {{arxiv|hep-th/0510022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors admits that their model &quot;does not solve the entropy and flatness problems of standard cosmology ..... and we can provide no explanation for why the current universe is so close to being spatially flat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Brandenberger, Ali Nayeri, Subodh P. Patil and Cumrun Vafa, ''String Gas Cosmology and Structure Formation'', Int.J.Mod.Phys.A22:3621-3642,2007., {{arxiv|hep-th/0608121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ekpyrotic]] and [[cyclic model]]s are also considered adjuncts to inflation.  These models solve the [[horizon problem]] through an expanding epoch well ''before'' the Big Bang, and then generate the required spectrum of primordial density perturbations during a contracting phase leading to a [[Big Crunch]].  The universe passes through the Big Crunch and emerges in a hot [[Big Bang]] phase.  In this sense they are reminiscent of the [[oscillatory universe]] proposed by [[Richard Chace Tolman]]: however in Tolman's model the total age of the universe is necessarily finite, while in these models this is not necessarily so.  Whether the correct spectrum of density fluctuations can be produced, and whether the universe can successfully navigate the Big Bang/Big Crunch transition, remains a topic of controversy and current research.  They also provide no explanation of the [[magnetic monopole]] problem.  Unfortunately, as things stand - there is no evidence of any 'slowing down' of the expansion.

The '''candela''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|æ|n|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|k|æ|n|ˈ|d|iː|l|ə}}; symbol: '''cd''') is the [[SI base unit]] of [[luminous intensity]]; that is, power emitted by a light source in a particular direction, weighted by the [[luminosity function]] (a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye to different [[wavelength]]s, also known as the ''luminous efficiency function''&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharpe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wyzecki |first=G. |coauthors=Stiles, W.S. |year=1982 |edition=2nd ed. |title=Color Science: Concepts and Methods, Quantitative Data and Formulae |isbn=0471021067 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A common [[candle]] emits light with a luminous intensity of roughly one candela. If emission in some directions is blocked by an opaque barrier, the emission would still be approximately one candela in the directions that are not obscured. 

The word ''candela'' means ''candle'' in [[Latin language|Latin]], as well as in many modern languages.

==Definition==

Like other SI base units, the candela has an [[operational definition]]—it is defined by a description of a physical process that will produce one candela of luminous intensity. Since the 16th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 1979, the candela has been defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Base unit definitions: Candela
 | work = The [[NIST]] Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty
 | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/candela.html
 | accessdate = Sept. 27, 2010
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540{{e|12}} [[hertz]] and that has a [[radiant intensity]] in that direction of {{frac|683}} [[watt]] per [[steradian]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The definition describes how to produce a light source that (by definition) emits one candela. Such a source could then be used to calibrate instruments designed to measure luminous intensity.

The candela is sometimes still called by the old name ''candle'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/candela Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; such as in ''[[foot-candle]]'' and the modern definition of ''[[candlepower]]''.

==Explanation==

The frequency chosen is in the [[visible light|visible spectrum]] near [[green]], corresponding to a wavelength of about 555&amp;nbsp;nanometers.  The [[human eye]] is most sensitive to this frequency, when [[Adaptation (eye)|adapted]] for bright conditions.  At other frequencies, more radiant intensity is required to achieve the same luminous intensity, according to the frequency response of the human eye. The luminous intensity for light of a particular wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;I_v(\lambda)= 683.002\,\overline{y}(\lambda) I(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_v(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the luminous intensity in candelas, &lt;math&gt;I(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the radiant intensity in W/sr and &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the standard luminosity function. If more than one wavelength is present (as is usually the case), one must sum or integrate over the [[spectrum]] of wavelengths present to get the total luminous intensity.

A common candle emits roughly 1&amp;nbsp;cd.

==Origin==

Prior to 1948, various standards for luminous intensity were in use in a number of countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a &quot;standard candle&quot; of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these was the [[England|English]] standard of candlepower. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120 [[Grain (mass)|grains]] per hour. Germany, Austria and Scandinavia used the [[hefnerkerze]], a unit based on the output of a [[Hefner lamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/hefner.htm |title=Hefner unit, or Hefner candle |work=Sizes.com |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=25 Feb. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became clear that a better-defined unit was needed. The [[Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage]] (International Commission on Illumination) and the CIPM proposed a “new candle” based on the luminance of a [[Planck radiator]] (a [[black body]]) at the temperature of freezing [[platinum]]. The value of the new unit was chosen to make it similar to the earlier unit candlepower. The decision was promulgated by the CIPM in 1946:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The value of the '''new candle''' is such that the brightness of the full radiator at the temperature of solidification of platinum is 60 new candles per [[square centimetre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Metric System: The International System of Units (SI) | author = Barry N. Taylor | publisher = U. S. Department of Commerce | year = 1992 | isbn = 0941375749 | page = 18 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=y2-BDaoBVnwC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22value+of+the+new+candle+is+such+that+the+brightness+of+the+full+radiator%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=elatR_S1FofgswPvu430BQ&amp;sig=yl2AU7A-R1O9e5ZuEzuLwekiM2E }} (NIST Special Publication 330, 1991 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was then ratified in 1948 by the 9th CGPM which adopted a new name for this unit, the ''candela''. In 1967 the 13th CGPM removed the term &quot;new candle&quot; and gave an amended version of the candela definition, specifying the atmospheric pressure applied to the freezing platinum:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The candela is the luminous intensity, in the perpendicular direction, of a surface of 1/600&amp;nbsp;000 square metre of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum under a pressure of 101&amp;nbsp;325 newtons per square metre.&lt;ref&gt;13th CGPM Resolution 5, CR, 104 (1967), and ''Metrologia'', '''4''', 43–44 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1979, because of the difficulties in realizing a Planck radiator at high temperatures and the new possibilities offered by [[radiometry]], the 16th CGPM adopted the modern definition of the candela.&lt;ref&gt;16th CGPM Resolution 3, CR, 100 (1979), and ''Metrologia'', '''16''', 56 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The arbitrary (1/683) term was chosen so that the new definition would exactly match the old definition. Although the candela is now defined in terms of the [[second]] (an SI base unit) and the watt (a derived SI unit), the candela remains a base unit of the SI system, by definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_cd_en.pdf |title=The photometric base unit – the candela |work=SI Brochure |date=7 September 2007|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SI photometric light units==

{{SI light units}}

===Relationship between luminous intensity and luminous flux===

If a source emits a known luminous intensity ''I''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (in candelas) in a well-defined cone, the total luminous flux ''F'' in [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s is given by
:''F'' = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; × 2π × (1 - cos(''A''/2)),
where ''A'' is the ''radiation angle'' of the lamp—the full vertex angle of the emission cone. For example, a lamp that emits 590&amp;nbsp;cd with a radiation angle of 40° emits about 223&amp;nbsp;lumens. See [[MR16]] for emission angles of some common lamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theledlight.com/lumens.html Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.linear1.org/index.php/topic,113.0.html Formulas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://led.linear1.org/lumen.wiz Online converter]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the source emits light uniformly in all directions, the flux can be found by multiplying the intensity by 4π: a uniform 1 candela source emits 12.6 lumens.

'''Condensed matter [[physics]]''' deals with the physical properties of condensed [[phase (matter)|phases]] of [[matter]]. These properties appear when a number of [[atom]]s at the [[supramolecular]] and [[macromolecular]] scale interact strongly and adhere to each other or are otherwise highly concentrated in a system. The most familiar examples of condensed phases are [[Solid-state physics|solids]] and [[liquid]]s. Such every-day condensed phases arise from the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] forces between [[atom]]s. More exotic condensed phases include the [[mesophase]]s of [[liquid crystal]] devices, the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by certain materials at low [[temperature]], the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice|atomic lattices]], and the [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] found in certain [[Ultracold atom|ultracold]] atomic systems.

Condensed matter physics seeks to understand the behavior of these phases by using well-established [[physical laws]]. In particular, these include the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics by far the largest field of contemporary physics. By one estimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html | title = Condensed Matter Physics Jobs: Careers in Condensed Matter Physics [Physics Today Jobs] | accessdate = 2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; one third of all [[United States]] [[physicist]]s identify themselves as condensed matter physicists. The field has a large overlap with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and [[nanotechnology]], and there are close connections with the related fields of [[atomic physics]] and [[biophysics]]. [[Theoretical physics|Theoretical]] condensed matter physics also shares many important concepts and techniques with theoretical [[Particle physics|particle]] and [[nuclear physics]].

Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of [[solid-state physics]], now considered one of its main subfields. The name of the field was apparently{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} coined in 1967 by [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] and [[Volker Heine]] when they renamed their research group in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] from &quot;Solid-State Theory&quot; to &quot;Theory of Condensed Matter&quot;. In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics at the [[American Physical Society]] was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.&lt;ref name=dcmp_governance&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://dcmp.bc.edu/page.php?name=governance_history | title = Division of Condensed Matter Physics Governance History | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons for this change is that many of the concepts and techniques developed for studying solids can also be applied to fluid systems. For instance, the [[conduction electrons]] in an [[electrical conductor]] form a [[Fermi liquid]], with similar properties to conventional liquids made up of atoms or molecules. Even the phenomenon of [[superconductivity]], in which the quantum-mechanical properties of the electrons lead to collective behavior fundamentally different from that of a classical fluid, is closely related to the [[superfluid]] phase of [[liquid helium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cultural anthropology''' is a branch of [[anthropology]] focused on the study of [[culture|cultural variation]] among humans, collecting data about the impact of global economic and political processes on local cultural realities. Anthropologists use a variety of methods, including [[participant observation]], [[interviews]] and [[Statistical survey|surveys]]. Their research is often called [[fieldwork]] because it involves the anthropologist spending an extended period of time at the research location.

==Origins==
One of the earliest articulations of the anthropological meaning of the term &quot;culture&quot; came from Sir Edward Tylor who writes on the first page of his 1897 book: “Culture, or civilization, taken in its broad, ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.”&lt;ref&gt;Tylor,Edward. 1920 [1871]. ''Primitive Culture''. New York: J.P. Putnam’s Sons.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;civilization&quot; later gave way to definitions by [[V. Gordon Childe]], with culture forming an umbrella term and civilization becoming a particular kind of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Sherratt, Andrew V. &quot;Gordon Childe: Archaeology and Intellectual History&quot;, Past and Present, No. 125. (Nov., 1989), pp. 151–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropological concept of &quot;culture&quot; reflects in part a reaction against earlier Western [[discourse]]s based on an opposition between &quot;[[culture]]&quot; and &quot;[[nature]]&quot;, according to which some human beings lived in a &quot;state of nature&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Anthropologists have argued that culture ''is'' &quot;human nature&quot;, and that all people have a capacity to classify [[experience]]s, encode classifications symbolically (i.e. in [[language]]), and teach such abstractions to others.

Since humans acquire culture through the [[learning]] processes of [[enculturation]] and [[socialization]], people living in different places or different circumstances develop different cultures. Anthropologists have also pointed out that through culture people can adapt to their environment in non-genetic ways, so people living in different environments will often have different cultures. Much of anthropological theory has originated in an appreciation of and interest in the tension between the local (particular cultures) and the global (a universal human nature, or the web of connections between people in distinct places/circumstances).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The rise of cultural anthropology occurred within the context of the late 19th century, when questions regarding which cultures were &quot;primitive&quot; and which were &quot;civilized&quot; occupied the minds of not only [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], but many others. [[Colonialism]] and its processes increasingly brought European thinkers in contact, directly or indirectly with &quot;primitive others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth''. 1993. Beach Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative status of various humans, some of whom had modern advanced technologies that included engines and telegraphs, while others lacked anything but face-to-face communication techniques and still lived a Paleolithic lifestyle, was of interest to the first generation of cultural anthropologists.

Parallel with the rise of cultural anthropology in the United States, [[social anthropology]], in which ''sociality'' is the central concept and which focuses on the study of social statuses and roles, groups, institutions, and the relations among them, developed as an academic discipline in Britain. An umbrella term socio-cultural anthropology makes reference to both cultural and social anthropology traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D.T.

==A brief history==
Modern cultural anthropology has its origins in, and developed in reaction to, 19th century &quot;[[ethnology]]&quot;, which involves the organized comparison of human societies. Scholars like [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[James Frazer|J.G. Frazer]] in [[England]] worked mostly with materials collected by others – usually missionaries, traders, explorers, or colonial officials – this earned them their current sobriquet of &quot;arm-chair anthropologists&quot;.

Ethnologists had a special interest in why people living in different parts of the world often had similar [[belief]]s and practices. In addressing this question, ethnologists in the 19th century divided into two schools of thought. Some, like [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], argued that different groups must somehow have learned from one another, however indirectly; in other words, they argued that cultural traits spread from one place to another, or &quot;[[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffused]]&quot;.

Other ethnologists argued that different groups had the capability of creating similar beliefs and practices independently. Some of those who advocated &quot;independent invention&quot;, like [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], additionally supposed that similarities meant that different groups had passed through the same stages of [[cultural evolution]] (See also [[classical social evolutionism]]). Morgan, in particular, acknowledged that certain forms of society and culture could not possibly have arisen before others. For example, industrial farming could not have been invented before simple farming, and metallurgy could not have developed without previous non-smelting processes involving metals (such as simple ground collection or mining). Morgan, like other 19th century social evolutionists, believed there was a more or less orderly progression from the primitive to the civilized.

20th-century anthropologists largely reject the notion that all human societies must pass through the same stages in the same order, on the grounds that such a notion does not fit the empirical facts. Some 20th-century [[ethnologists]], like [[Julian Steward]], have instead argued that such similarities reflected similar adaptations to similar environments (see [[cultural evolution]]).

Others, such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] (who was influenced both by American cultural anthropology and by French [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheimian]] [[sociology]]), have argued that apparently similar patterns of development reflect fundamental similarities in the structure of human thought (see [[structuralism]]). By the mid-20th century, the number of examples of people skipping stages, such as going from hunter-gatherers to post-industrial service occupations in one generation, were so numerous that 19th-century evolutionism was effectively disproved.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. Guns, Germs and Steel.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, most cultural (and social) anthropologists turned to the crafting of [[ethnography|ethnographies]]. An ethnography is a piece of writing about a people, at a particular place and time. Typically, the anthropologist lives among people in another society for a considerable period of time, simultaneously [[participant observation|participating in and observing]] the social and cultural life of the group.

Numerous other ethnographic techniques have resulted in ethnographic writing or details being preserved, as cultural anthropologists also curate materials, spend long hours in libraries, churches and schools poring over records, investigate graveyards, and decipher ancient scripts. A typical ethnography will also include information about physical geography, climate and habitat. It is meant to be a holistic piece of writing about the people in question, and today often includes the longest possible timeline of past events that the ethnographer can obtain through primary and secondary research.

[[Bronisław Malinowski]] (who conducted [[fieldwork]] in the [[Trobriand Islands]] and taught in England) developed this method, and [[Franz Boas]] (who conducted fieldwork in [[Baffin Island]] and taught in the [[United States]]) promoted it. Boas's students drew on his conception of culture and [[cultural relativism]] to develop cultural anthropology in the United States. Simultaneously, Malinowski and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A.R. Radcliffe Brown]]´s students were developing [[social anthropology]] in the United Kingdom. Whereas cultural anthropology focused on symbols and values, social anthropology focused on social groups and institutions. Today socio-cultural anthropologists attend to all these elements.

Although 19th-century ethnologists saw &quot;diffusion&quot; and &quot;independent invention&quot; as mutually exclusive and competing theories, most ethnographers quickly reached a consensus that both processes occur, and that both can plausibly account for cross-cultural similarities. But these ethnographers also pointed out the superficiality of many such similarities. They noted that even traits that spread through diffusion often were given different meanings and function from one society to another.

Accordingly, these anthropologists showed less interest in comparing cultures, generalizing about human nature, or discovering universal laws of cultural development, than in understanding particular cultures in those cultures' own terms. Such ethnographers and their students promoted the idea of &quot;[[cultural relativism]]&quot;, the view that one can only understand another person's beliefs and behaviors in the context of the culture in which he or she lived or lives.

In the early 20th century, socio-cultural anthropology developed in different forms in [[Europe]] and in the United States. European &quot;social anthropologists&quot; focused on observed social behaviors and on &quot;social structure&quot;, that is, on [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] among social [[role]]s (for example, husband and wife, or parent and child) and social [[institution]]s (for example, [[anthropology of religion|religion]], [[economic anthropology|economy]], and [[political anthropology|politics]]).

American &quot;cultural anthropologists&quot; focused on the ways people expressed their view of themselves and their world, especially in [[symbol]]ic forms, such as [[art]] and [[Mythology|myths]]. These two approaches frequently converged and generally complemented one another. For example, [[kinship]] and [[leadership]] function both as symbolic systems and as social institutions. Today almost all socio-cultural anthropologists refer to the work of both sets of predecessors, and have an equal interest in what people do and in what people say.

Ethnography dominates socio-cultural anthropology. Nevertheless, many contemporary socio-cultural anthropologists have rejected earlier models of ethnography as treating local cultures as bounded and isolated. These anthropologists continue to concern themselves with the distinct ways people in different locales experience and understand their [[personal life|lives]], but they often argue that one cannot understand these particular ways of life solely from a local perspective; they instead combine a focus on the local with an effort to grasp larger political, economic, and cultural frameworks that impact local lived realities. Notable proponents of this approach include [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[James Clifford]], [[George Marcus]], [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Michael Taussig]] and [[Eric Wolf]].

A growing trend in anthropological research and analysis is the use of multi-sited ethnography, discussed in George Marcus's article, &quot;Ethnography In/Of the World System: the Emergence of Multi-Sited Ethnography&quot;]. Looking at culture as embedded in macro-constructions of a global social order, multi-sited ethnography uses traditional methodology in various locations both spatially and temporally. Through this methodology, greater insight can be gained when examining the impact of world-systems on local and global communities.

Also emerging in multi-sited ethnography are greater interdisciplinary approaches to fieldwork, bringing in methods from cultural studies, media studies, science and technology studies, and others. In multi-sited ethnography, research tracks a subject across spatial and temporal boundaries. For example, a multi-sited ethnography may follow a &quot;thing,&quot; such as a particular commodity, as it is transported through the networks of global capitalism.

Multi-sited ethnography may also follow ethnic groups in [[diaspora]], stories or rumours that appear in multiple locations and in multiple time periods, metaphors that appear in multiple ethnographic locations, or the biographies of individual people or groups as they move through space and time. It may also follow conflicts that transcend boundaries. An example of multi-sited ethnography is [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]]'s work on the international black market for the trade of human organs. In this research, she follows organs as they are transferred through various legal and illegal networks of capitalism, as well as the rumours and urban legends that circulate in impoverished communities about child kidnapping and organ theft.

Sociocultural anthropologists have increasingly turned their investigative eye on to [[western culture|&quot;Western&quot; culture]]. For example, [[Philippe Bourgois]] won the [[Margaret Mead Award]] in 1997 for ''In Search of Respect'', a study of the entrepreneurs in a Harlem crack-den. Also growing more popular are ethnographies of professional communities, such as laboratory researchers, [[Wall Street]] investors, law firms, or [[information technology]] (IT) computer employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://mcb/161/1995/00000008/00000003/art00003&amp;unc=  Dissertation Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conversion of units''' refers to '''conversion factors''' between different [[units of measurement]] for the same [[quantity]].

==Techniques==
=== Process ===

The process of conversion depends on the specific situation and the intended purpose.  This may be governed by regulation, [[contract]],  [[Technical specifications]] or other published [[Technical standard|standard]]s.  Engineering judgment may include such factors as:
* The [[precision and accuracy]] of measurement and the associated [[uncertainty of measurement]]
* The statistical [[confidence interval]] or [[tolerance interval]] of the initial measurement
* The number of [[significant figures]] of the measurement
* The intended use of the measurement including the [[engineering tolerance]]s

Some conversions from one system of units to another need to be exact, without increasing or decreasing the precision of the first measurement.  This is sometimes called ''soft conversion''.  It does not involve changing  the physical configuration of the item being measured.

By contrast, a ''hard conversion'' or an ''adaptive conversion''  may not be exactly equivalent.  It changes the measurement to convenient and workable numbers and units in the new system. It sometimes involves a slightly different configuration, or size substitution, of the item.  [[Real versus nominal value|Nominal values]] are sometimes allowed and used.

=== Multiplication Factors ===
Conversion between units in the [[metric system]] can be discerned by their [[SI prefix|prefixes]] (for example, 1 kilogram = 1000&amp;nbsp;grams, 1 milligram = 0.001&amp;nbsp;grams) and are thus not listed in this article. Exceptions are made if the unit is commonly known by another name (for example, 1 micron = 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; metre).

=== Table Ordering ===
Within each table, the units are listed alphabetically, and the [[SI]] units (base or derived) are highlighted.

== Tables of conversion factors ==
This article gives lists of conversion factors for each of a number of physical quantities, which are listed in the index. For each physical quantity, a number of different units (some only of historical interest) are shown and expressed in terms of the corresponding SI unit.

===Mass===
Notes:
* See [[Weight]] for detail of mass/weight distinction and conversion.
* In this table, the unit ''gee'' is used to denote [[standard gravity]] in order to avoid confusion with the &quot;g&quot; symbol for grams.
* In [[physics]], the [[pound (mass)|pound of mass]] is sometimes written '''lbm''' to distinguish it from the [[pound-force]] ('''lbf'''). It should not be read as the mongrel unit &quot;pound metre&quot;.

Often, information entropy is measured in [[Claude Shannon|shannon]]s, whereas the (discrete) storage space of digital devices is measured in bits. Thus, uncompressed redundant data occupy more than one bit of storage per shannon of information entropy. The multiples of a bit listed above are usually used with this meaning. Other times the bit is used as a measure of information entropy and is thus a synonym of shannon.

Although the definitions for sievert (Sv) and gray (Gy) would seem to indicate that they measure the same quantities, this is not the case. The effect of receiving a certain dose of radiation (given as Gy) is variable and depends on many factors, thus a new unit was needed to denote the biological effectiveness of that dose on the body; this is known as the equivalent dose and is shown in Sv. The general relationship between absorbed dose and equivalent dose can be represented as
:''H = Q · D''
where ''H'' is the equivalent dose, ''D'' is the absorbed dose, and ''Q'' is a dimensionless quality factor. Thus, for any quantity of ''D'' measured in Gy, the numerical value for ''H'' measured in Sv may be different.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/ | title=[[Comité international des poids et mesures]], 2002, Recommendation 2 | accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software tools ==
Home and office computers come with converters in bundled spreadsheet applications or can access free converters via the Internet. Units and measurements can be easily converted using these tools, but only if the units are explicitly defined and the conversion is compatible (e.g., cmHg to kPa).

===General commercial sources of converters===
*[[calculator|Advanced electronic calculators]] have unit-conversion functionality.
*[[Spreadsheet]] programs usually provide conversion [[function (computer science)|function]]s or [[formula]]s or the user can write their own.
*Commercial mathematical, scientific and technical applications often include converters.

A '''city''' is a relatively large and permanent [[human settlement|settlement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodall&quot;&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuper and Kuper&quot;&gt;Kuper, A. and Kuper, J., eds (1996) ''The Social Science Encyclopedia''. 2nd edition. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a [[town]] within general [[English language]] meanings, many cities have a particular [[administrative]], [[legal]], or [[historical]] status based on local law.

For example, an article of incorporation approved by the local [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] distinguishes a city government from a town in [[Massachusetts]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] and parts of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a city is traditionally a settlement with a [[royal charter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodall&quot;/&gt; Historically, in Europe, a city was understood to be an urban settlement with a [[cathedral]].

Cities generally have complex systems for [[sanitation]], [[utilities]], land usage, [[house|housing]], and [[transportation]]. The concentration of development greatly facilitates interaction between people and [[businesses]], benefiting both parties in the process. A big city or metropolis usually has associated [[suburb]]s and [[exurb]]s.  Such cities are usually associated with [[metropolitan areas]] and [[urban areas]], creating numerous business [[commuter]]s traveling to urban centers of [[employment]].  Once a city expands far enough to reach another city, this region can be deemed a [[conurbation]] or [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]].

==Origins==
There is insufficient evidence to assert what conditions in history gave rise to the first cities. Theorists, however, have speculated on appropriate pre-conditions and have identified some basic mechanisms that might have been the important driving forces.

===Theories===
[[File:Sunset over florence 1.jpg|thumb|[[Florence]], [[Italy]]]]

[[File:Panorama Paris December 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Paris]], [[France]]]]

====Agricultural primacy====
The conventional view holds that cities first formed after the [[Neolithic revolution]].  The Neolithic revolution brought [[agriculture]], which made denser human populations possible, thereby supporting city development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Bairoch|1988| pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of farming encouraged hunter-gatherers to abandon nomadic lifestyles and to settle near others who lived by  agricultural production.  The increased population-density encouraged by farming and the increased output of food per unit of land created conditions that seem more suitable for city-like activities.  In his book, ''Cities and Economic Development'', [[Paul Bairoch]] takes up this position in his argument that agricultural activity appears necessary before true cities can form.

According to [[Vere Gordon Childe]], for a settlement to qualify as a city, it must have enough surplus of raw materials to support trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Pacione|2001| p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bairoch points out that, due to sparse population densities that would have persisted in pre-Neolithic, hunter-gatherer societies, the amount of land that would be required to produce enough food for subsistence and trade for a large population would make it impossible to control the flow of trade. To illustrate this point, Bairoch offers an example: &quot;Western Europe during the pre-Neolithic, [where] the density must have been less than 0.1 person per square kilometer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bairoch 1988 13&quot;&gt;{{Harv |Bairoch|1988| p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this population density as a base for calculation, and allotting 10% of food towards surplus for trade and assuming that city dwellers do no farming, he calculates that &quot;in order to maintain a city with a population of 1,000, and without taking the cost of transportation into account, an area of 100,000 square kilometers would have been required. When the cost of transportation is taken into account, the figure rises to 200,000 square kilometers...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bairoch 1988 13&quot;/&gt;  Bairoch noted that this is roughly the size of [[Great Britain]].

====Urban primacy====
In her book ''The Economy of Cities'', [[Jane Jacobs]] claims that city-formation preceded the birth of agriculture. Jacobs does not lend her theory to any strict definition of a city, but her account suggestively contrasts what could only be thought of as primitive city-like activity to the activity occurring in neighboring hunter-gatherer settlements. To argue this view, Jacobs suggests a fictitious scenario where a valued natural resource leads to primitive economic activity - she takes [[obsidian]] as an example.  The stock of obsidian is controlled and traded with neighboring hunting groups.  Hunters who do not control the stock travel great distances to barter what they have, valuing obsidian because it &quot;makes the sharpest tools to be had&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs 1969 23&quot;&gt;{{Harv |Jacobs|1969| p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This activity brings more people to the center as jobs are created and goods are being traded.  Among the goods traded are seeds of all different sorts, stored in unprecedented combinations.  In various ways, some accidental, the seeds are sown, and the variation in yields are observed more readily than they would be in the wild. The seeds that yield the most grain are noticed and trading them begins to occur within the city.  Owing to this local dealing, the city dwellers find that their grain yields are the best, and for the first time make deliberate and conscious selection.  The choices made now become purposeful, and they are made among various strains of already cultivated crosses, and their crosses, mutants and hybrids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs 1969 23&quot;/&gt;

===Causes of establishment===
[[File:Bucharest-Skyline-01.jpg|thumb|[[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]]]
Theorists have suggested many possible reasons for why people would have originally decided to come together to form dense populations. In his book ''City Economics'', Brendan O'Flaherty asserts &quot;Cities could persist—as they have for thousands of years—only if their advantages offset the disadvantages&quot; {{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| p=12}}. O'Flaherty illustrates two similar attracting advantages known as [[increasing returns to scale]] and [[economies of scale]], which are concepts normally associated with [[firm]]s.  Their applications are seen in more basic economic systems as well.  Increasing returns to scale occurs when &quot;doubling all inputs more than doubles the output [and] an activity has economies of scale if doubling output less than doubles cost&quot; {{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| pp=572–573}}. To offer an example of these concepts, O'Flaherty makes use of &quot;one of the oldest reasons why cities were built: military protection&quot; {{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| p=13}}. In this example, the inputs are anything that would be used for protection (e.g.: a wall) and the output is the area protected and everything of value contained in it. O'Flaherty then asks that we suppose that the area to be protected is square and each hectare inside it has the same value of protection. The advantage is expressed as: {{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| p=13}}

:(1) '''&lt;math&gt;O = s^2&lt;/math&gt;''', where O is the output (area protected) and s stands for the length of a side. This equation shows that output is proportional to the square of the length of a side.

The inputs depend on the length of the perimeter:

:(2) '''&lt;math&gt;I = 4s&lt;/math&gt;''', where I stands for the quantity of inputs. This equation shows that the perimeter is proportional to the length of a side.

So there are increasing returns to scale:

:(3) '''&lt;math&gt;O = I^2/16&lt;/math&gt;'''. This equation (solving for '''&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;''' in (1) and substituting in (2)) shows that with twice the inputs, you produce quadruple the output.

Also, economies of scale:

:(4) '''&lt;math&gt;I = 4O^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;'''. This equation (solving for '''&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;''' in equation (3)) shows that the same output requires less input.

&quot;Cities, then, economize on protection, and so protection against marauding barbarian armies is one reason why people have come together to live in cities...&quot; {{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| p=13}}.

Similarly, &quot;Are Cities Dying?&quot;, a paper by Edward L. Glaeser, delves into similar reasons for city formation: reduced transport costs for goods, people, and ideas.  Discussing the benefits of proximity, Glaeser claims that if you double a city size, workers have a ten-percent increase in earnings.  Glaeser furthers his argument by  stating that bigger cities do not pay more for equal productivity than in a smaller city, so it is reasonable to assume that workers become more productive if they move to a city twice the size as they initially worked in. However, the workers do not benefit much from the ten-percent wage increase, because it is recycled back into the higher cost of living in a bigger city.  They do gain other benefits from living in cities, though.

==Geography==
[[File:Haarlem-City-Map-1550.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Haarlem]], the [[Netherlands]], of around 1550. The city is completely surrounded by a city wall and defensive canal. The square shape was inspired by Jerusalem.]]

Modern city planning has seen many different schemes for how a city should look. The most commonly seen pattern is the [[grid plan|grid]], used for thousands of years in [[China]], independently invented by [[Alexander the Great]]'s city-planner [[Dinocrates of Rhodes]] and favoured by the Romans, while almost a rule in parts of [[pre-Columbian America]]. [[Derry]] begun in 1613, was the first [[planned city]] in Ireland, with the walls being completed five years later. The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was thought to be a good design for defence. The grid pattern was widely copied in the colonies of British North America.

The Ancient Greeks often gave their colonies around the Mediterranean a grid plan. One of the best examples is the city of [[Priene]]. This city had different specialized districts, much as is seen in modern city planning today. Fifteen centuries earlier, the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] was using grids in such cities as [[Mohenjo-Daro]]. In medieval times there was evidence of a preference for linear planning. Good examples are the cities established by various rulers in the south of France and city expansions in old Dutch and Flemish cities.

Grid plans were popular among planners in the 19th century, particularly after the redesign of Paris. They cut through the meandering, organic streets that followed old paths. The United States imposed grid plans in new territories and towns, as the [[American West]] was rapidly established, in places such as [[Salt Lake City]] and [[San Francisco]].

Other forms may include a radial structure, in which main roads converge on a central point.  This was often a historic form, the effect of successive growth over long time with concentric traces of [[town wall]]s and [[citadel]]s.  In more recent history, such forms were supplemented by ring-roads that take [[traffic]] around the outskirts of a town. Many Dutch cities are structured this way: a central square surrounded by concentric canals. Every city expansion would imply a new circle (canals together with town walls). In cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Haarlem]], and also [[Moscow]], this pattern is still clearly visible.

==History==
{{See|Historical cities|List of largest cities throughout history}}
Towns and cities have a long history, although opinions vary on whether any particular [[Ancient history|ancient]] settlement can be considered to be a city. A city formed as central places of trade for the benefit of the members living in close proximity to others facilitates interaction of all kinds. These interactions generate both positive and negative externalities between others' actions.  Benefits include reduced transport costs, exchange of ideas, sharing of natural resources, large local markets, and later in their development, amenities such as [[running water]] and [[sewage]] disposal.  Possible costs would include higher rate of crime, higher mortality rates, higher cost of living, worse [[pollution]], traffic and high commuting times. Cities will grow when the benefits of proximity between people and firms are higher than the cost.

The first true towns are sometimes considered to be large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power was centralized. In 1950 [[Gordon Childe]] attempted to define a historic city with 10 general metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
# Size and density of the population should be above normal.
# Differentiation of the population. Not all residents grow their own food, leading to specialists.
# Payment of taxes to a deity or king.
# Monumental public buildings.
# Those not producing their own food are supported by the king.
# Systems of recording and practical science.
# A system of writing.
# Development of symbolic art.
# Trade and import of raw materials.
# Specialist craftsmen from outside the kin-group.
This categorisation is descriptive, and it is used as a general touchstone when considering ancient cities, although not all have each of its characteristics.

One characteristic that can be used to distinguish a small city from a large town is organized government. A town accomplishes common goals through informal agreements between neighbors or the leadership of a chief. A city has professional administrators, regulations, and some form of taxation (food and other necessities or means to trade for them) to feed the government workers. The governments may be based on heredity, religion, military power, work projects (such as canal building), food distribution, land ownership, agriculture, commerce, manufacturing, finance, or a combination of those. Societies that live in cities are often called [[civilization]]s.

===Ancient times===
{{See|Cities of the Ancient Near East|polis|City-state}}
[[File:Ur-Nassiriyah.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ancient city of [[Ur]] of [[Sumer]], in present day Tell el-Mukayyar in [[Iraq]] is known to be one of the world's earliest [[сities]]]]

Early cities developed in a number of regions of the ancient world. [[Mesopotamia]] can claim the earliest cities, particularly [[Eridu]], [[Uruk]], and [[Ur]]. After Mesopotamia, this culture arose in Syria and Anatolia, as shown by the city of [[Çatalhöyük]] (7500-5700BC).  It is the largest Neolithic site found to date.  Although it has sometimes been claimed that ancient [[Egypt]] lacked urbanism, several types of urban settlements were found in ancient times.

The Indus Valley Civilization and ancient China are two other areas with major indigenous urban traditions.  Among the early Old World cities, [[Mohenjo-daro]] of the Indus Valley Civilization in present-day [[Pakistan]], existing from about 2600 BC to 1900 BC, was one of the largest, with an estimated population of 40,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998) ''Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization''. [[Oxford University Press]], Karachi and New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohenjo-daro and [[Harappa]], the large Indus capitals, were among the first cities to use grid plans, [[drainage]], [[flush toilet]]s, urban sanitation systems, and [[Sewage collection and disposal|sewage systems]]. At a somewhat later time, a distinctive urban tradition developed in the Khmer region of [[Cambodia]], where [[Angkor]] grew into one of the largest cities (in area) of the world.

In the ancient Americas, early urban traditions developed in [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Andes]]. Mesoamerica saw the rise of early urbanism in several cultural regions, including the [[Maya city|Preclassic Maya]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] of Oaxaca, and [[Teotihuacan]] in central Mexico. Later cultures such as the [[Aztec]] drew on these earlier urban traditions. In the Andes, the first urban centers developed in the [[Chavín culture|Chavin]] and [[Moche]] cultures, followed by major cities in the [[Huari culture|Huari]], [[Chimu]] and [[Inca]] cultures.

This roster of early urban traditions is notable for its diversity. Excavations at early urban sites show that some cities were sparsely populated political capitals, others were trade centers, and still other cities had a primarily religious focus. Some cities had large dense populations, whereas others carried out urban activities in the realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations. Theories that attempt to explain ancient urbanism by a single factor, such as economic benefit, fail to capture the range of variation documented by archaeologists (Smith 2002).

The growth of the population of ancient civilizations, the formation of ancient [[empire]]s concentrating political power, and the growth in commerce and manufacturing led to ever greater [[Capital (political)|capital]] cities and centres of commerce and industry, with [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]] of the [[Hellenistic civilization]], [[Pataliputra]] (now [[Patna]]) in India, [[Chang'an]] (now [[Xi'an]]) in China, [[Carthage]], ancient [[Rome]], its eastern successor Constantinople (later [[Istanbul]]), and successive Chinese, Indian and [[Muslim world|Muslim]] capitals approaching or exceeding the half-million population level.

Keith Hopkins estimates that ancient [[Rome]] had a population of about a million people by the end of the 1st century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''&quot;. PUQ. p.185. ISBN 2760515885&lt;/ref&gt; after growing continually during the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st centuries BC.&lt;ref name=cities&gt;On The Political Economy of the Roman Empire, Keith Hopkins&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria's population was also close to Rome's population at around the same time, the historian Rostovtzeff estimates a total population close to a million based on a census dated from 32 AD that counted 180,000 adult male citizens in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Rostovtzeff 1941: 1138-39)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar administrative, commercial, industrial and ceremonial centres emerged in other areas, most notably medieval [[Baghdad]], which according to [[George Modelski]], later became the first city to exceed a population of one million by the 8th century instead of Rome.&lt;ref name=Modelski/&gt;

While David Kessler and [[Peter Temin]] consider ancient Rome to be the largest city before 19th century London,&lt;ref&gt;The organization of the grain trade in the early Roman Empire, David Kessler and Peter Temin&lt;/ref&gt; George Modelski considers medieval Baghdad, with an estimated population of 1.2 million at its peak, to be the largest city before 19th century London.&lt;ref name=Modelski&gt;George Modelski, ''World Cities: –3000 to 2000'', Washington DC: FAROS 2000, 2003.

Agriculture was practiced in sub-Saharan [[Africa]] since the third millennium BC. Because of this, cities were able to develop as centers of non-agricultural activity. Exactly when this first happened is still a topic of archeological and historical investigation. Western scholarship has tended to focus on cities in Europe and Mesopotamia, but emerging archeological evidence indicates that urbanization occurred south of the Sahara well before the influence of Arab [[urban culture]]. The oldest sites documented thus far are from around 500 AD including Awdaghust, Kumbi-Saleh the ancient capital of Ghana, and Maranda a center located on a trade rout between Egypt and Gao.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://markuswiener.com/book_reviews.html?products_id=93&amp;products_name=History%20of%20African%20Cities%20South%20of%20the%20Sahara History of African Cities South of the Sahara]'' By Catherine Coquery

In the [[Late Roman Empire]], [[Late Antiquity#Cities|cities in Late Antiquity]] underwent transformations as the urban power base shrank and was transferred to the local [[bishop]]. Cities essentially disappeared, earliest in [[Roman Britain]] and [[Germania]] and latest in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and [[Visigothic Spain]].

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Nuremberga.png|thumb|This woodcut shows [[Nuremberg]] as a prototype of a flourishing and independent city in the 15th century]]

During the [[European Middle Ages]], a town was as much a political entity as a collection of houses. City residence brought freedom from customary rural obligations to lord and community: ''&quot;[[Stadtluft macht frei]]&quot;'' (&quot;City air makes you free&quot;) was a saying in Germany. In [[Continental Europe]] cities with a legislature of their own were not unheard of, the laws for towns as a rule other than for the countryside, the lord of a town often being another than for surrounding land. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]] some cities had no other lord than the emperor. In Italy [[medieval commune]]s had quite a statelike power.

In exceptional cases like [[Venice]], [[Genoa]] or [[Lübeck]], cities themselves became powerful states, sometimes taking surrounding areas under their control or establishing extensive maritime empires. Similar phenomena existed elsewhere, as in the case of [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]], which enjoyed a considerable autonomy in late medieval Japan.

===Early modern===
[[File:Wojciech_Gerson_-_Gdańsk_in_the_XVII_century.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gdańsk]] in the 17th century]]
While the [[city-state]]s, or [[polis|poleis]], of the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea]] languished from the 16th century, Europe's larger capitals benefited from the growth of commerce following the emergence of an [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade. By the early 19th century, [[London]] had become the largest city in the world with a population of over a million, while Paris rivaled the well-developed regionally traditional capital cities of Baghdad, Beijing, Istanbul and [[Kyoto]].
During the Spanish colonization of the [[Americas]] the old Roman city concept was extensively used. Cities were founded in the middle of the newly conquered territories, and were bound to several laws about administration, finances and urbanism.

Most towns remained far smaller places, so that in 1500 only some two dozen places in the world contained more than 100,000 inhabitants: as late as 1700 there were fewer than forty, a figure which would rise thereafter to 300 in 1900. A small city of the early modern period might contain as few as 10,000 inhabitants, a town far fewer still.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Industrial age===
[[Image:Slum in Glasgow, 1871.jpg|thumb|[[Glasgow]] [[slum]] in 1871]]
The growth of modern [[industry]] from the late 18th century onward led to massive [[urbanization]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from [[rural area|rural]] communities into urban areas. In the United States from 1860 to 1910, the invention of railroads reduced transportation costs, and large manufacturing centers began to emerge, thus allowing migration from rural to city areas. However, cities during those periods of time were deadly places to live in, due to health problems resulting from contaminated water and air, and communicable diseases. In the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s [[Cities in the great depression|cities were hard hit by unemployment]], especially those with a base in heavy industry. In the U.S. urbanization rate increased forty to eighty percent during 1900-1990. Today the world's population is slightly over half urban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ncsu.edu/releases/2007/may/104.html |title=Mayday 23: World Population Becomes More Urban Than Rural |publisher=News.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-02-07}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; with millions still streaming annually into the growing cities of [[Asia]], Africa and [[Latin America]]. There has also been a shift to suburbs, perhaps to avoid crime and traffic, which are two costs of living in an urban area.

==External effects==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2007}}

Modern cities are known for creating their own [[microclimate]]s. This is due to the large clustering of heat absorbent surfaces that heat up in [[sunlight]] and that channel [[rain]]water into underground ducts.

[[Waste]] and sewage are two major problems for cities, as is [[air pollution]] coming from various forms of combustion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aklung.org/air-quality/indoor-air-quality/ |title=Indoor Air Quality — American Lung Association of Alaska |publisher=Aklung.org |date= |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including fireplaces, wood or coal-burning stoves, other heating systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsminer.com/news/2008/aug/20/epa-put-fairbanks-air-pollution-problem-list/ |title=Newsminer.com; EPA to put Fairbanks on air pollution problem list |publisher=Newsminer.com |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[internal combustion engine]]s. The impact of cities on places elsewhere, be it hinterlands or places far away, is considered in the notion of [[Ecological Footprint|city footprinting]] (''ecological footprint'').
Other negative external effects include health consequences such as communicable diseases, crime, and high traffic and commuting times. Cities cause more interaction with more people than rural areas, thus a higher probability to contracting contagious diseases. However, many inventions such as inoculations, vaccines, and water filtration systems have also lowered health concerns. [[Crime]] is also a concern in the cities. Studies have shown that crime rates in cities are higher and the chance of punishment after getting caught is lower. In cases such as burglary, the higher concentration of people in cities create more items of higher value worth the risk of crime. The high concentration of people also makes using auto mobiles inconvenient and pedestrian traffic is more prominent in metropolitan areas than a rural or suburban one.

Cities also generate positive external effects. The close physical proximity facilitates [[knowledge spillover]]s, helping people and firms exchange information and generate new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/files/br/brq401gc.pdf |title=Knowldege Spillovers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thicker labor market allows for better skill matching between firms and individuals. Another positive external effect of cities comes from the diverse social opportunities created when people of different backgrounds are brought together. Larger cities typically offer a wider variety of social interests and activities, letting people of all backgrounds find something they can be involved in.

Cities may however also have a positive influence on the environment. UN [[Habitat]] stated in its reports that city living can be the best solution for dealing with the rising population numbers (and thus still be a good approach on dealing with overpopulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6244496.stm |title=UN Habitat calling urban living 'a good thing |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because cities concentrate human activity into one place, making the environmental damage on other places smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michellenijhuis.com/ |title=National Geographic Magazine; Special report 2008: Changing Climate (Village Green-article by |publisher=Michelle Nijhuis |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letting the cities have a positive influence however, can only be achieved if [[urban planning]] is improved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2523&amp;catid=5&amp;typeid=6&amp;subMenuId=0 |title=Un Habitat calling to rethink urban planning |publisher=Un-Habitat. |date= |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the city services are properly maintained.

==Distinction between cities and towns==

The difference between ''towns'' and ''cities'' is differently understood in different parts of the world. Indeed, many languages other than English often use a single word for both concepts (German ''[[:de:Stadt|Stadt]]'', Dutch ''[[:nl:stad|stad]]'', Swedish ''[[:sv:stad|stad]]'', Danish/Norwegian ''[[:da:by|by]]'', etc.). Iberian languages typically use a three-way designation (Catalan: ''“[[:ca:Poble (localitat)|poble]]”'', ''“[[:ca:Vila|vila]]”'', ''“[[:ca:Ciutat|ciutat]]”''; Galician: ''“[[:gl:Aldea|aldea]]”'', ''“[[:gl:Vila|vila]]”'', ''“[[:gl:Cidade|cidade]]”''; Portuguese: ''“[[:pt:Aldeia|aldeia]]”'', ''“[[:pt:Vila|vila]]”'', ''“[[:pt:Cidade|cidade]]”''; Spanish: ''“[[:es:Pueblo (población rural)|pueblo]]”'', ''“[[:es:Villa (población)|villa]]”'', ''“[[:es:Ciudad|ciudad]]”''—respectively “village”, “town”, “city”); Italian: “''[[:it:Villaggio|villaggio]]”'', &quot;''[[:it:Paese (geografia)|paese]]''&quot; ''“[[:it:Città|città]]”''—respectively “village”, &quot;town&quot;, “city”; , but other [[Romance languages]] don’t (French: ''“[[:fr:Village|village]]”'', ''“[[:fr:Ville|ville]]”'').{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Even within the English-speaking world there is no one standard definition of a city: the term may be used either for a town possessing city status; for an urban locality exceeding an arbitrary population size; for a town dominating other towns with particular regional economic or administrative significance. In British English ''city'' is reserved for very large settlements, smaller ones are called town or [[village]]. In the US ''city'' is used for much smaller settlements.

Although ''city'' can refer to an [[agglomeration]] including suburban and satellite areas, the term is not usually applied to a conurbation (cluster) of ''distinct'' urban places, nor for a wider [[metropolitan area]] including more than one city, each acting as a focus for parts of the area. And the word &quot;town&quot; (also &quot;downtown&quot;) may mean the center of the city.

===Australia===
[[File:City of sydney from the balmain wharf dusk cropped2.jpg|thumb|250px|Sydney is Australia's largest city]]

In Australia, ''city'' in its broadest terms refers simply to any town that is large enough. Narrower usage can refer to a [[local government area]], or colloquially to the [[central business district]] (CBD) of a large urban area.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} For instance the City of South Perth&lt;ref name=&quot;perth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southperth.wa.gov.au|title=City of South Perth|accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a local government area within the wider urban area known as [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], commonly called Australia's fourth largest city. Residents of Sydney might speak of travelling to the CBD as &quot;going to the city&quot;. Australia's largest cities are Sydney, [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], Perth and [[Adelaide]].

In official designations, a city or rural city is the style of some local government areas, whereas a town is a kind of [[suburbs and localities (Australia)|bounded locality]] with an urban lifestyle, commercial activities and social services, providing for both the town and surrounding region.&lt;ref name=&quot;dse-name-guidelines&quot;&gt;Department of Sustainability and the Environment. (2004, October). [http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenptm.nsf/childdocs/-0EE318415F9F866DCA257522001C50E1-5BAB1485E530B05ECA257522001C973F?open Guidelines for Geographic Names Victoria: Principles, policies, procedures].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, cities contrast with shires whereas towns contrast with suburbs (in the Australian sense) and rural districts or townships (i.e. small settlements); a city may contain many towns and a town may be in more than one city. A &quot;provincial city&quot; is any urban area (other than the capital city) that is a combination of multiple suburbs—no matter the status of its LGA. Approximately, a city can be understood as an urban area which is divided into suburbs, and a town is an urban area which is not divided into suburbs.  While almost all Australian cities have a population of over 10,000, definition based on population is often inconsistent, for example [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]] in Victoria with less than this that are officially regarded as a cities, though [[Bacchus Marsh]], also in Victoria, with double the population is considered a town.

===Azerbaijan===
Azerbaijan recognizes 69 urban settlements as cities. The largest, with just over two million inhabitants, is the capital [[Baku]].
See: [[List of cities in Azerbaijan]]

===Belarus===
[[File:Belarus-Minsk-Prytytski Square-East Part.jpg|right|thumb|[[Minsk]], the most populous city in Belarus]]
In the [[Belarus]]ian language two words mean &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot; - &quot;горад&quot; (horad) and &quot;места&quot; (miesta), where &quot;horad&quot; translated as &quot;fortifying miesta&quot;, or &quot;stronghold&quot;. The term &quot;miesta&quot; translated as &quot;town without fortifying&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Гісторыя Беларусі. Энцыклапедыя. Том 5&lt;/ref&gt; and meaning modern town. In the contemporary Belarusian language term &quot;horad&quot; is used more often, in spite of lexical inexactitude of this term. The smallest population of a city of Belaruse officially not named &quot;horad&quot; or &quot;miesta&quot; it is used a name &quot;urban-type settlement&quot; (&quot;паселішча гарадскога тыпу&quot;, &quot;paselyscha haradskoha typu&quot;) and also (informal or with historical sense) &quot;мястэчка&quot; (&quot;miastechka&quot;).

===Brazil===
[[File:Aguas de Sao Pedro Landscape 02.jpg|thumb|220px|The town of [[Aguas de Sao Pedro]] is the smallest city in [[Brazil]]]]
[[Brazil]] is divided into [[States of Brazil|states]] ({{lang-pt|estados}}) and these into [[municipality|municipalities]] (''municípios''); there is no [[county]] or equivalent level. Brazilian law defines a &quot;city&quot; (''cidade'') as the urban seat of a municipality and establishes no difference between cities and towns; all it takes for an urban area to be legally called a &quot;city&quot; is to be the seat of a municipality, and some of them are semi-rural settlements with a very small population. Municipalities always have the same name as their corresponding cities, and the terms ''município'' and ''cidade'' are often used interchangeably, even by the government itself, although this is not technically correct. However, except for the [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]] (the area of the national capital city, [[Brasília]]), which has special status and no municipalities, all land in Brazil is in the territory of some municipality. Thus, even in the country's remotest wilderness areas, one is still technically under the jurisdiction of a &quot;city,&quot; or at least of its government. Brazil's largest cities are [[Sao Paulo|São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], both located on the heavily urbanized South East coast.

[[File:Plovdiv Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|[[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]], the oldest city in [[Europe]]{{fact|date=January 2011}}]]
In [[Bulgaria]] the word &quot;град&quot; (grad) means city or town, although the word &quot;градче&quot; (gradche) can be used for small cities or towns.
The Council of Ministers has the right to give or withdraw the status of the territorial unit and the president sets the name. In 2005 it was introduced that in order for a village to become a city it has to have developed social and technical infrastructure and have a population of more than 3500 people (in the resort cities - more than 1000).

There are settlements with a city status for historical and cultural reasons ([[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]] with a population of 358), or for political reasons ([[Pravets]], [[Kableshkovo]], etc.).

===Canada===
{{Main|List of cities in Canada|Local government in Canada}}
[[File:Toronto at Dusk -a.jpg|thumb|[[Toronto]] is the largest city in [[Canada]]]]
In Canada, the granting of city status is handled by the individual [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]]. Therefore, city status definitions and criteria vary widely across the country. In [[British Columbia]] and [[Saskatchewan]], towns can become cities after they reach a population of 5,000 people,&lt;ref name=BCcity&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20L%20--/Local%20Government%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%20323/00_Act/96323_03.xml#section7 | title=Local Government Act, Part 2 – Incorporation of Municipalities | publisher=British Columbia Queen's Printer | accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SKcity&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/Statutes/Statutes/c11-1.pdf | title=The Cities Act, Part IV – Incorporation of Cities | publisher=Saskatchewan Queen's Printer | accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the threshold is 10,000 in [[Alberta]],&lt;ref name=ABcity&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=m26.cfm&amp;leg_type=Acts&amp;isbncln=9780779756155 | title=Municipal Government Act, Part 4 – Formation, Fundamental Changes and Dissolution | publisher=Alberta Queen's Printer | accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Brunswick]],&lt;ref name=NBcity&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gnb.ca/0062/PDF-acts/m-22.pdf | title=Municipalities Act | publisher=New Brunswick Queen's Printer | accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ontario]]. In [[Manitoba]], an urban municipality may not be named as a city unless its population meets or exceeds 7,500 people.&lt;ref name=MBcity&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/m225e.php | title=Municipalities Act, Part 2 – Formation, Fundamental Changes and Dissolution | publisher=Province of Manitoba | accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has numerous cities in the traditional sense of the term, Ontario also sometimes confers city status on primarily rural areas whose municipalities have been merged into a former county government. [[Nova Scotia]] has abolished the title of city altogether, with all local government taking place at the [[regional municipality]] level.

In [[Quebec]], there is no legal distinction between a city and a town, as both have the legal status of ''ville''. The province formerly differentiated between ''ville'' (town) and ''cité'' (city), but no longer does so.

===China (People's Republic of China)===
[[File:Shanghaiviewpic1.jpg|thumb|[[Shanghai]], [[Mainland China|China]]]]
A city is an administrative division in [[Mainland China]]. There are three types of cities:  a [[Direct-controlled municipality|municipality]] is a provincial-level division (e.g. Shanghai or Beijing);  a [[prefecture-level city]] is governed by [[Province (China)|provinces]] or [[Autonomous regions of the People's Republic of China|autonomous regions]]; and a [[county-level city]] is a sub-unit of a [[Political divisions of China#Prefecture level|prefecture-level]] administrative division.

There is a formal definition of ''city'' in China provided by the Chinese government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} For an urban area that can be defined as a ''city'', there should be at least 100,000 non-agricultural population.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} ''City'' with less than 200,000 non-agricultural population refers to a small city, 200,000-500,000 non-agricultural population is a medium city, 500,000-1,000,000 non-agricultural population is a large city and &gt;1,000,000 non-agricultural population is an extra-large city.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Also, there is an administrative definition based on the city boundary too and a city has its legal city limits.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In 1998, there were 668 cities in China. China has the largest urban population in the world although most of its population still lives in rural areas.

===Chile===
[[File:Stgo Abril.jpg|thumb|right|[[Santiago de Chile]], the largest city in Chile]]

[[Chile]]'s Department of National Statistics defines a city (''ciudad'' in Spanish) as an urban entity with more than 5,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;ine.cl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/territorio/division_politico_administrativa/pdf/dpa2001.pdf |title=DPA y CENSAL 2000 Political Divisions Chile National Institute of Statistics|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A town (''pueblo''), is an urban entity with 2,001 to 5,000 persons, however, if the area has some economic activity, the designation may include populations as small as 1,001. The department also defines Major Cities as provincial or regional capitals with populations of 100,001 to 500,000; Great Urban Areas which comprise several entities without any appreciable limit between them and populations which total between 500,001 and 1,000,000. A Metropolis is the largest urban area in the country where there are more than one million inhabitants. The &quot;urban entity&quot; is defined as a concentration of habitations with more than 2,000 persons living in them, or more than 1,000 persons if more than half of those persons are in some way gainfully employed. [[Tourist]] and [[recreation]] areas with more than 250 living units may be considered as urban areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ine.cl&quot;/&gt;

===Egypt===

{{Main|List of cities in Egypt}}

In [[Egypt]] the word &quot;مدينة&quot; (''madina'') means city or town &amp; there is no distinction between a town and a city.
[[File:Downtowncairo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Cairo]], Capital of [[Egypt]]]]
===France===

The French word for city is the same for [[town]]: it's ''ville'' for both of them. In [[France]], there is no distinction between a town and a city. There is only a difference between a city or town (''ville''), a [[village]] (''village'') which is smaller (around 50 to 2000 inhabitants), and a [[hamlet]] (''hameau'') which doesn't have more than around 50 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/default.asp?page=definitions/ville.htm&lt;/ref&gt; French people usually make a difference between a city that has more than around 10000 inhabitants (city) and one that has less than around 10000 (town). Anyway, it is very subjective. The number of inhabitants that is supposed to have a city or a village to be considered as one may vary among individuals. But they usually say ''petite ville'' (literally &quot;small city&quot;, or town) for the littlest city, and ''ville'' (city) for the bigger ones. The term ''métropole'' ([[metropolis]]) or ''grande ville'' (big city) can be used for the biggest cities.

===Germany===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Essen]] --&gt;
[[File:Über den Dächern von Berlin.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin]], the largest city in [[Germany]]]]
The German word for both &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; is ''Stadt'', while a city with more than 100,000 inhabitants is called a ''Großstadt'' (big city). On the other hand, most towns are communities belonging to a ''Landkreis'' (county or rural district), but there are some cities, usually with at least 50,000 inhabitants, that are counties by themselves (''kreisfreie Städte''). In 2006, there were 82 cities with more than 100.000 inhabitants in Germany. Germany's largest cities are Berlin, [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] while the largest urban area is in the Rhine-Ruhr region around such cities as [[Dortmund]], [[Duisburg]] and [[Essen]]. Berlin and Frankfurt are characterized as [[World city (disambiguation)|world cities]] or [[global city|global cities]].

===Italy===
[[File:Roma-piazza spagna di notte.jpg|thumb|[[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]

In Italy a city is called ''città'', a noun derived from the [[Latin]] ''civitas''. The status of &quot;city&quot; is granted by the President of the Republic with Presidential Decree Law. The largest and most important cities in the country, such as Rome, [[Milan]], [[Naples]] and [[Turin]], are called ''aree metropolitane'' (metropolitan areas) because they include several minor cities and towns in their areas. There is no population limit for a city. In the coat of arms, a golden crown tower stands for a city.

===Mexico===
[[File:Mexico-city-cathedral.jpg|thumb|[[Mexico City]] the largest metropolis of the country and one of the largest of the world.]]

The Mexican population is increasingly urban with close to 75% of the population living in cities. The five largest [[metropolitan areas of Mexico]] ([[Greater Mexico City]], [[Greater Guadalajara]], [[Greater Monterrey]], [[Greater Puebla]] and [[Greater Tijuana]]) are home to 30% of the country's population.

In 2004, a joint effort between CONAPO (National Council of Population), [[INEGI]] and the Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL) agreed to define metropolitan areas as either:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/metodologias/otras/zonas_met.pdf |title=Delimitación de las zonas metropolitanas de México |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The group of two or more municipalities in which a city with a population of at least 50,000 is located whose urban area extends over the limit of the municipality that originally contained the core city incorporating either physically or under its area of direct influence other adjacent predominantly urban municipalities all of which have a high degree of social and economic integration or are relevant for urban politics and administration.

*A single municipality in which a city of a population of at least one million is located and fully contained, (that is, it does not transcend the limits of a single municipality).

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] a city is called ''stad'', in common with other [[Germanic language]]s. In the Dutch language there is no distinction between town and city (both are stad). Small settlements are distinguished similarly as in English, being called dorp (village) or gehucht (hamlet). In medieval times, a settlement had to achieve [[city rights in the Netherlands|city-rights]] to be called a ''stad''. In modern times, there's no Dutch law saying what can be called a city or not, although generally places with more than 50,000 inhabitants are called a city. Settlements between 20,000 and 50,000 are most often called ''kleine stad'' or ''stadje'', which literally means &quot;little city&quot;. Settlements under about 20,000 may be called ''dorp'', &quot;village&quot;. The four largest cities are Amsterdam, [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], which together form the heart of the [[Randstad]] metropolitan conurbation.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Territorial authorities of New Zealand}}
[[File:Aukland night.jpg|thumb|left|[[Auckland]], the largest city in New Zealand]]

In New Zealand, a local authority may be proclaimed a city only if it meets certain criteria. Specifically, &quot;a city [...] must have a minimum population of 50,000, be predominantly urban in character, be a distinct entity and a major centre of activity within the region.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/about-2006-census/2006-census-definitions-questionnaires/definitions/c.aspx|title=Geographic Definitions, 2006 Census Information About Data, ''2006 Census'', Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early settlements, such as [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Christchurch, New Zealand|Christchurch]], were proclaimed cities by [[royal charter]]. Later, laws established criteria for a town to meet before it could officially be proclaimed a city, and these criteria have changed over time. {{As of|2010|11|01}}, 13 of New Zealand's 67 territorial authorities will be officially styled cities.

In informal usage, a city is simply a large, important urban centre, regardless of the composition of its local government (which may be a combination of one or more cities or districts). For example, [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], which purports to be the first city to see the sun, has a population of only 44,500 (2006), many of whom live outside the Gisborne urban area; it is, therefore, administered by a district council, not a city council. Some city councils, such as Christchurch and [[Dunedin, New Zealand|Dunedin]], also administer large areas of rural hinterland; the communities in these areas, such as the towns of [[Akaroa]] and [[Middlemarch, New Zealand|Middlemarch]], are not often thought of as part of their cities, except for certain legal and administrative purposes. Meanwhile, the cities of [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] and [[Auckland, New Zealand|Auckland]] are generally regarded as single cities, despite Wellington and, until recently, Auckland's being divided into several local government areas.

[[Statistics New Zealand]] has introduced the concept of ''main urban areas'', which have a minimum population of 30,000. The 16 main urban areas identified in 2001 and 2006 correspond closely to the urban settlements traditionally regarded as cities.

===Norway===
{{Main|List of cities in Norway}}
In [[Norway]] a city is called ''by'' and is derived from the Norse word býr meaning &quot;a place with many buildings&quot;. Both cities and towns can be referred to as ''by'', however in recent years, ''storby'' (lit. large city) has been used for larger settlements. The status of &quot;town&quot; is granted by the local authorities if a request for city status has been made and the area has a population of at least 5000. An area with a population of at least 50,000 is counted as a &quot;city&quot;. Since 1997, cities no longer have special administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/krd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20022003/stmeld-nr-31-2002-2003-/1.html?id=402980 |title=Storbymeldingen|format=|date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bjørvika Oslo.jpg|thumb|550px|center|[[Oslo]], the largest city in Norway]]

&lt;!-- Relevant? If the area has not been granted the status of a city it is called ''tettsted'' or ''bygd''. The terms differ in that a ''tettsted'' has more concentrated population than a ''bygd''. A ''bygd'' is in many ways similar to a village, but the Norwegian term for village, ''landsby'', is not used for places in Norway.--&gt;

===Pakistan===
[[File:Karachi downtown.jpg|thumb|[[Karachi]] is the largest city in [[Pakistan]]]]
{{main|List of cities in Pakistan}}
There has traditionally been no formal distinction between &quot;City&quot; or &quot;Town&quot; in Pakistan, although informal distinctions and status has been as common as in any other country. Several cities in what is now Pakistan were traditionally recognized as cities; in some cases for centuries; [[Lahore]], [[Multan]] and [[Peshawar]] are examples. After independence and the rapid increase in population that followed caused [[Karachi]] to become the nation's largest city, while the rapid industrialisation in the north of the country resulted in new towns increasing greatly in population; such as [[Sialkot]] and [[Faisalabad]],these two cities grow in population also because of agriculture,social development and high rate of natural increase, whilst [[Rawalpindi]], traditionally a garrison town became a large city due to the decision to build a new capital nearby. In 2001, a new Act formalised the distinction, by granting the 10 largest cities and metropolitan areas the status of [[City Districts of Pakistan|city district]], which for the first time gave areas the status of cities.

===Philippines===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
[[File:Makati skyline j 0 n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Makati]] The Financial Capital of the Philippines]]
[[File:Metro Manila in 2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Makati]] Metro Manila]]

Congress is the lone legislative entity that can incorporate cities. [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan|Provincial]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan|municipal councils]] can pass resolutions indicating a desire to have a certain area (usually an already-existing municipality or a cluster of barangays) declared a city after the requirements for becoming a city are met. As per Republic Act No. 9009, these requirements include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9009.html Republic Act No. 9009], Chan-Robles Law Library.&lt;/ref&gt;
* locally generated income of at least [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 100 million (based on constant prices in the year 2000) for the last two consecutive years, as certified by the Department of Finance, '''AND'''
* a population of 150,000 or more, as certified by the [[National Statistics Office]] (NSO); '''OR''' a contiguous territory of 100 square kilometers, as certified by the [[Bureau of Lands Management (Philippines)|Land Management Bureau]], with contiguity not being a requisite for areas that are on two or more [[island]]s.

===Poland===
[[File:Warsaw7ob.jpg|thumb|right|[[Warsaw]] is the largest city in Poland]]

In [[Poland]] the word ''miasto'' serves for both town and city. Miasto is the term applied purely on the basis of the administrative decision of the central government, and specifically means either:
* a county ([[gmina]] or [[powiat]]) with a city charter;
* a city within a county, created by granting a city charter to a smaller town within a county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.pl/gus/definicje_PLK_HTML.htm?id=POJ-4689.htm |title=Definition of city in Poland |language={{pl icon}} |publisher=Stat.gov.pl |date= |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These formal distinctions may differentiate larger towns from smaller ones (such as status as a separate powiat, or the conferring of the title ''prezydent'' on the [[mayor]] rather than ''burmistrz''), but none of these is universally recognized as equivalent to the English city/town distinction.

Poland's largest cities are: [[Warsaw]], [[Łódź]], [[Kraków]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Poznań]], [[Wrocław]], [[Toruń]], [[Lublin]].

===Portugal===

As in Spanish, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] there is a traditional distinction between cities—''cidades''—and towns—''vilas''. The difference is defined by law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.povt.qren.pt/tempfiles/20080213151143moptc.pdf |title=Law n.° 11/82 (Lei das designações e determinação de categoria das povoações), of June, 2nd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a city must have:
* at least 8,000 electors (more or less 10,000 inhabitants)
* at least half of the following services:
** hospital
** pharmacy
** fire department
** theatre / cultural house
** museum
** library
** hotel services
** basic and secondary schools
** public transport
** gardens / urban parks
In special cases, some towns may be granted the status of city if they possess historical, cultural or architectonic importance.

The Portuguese urban settlements [[heraldry]] reflects the difference between cities, towns and villages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/pt-_m.html#rules |title=Flags of the World |publisher=Crwflags.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[coat of arms]] of a city bearing a crown with 5 towers, the coat of arms of a town bearing a crown with 4 towers, while the coat of arms of a village bears a crown with 3 towers. This difference between cities, towns and villages is still in use in other Portuguese speaking countries, but in Brazil is no longer in use.

There is also the notion of “'''''Grande Área Metropolitana'''''”. There are two main metropolitan areas—Lisbon (the capital), in the centre of the country and [[Porto]] in the North. [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]] has a population that exceeds 3 million. [[Greater Metropolitan Area of Porto]] has over 2 million inhabitants, although it is part of the Portuguese Northwestern Agglomeration that has, also, about 3 million inhabitants.

===Romania===
Cities and towns in Romania can have the status either of ''[[municipiu]]'' or ''[[oraş]]''. Smaller villages that do not apply to the city status are called ''comuna''/''comune'' (f., sing./pl.) and ''sat''/''sate'' (m., sing./pl.). By 2001 law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cdep.ro/pls/legis/legis_pck.htp_act_text?idt=28862 | title = Legea nr.351 din 6 iulie 2001 privind aprobarea Planului de amenajare a teritoriului național - Secțiunea a IV-a Rețeaua de localități | date = 6 iulie 2001 | accessdate = 26 octombrie 2008 | publisher = Monitorul Oficial | language = română}}&lt;/ref&gt;  published on July 24, 2001 (M.O. number 408), there are 172 cities in Romania, and the minimum requirements for a settlement to be acknowledge as a iii-3rd rank city status are:&lt;ref&gt;See Law 351/2001, anexe nr. II&lt;/ref&gt;

*Population: over 5,000 citizens
*Non-agricultural related activities: 75% people
*Network of drinking water coverage for homes: 70% of street covering
*Network of liquid waste recycle from homes: 55% of street covering
*Waste water recycling facility
*Water access-points for fire related incidents: 60% of the street covering
*Paved streets or more: 50%
*Hospital seats: 7 every 1000th citizen
*Medical health care: 1.8 doctors per 1000th citizen
*Hotel rooms: 50 seats
*Public and permanent waste disposal
*Primary school for children and a complementary school or at least one high school.
*Cultural facilities: One free-access library, one show room, one public gym
*One public garden : 10 sqm / citizen

In respect to the density of the cities, if it is more than 25&amp;nbsp;km to the next city, there are further benefits the mayor can access, fundings included.

A municipality is the next status after city-status by the same law, and Romania has 82 municipalities, plus the Municipality of [[Bucharest]].

===South Korea===

{{Main|List of cities in South Korea}}

[[South Korea]] has a system of dividing into metropolitan cities, provinces, a special city (Seoul) and one specially self-governing province ([[Jeju-do]]). In South Korea, cities should have a population of more than 150,000, and if a city has more than 500,000, it would be divided into 2 districts and then sub-communities follow as a name of dong with similar system of normal cities. Additionally, if a city's population is over 1,000,000, then it would be promoted to metropolitan city.&lt;ref&gt;Korea.net - Administrative Units&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Seoul is the world's second largest metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Forstall, R.P. Greene, and J.B.

===Sweden===
{{main|List of cities in Sweden by population}}
[[Sweden]] canceled the official legal term City (in Swedish: stad) in the year 1971. Only the word [[municipality]] (in Swedish: kommun) prevails, making no legal difference between [[Stockholm]] and a countryside municipality. Before that there were a number of terms like &quot;stad&quot;/Town, &quot;köping&quot;/large village etc. The definition of City/Town (stad) was merely that it was given such a title. Since the 1980s some municipalities (13 out of 290) being &quot;stad&quot; before 1971, again call themselves town (stad), but only in tourist advertising. This has no legal or administrative significance whatsoever, and the municipalities have to use the word &quot;kommun&quot; by law. In other cases the seat of the municipality is called &quot;town&quot;.

Today's Swedish terminology makes no difference between city and town, both concepts translates to the single word &quot;stad&quot;, but sometimes town can be rendered &quot;småstad&quot;. [[Statistics Sweden]] defines a &quot;stad&quot; as an [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]] (in Swedish: tätort) of at least 10,000 inhabitants.

===Turkey===

{{Main|Metropolitan centers in Turkey}}
There are some definitions of city in Turkey. Older definition which defines the city as a settlement with more than 20 000 inhabitants is out of use and a city is usually defined as the administrative center of a province ({{lang-tr|il}}) There are 81 provincial centers in Turkey. However some of the district centers ({{lang-tr|ilçe}}) are more populous and more developed than the provincial centers.

But in 1984, the '''metropolitan center''' concept was introduced. ({{lang-tr|Büyükşehir}}) According to definition (revised as of 2004) a metropolitan center is a city with more than 750 000 inhabitants. At present 16 of the provincial centers are metropolitan centers.

===Ukraine===
There is no difference in the Ukrainian language between the notions of &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot;. Both these words are translated into Ukrainian as &quot;місто&quot; (&quot;misto&quot;). In articles of Wikipedia only the term &quot;city&quot; is used for every Ukrainian locality named &quot;місто&quot;. The smallest population of a city of Ukraine can be about 10,000. For towns which officially are not named &quot;місто&quot; it is used a name &quot;urban-type settlement&quot; (&quot;селище міського типу&quot;, &quot;selyshche mis'koho typu&quot;) and also (informal) &quot;містечко&quot; (&quot;mistechko&quot;), the latter Ukrainian word is related to the word &quot;місто&quot; and can be translated as &quot;small town&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|City status in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Canary Wharf at night, from Shadwell cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Canary Wharf]] is a financial district within the greater city of [[London]].]]

In the United Kingdom (UK), a ''city'' is a town which has been known as a city since [[time immemorial]], or which has received city status by [[letters patent]]—which are normally granted on the basis of: Population (&gt;300,000), metropolitan character, governance, importance and / or a Royal connection. In England and Wales, prior to 1907 the criterion was simply the establishment of an Anglican Cathedral. For example the small town of [[Ripon]] was granted city status in 1836 to coincide with the creation of the Diocese of Ripon, but also in recognition of its long-standing role as a supplier of [[spur]]s to royalty. In the United Kingdom, when people talk about cities, they generally include the suburbs in that. Some cathedral cities, such as St David's in [[Wales]] and [[Wells]] in [[England]], are quite small, and may not be known as cities in common parlance. [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] became England's newest city in the year 2002 to mark the Queen's jubilee, as did [[Newport]] in Wales, [[Stirling]] in [[Scotland]], and [[Lisburn]] and [[Newry]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. However, major towns such as [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Northampton]], [[Luton]], [[Swindon]] and [[Milton Keynes]] all harbour populations between 170,000 and 215,000 inhabitants but are not officially cited as cities.

The situation in London is a historical anomaly: the [[City of Westminster]] and the City of London are geographically small but historically significant parts of the [[Greater London]] conurbation that have independent city status.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

A ''Review of Scotland's Cities'' led to the ''Fair City'' of [[Perth, Scotland]], losing city status. By both legal and traditional definition, a town may be of any size, but must contain a [[market|market place]]. A village must contain a church{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. A small village without a church is called a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of British Social History; L W Cowrie: Wordsworth reference: ISBN 1-85326-378-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK's five largest cities are generally considered to be [[London]], [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]] and [[Glasgow]], but this is based on the population of the conurbation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fom2005/03_FOPM_UrbanAreas.pdf |title=Statistics.gov.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanaudit.org/CityProfiles.aspx |title=CityProfiles |publisher=Urban Audit |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of formal city boundaries, the largest include [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Sheffield]].

[[File:ChicagovanafSearsTower.jpg|thumb|[[Chicago]] is one of the biggest cities in the United States]]
In the [[United States of America]], the classification of population centers is a matter of state law; consequently, the definition of a city varies widely from state to state. In some states, a city may be run by an elected mayor and city council, while a town is governed by the people, a select board (or board of trustees), or open town meeting. There are some very large municipalities which label themselves as  towns (such as [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Hempstead, New York]], with a population of 755,785 in 2004 or [[Town of Cary|Cary, North Carolina]] with a population of 112,414 in 2006 ) and some very small cities (such as [[Woodland Mills, Tennessee]], with a population of 296 in 2000), and the line between town and city, if it exists at all, varies from state to state.  The lack of a clear-cut definition of a city in the United States can lead to some counter-intuitive labeling; for example, before it was dissolved in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/geographic/boundary_changes/ |title=U.S. Census Bureau: Boundary Changes |publisher=Census.gov |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maza, North Dakota]], with only 5 inhabitants, was a city as by [[North Dakota]] law any incorporated location is deemed a city regardless of size.  [[California]] has both towns and cities but the terms &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; are considered synonymous. The nation's top five [[List of United States cities by population|largest cities]] are [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], and [[Philadelphia]]. 

In some U.S. states, any incorporated town is also called a city. If a distinction is being made between towns and cities, exactly what that distinction is often depends on the context. The context will differ depending on whether the issue is the legal authority it possesses, the availability of shopping and entertainment, and the scope of the group of places under consideration. Intensifiers such as &quot;small town&quot; and &quot;big city&quot; are also common, though the flip side of each is rarely used.

Some states make a distinction between [[Village (United States)|villages]] and other forms of municipalities. In some cases, villages combine with larger other communities to form larger towns; a well-known example of an urban village is New York City's famed [[Greenwich Village]], which started as a quiet country settlement but was absorbed by the growing city. The word has often been co-opted by enterprising developers to make their projects sound welcoming and friendly.

In [[Illinois]], cities must have a minimum population of 2,500 but in Nebraska, cities must have a minimum of only 800 residents. In [[Oregon]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], North Dakota, [[Minnesota]], and [[Iowa]], all incorporated municipalities are cities. In [[Ohio]], a municipality automatically becomes a city if it has 5,000 residents counted in a federal census but it reverts to a village if its population drops below 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ohio Revised Code]] [http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/703.01 703.01]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nebraska]], 5,000 residents is the minimum for a city of the first class while 800 is the minimum for a city of the second class. The Constitution of [[Idaho]] makes no distinction between incorporated towns or cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/IC/ArtXIISect1PrinterFriendly.htm |title=Idaho Constitution |publisher=Legislature.idaho.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all the [[New England]] states, city status is conferred by the form of government, not population. Town government has a board of [[selectmen]] or Town Council for the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch, and a [[town meeting]] for the [[legislative]] branch, but unlike the US Government, the executive acts only as an administrative body and cannot override the will of town meeting. New England cities, on the other hand, have a mayor for the executive, and a legislature referred to as either the city council or the board of [[aldermen]].

In [[Virginia]], all incorporated municipalities designated as cities are [[independent city|independent]] of the adjacent or surrounding county while a town is an incorporated municipality which remains a part of an adjacent or surrounding county. The largest incorporated municipalities by population are all cities, although some smaller cities have a smaller population than some towns. For example, the smallest city of [[Norton, Virginia|Norton]] has a population of 3,904 and the largest town of [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]] has a population of 39,573. The other U.S. independent cities are [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; and [[Carson City, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/GARM/Ch4GARM.pdf |format=PDF|title=Chapter 4: States, Counties, and Statistically Equivalent Entities |accessdate=2008-09-16 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work=[http://www.census.gov/geo/www/garm.html Geographic Areas Reference Manual] |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |pages=4–9, 4–11 |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pennsylvania, municipalites with more than 10 persons can incorporate as a borough. Any township or borough with a population of at least 10,000 can ask the state legislature to charter as a city. In Pennsylvania, a village is simply an unincorporated community within a township. Parker, Pennsylvania is known as the smallest city in the United States.

Minnesota, has a city population of 200,000 to 500,000 with subsidiaries as low as 50,000
with many non-appropriated assembled towns and counties with decrepit representations.

Recently areas near and in Minneapolis have been referred to as non-partisan and territories.

===Venezuela===
Venezuela's Department of National Statistics defines a city (''ciudad'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) as an urban entity with more than 5,000 inhabitants. A town (''pueblo''), is an urban entity with 2,001 to 5,000 persons.

==Global cities==
{{Main|Global city}}

A global city, also known as a ''world city'', is a prominent centre of [[trade]], [[bank]]ing, [[finance]], innovation, and markets. The term &quot;global city&quot;, as opposed to [[megacity]], was coined by [[Saskia Sassen]] in a seminal 1991 work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Whereas &quot;megacity&quot; refers to any city of enormous size, a global city is one of enormous power or influence. Global cities, according to Sassen, have more in common with each other than with other cities in their host nations. Notable examples of such cities include [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Chicago]], [[Paris]], [[Beijing]], [[Tokyo]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Mumbai]], [[Singapore]], and [[Shanghai]].

The notion of global cities is rooted in the concentration of [[Power (sociology)|power]] and capabilities within all cities. The city is seen as a container where skills and resources are concentrated: the better able a city is to concentrate its skills and resources, the more successful and powerful the city. This makes the city itself more powerful in the sense that it can influence what is happening around the world. Following this view of cities, it is possible to [[Global city#GaWC Inventory of World Cities|rank the world's cities hierarchically]].&lt;ref name=ranking&gt;John Friedmann and Goetz Wolff, &quot;World City Formation: An Agenda for Research and Action,&quot; ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'', 6, no. 3 (1982): 319&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the notion point to the different realms of power. The term ''global city'' is heavily influenced by economic factors and, thus, may not account for places that are otherwise significant. For example, cities like Rome, Istanbul, [[Mecca]], [[Mashhad]], [[Karbala]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Lisbon]] are powerful in [[religion|religious]] and [[history|historical]] terms but would not be considered &quot;global cities.&quot; Additionally, it has been questioned whether the city itself can be regarded as an actor.{{By whom|date=November 2010}}

In 1995, Kanter argued that successful cities can be identified by three elements: good thinkers (concepts), good makers (competence) or good traders ([[city network|connections]]). The interplay of these three elements, Kanter argued, means that good cities are not planned but managed.

==Inner city==
[[File:Tehranwnight34w.jpg|thumb|[[Tehran]], [[Iran]]]]
{{Main|Inner city}}
In the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland, the term &quot;inner city&quot; is sometimes used with the connotation of being an area, perhaps a [[ghetto]], where people are less wealthy and where there is more crime. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} These connotations are less common in other Western countries, as deprived areas are located in varying parts of other Western cities. In fact, with the [[gentrification]] of some formerly run-down central city areas the reverse connotation can apply. In Australia, for example, the term &quot;outer suburban&quot; applied to a person implies a lack of sophistication. In Paris, the inner city is the richest part of the metropolitan area, where housing is the most expensive, and where elites and high-income individuals dwell. In the developing world, economic modernization brings poor newcomers from the countryside to build haphazardly at the edge of current settlement (see [[favelas]], [[shack]]s and [[shanty towns]]).

The United States, in particular, has a culture of anti-urbanism that dates back to colonial times. The American [[City Beautiful]] architecture movement of the late 19th century was a reaction to perceived [[urban decay]] and sought to provide stately civic buildings and boulevards to inspire civic pride in the motley residents of the urban core. Modern anti-urban attitudes are to be found in the United States in the form of a planning profession that continues to develop land on a low-density suburban basis, where access to amenities, work and shopping is provided almost exclusively by car rather than by foot or transit.

However, there is a growing movement in North America called &quot;[[New Urbanism]]&quot; that calls for a return to traditional city planning methods where mixed-use zoning allows people to walk from one type of land-use to another. The idea is that housing, shopping, office space, and leisure facilities are all provided within walking distance of each other, thus reducing the demand for road-space and also improving the efficiency and effectiveness of [[mass transit]].

London: Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge-based development of cities, globalization of innovation networks, and broadband services are driving forces of a new city planning paradigm towards [[intelligent cities]]. Intelligent / [[smart cities]] use technology and communication to create more efficient agglomerations in terms of competitiveness, innovation, environment, energy, utilities, governance, and delivery of services to the citizen. Some companies are building brand new [[land use planning|masterplanned]] cities from scratch on [[greenfield land|greenfield]] sites.

'''Chervil''' (''Anthriscus cerefolium'')  is a delicate [[annual plant|annual]] [[herb]] related to [[parsley]]. Sometimes called '''garden chervil''', it is used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture [[fines herbes]].  

==Biology==
A member of the [[Apiaceae]], chervil is native to the [[Caucasus]] but was spread by the Romans through most of Europe, where it is now naturalised.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBFP&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Vaughan | first =J.G.   | authorlink = | coauthors = Geissler, C.A. | title =The New Oxford Book of Food Plants | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plants grow to 40-70&amp;nbsp;cm, with tripinnate leaves that may be curly. The small white flowers form small umbels, 2.5-5&amp;nbsp;cm across. The fruit is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm long, oblong-ovoid with a slender, ridged beak.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBFP&quot;/&gt;

===Root Chervil===
Another type of chervil is grown as a [[root vegetable]], sometimes called [[Chaerophyllum bulbosum|'''turnip rooted chervil''']] or [[Chaerophyllum bulbosum|'''tuberous-rooted chervil''']]. This type of chervil produces much thicker roots than types cultivated for their leaves. It was a popular vegetable in the 19th century. Now virtually forgotten in Britain and the United States, root chervil is still used in French cuisine, in soups or stews.

==Uses==
===Culinary arts===
[[Image:Chervil.JPG|thumb|Chervil garnishing a salad]]

Sometimes referred to as &quot;gourmet's parsley&quot;, chervil is used to season [[poultry]], [[seafood]], and young [[vegetable]]s. It is particularly popular in France, where it is added to omelettes, salads and soups. More delicate than parsley, it has a faint taste of [[liquorice]].

===Horticulture===
Chervil is sometimes used to repel [[slug]]s.

===Medicinal===
Chervil had various traditional uses. Pregnant women were bathed in an [[infusion]] of it; a [[lotion]] of it was used as a skin cleanser; and it was used medicinally as a [[blood]] purifier. It was also claimed to be useful as a digestive aid, for lowering high blood pressure, and, infused with vinegar, for curing hiccups.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =McGee | first =Rose Marie Nichols  | authorlink = | coauthors = Stuckey, Maggie | title =The Bountiful Container | publisher = Workman Publishing | date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chervil has also been implicated in &quot;strimmer dermatitis&quot; due to a phytophotodermatitis due to spray from a weed trimmer.  Other plants in the parsley family can have similar effects.

==Cultivation==
Chervil is best grown seeded in place - transplanting can be difficult, due to the long taproot.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt; It prefers a cool and moist location, otherwise it rapidly goes to seed (also known as bolting).&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt; Regular harvesting of leaves also helps to prevent bolting.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt; If plants bolt despite precautions, the plant can be periodically re-sown through the growing season, thus producing fresh plants as older plants bolt and go out of production.

Chervil grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, and a width of 6 to 12 inches.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt;

''Allium schoenoprasum'' is also the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the [[New world|New]] and the [[Old World]] and is a [[perennial]].

The name of the species derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''skhoínos'' ([[Cyperaceae|sedge]]) and ''práson'' ([[leek]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gräslök], from Den virtuella floran, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[English language|English]] name, ''chive'', derives from the [[French language|French]] word ''cive'', from ''cepa'', the [[Latin]] word for onion.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;[http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa022398.htm Chives], from homecooking.about.com, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

In culinary uses, chives leaves (straws) are shredded for use as condiment for [[fish]], [[potato]]es and [[soup]]s. Chives are a commonly used household [[herb]], frequent in gardens and in grocery stores. It has insect-repelling properties which can be used in gardens to control pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Biology==
The chive is a [[bulb]]-forming [[herbaceous]] [[perennial plant]], growing to 30–50&amp;nbsp;cm tall. The bulbs are slender conical, 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm long and 1&amp;nbsp;cm broad, and grow in dense clusters from the [[root]]s. The [[leaf|leaves]] are hollow tubular, up to 50&amp;nbsp;cm long, and 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm in [[diameter]], with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower from a leaf, it may appear stiffer than usual. The [[flower]]s are pale purple, star-shaped with six [[tepal]]s, 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and produced in a dense [[inflorescence]] of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery [[bract]]. The [[seed]]s are produced in a small three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006'', based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gräslök], from Den virtuella floran, ''retrieved on June 13, 2006'', The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chives are the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the Old World and [[New World|New]]. Sometimes, the plants found in North America are classified as ''A. schoenoprasum'' [[variety (botany)|var.]] ''sibiricum'', although this is disputed. There have been significant differences among specimens.  One example was found in northern [[Maine]] growing solitary, instead of in clumps, also exhibiting dingy grey flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although repulsive to insects in general, due to its [[sulfur]] compounds, its flowers are attractive to [[bee]]s, and it is sometimes kept to increase desired insect life.&lt;ref&gt;Baines. C. Making a Wildlife Garden. 0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
=== Culinary arts ===

Chives are grown for their leaves, which are used for culinary purposes as flavoring herb, and provide a somewhat milder flavour than those of its neighbouring [[Allium]] species.

Chives have a wide variety of culinary uses, such as in traditional dishes in [[France]] and Sweden,&lt;ref name=&quot;swe&quot;&gt;Försök til en Flora Oeconomica Sveciæ by A. J. Retzius (1806)&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In his 1806 book ''Attempt at a Flora'' (''Försök til en flora''), Retzius describes how chives are used with pancakes, soups, fish and sandwiches.&lt;ref name=&quot;swe&quot;/&gt; It is also an ingredient of the ''[[sour cream|gräddfil]]'' sauce served with the traditional [[herring]] dish served at Swedish [[midsummer]] celebrations. The flowers may also be used to garnish dishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountainvalleygrowers.com/allschoenoprasum.htm Allium schoenoprasum], from Mountain valley growers, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Poland]] chives are served with [[Quark (cheese)|quark cheese]].

Chives are one of the &quot;[[fines herbes]]&quot; of French cuisine, which also include [[tarragon]], [[chervil]] and/or [[parsley]].

Chives can be found fresh at most markets year-round, making it a readily available herb; it can also be dry-frozen without much impairment to its taste, giving home growers the opportunity to store large quantities harvested from their own garden.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;/&gt;

===Cultivation===
Retzius also describes how farmers would plant chives between the rocks making up the borders of their flowerbeds, to keep the plants free from pests (such as [[Japanese beetle]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;swe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;japanese_beetles&quot;&gt;[http://www.selfsufficientish.com/pests.htm pests - selfsufficientish - pests&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While the growing plant repels unwanted insect life, the juice of the leaves can be used for the same purpose, as well as fighting [[fungal infection]]s, [[mildew]] and [[Fusarium ear blight|scab]].&lt;ref&gt;Holtom. J. and Hylton. W. Complete Guide to Herbs. Rodale Press 1979 ISBN 0-87857-262-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riotte. L. Companion Planting for Successful Gardening.

Its flowers are attractive to bees, which are important for gardens with an abundance of plants in need of [[pollination]].

===Medicine===
The medical properties of chives are similar to those of [[garlic]], but weaker; the faint effects in comparison with garlic are probably the main reason for its limited use as a [[medicinal herb]]. Containing numerous [[organosulfur compounds]] such as [[allyl]] [[sulfide]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[alkyl]] [[sulfoxide]]s, chives are reported to have a beneficial effect on the [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;phd&quot;&gt;[http://www.vibrantlife.com/vl/herb-43.html Chive Talkin'], by Winston J. Craig, Ph. D, from Vibrantlife.com, ''accessed on May 31, 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; As chives are usually served in small amounts and never as the main dish, negative effects are rarely encountered, although [[digestive system|digestive]] problems may occur following over-consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;phd&quot;/&gt;

Chives are also rich in [[vitamin A|vitamins A]] and [[Vitamin C|C]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sal&quot;&gt;[http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/gilbert/chives.htm Chives], from &quot;Sally's place&quot;, ''accessed on May 31, 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; contain trace amounts of sulfur, and are rich in [[calcium]] and [[iron]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.organicgardeningpractices.com/garlicchives.php Organic Gardening&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
Chives are cultivated both for their culinary uses and their ornamental value; the violet flowers are often used in ornamental dry bouquets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1082/is_n3_v40/ai_18339595/pg_2 Flower &amp; Garden Magazine, June-July 1996, The lazy gardener's guide to potpourri]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chives thrive in well drained soil, rich in organic matter, with a [[pH]] of 6-7 and full sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobot&quot;/&gt;

Chives can be grown from seed and mature in summer, or early the following spring. Typically, chives need to be [[germination|germinated]] at a temperature of 15 °C to 20 °C (60 °F-70 °F) and kept moist. They can also be planted under a [[Row cover|cloche]] or germinated indoors in cooler climates, then planted out later. After at least four weeks, the young shoots should be ready to be planted out.

Chives are also easily propagated by division.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =McGee | first =Rose Marie Nichols  | authorlink = | coauthors = Stuckey, Maggie | title =The Bountiful Container | publisher = Workman Publishing | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cold regions, chives die back to the underground bulbs in winter, with the new leaves appearing in early spring.

Chives starting to look old can be cut back to about 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm. When harvesting, the needed number of stalks should be cut to the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt; During the growing season, the plant will continually regrow leaves, allowing for a continuous harvest.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt;

==History and cultural importance==
Chives have been cultivated in Europe since the [[Middle Ages]], although signs of its usage date back to 5000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;/&gt;  They were sometimes referred to as &quot;rush leeks&quot; (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''schoinos'' meaning rush and ''parson'' meaning leek).

The Romans believed chives could relieve the pain from [[sunburn]] or a sore throat. They believed that eating chives would increase [[blood pressure]] and acted as a [[diuretic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= 75 Exceptional Herbs for Your Garden |last= Staub |first= Jack E. |year= 2008 |publisher= Gibbs Smith |isbn= 97814236025144 |page= 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian Gypsies have used chives in fortune telling.&lt;ref name=&quot;sal&quot;&gt;[http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/gilbert/chives.htm Chives], from &quot;Sally's place&quot;, ''accessed on June 13, 2006''&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that bunches of dried chives hung around a house would ward off disease and evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;sal&quot;/&gt;

'''Christopher Morris''' (born 15 June 1962) is an English [[satirist]], writer, [[Film director|director]] and actor. A former [[radio DJ]], he is best known for anchoring the spoof news and current affairs television programmes ''[[The Day Today]]'' and ''[[Brass Eye]]'', as well as his frequent engagement with controversial subject matter.

In 2010 Morris directed his first feature-length film ''[[Four Lions]]'' about a group of inept British terrorists. Reception of the film was largely positive and received a respectable box office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/article/16915/UK-Box-Office-30-July---1-August-2010&lt;/ref&gt; Outside his central work, Morris tends to stay out of the public eye and has become one of the more enigmatic figures in British comedy.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Morris grew up in [[Cambridgeshire]]. He was educated at [[Stonyhurst College]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boys' boarding school in [[Lancashire]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_Brass_Neck&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1460463.stm|title= Chris Morris: Brass Neck|accessdate= 23 June 2008|date= 27 July 2001|publisher=BBC News|quote= The son of two Cambridgeshire GPs, Chris Morris was educated at Stonyhurst College}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied [[zoology]] at the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;observer_profile&quot;&gt;{{cite news
|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/jul/22/comment.euanferguson|title= The Observer Profile: Chris Morris|accessdate= 23 June 2008|last= Ferguson|first= Euan|date= 22 July 2001|work= [[The Observer]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio career===

On graduating, Morris took up a traineeship with [[BBC Radio Cambridgeshire]], where he took advantage of access to editing and recording equipment to create elaborate [[Parody|spoofs]] and [[parody|parodies]].  He also spent time in early 1987 hosting a 2–4pm afternoon show and finally ended up presenting Saturday morning show ''I.T.''.  In July 1987, he moved on to [[BBC Radio Bristol]] to present his own show &quot;No Known Cure&quot;, and later joined, from its launch, [[BBC London 94.9|Greater London Radio]] (GLR). 

His move away from the BBC in 1987 coincided with a schoolboy prank where he flooded a news studio with helium while a bulletin was being presented. The resultant increase in pitch of the newsreader was amusing, but unfortunately had the effect of pushing him to pastures new. 

Until 1990, he was presenting Friday night and Saturday morning shows on Radio Bristol and a Sunday morning show on GLR.

In 1991, Morris reduced his work as a mainstream disc jockey and devoted himself to comedy with his new radio project ''[[On the Hour]]''. Working with [[Armando Iannucci]], [[Patrick Marber]], [[Richard Herring]], [[Stewart Lee]], [[Steve Coogan]] and others, he created the spoof news show on [[BBC Radio 4]]. In 1994, Morris began a weekly evening show, the ''Chris Morris Music Show'', on [[BBC Radio 1]] alongside [[Peter Baynham]] and 'man with a mobile phone' [[Paul Garner (comedian)|Paul Garner]]. In the shows, Morris perfected the spoof interview style that would become a central component of his ''[[Brass Eye]]'' programme. The show's pranks left BBC bosses nonplussed, and a profanity-laden mid-afternoon show on Boxing Day was his last.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In the same year, Morris teamed up with [[Peter Cook]], as [[Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling]], in a series of improvised conversations for [[BBC Radio 3]], entitled ''[[Why Bother?]]''. Morris followed this with ''[[Blue Jam]]'', a late-night [[ambient music]] and sketch show on Radio 1, which was later reworked for television as [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]''.

===Move into television and film===

In 1994, a [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] television series based on ''On the Hour'' was broadcast under the name ''[[The Day Today]]''. ''The Day Today'' made a star of Morris, and helped to launch the careers of [[Patrick Marber]] and [[Steve Coogan]].

The [[black comedy|black humour]] which had featured in ''On the Hour'' and ''The Day Today'' became more prominent in ''[[Brass Eye]]'', another spoof current affairs television documentary, shown on [[Channel 4]]. ''Brass Eye'' became known for tricking celebrities and politicians into throwing support behind public awareness campaigns for made-up issues that were often absurd or surreal (such as a drug called ''cake'' and an [[elephant]] with its trunk stuck up its [[anus]]). In 2001, a reprise of ''Brass Eye'' on the [[moral panic]] that surrounds [[pedophilia|paedophilia]] led to a record-breaking number of complaints – it still remains the third highest on UK television after ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 2007]]'' and ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'' – as well as heated discussion in the press. Many complainants, some of whom later admitted to not having seen the programme (notably [[Beverley Hughes]], a government minister),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1335865/Minister-in-Brass-Eye-protest-has-not-even-seen-it.html |title=Minister in Brass Eye protest has not even seen it |first=Andy |last=McSmith |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=31 July 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; felt the satire was directed at the victims of paedophilia, which Morris denies. Channel 4 defended the show, insisting the target was the media and its hysterical treatment of paedophilia, and not victims of crime.

Morris also wrote and directed ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]'', a television reworking of his radio show ''[[Blue Jam]]''. Darker and more unsettling than his previous work, the show explored such [[taboo]]s as infant mortality, [[incest]], [[anal sex]], [[rape]], [[suicide]] and [[sadomasochism]] through a series of unsettling, dreamlike sketches with a soundtrack of ambient music. This was followed by a 'remix' version, ''Jaaaaam''.

In 2002, Morris ventured into [[film]], directing the [[short film|short]] ''[[My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117|My Wrongs #8245–8249 &amp; 117]]'', adapted from a ''Blue Jam'' monologue about a man led astray by a sinister talking dog. It was the first film project of [[Warp Films]], a branch of [[Warp Records]]. In 2002 this won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for best short film.&lt;ref name=&quot;bafta_2002&quot;/&gt; In 2005 Morris worked on a sitcom entitled ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', based on the character created by [[Charlie Brooker]] for his website [[TVGoHome]]. Co-written by Brooker and Morris, the series was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in early 2005.

===Recent work===

Morris was a cast member in ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', a [[Channel 4]] [[situation comedy|sitcom]] focusing on the [[information technology]] department of the fictional company Reynholm Industries. The series is written and directed by [[Graham Linehan]] (writer of ''[[Father Ted]]'' and ''[[Black Books]]'', with whom Morris collaborated on ''The Day Today'', ''Brass Eye'' and ''Jam'') and produced by [[Ash Atalla]] (''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''). Morris played Denholm Reynholm, the eccentric managing director of the company. This marked the first time Morris has acted in a substantial role in a project which he has not developed himself and is more mainstream than his earlier work.  Morris's character appeared to leave the series during episode two of the second series. His character made a brief return in the first episode of the third series.

In November 2007, Morris wrote an article for ''[[The Observer]]'' in response to [[Ronan Bennett]]'s article published six days earlier in ''[[The Guardian]]''. Bennett's article, &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/nov/19/race.bookscomment Shame on us]'&quot;, accused the novelist [[Martin Amis]] of [[racism]]. Morris's response, &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/25/bookscomment.religion The absurd world of Martin Amis]&quot;, was also highly critical of Amis; although he didn't accede to Bennett's accusation of racism, Morris likened Amis to the Muslim cleric [[Abu Hamza al-Masri|Abu Hamza]] (who was jailed for [[inciting racial hatred]] in 2006), suggesting that both men employ &quot;mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Qu'ran&quot; to incite hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/25/bookscomment.religion |title=The absurd world of Martin Amis |publisher=The Observer |date=25 November 2007 |accessdate=22 June 2008 |quote=Last week Amis was called a racist. I saw him speak at the ICA last month. Was his negativity about Islam technically racist? I don't know. What I can tell you is that Martin Amis is the new Abu Hamza. […] Like Hamza, Amis could only make his nonsense stand up with mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Koran. | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris served as script editor for the 2009 series ''[[Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle]]'', working with former colleagues [[Stewart Lee]], the actor [[Kevin Eldon]] and [[Armando Iannucci]].

Morris completed his debut feature film ''[[Four Lions]]'' in late 2009, a satire based on a group of Islamist terrorists in Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2009/07/17/set-shot-from-chris-morris-four-lions/|title=Set shot from Chris Morris' Four Lions|publisher=Bleeding Cool.com|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2010 and was short-listed for the festival's World Cinema Narrative prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.sundance.org/2010/press_industry/releases/2010_sundance_film_festival_announces_films_in_competition/ |title=2010 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL ANNOUNCES FILMS IN COMPETITION &amp;#124; Sundance Festival 2010 |publisher=Festival.sundance.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film (working title ''Boilerhouse'') was picked up by [[Film Four]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/wannabe-suicide-bombers-beware-chris-morris-movie-gets-goahead-1228152.html |title=Wannabe suicide bombers beware: Chris Morris movie gets go-ahead |first=Geneviève |last=Roberts |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | work=The Independent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris told ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that the film, will seek to do for Islamic terrorism what ''[[Dad's Army]]'', the classic BBC comedy, did for the Nazis by showing them as &quot;scary but also ridiculous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=Richard |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article3177654.ece |title=Satirist turns terrorists into Dad's Army |publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=13 January 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

Morris often co-writes and performs incidental music for his television shows, notably with ''Jam'' and the 'extended remix' version, ''Jaaaaam''. Morris supplied sketches for British band [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]]'s 1993 single &quot;[[You're in a Bad Way]]&quot; (the sketch 'Spongbake' appears at the end of the 4th track on the CD single).
In 2000, he collaborated by mail with [[Amon Tobin]] to create the track &quot;Bad Sex&quot;, which was released as a B-side on the Tobin single &quot;Slowly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Amon-Tobin-Slowly/release/29172 |title=Amon Tobin (feat Chris Morris at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=2002-05-21 |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
British band [[Stereolab]]'s song &quot;Nothing to Do with Me&quot; from their 2001 album ''[[Sound-Dust]]'' featured various lines from Chris Morris sketches as lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.nme.com/news/stereolab/8265 |title=Stereolab's 'Jam' Session |work=[[NME]] |date=21 June 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been sampled by The Orb.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Recognition==

In 2003, Morris was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1101525,00.html|title=The A-Z of laughter (part two)|publisher=The Observer |date=7 December 2003 |accessdate=13 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Channel 4]] aired a show called ''[[The Comedian's Comedian]]'' in which foremost writers and performers of comedy ranked their 50 favourite acts. Morris was at number eleven.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_comedians&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4141019.stm|title= Cook voted 'comedians' comedian'|accessdate= 23 June 2008 |date= 2 January 2005|publisher= BBC News|quote= Modern TV satirist Chris Morris was in 11th, followed by Tony Hancock, Bill Hicks, Peter Sellers and Steve Martin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris won the BAFTA for outstanding debut with his film Four Lions. Adeel Akhtar and Nigel Lindsay collected the award in his absence, Morris sent them a text before they collected the award reading, 'Dowsed in petrol, zippo at the ready'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12432378 | work=BBC News | title=King's Speech reigns over Bafta awards | date=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Morris lives in [[Brixton]], with literary agent  Jo Unwin, and has two sons, both of whom were born in [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]], London: Charles Peter (born 1996) and Frederick Rudolf (born 1999).&lt;ref name=&quot;observer_profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp |title=Births England and Wales 1984-2006 |publisher=Findmypast.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has given very few interviews and little is known about Morris's personal life.

Morris can be heard as himself in a podcast for [[CERN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/audio/2008/jun/30/cern.chris.morris.podcast |title=Cern podcast: Chris Morris visits the Large Hadron Collider |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is brother to [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] associate director Tom Morris and television director Ben Morris.

'''Colorado''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ColoradanColorado.ogg|k|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|r|æ|d|oʊ}} or, {{IPAc-en|en-us-Colorado.ogg|k|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|d|oʊ}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Colorado Merriam-Webster.com], Colorado, Definition from the ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary'' {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[U.S. state]] that encompasses most of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] as well as the northeastern portion of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. Colorado is part of the [[Western United States]], the [[Mountain States]], and the [[Southwestern United States]].

The state was named for the [[Colorado River]], which early [[Spain|Spanish]] explorers named the ''Rio Colorado'' for the red colored ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Colorado'') silt the river carried from the mountains. In 1861, [[Jefferson Territory|Jefferson Territorial]] officials decided that &quot;Colorado&quot; would be a fitting name for a new territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm |title=Colorado Department of Personnel &amp; Administration (DPA) Division of Information Technologies (DoIT) |publisher=Colorado.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/histfaqs.htm |title=Colorado Department of Personnel &amp; Administration (DPA) Division of Information Technologies (DoIT) |publisher=Colorado.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado is nicknamed the &quot;[[List of U.S. state nicknames|Centennial State]]&quot; because it was admitted to the [[United States|Union]] as the 38th state in 1876, the [[century|centennial year]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Colorado is bordered by the [[Northwestern United States|northwest]] state of [[Wyoming]] to the north, the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]] states of [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]] to the northeast and east, on the south by [[New Mexico]] and a small portion of the [[Southern United States|southern]] state of [[Oklahoma]], and on the west by [[Utah]]. The four states of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]] meet at one common point known as the [[Four Corners]], which is known as the heart of the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. Colorado is one of only three U.S. states with no natural borders, the others being neighboring [[Wyoming]] and [[Utah]].

Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of [[mountains]], forests, [[High Plains (United States)|high plains]], [[mesa]]s, [[canyon]]s, [[plateau]]s, [[river]]s, and [[Desert|desert lands]]. The [[2010 United States Census]] tallied the state population at 5,029,196 as of April 1, 2010, an increase of +16.92% since the [[2000 United States Census]]. [[Denver]] is the [[capital (political)|capital]] and the [[Colorado municipalities by population|most populous city]] of Colorado. Residents of the state are properly known as &quot;[[List of demonyms for U.S. states|Coloradans]]&quot;, although the archaic term &quot;Coloradoan&quot; is still used.&lt;ref name=statestyle&gt;[http://ccs.colostate.edu/style_guide/style_guide_az.aspx#state_names Writers Style Guide], Colorado State University.

[[File:6601-RedRocksTheater.JPG|thumb|[[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]], west of Denver, where the Plains meet the Rockies.]]
A little over one fourth of the area of Colorado is flat and rolling land. East of the Rocky Mountains are the [[Colorado Eastern Plains]] of the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]], the section of the Great Plains within Colorado at elevations ranging from roughly {{convert|3350|to|7360|ft|m|abbr=off}}.The midwest plains states of Kansas and Nebraska border Colorado to the east and northeast. The Colorado plains are usually thought of as [[prairie]]s, but actually they have many patches of [[deciduous forests]], [[butte]]s, and [[canyons]], much like the high plains in New Mexico as well. Eastern Colorado is presently mainly covered in farmland, along with small farming villages and towns. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is fair, averaging from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm|abbr=off}} annually.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php|title=Climate of Colorado |last=Doesken|first=Nolan J.|coauthors=[[Roger A. Pielke]], Sr., Odilia A.P. Bliss |date=January 2003|publisher=Colorado Climate Center – Department of Atmospheric Science – [[Colorado State University]]|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summers in the plains are normally hot and dry, while the winters are often quite cold, snowy, and icy. [[maize|Corn]], [[wheat]], [[hay]], [[soybeans]], and [[oats]] are all typical crops, and most of the villages and towns in this region boast both a [[water tower]] and a [[grain elevator]]. As well as the farming of [[crop]]s, Eastern Colorado has a good deal of [[livestock]] raising, such as at [[cattle]] ranches and [[Intensive pig farming|hog farm]]s. In eastern Colorado, a good deal of [[irrigation]] water is available from the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams, and also from subterranean sources, including [[artesian well]]s. However, heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline.

[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|The high desert terrain of the [[San Luis Valley]] in southern Colorado.]]
Most of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The only other significant population centers are at Grand Junction and [[Durango, CO|Durango]] in far western Colorado.

[[File:LovelandPass CMM.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Continental Divide]] dips down to {{convert|11990|ft|m|0|sp=us}} at [[Loveland Pass]].]]
To the west of Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The [[Continental Divide]] extends along the crest of the Rocky Mountains. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. Drainage water west of the Continental Divide flows to the southwest via the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] and the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].

Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large so-called &quot;parks&quot; or high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Colorado basin)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.

In southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.

The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain about 54 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=U.S. Forest Service |title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12140|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year round. Much of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]] and [[Central City, CO|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado.

[[File:Mount Elbert2.JPG|thumb|[[Mount Elbert]], the tallest peak in the [[Rocky Mountains]].]]
The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[North America]] all lie within the state. Colorado is home to [[List of national parks in Colorado|four national parks]], [[National monuments of Colorado|six national monuments]], [[National recreation areas of Colorado|two national recreation areas]], [[National historic sites of Colorado|two national historic sites]], [[National historic trails of Colorado|three national historic trails]], [[National scenic trail of Colorado|a national scenic trail]], [[National forests of Colorado|11 national forests]], [[National grasslands of Colorado|two national grasslands]], [[National wilderness areas of Colorado|41 national wilderness areas]], [[List of federal lands in Colorado#National Conservation Areas|two national conservation areas]], [[National wildlife refuges of Colorado|eight national wildlife refuges]], [[List of Colorado state parks|44 state parks]], [[Colorado State Forest|a state forest]], [[Colorado Division of Wildlife|323 state wildlife areas]], and numerous other scenic, historic, and recreational attractions.

The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] and the [[San Juan River (California)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. Prominent in the southwestern area of the Western Slope are the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range, and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah. The city of [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], is the largest city on the Western Slope, Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[television broadcasting]], [[newspaper]]s, and higher education on the Western Slope. The [[Mesa State College]] in Grand Junction, Western State College in Gunnison, and Fort Lewis College in Durango are the only four-year colleges in Colorado west of the [[Continental Divide]].
[[File:6408-LovelandPassCOLO.jpg|thumb|left|August, 1964. Continental Divide at the top of Loveland Pass]]

Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway of Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]], which also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.

To the southeast of Grand Junction is the [[Grand Mesa]], said to be the world's largest flat-topped mountain. Other towns of the Western Slope include [[Glenwood Springs, CO|Glenwood Springs]] with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, CO|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, CO|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, CO|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, CO|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, CO|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, CO|Telluride]].

The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely-populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which is not only a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of high, rocky hills, canyons, and streambeads. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado.

From west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands and desert plateaus, then alpine mountains with National Forests, than some scattered desert land in the southern mountain areas in the state, and then the relatively-flat grasslands and scattered forests of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, CO|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=5689 |name=Pikes Peak, Colorado |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as, the [[Royal Gorge]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Roan Plateau]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].

Colorado is one of four states in the United States that share a common geographic point the [[Four Corners]], together with Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. At this intersection, it is possible to stand in four states at once.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Bearlakeinspring2.jpg|thumb|Spring melt at [[Bear Lake (Colorado)|Bear Lake]] in [[Rocky Mountain National Park]].]]
{{main|Climate of Colorado}}
The [[climate]] of Colorado is quite complex compared to most of the United States. Unlike in other states, southern Colorado is not necessarily warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate. As a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in [[temperature]] and an increase in [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.

==== Eastern Plains ====
[[File:PivotWithDrops.JPG|thumb|[[Center pivot irrigation]] of [[wheat]] growing in [[Yuma County, CO|Yuma County]].]]

The climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Semi-arid climate#Cold Semi-arid climates|''BSk'']]'') with low [[humidity]] and moderate [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm|abbr=off}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. In summer, this area can have many days above {{convert|95|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and sometimes {{convert|100|°F|°C|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate of Colorado&quot;&gt;[http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm DRI.edu] Western Regional Climate Center. Retrieved October 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although {{convert|105|°F|°C|abbr=on}} is the maximum in the front range cities above {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In the plains, the winter extremes can be from 0 °F (-18 °C) to {{convert|-10|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-15|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from [[thunderstorm]]s, which are often severe, and from major [[snowstorm]]s that occur most often in the early spring, late autumn, and sometimes winter. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold. In much of the region, March and April are the snowiest months. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of {{convert|40|°F|°C|abbr=on}} or higher in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate of Colorado&quot;/&gt; The average July temperature is {{convert|55|°F|°C}} in the morning and {{convert|80|°F|°C}} in the afternoon. The average January temperature is {{convert|10|°F|°C}} in the morning and {{convert|30|°F|°C}} in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&amp;nbsp;°F (22&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;!--this is a temperature difference, so the convert template shouldn't be used here--&gt;

==== West of the plains and foothills ====
[[File:GrandJunctionTrip92007013.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope]] from [[Grand Junction, CO|Grand Junction]].]]

West of the plains and foothills, the weather of Colorado is much less uniform. Even places a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography of the area. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, which becomes an [[alpine climate]] at higher elevations. Humid [[microclimate]]s also exist in some areas. Generally, the wettest season in western Colorado is winter while June is the driest month. This is the opposite of precipitation patterns in the east. The mountains have cool summers with many days of high temperatures around {{convert|60|°F|°C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|70|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, although frequent thunderstorms can cause sudden drops in temperature. Summer nights are cool or even cold at the highest elevations, which sometimes get snow even in the middle of the summer. The winters bring abundant, powdery snowfall to the mountains with abundant sunshine in between major storms. The western slope has high summer temperatures similar to those found on the plains, while the winters tend to be slightly cooler due to the lack of warming winds common to the plains and Front Range. Other areas in the west have their own unique climate.

==== Extreme weather ====
[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains.]]

Extreme weather is a common occurrence in Colorado. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental divide in the spring and summer, and Colorado is one of the leading states in deaths due to [[lightning]]. [[Hail]] is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state. The Eastern Plains have some of the biggest hail storms in North America.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; Also the Eastern Plains are part of [[Tornado Alley]] and produce some of the deadliest U.S. tornadoes. Some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [[Limon, CO|Limon]] [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado and the 2008 [[Windsor, CO|Windsor]] [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado, which devastated the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The plains are also susceptible to [[flood]]s, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Denver's record in 1921 for the number of consecutive days above {{convert|90|°F|°C}} was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, there are some of the mountainous regions of Colorado which receive a huge amount of moisture via winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in such rivers as the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River|Grand River]], the Colorado River, the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]], the North Platte River, and the South Platte River. Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of fellow southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, as well as midwest like Nebraska and Kansas, and also southern states like Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently) the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.

{{Main|History of Colorado |Outline of Colorado history}}
The region that is today the State of Colorado has been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 13 millennia. The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, CO|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BCE to 3000 BCE. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the [[Americas]]. The [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] lived in the [[valley]]s and [[mesa]]s of the [[Colorado Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]&quot;, Discovery News, September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]]. The [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].

The United States acquired a territorial claim to the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim of Spain to a huge region surrounding its [[colony]] of [[Santa Fé de Nuevo Méjico]] as its [[sovereignty|sovereign]] trading zone with native peoples. [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region in 1806. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and then expelled from Mexico the following July.

[[File:Beol court25.jpg|thumb|[[Bent's Old Fort]] along the [[Arkansas River]] operated from 1833 to 1849.]]
The United States relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the United States admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[State of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of the [[Missouri Territory]], including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and would remain so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835–1836 fomented a dispute between the United States and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the United States with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.

Most American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of [[State of Deseret|Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the [[Green River (Utah)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]] rivers. The federal government of the United States flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[State of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[English American|Anglo American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].

[[File:Wpdms kansas nebraska utah territories 1860 idx.png|thumb|The territories of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] before the creation of the [[Territory of Colorado]].]]
In 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.

[[Gold]] was discovered along the [[South Platte River]] then in western [[Kansas Territory]] in July 1858, precipitating the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name=PikesPeakGold&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Falls/2000/index.html | title = The Pike's Peak Gold Rush | author = Gehling, Richard | publisher = Richard Gehling | year = 2006 | accessdate = June 12, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080628172253/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Falls/2000/index.html|archivedate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[placer deposit|placer gold deposits]] along the rivers and streams of the region rapidly played out, but miners soon discovered far more valuable seams of [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock]] gold in the nearby mountains.

[[File:Denver 1859.jpg|thumb|A [[lithograph]] of the [[Denver, CO|Denver City]] mining camp in 1859.]]
The gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.

Thirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].&lt;ref name=ColoradoTerritory&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/territory.pdf | title = An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado | format = PDF | publisher = [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]] | date = February 28, 1861 | accessdate = June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged today. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.&lt;ref name=Colorado_River&gt;Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall  Colorado River.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Spanish explorers named the Colorado River the &quot;Rio Colorado&quot; for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=State of Colorado – Division of Information Technologies |url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm#Name|title=State Names and Nicknames |accessdate=November 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, a [[U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=Macomb&gt;Report of the exploring expedition from Santa Fé, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859:

Macomb, Corps of topographical engineers, Volume 1 [http://www.archive.org/stream/reportofexplorin00unitrich#page/n5/mode/2up @ archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The Macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the Colorado River. In fact, the river that is now named the Colorado River did not flow through Colorado until the House of Representatives Joint Resolution 460 of the [[66th United States Congress]] changed the name of the Grand River to the Colorado River on July 25, 1921, in spite of the fact that the Green River had the more extensive [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref name=Grand_River&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20031223/OPINION/312230302 | title = Many years ago, the Colorado River was just Grand | author = Colorado River Water Conservation District | publisher = Summit Daily News | year = 2003 | accessdate = June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The-Battle-of-Glorieta-Pass.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], 1862]]
On April 12, 1861, [[South Carolina]] artillery opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]] to start the [[American Civil War]]. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause. In 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and ran off 500 head of their horses and mules. The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the [[Southwestern United States]].

In 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along [[Sand Creek massacre|Sand Creek]]. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so called battle was a blatant [[Sand Creek massacre|massacre]] of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been mutilated and desecrated in hideous manner. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming [[U.S. President|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished.

In the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a determined few stayed on to develop mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in the Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered [[silver]] near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to [[Julesburg, Colorado|Weir]], now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June of the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.

The [[United States Congress]] passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the [[Territory of Colorado]] to become a state.&lt;ref name=Colorado_Enabling_Act&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i2i.org/Publications/ColoradoConstitution/cnenable.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080507151300/http://www.i2i.org/Publications/ColoradoConstitution/cnenable.htm|archivedate=2008-05-07|title=An Act to Enable the People of Colorado to Form a Constitution and State Government, and for the Admission of the Said State into the Union on an Equal Footing with the Original States|format=PDF|author=[[Forty-third United States Congress]]|date=March 3, 1875|accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 1876 (28 days after the [[Centennial of the United States]]), U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

[[File:Georgetown loop 1899.jpg|thumb|The [[Georgetown Loop]] of the [[Colorado Central Railroad]] as photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1899]]
The discovery of a major [[silver]] lode near [[Leadville, CO|Leadville]] in 1878, triggered the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the [[suffrage|right to vote]] beginning on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered.

Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] met in Denver in 1908. By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. Census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. [[Tourism]] became a mainstay of the state economy, and [[high technology]] became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.

Three [[warship]]s of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the USS ''[[USS Colorado|Colorado]]''. The first USS ''Colorado'' was named for the Colorado River. The later two ships were named in honor of the state, including the [[battleship]] USS ''[[USS Colorado (BB-45)|Colorado]]'' which served in [[War in the Pacific|World War II in the Pacific]] beginning in 1941. At the time of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], this USS ''Colorado'' was located at the naval base in [[San Diego, CA|San Diego, Calif.]] and hence went unscathed.

[[File:Colorado population map.png|thumb|left|410px|Colorado Population Density Map]]
Colorado's most populous city, and capital, is [[Denver, CO|Denver]]. The [[Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area]] with an estimated 2009 population of 3,110,436, is home to 61.90% of the state's residents.

As of 2005, Colorado has an estimated population of 4,665,177, which is an increase of 63,356, or 1.4%, from the prior year and an increase of 363,162, or 8.4%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 205,321 people (that is 353,091 births minus 147,770 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 159,957 people into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 112,217 people, and [[Human migration|migration]] within the country produced a net increase of 47,740 people.

The largest increases are expected in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]], especially in the [[Denver metropolitan area]]. The state's fastest-growing counties are [[Douglas County, CO|Douglas]] and [[Weld County, CO|Weld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/top10/countyPop/coPop6.html |title=Epodunk.com |publisher=Epodunk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[center of population]] of Colorado is located just north of the village of Critchell in [[Jefferson County, CO|Jefferson County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Population and Population Centers by State – 2000 | publisher = United States Census Bureau | accessdate = December 4, 2008 | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado has a high proportion of [[Hispanic]], mostly [[Mexican-American]], citizens in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs, as well as the smaller cities of Greeley and Pueblo, and in many other smaller cities and towns all throughout the state. Colorado is well known for its strong [[Latino]] culture and presence. Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern Colorado has a large number of [[Hispanos]], the descendants of the early Mexican settlers of colonial Spanish origin. The [[2000 U.S. Census]] found that 10.5% of people aged five and over in Colorado speak only Spanish at home, with the 2009 estimate being roughly 14%. Colorado also has a large immigration presence all throughout the state, which has led to Colorado cities being referred to as &quot;Sanctuary Cities&quot; for illegal immigrants as well. Colorado has the 5th highest percentage of undocumented people in the U.S., only behind Nevada, Arizona, California, and tied with Texas. An estimated 5.5-6.0% of the states population being illegal immigrants. Also, over 20% of the states prisons are undocumented inmates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cairco.org/issues/issues_crime_colorado.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;state_id=8&amp;mode=state_tops&amp;order=r |title=Language Map Data Center |publisher=Mla.org |date=2007-07-17 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado, like New Mexico, is very rich in archaic Spanish idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcastellano.org/palabra.php?id=946 |title=talking about Colorado in &quot;nada&quot; |publisher=Elcastellano.org |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado also has some African-American communities located in Denver, in the neighborhoods of Montbello, Green Valley Ranch, Park Hill, Five Points, Whittier, and many other East Denver areas. A decent amount of African Americans are also found in Colorado Springs on the east and southeast side of the city. The state has sizable numbers of [[Asian-Americans]] of [[Mongolian American|Mongolian]], [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Koreans|Korean]], [[Southeast Asian]] and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent. The highest population of Asian Americans can be found on the south and southeast side of Denver, as well as some on Denver's southwest side.

Early industry was based on the extraction and processing of minerals and agricultural products. Current agricultural products are [[cattle]], [[wheat]], [[dairy product]]s, [[maize|corn]], and [[hay]].

The [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] is also a major economic force in the state with many important federal facilities including [[NORAD]], [[United States Air Force Academy]] and [[Peterson Air Force Base]] in [[Colorado Springs]]; [[NOAA]] and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]]; [[U.S. Geological Survey]] and other government agencies at the Denver Federal Center in [[Lakewood, CO|Lakewood]]; the [[Denver Mint]], [[Buckley Air Force Base]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in Denver; and a federal [[ADX Florence|Supermax Prison]] and other federal [[prisons]] near [[Cañon City, CO|Cañon City]].

A number of nationally known brand names have originated in Colorado factories and laboratories. From [[Denver#Economy|Denver]] came the forerunner of telecommunications giant [[Qwest Corporation|Qwest]] in 1879, [[Samsonite]] luggage in 1910, [[Gates Corporation|Gates]] belts and hoses in 1911, and [[Russell Stover Candies]] in 1923. Kuner canned vegetables began in [[Brighton, CO|Brighton]] in 1864. From [[Golden, CO|Golden]] came [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer in 1873, [[CoorsTek]] industrial ceramics in 1920, and [[Jolly Rancher]] candy in 1949. [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|CF&amp;I]] railroad rails, wire, nails and pipe debuted in [[Pueblo, CO|Pueblo]] in 1892. [[Imperial Sugar|Holly Sugar]] was first milled from beets in [[Holly, CO|Holly]] in 1905, and later moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs. The present-day [[Swift &amp; Company|Swift]] packed meat of [[Greeley, CO|Greeley]] evolved from Monfort of Colorado, Inc., established in 1930. [[Estes Industries|Estes]] model rockets were launched in [[Penrose, CO|Penrose]] in 1958. [[Fort Collins, CO|Fort Collins]] has been the home of [[Woodward Governor Company]]'s motor controllers (governors) since 1870, and [[Oral irrigator|Waterpik]] dental water jets and showerheads since 1962. [[Celestial Seasonings]] herbal teas have been made in [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]] since 1969. [[Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory]] made its first candy in [[Durango, CO|Durango]] in 1981.

Colorado has a flat 4.63% [[income tax]], regardless of income level. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal ''adjusted gross income'', Colorado taxes are based on ''taxable income'' – income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions.&lt;ref&gt;Colorado individual income tax return (2005) [http://www.revenue.state.co.us/PDF/05104f.pdf Revenue.state.co.us].

Retrieved September 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado's state [[sales tax]] is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return. Many counties and cities charge their own rates in addition to the base state rate. There are also certain county and special district taxes that may apply.

[[Real estate]] and personal business property are taxable in Colorado. The state's senior property tax exemption was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The tax break is scheduled to return for assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.

As of September 2010, the state's unemployment rate is 8.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===
Major [[philanthropic]] organizations based in Colorado, including the [[Daniels Fund]], the Anschutz Family Foundation, the [[Gates Family Foundation]], the El Pomar Foundation and the [[Boettcher Foundation]], grant approximately $400 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradofunders.org/docs/2007%20Giving%20Study%20PublishedFinal_1.pdf Coloradofunders.org]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; each year from approximately $7 billion&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cof.org/files/Documents/Government/StateGiving/CO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of assets.

=== Natural resources ===
Colorado has significant [[hydrocarbon]] resources. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Colorado hosts seven of the Nation’s 100 largest [[natural gas]] fields and two of its 100 largest [[oil field]]s. Conventional and unconventional natural gas output from several Colorado basins typically account for more than 5 percent of annual U.S. natural gas production. Colorado’s [[oil shale]] deposits hold an estimated {{convert|1|Toilbbl|km3}} of oil – nearly as much oil as the entire world’s proven oil reserves; the economic viability of the oil shale, however, has not been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial deposits of [[bituminous coal|bituminous]], [[sub-bituminous coal|subbituminous]], and [[lignite]] coal are found in the state. [[Kimberlite]] [[volcanic pipe]]s have been found in Colorado; the [[Kelsey Lake Diamond Mine]] operated for several years, recovering gem quality [[diamond]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Colorado's high Rocky Mountain ridges and eastern plains offer [[wind power]] potential, and geologic activity in the mountain areas provides potential for [[geothermal power]] development. Much of the state is sunny and could produce [[solar power]]. Major rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains offer [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] resources. Corn grown in the flat eastern part of the state offers potential resources for [[ethanol]] production.

===Accidents===
In 2011, Colorado ranked among the five deadliest states for debris/litter–caused vehicle accidents per total number of registered vehicles and population size. Figures derived from the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) show at least 16 persons in Colorado were killed each year in motor vehicle collisions with non-fixed objects, including debris, dumped litter, animals and their carcasses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the [[United States]] including Colorado, most civil aviation incidents are investigated by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB), as well as the [[Colorado Bureau of Investigations]] (CBI). When investigating an aviation disaster, NTSB investigators piece together evidence from the crash and determine the likely cause or causes. Where as the CBI will also investigate if there is any involved criminal actions.

[[File:Denver capital.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Colorado State Capitol]] in [[Denver]]]]

Just like all the states, Colorado's [[state constitution]] provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches. The [[List of Governors of Colorado|Governor]] heads the state's executive branch. The [[Colorado Supreme Court]] is the highest judicial court in the state. The state legislative body is the [[Colorado General Assembly]], which is made up of two houses, the [[Colorado House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Colorado Senate|Senate]].

The House has 65 members and the Senate has 35. Currently, the House is controlled by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] by a one vote majority and the Senate is controlled by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The 2005 Colorado General Assembly was the first to be controlled by the Democrats in forty years. The incumbent governor is Democrat [[John Hickenlooper]].

Most Coloradans are originally native to other states (nearly 60% according to the 2000 census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|Politics of Colorado}}

Colorado is considered a [[swing state]] in both state and federal elections. Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado supported Democrats [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and [[Barack Obama]] in 2008, and supported Republicans [[Bob Dole|Robert J. Dole]] in 1996 and [[George W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]]. The presidential outcome in 2008 was the second closest to the national popular vote, after Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Colorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, CO|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, CO|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.

*In Denver, the employer is liable for US$4.00 per employee per month and the employee is liable for US$5.75 per month.
*In Aurora, both employer and employees are liable for US$2.00 per month.

===Districts===
The State of Colorado has more than 3,000 districts with taxing authority.  These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.

Some of these districts have authority to levy sales tax and well as property tax and use fees.  This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado.  There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.

Some of the more notable Colorado districts are:
* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties
* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties
** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).
** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.
** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three &quot;tiers&quot; among which receipts are allocated by percentage.
*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.
*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.
*** Tier III has over 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.
** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.
* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[INVESCO Field at Mile High]]
* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties
* Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Gunnison County

The '''Carboniferous''' is a [[geologic period|geologic period and system]] that extends from the end of the [[Devonian]] Period, about 359.2 ± 2.5 [[annum|Mya]] (million years ago), to the beginning of the [[Permian]] Period, about 299.0 ± 0.8 Mya {{ICS 2004}}.

The Carboniferous was a time of [[glacier|glaciation]], low sea level and mountain building, diversification and extinction; a minor marine and terrestrial [[extinction event]] among animals and plants ([[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]]) occurred in the middle of the period caused by climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from the Latin word for coal, ''carbo''. Carboniferous means &quot;coal-bearing&quot;. Many coal beds were laid down globally during this period, hence the name.

==Subdivisions==
In the USA the Carboniferous is usually broken into [[Mississippian]] (earlier) and [[Pennsylvanian]] (later) Periods. The Mississippian is about twice as long as the Pennsylvanian, but due to the large thickness of coal bearing deposits with Pennsylvanian ages in Europe and North America, the two subperiods were long thought to have been more or less equal.&lt;ref&gt;Menning ''et al.'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stage (stratigraphy)|faunal stage]]s from youngest to oldest, together with some of their subdivisions, are:

'''Late Pennsylvanian: Gzhelian (most recent)'''
* Noginskian / Virgilian ''(part)''

'''Late Pennsylvanian: Kasimovian'''
* Klazminskian
* Dorogomilovksian / Virgilian ''(part)''
* Chamovnicheskian / Cantabrian / Missourian
* Krevyakinskian / Cantabrian / Missourian

'''Middle Pennsylvanian: Moscovian'''
* Myachkovskian / Bolsovian / Desmoinesian
* Podolskian / Desmoinesian
* Kashirskian / Atokan
* Vereiskian / Bolsovian / Atokan

'''Early Pennsylvanian: Bashkirian / Morrowan'''
* Melekesskian / Duckmantian
* Cheremshanskian / Langsettian
* Yeadonian
* Marsdenian
* Kinderscoutian

'''Late Mississippian: Serpukhovian'''
* Alportian
* Chokierian / Chesterian / Elvirian
* Arnsbergian / Elvirian
* Pendleian

'''Middle Mississippian: Visean'''
* Brigantian / St Genevieve / Gasperian / Chesterian
* Asbian / Meramecian
* Holkerian / Salem
* Arundian / Warsaw / Meramecian
* Chadian / Keokuk / Osagean ''(part)'' / Osage ''(part)''

A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [[crinoids]] and [[ammonites]] especially hard.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; This sea level drop and the associated [[unconformity]] in North America separate the Mississippian subperiod from the Pennsylvanian subperiod.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; This happened about 318 million years ago, at the onset of the [[Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation]].{{citation needed|reason=A non-image and a college course do not a cite make|date=July 2010}}

The Carboniferous was a time of active [[orogeny|mountain-building]], as the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] came together. The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America–Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly-uplifted [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and [[South China (continent)|South China]] continents were still separated from [[Laurasia]]. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an &quot;O.&quot;

There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous—[[Panthalassa]] and [[Paleo-Tethys]], which was inside the &quot;O&quot; in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]]), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and Siberia continents, creating the [[Ural Mountains]]) and [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (closed by [[North China (continent)|North China]] collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]/[[Kazakhstania]]).

==Climate==
The early part of the Carboniferous was mostly warm; in the later part of the Carboniferous, the [[climate]] [[global cooling|cooled]]. Glaciations in [[Gondwana]], triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the [[Permian]] and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as [[Permo-Carboniferous]] in age.

The cooling and drying of the climate led to the [[Rainforest Collapse|Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC). Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt;

==Rocks and coal==
[[Image:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]
Carboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]] beds.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (1999), p 426&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.

The large coal deposits of the Carboniferous primarily owe their existence to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[bark]]-bearing trees (and in particular the [[evolution]] of the bark fiber [[lignin]]). The second is the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the [[Devonian]] period. This allowed for the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. Some{{who|date=May 2010}} hypothesize that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacteria]] had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] that could effectively digest the new lignin. Those early plants made extensive use of lignin. They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than [[Basidiomycetes]] fungi can degrade it. It can not be oxidized in an atmosphere of less than 5% oxygen. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and inhibits decay of other substances.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, JM. 1990 Lignin, land plants, and fungi: Biological evolution affecting Phanerozoic oxygen balance. Geology 18; 607–610, on p608.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the reason for its high percentages is protection from insect herbivory in a world containing very effective insect herbivores, but nothing remotely as effective as modern [[insectivores]] and probably many fewer poisons than currently. In any case coal measures could easily have made thick deposits on well drained soils as well as swamps. The extensive burial of biologically-produced [[carbon]] led to a buildup of surplus [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere; estimates place the peak oxygen content as high as 35%, compared to 21% today.[http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:16907261&amp;ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20b%3ADocG%3AResult&amp;ao=] This oxygen level probably increased [[wildfire]] activity, as well as resulted in [[insect]] and [[amphibian]] [[gigantism]]--creatures whose size is constrained by [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] systems that are limited in their ability to diffuse oxygen.

In eastern North America, marine beds are more common in the older part of the period than the later part and are almost entirely absent by the late Carboniferous. More diverse geology existed elsewhere, of course. Marine life is especially rich in [[crinoids]] and other [[echinodermata|echinoderms]]. [[Brachiopoda|Brachiopods]] were abundant. [[Trilobite]]s became quite uncommon. On land, large and diverse [[plant]] populations existed. Land [[vertebrata|vertebrates]] included large amphibians.

==Life==
===Plants===

[[Image:Meyers b15 s0272b.jpg|thumb|250px|Etching depicting some of the most significant plants of the Carboniferous.]]
[[Mississippian|Early Carboniferous]] land plants were very similar to those of the preceding Late [[Devonian]], but new groups also appeared at this time.

The main Early Carboniferous plants were the [[Equisetales]] (horse-tails), [[Sphenophyllum|Sphenophyllales]] (vine-like plants), [[Lycopodiales]] (club mosses), [[Lepidodendrales]] (scale trees), [[Filicales]] (ferns), [[Medullosales]] (informally included in the &quot;[[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]]&quot;, an artificial assemblage of a number of early [[gymnosperm]] groups) and the [[Cordaitales]]. These continued to dominate throughout the period, but during [[Pennsylvanian|late Carboniferous]], several other groups, [[Cycadophyta]] (cycads), the [[Callistophytales]] (another group of &quot;seed ferns&quot;), and the [[Voltziales]] (related to and sometimes included under the [[conifers]]), appeared.

The Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales, which are cousins (but not ancestors) of the tiny club-moss of today, were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1.5 meters in diameter. These included ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' (with its fruit cone called [[Lepidostrobus]]), ''[[Halonia]]'', ''[[Lepidophloios]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]''. The roots of several of these forms are known as [[Stigmaria]]. The Cladoxylopsids were large trees, that were ancestors of ferns, first arising in the Carboniferous.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern ''Fern''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment]. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

The fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species. Probably many species were [[epiphytic]]. Fossil ferns and &quot;seed ferns&quot; include ''[[Pecopteris]]'', ''[[Cyclopteris]]'', ''[[Neuropteris]]'', ''[[Alethopteris]]'', and ''[[Sphenopteris]]''; ''[[Megaphyton]]'' and ''[[Caulopteris]]'' were tree ferns.

The Equisetales included the common giant form ''[[Calamites]]'', with a trunk diameter of 30 to {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}} and a height of up to {{convert|20|m|0|abbr=on}}. ''[[Sphenophyllum]]'' was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods.

''[[Cordaites]]'', a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the [[catkin]]-like inflorescence, which bore yew-like berries, is called ''[[Cardiocarpus]]''. These plants were thought to live in swamps and mangroves. True coniferous trees (''[[Walchia]]'', of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.

===Marine invertebrates===
In the oceans the most important [[marine invertebrate]] groups are the [[foraminifera]], [[Anthozoa|corals]], [[bryozoa]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[echinoderm]]s (especially [[crinoid]]s).

For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''[[Fusulina]]'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''[[Valvulina]]'', ''[[Endothyra]]'', ''[[Archaediscus]]'', and ''[[Saccammina]]'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still extant.

The microscopic shells of [[radiolaria]]ns are found in [[chert]]s of this age in [[River Culm|the Culm]] of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere.

[[Porifera|Sponges]] are known from [[spicule]]s and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the [[Calcispongea]] ''[[Cotyliscus]]'' and ''[[Girtycoelia]]'', the [[demosponge]] ''[[Chaetetes]]'', and the genus of unusual colonial [[Hyalospongea|glass sponges]] ''[[Titusvillia]]''.

Both [[reef]]-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both [[Rugosa|rugose]] (for example, ''[[Canina]]''&lt;!-- Caninia (genus) ? --&gt;, ''[[Corwenia]]'', ''[[Neozaphrentis]]''), [[Heterocorallia|heterocorals]], and [[Tabulata|tabulate]] (for example, ''[[Chladochonus]]'', ''[[Michelinia]]'') forms.

[[Conularids]] were well represented by ''[[Conularia]]''

[[Bryozoa]] are abundant in some regions; the [[Fenestellida|fenestellids]] including ''[[Fenestella (bryozoan)|Fenestella]]'', ''[[Polypora]]'', and the remarkable ''[[Archimedes (bryozoan)|Archimedes]]'', so named because it is in the shape of an [[Archimedean screw]].

[[Brachiopod]]s are also abundant; they include [[Productida|productids]], some of which (for example, ''[[Gigantoproductus]]'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''[[Chonetes]]'' were more conservative in form. [[Athyridida|Athyridids]], [[Spiriferida|spiriferids]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellids]], and [[Terebratulida|terebratulids]] are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''[[Discina (brachiopod)|Discina]]'' and ''[[Crania (genus)|Crania]]''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.

[[Annelid]]s such as ''[[Serpulites]]'' are common fossils in some horizons.

Among the mollusca, the [[bivalve]]s continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''[[Aviculopecten]]'', ''[[Posidonomya]]'', ''[[Nucula]]'', ''[[Carbonicola]]'', ''[[Edmondia (bivalve)|Edmondia]]'', and ''[[Modiola (bivalve)|Modiola]]''

''[[Conocardium]]'' is a common [[Rostroconchia|rostroconch]].

[[Gastropod]]s are also numerous, including the genera ''[[Murchisonia (gastropod)|Murchisonia]]'', ''[[Euomphalus]]'', ''[[Naticopsis]]''.

[[Nautiloid]] [[cephalopod]]s are represented by tightly coiled [[Nautilida|nautilids]], with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. [[Goniatite]] [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] are common.

[[Trilobite]]s are rarer than in previous periods, represented only by the proetid group. [[Ostracod]]s, a class of [[crustacean]] [[zooplankton]], were abundant; genera included ''[[Cythere]]'', ''[[Kirkbya]]'', and ''[[Beyrichia]]''.

Amongst the [[echinoderm]]s, the [[crinoid]]s were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''[[Cyathocrinus]]'', ''[[Woodocrinus]]'', and ''[[Actinocrinus]]''. Echinoids such as ''[[Archaeocidaris]]'' and ''[[Palaeechinus]]'' were also present. The [[blastoid]]s, which included the [[Pentreinitidae]] and [[Codasteridae]] and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Fish===
Many fish inhabited the Carboniferous seas; predominantly [[Elasmobranch]]s (sharks and their relatives). These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[petalodont]]s, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the [[Palaeonisciformes]] found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. [[Sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygia]]n fish were also prominent, and one group, the [[Rhizodont]]s, reached very large size.

Most species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole.

Freshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera ''[[Ctenodus]]'', ''[[Uronemus]]'', ''[[Acanthodes]]'', ''[[Cheirodus]]'', and ''[[Gyracanthus]]''.

[[Shark]]s (especially the ''Stethacanthids'') underwent a major [[evolutionary radiation]] during the Carboniferous.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; It is believed that this evolutionary radiation occurred because the decline of the [[Placodermi|placoderms]] at the end of the Devonian period caused many [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] to become unoccupied and allowed new organisms to evolve and fill these niches.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; As a result of the evolutionary radiation carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapes including ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' who possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of [[denticles]] on its top.&lt;ref name=goldsharks/&gt; ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.&lt;ref name=goldsharks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/golden_age.htm |title=A Golden Age of Sharks |accessdate=2008-06-23 |work=Biology of Sharks and Rays |author=R. Aidan Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freshwater and lagoonal invertebrates===
Freshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''[[Anthracomya]]'', ''[[Naiadiles]]'', and ''[[Carbonicola]]''; diverse [[crustacean]]s such as ''[[Bairdia]]'', ''[[Carbonita (genus)|Carbonita]]'', ''[[Estheria (crustacean)|Estheria]]'', ''[[Acanthocaris]]'', ''[[Dithyrocaris]]'', and ''[[Anthrapalaemon]]''.

The [[Eurypterid]]s were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as ''[[Eurypterus]]'', ''[[Glyptoscorpius]]'', ''[[Anthraconectes]]'', ''[[Megarachne]]'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider) and the specialised very large ''[[Hibbertopterus]]''. Many of these were amphibious.

Frequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', [[Orbiculoidea]], and ''[[Productus]]'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.

===Terrestrial invertebrates===
[[Image:Meganeura.jpg|thumb|The late Carboniferous giant dragonfly-like insect ''[[Meganeura]]'' grew to wingspans of {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]
[[Image:Pulmonoscopius BW.jpg|thumb|The gigantic ''[[Pulmonoscorpius]]'' from the early Carboniferous reached a length of up to one metre.]]
Fossil remains of air-breathing [[insect]]s, [[myriapod]]s and [[arachnid]]s are known from the late Carboniferous, but so far not from the early Carboniferous. Their diversity when they do appear, however, shows that these arthropods were both well developed and numerous. Their large size can be attributed to the moistness of the environment (mostly swampy fern forests) and the fact that the oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere in the Carboniferous was much higher than today. (The oxygen concentration in the Earth's atmosphere during the Carboniferous was 35% whereas the oxygen concentration in earth's current atmosphere is 21%.) This required less effort for respiration and allowed [[Arthropoda|arthropods]] to grow larger with the up to 2.6 metres long millipede-like ''[[Arthropleura]]'' being the largest known land invertebrate of all time. Among the insect groups are the huge predatory [[Protodonata]] (griffinflies), among which was ''[[Meganeura]]'', a giant [[dragonfly]]-like insect and with a wingspan of ca. {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}} — the largest flying insect ever to roam the planet. Further groups are the [[Syntonopterodea]] (relatives of present-day [[Ephemeroptera|mayflies]]), the abundant and often large sap-sucking [[Palaeodictyopteroidea]], the diverse herbivorous [[Protorthoptera]], and numerous [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[Dictyoptera]] (ancestors of [[Blattaria|cockroaches]]). Many insects have been obtained from the coalfields of [[Saarbrücken]] and [[Commentry]], and from the hollow trunks of fossil trees in Nova Scotia. Some British coalfields have yielded good specimens: ''[[Archaeoptitus]]'', from the Derbyshire coalfield, had a spread of wing extending to more than 35&amp;nbsp;cm; some specimens (''[[Brodia]]'') still exhibit traces of brilliant wing colors. In the Nova Scotian tree trunks land snails (''[[Archaeozonites]]'', ''[[Dendropupa]]'') have been found.

===Tetrapods===
Carboniferous [[amphibian]]s were diverse and common by the middle of the period, more so than they are today; some were as long as 6 meters, and those fully terrestrial as adults had scaly skin.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley (1999), p 411-12.&lt;/ref&gt; They included a number of basal tetrapod groups classified in early books under the [[Labyrinthodont]]ia. These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the [[Lepospondyli]], often only about {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''[[Loxomma]]'', ''[[Eogyrinus]]'', ''[[Proterogyrinus]]''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''[[Ophiderpeton]]'', ''[[Amphibamus]]'', ''[[Hyloplesion]]'') or terrestrial (''[[Dendrerpeton]]'', ''[[Tuditanus]]'', ''[[Anthracosaurus]]'').

The [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however prospered due to specific key adaptations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt; One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the [[amniote]] egg, which allowed for the further exploitation of the land by certain [[tetrapod]]s. These included the earliest [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]] reptiles (''[[Hylonomus]]''), and the earliest known [[synapsid]] (''[[Archaeothyris]]''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants. The amniote egg allowed these ancestors of all later [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, and [[reptile]]s to reproduce on land by preventing the desiccation, or drying-out, of the [[embryo]] inside.

Reptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation, in response to the drier climate that proceeded the rainforest collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kazlev&gt;M. Alan Kazlev (1998) [http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Carboniferous/Carboniferous.htm The Carboniferous Period of the Paleozoic Era: 299 to 359 million years ago], [[Palaeos]].org, Retrieved on 2008-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Carboniferous period, [[amniotes]] had already diversified into a number of groups, including [[Protorothyrididae|protorothyridids]], [[captorhinidae|captorhinids]], [[Araeoscelidia|aeroscelid]]s, and several [[Family (biology)|families]] of [[pelycosaur]]s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Fungal life===
Because plants and animals were growing in size and abundance in this time (for example,, ''[[Lepidodendron]]''), land [[fungi]] diversified further. Marine [[fungi]] still occupied the oceans. All modern [[class (biology)|classes]] of fungi were present in the Late Carboniferous ([[Pennsylvanian]] Epoch).&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Meredith, Vilgalys, Rytas, James, Timothy Y., and Taylor, John W. 2008.

==Extinction events==
In the middle Carboniferous, an [[extinction event]] occurred. On land this event is referred to as the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC).&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt; Vast tropical rainforests collapsed suddenly as the [[climate change]]d from hot and humid to cool and arid. This was likely caused by intense [[glaciation]] and a drop in sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author= Heckel, P.H. | year=2008 | title=Pennsylvanian cyclothems in Midcontinent North America as far-field effects of waxing and waning of Gondwana ice sheets | journal=Resolving the late Paleozoic ice age in time and space:Geological Society of America Special Paper | volume =441  | pages = 275–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new climatic conditions were not favorable to the growth of rainforest and the animals within them. Rainforests shrank into isolated islands, surrounded by seasonally dry habitats. Towering [[lycopsid]] forests with a heterogenus mixture of vegetation were replaced by much less diverse tree-fern dominated flora.

Amphibians, the dominant vertebrates at the time fared poorly through this event with large losses in biodiversity; reptiles continued to diversify due to key adaptations that let them survive in the drier habitat, specifically the hard-shelled egg and scales both of which retain water better than their amphibian counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt;

The '''Comoros''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-Comoros.ogg|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|ər|oʊ|z}}; {{lang-ar|جزر القمر}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ǧuzur al-Qumur/Qamar}}''), officially the '''Union of the Comoros''' ([[Comorian language|Comorian]]: ''Udzima wa Komori,'' {{lang-fr|Union des Comores}}, {{lang-ar|الاتحاد القمري}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Ittiḥād al-Qumurī/Qamarī}}'') is an [[archipelago]] [[island nation]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], located off the eastern coast of [[Africa]], on the northern end of the [[Mozambique Channel]], between northeastern [[Mozambique]] and northwestern [[Madagascar]]. Other [[country|countries]] near to the Comoros are [[Tanzania]] to the northwest and the [[Seychelles]] to the northeast. The capital is [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]] on [[Grande Comore]].

At {{convert|1862|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} (excluding [[Mayotte]]),&lt;ref&gt;Dominique and Michelle Frémy (2004).''Quid 2005 ''Editions Robert Laffont. p.1175.&lt;/ref&gt; the Comoros is the third-smallest African nation by area. With a [[population]] estimated at 798,000 (excluding [[Mayotte]]), it is the sixth-smallest African nation by population—although it has one of the highest [[population density|population densities]] in Africa. Its name derives from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{transl|ar| القمر ''qamar''}} (&quot;[[moon]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comores-online.com/mwezinet/histoire/islandsofthemoon.htm |title=Comores Online.com – reference to the history of the name |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[archipelago]] is notable for its diverse culture and history, as a nation formed at the crossroads of many civilizations. It is the southern most member state of the [[Arab League]]. Though in the contested island of Mayotte the sole official language is French, the &quot;Union of the Comoros&quot; has three official languages: [[Comorian language|Comorian]], [[Arabic]], and French.

The country officially consists of the four islands in the [[volcanic island|volcanic]] [[Comoros archipelago]]: northwestermost [[Grande Comore]] or Ngazidja, [[Mohéli]] or Mwali, [[Anjouan]] or Nzwani, and southeastermost [[Mayotte]] or Maore, as well as many smaller islands. However, the government of the Comoros (or its predecessors, since independence) has never administered the island of Mayotte, which [[France]] administers as an [[overseas department]]. Mayotte was the only island in the archipelago that voted against independence from France in 1974; the latter has [[veto]]ed [[United Nations Security Council]] resolutions that would affirm Comorian [[sovereignty]] over the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA31_first-resolution&quot;&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}The first UN General Assembly Resolution regarding the matter, &quot;[http://un.cti.depaul.edu/Countries/Comoros/1156213396.pdf Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte] (PDF),&quot; United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/31/4, (21 October 1976) states &quot;the occupation by France of the Comorian island of Mayotte constitutes a flagrant encroachment on the national unity of the Comorian State, a Member of the United Nations,&quot; rejecting the French-administered referendums and condemning French presence in Mayotte.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As defined by the [[Organization of African Unity]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Movement of Non-Aligned Countries]], the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], and the [[United Nations General Assembly]]: the most recent UN General Assembly Resolution regarding the matter, &quot;Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte,&quot; United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/49/18, (6 December 1994) states &quot;the results of the referendum of 22 December 1974 were to be considered on a global basis and not island by island,...Reaffirms the sovereignty of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros over the island of Mayotte&quot;.{{Dead link|date=July 2010}} [http://un.cti.depaul.edu/public/Comoros/10/English/ Several resolutions expressing similar sentiments were passed between 1977 (31/4) and 1994 (49/18).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GlobalPolicy_SC-Vetoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm |title=Subjects of UN Security Council Vetoes |publisher=Global Policy Forum |accessdate=2008-03-27|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080317010910/http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm |archivedate = March 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;article33&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://untreaty.un.org/cod/repertory/art33/english/rep_supp5_vol2-art33_e.pdf |title=Article 33 |format=PDF |work=UN Treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a 29 March 2009 [[referendum]] on Mayotte's becoming an [[overseas department]] of France in 2011 was passed overwhelmingly by the people of Mayotte.

The Comoros is the only state to be a member of all of the following: [[African Union]], [[Francophonie]], [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], [[Arab League]], and [[Indian Ocean Commission]]. The country has had a history marked by numerous ''[[coups d'état]]'' since [[independence]] in 1975. As of 2008 about half the population lives below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf ''Human Development Indices''], Table 3: Human and income poverty, p. 35.

{{Main|History of Comoros}}

=== Precolonial inhabitation ===
[[File:Moroni Capital of the Comores Photo by Sascha Grabow.jpg|thumb|left|Moroni with Harbor Bay and Central Mosque, Capital of the Comoros]]

[[Image:Vanilla plantation in wood dsc00190.jpg|thumb|upright|Vanilla plantation.]]
The first human inhabitants of the Comoros Islands are thought to have been [[Africa]]n and [[Austronesian]] settlers who traveled to the islands by boat. These people arrived no later than the sixth century AD, the date of the earliest known archaeological site, found on [[Nzwani]], although settlement beginning as early as the first century has been postulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Country Study: Comoros |publisher=US Department of the Army |author=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress under the Country Studies/Area Handbook Program |month=August |year=1994 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/kmtoc.html |accessdate=January  2007 |location=Washington, D.C.  |editor=Ralph K. Benesch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands of Comoros became populated by a succession of diverse groups from the coast of Africa, the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Malay Archipelago]], and [[Madagascar]]. [[Swahili people|Swahili]] settlers first reached the islands as a part of the greater [[Bantu expansion]] that took place in Africa throughout the first millennium.

According to a famous pre-Islamic mythology: A jinni (possibly Spirit) dropped a [[Gemstone|jewel]], which formed a great circular inferno. This became the Kartala volcano which, created the island of Comoros. The early inhabitants of the islands worshiped nature and most probably the moon which they believed controlled the tides, these beliefs unified the islands.

Development of the Comoros is divided into phases, beginning with Swahili influence and settlement in the Dembeni phase (ninth to tenth centuries), during which each island maintained a single, central village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas Spear |title=Early Swahili History Reconsidered |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |volume=33 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=257–290|doi=10.2307/220649 |publisher=Boston University African Studies Center |jstor=220649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, trade with the island of [[Madagascar]] and merchants from the [[Middle East]] flourished, smaller villages emerged, and existing towns expanded. The citizens {{refnec|and historians|date=January 2011}} of the Comoros state that early Arab settlements date to even before their known arrival to the archipelago, and Swahili historians frequently trace genealogies back to Arab ancestors who had traveled from Yemen and the ancient kingdom of Saba' in Eden (thought to be the biblical Eden), even though people are unsure if this is fake.

In the year 933 [[Al-Masudi]] mentions [[Omani]] sailors, who call the Comoros islands &quot;The Perfume Islands&quot; and sing of waves that break rhythmically along broad, pearl-sand beaches, the light breezes scented with [[Vanilla]] and [[ylang-ylang]], a component in many perfumes.

In 1154, Arab geographer al-Idrisi depicted the Comoros on a map and mentioned how its sailors sold metal tools for [[gold]] and [[ivory]] in [[East Africa]]; he considered the island more stable and individually prosperous than the busy coastal ports of [[Mombasa]], [[Zanzibar]], [[Kilwa]] and [[Kitao]]. In the 15th century, the Arab seafarer [[Ahmad ibn Majid]] drew the individual routes among these islands.

=== Medieval Comoros ===
According to legend, in 632, upon hearing of [[Islam]], islanders are said to have dispatched an emissary, the navigator [[Qumralu]], to [[Mecca]]—but by the time he arrived there, the [[Prophet Muhammad]] had died. Nonetheless, after a stay in Mecca, he returned to Qanbalu and led the gradual conversion of his islanders to Islam.

Even though it was [[Arab]] merchants who first brought Arab and [[Islamic]] influence to the islands. One possibility is that [[Arab slave trade|Arabs traded for slaves in Africa]], increasing the spread and dominance of Arab culture. As their religion gained hold, small [[mosque]]s and large [[mosque]]s were constructed. The Comoro Islands, like other coastal areas in the region, were important stops in early Islamic trade routes frequented by Persians and Arabs. Despite its distance from the coast, Comoros is situated along the ''Swahili Coast'' in [[East Africa]]. It was a major hub of trade and an important location in the sea route between [[Kilwa]] (an outlet for [[Zimbabwe]]an gold) in [[Mozambique]] and [[Mombasa]] in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas Spear |title=Early Swahili History Reconsidered |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |volume=33 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=264–5 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab colonization in the region increased when nearby [[Zanzibar]] came under [[Oman]]i rule, and Comorian culture, especially architecture and religion, also increasingly came under Arab imperial sway.  [[Sultans on the Comoros|Many rival sultanates]] colonized the area in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas Spear |title=The Shirazi in Swahili Traditions, Culture, and History |journal=History in Africa |volume=11 |year=1984 |pages=291–305|doi=10.2307/3171638 |publisher=African Studies Association |jstor=3171638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Europeans showed interest in the Comoros, the dominant Arab cultural veneer of the islands led many to remind of the society's Arab colonial history at the expense of its native Swahili and African heritage. More recent western scholarship by [[Thomas Spear]] and Randall Pouwells emphasizes black African historical predominance over the diffusionist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=History in Africa |volume=11 |year=1984 |pages=237–267 |author=Randall L. Pouwels |title=Oral Historiography and the Shirazi of the East African Coast|doi=10.2307/3171636 |publisher=African Studies Association |jstor=3171636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European contact and French colonization ===
[[File:Camora.jpg|thumb|An 1808 map refers to the islands as &quot;Camora&quot;.]]
[[File:Franz Sikora 038.jpg|thumb|Sultan Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore (1897)]]
[[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers first visited the [[archipelago]] in 1505.

By the year 1506 the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] landed on the islands and began to challenge the ''Bajas'' (Bantu Muslim chiefs) and ''Fanis'' (lesser chiefs). In the years that followed the islands were sacked by the forces of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in the year 1514 by the Portuguese. The ruler of the Comoran Muslims barely survived after hiding in an extinct volcanic crater despite the inadequacy of their cover, the Portuguese miraculously never found them. In the year 1648 the islands were raided by the [[Malagasy]] pirates, they sacked Iconi, a coastal trading hub near [[Ngazidja]] after defeating the weak Sultan.

In 1793, [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] warriors from [[Madagascar]] first started raiding the islands for [[slave]]s, and later settled and seized control in many locations. On Comoros, it was estimated in 1865 that as much as 40% of the population consisted of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/comoros/2.htm Comoros - Early Visitors and Settlers]&quot;. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; France first established [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule in the Comoros in 1841. The first French colonists landed in Mayotte, and Andrian Tsouli, the Malagasy King of Mayotte, signed the Treaty of April 1841, which ceded the island to the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Comoro Islands. ''African Historical Dictionaries; No. 59''|author=Ottenheimer, Martin and Ottenheimer, Harriet|year=1994|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Metuchen, N.J.|isbn=9780585070216|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Mohéli was placed under French protection by its Queen Salima Machimba. That same year, after consolidating his authority over all of Grande Comore, Sultan Said Ali agreed to French protection of his island, though he retained sovereignty until 1909. Also in 1909, Sultan Said Muhamed of Anjouan abdicated in favor of French rule. The Comoros (or ''Les Comores'') was officially made a French colony in 1912, and the islands were placed under the administration of the French colonial governor general of Madagascar in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |title=The Comoro Islands: Problems of a Microcosm |author=Andre Bourde |volume=3 |issue=1 |month=May | year=1965 |pages=91–102 |url= |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00004924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comoros served as a way station for merchants sailing to the Far East and India until the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] significantly reduced traffic passing through the Mozambique Channel. The native commodities exported by the Comoros were [[coconut]]s, cattle and tortoiseshell. French settlers, French-owned companies, and wealthy Arab merchants established a plantation-based economy that now uses about one-third of the land for export crops. After its annexation, France converted Mayotte into a sugar plantation colony. The other islands were soon transformed as well, and the major crops of [[ylang-ylang]], [[vanilla]], [[coffee]], [[cocoa bean]], and [[sisal]] were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=African Studies Bulletin |title=The Comoro Islands: A Bibliographical Essay |author=Barbara Dubins |month=September | year=1969 |pages=131–137 |volume=12 |issue=2|doi=10.2307/523155 |publisher=African Studies Association |jstor=523155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agreement was reached with France in 1973 for Comoros to become independent in 1978. The deputies of [[Mayotte]] abstained. Referendums were held on all four of the islands. Three voted for independence by large margins, while Mayotte voted against, and remains under French administration. On July 6, 1975, however, the Comorian parliament passed a unilateral resolution declaring independence. Ahmed Abdallah proclaimed the independence of the '''Comorian State''' (''État comorien''; دولة القمر) and became its first president.

=== Independence ===
The next 30 years were a period of political turmoil. On 3 August 1975, mercenary [[Bob Denard]], with clandestine support from [[Jacques Foccart]] and the French government, removed president [[Ahmed Abdallah]] from office in an armed coup and replaced him with United National Front of the Comoros (UNF) member Prince [[Said Mohammed Jaffar]]. Months later, in January 1976, Jaffar was ousted in favor of his Minister of Defense [[Ali Soilih]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mukonoweshuro:555-577&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Politics of Squalor and Dependency: Chronic Political Instability and Economic Collapse in the Comoro Islands |author=Eliphas G. Mukonoweshuro |journal=African Affairs |volume=89 |issue=357 |month=October | year=1990 |pages=555–577 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the population of Mayotte voted against independence from France in two referendums. The [[Comorian independence referendum, 1974|first]], held in December 1974, won 63.8% support for maintaining ties with France, while the [[Mahoran status referendum, 1976|second]], held in February 1976, confirmed that vote with an overwhelming 99.4%. The three remaining islands, ruled by President Soilih, instituted a number of [[socialism|socialist]] and isolationist policies that soon strained relations with France. On 13 May 1978, Bob Denard returned to overthrow President Soilih and reinstate Abdallah with the support of the French and South African governments. During Soilih's brief rule, he faced seven additional coup attempts until he was finally forced from office and killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mukonoweshuro:555-577&quot; /&gt;

In contrast to Soilih, Abdallah's presidency was marked by authoritarian rule and increased adherence to traditional Islam&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakar:181-191&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Small Island Systems: A Case Study of the Comoro Islands |journal=Comparative Education |author=Abdourahim Said Bakar |volume=24 |issue=2, Special Number (11): Education and Minority Groups |year=1988 |pages=181–191 |url= |doi=10.1080/0305006880240203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the country was renamed the '''Federal [[Islamic Republic]] of Comoros''' (''République Fédérale Islamique des Comores''; جمهورية القمر الإتحادية الإسلامية ). Abdallah continued as president until 1989 when, fearing a probable [[coup d'état]], he signed a decree ordering the Presidential Guard, led by [[Bob Denard]], to disarm the armed forces. Shortly after the signing of the decree, Abdallah was allegedly shot dead in his office by a disgruntled military officer, though later sources claim an antitank missile was launched into his bedroom and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mercenary Holding Island Nation Seeks Deal |author=Christopher S.

A few days later, Bob Denard was evacuated to South Africa by French paratroopers. Said Mohamed Djohar, Soilih's older half-brother, then became president, and served until September 1995, when Bob Denard returned and attempted another coup. This time France intervened with paratroopers and forced Denard to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1995-10-05 |publisher=New York Times |title=1,000 French Troops Invade Comoros to Put Down Coup |author=Marlise Simons |pages=Section A; Page 10; Column 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=New York Times |title=French Mercenary Gives Up in Comoros Coup |date=1995-10-06 |agency=Associated Press |pages=Section A; Page 7; Column 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French removed Djohar to Reunion, and the Paris-backed [[Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim]] became president by election. He led the country from 1996, during a time of labor crises, government suppression, and secessionist conflicts, until his death November 1998. He was succeeded by Interim President [[Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comoros president dies from heart attack |author=Kamal Eddine Saindou |agency=Associated Press |pages=International News |date=1998-11-06, Friday, AM cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands of [[Anjouan]] and [[Mohéli]] declared their independence from the Comoros in 1997, in an attempt to restore French rule.

Azali stepped down in 2002 to run in the democratic election of the President of the Comoros, which he won. Under ongoing international pressure, as a military ruler who had originally come to power by force, and was not always democratic while in office, Azali led the Comoros through constitutional changes that enabled new elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comoros said &quot;calm&quot; after Azali Assoumani declared elected as federal president |date=2002-05-10 |publisher=BBC Monitoring Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''Loi des compétences'' law was passed in early 2005 that defines the responsibilities of each governmental body, and is in the process of implementation. The elections in 2006 were won by [[Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi]], a Sunni Muslim cleric nicknamed the &quot;Ayatollah&quot; for his time spent studying Islam in Iran. Azali honored the election results, thus allowing the first peaceful and democratic exchange of power for the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comoros; Ahmed Abdallah Sambi Set to Win Presidency by a Landslide |date=2006-05-15 |publisher=AllAfrica, Inc.

Colonel [[Mohammed Bacar]], a French-trained former gendarme, seized power as President in Anjouan in 2001. He staged a vote in June 2007 to confirm his leadership that was rejected as illegal by the Comoros federal government and the African Union. On March 25, 2008 hundreds of soldiers from the African Union and Comoros seized rebel-held Anjouan, generally welcomed by the population: there have been reports of hundreds, if not thousands, of people tortured during Bacar’s tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= COMOROS: The legacy of a Big Man on a small island | publisher=[[IRIN]] | url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=81898
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some rebels were killed and injured, but there are no official figures. At least 11 civilians were wounded. Some officials were imprisoned. Bacar fled in a speedboat to the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte to seek asylum. Anti-French protests followed in Comoros (see [[2008 invasion of Anjouan]]).

Since independence from France, the Comoros experienced more than 20 coups or attempted coups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7316177.stm |title=Anti-French protests in Comoros |publisher=BBC News |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Comoros}}

[[File:Cn-map.png|thumb|Map of Comoros]]

The Comoros is formed by [[Ngazidja]] (Grande Comore), [[Mwali]] (Mohéli), [[Nzwani]] (Anjouan), and [[Maore]] (Mayotte), the major islands in the Comoros Archipelago, as well as many minor islets. The islands are officially known by their Comorian language names, though international sources still use their French names (given in parentheses above). The capital and largest city, [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], is located on Ngazidja. The archipelago is situated in the Indian Ocean, in the [[Mozambique Channel]], between the African coast (nearest to [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]]) and [[Madagascar]], with no land borders.

At {{convert|2235|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, it is one of the smallest countries in the world. The Comoros also has claim to {{convert|320|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of territorial seas. The interiors of the islands vary from steep mountains to low hills. The climate is generally tropical and mild, and the two major seasons are distinguishable by their relative raininess. The temperature reaches an average of {{convert|29|-|30|C|F}} in March, the hottest month in the rainy season (called kashkazi, December to April), and an average low of {{convert|19|°C|°F}} in the cool, dry season (kusi, May to November).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Comoro Islands. ''African Historical Dictionaries; No. 59''|author=Ottenheimer, Martin and Ottenheimer, Harriet|year=1994|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Metuchen, N.J.|isbn=9780585070216|pages=20, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands are rarely subject to cyclones.

Ngazidja is the largest of the Comoros Archipelago, approximately equal in area to the other islands combined. It is also the most recent island, and therefore has rocky soil. The island's two volcanoes, [[Karthala]] (active) and [[La Grille]] (dormant), and the lack of good harbors are distinctive characteristics of its terrain. Mwali, with its capital at [[Fomboni]], is the smallest of the four major islands. Nzwani, whose capital is [[Mutsamudu]], has a distinctive triangular shape caused by three mountain chains, Sima, Nioumakele, and Jimilime, emanating from a central peak, Ntringi ({{convert|1575|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

The oldest of the islands, Maore has the richest soil as well as good harbors and local fish populations, due to its ring of coral reefs. [[Dzaoudzi]], the previous capital of all the colonial Comoros, is located on [[Pamanzi]], ({{lang-fr|Petite-Terre}}), the largest islet of Maore. Maore's current capital is at [[Mamoudzou]]. The term ''Mayotte'' (or Maore) may also refer to the group of islands, of which the largest is known as Maore ({{lang-fr|Grande-Terre}}), and it includes Maore's surrounding islands, most notably Pamanzi (''Petite-Terre'').

[[File:Karthala MODIS 20051125.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite view of Mount Karthala after a November 2005 eruption. Ash obscures the islands (outlined).]]
The islands of the Comoros Archipelago were formed by volcanic activity. [[Mount Karthala]], an active [[shield volcano]] located on Ngazidja, is the country's highest point, at 2,361&amp;nbsp;m or {{convert|7748|ft|m|abbr=on}} It contains the Comoros' largest patch of its disappearing rainforest. Karthala is currently one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with a minor eruption in May 2006, and prior eruptions as recently as April 2005 and 1991. In the 2005 eruption, which lasted from April 17 to 19, 40,000 citizens were evacuated, and the [[crater lake]] in the volcano's {{convert|3|by|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} caldera was destroyed.

The Comoros also lays claim to the [[Glorioso Islands]], comprising Grande Glorieuse, Île du Lys, Wreck Rock, South Rock, Verte Rocks (three islets), and three unnamed islets, one of France's ''[[Scattered islands in the Indian Ocean|Îles Éparses or Îles éparses de l'océan indien]]'' (Scattered islands in the Indian Ocean) possessions. The Glorioso Islands were administered by the colonial Comoros before 1975, and are therefore sometimes considered part of the Comoros Archipelago. [[Banc du Geyser]], a former island in the Comoros Archipelago, now submerged, is geographically located in the ''Îles Éparses'', but was annexed by Madagascar in 1976 as an unclaimed territory. The Comoros now claims it as part of its exclusive economic zone.

The Comoros constitute an [[ecoregion]] in their own right, [[Comoros forests]].

== Government ==
{{Main|Politics of Comoros}}&lt;!--Please add new information on politics to relevant articles of the series--&gt;
Politics of the Comoros takes place in a framework of a [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of the Comoros]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. The Constitution of the Union of the Comoros was ratified by referendum on December 23, 2001, and the islands' constitutions and executives were elected in the following months. It had previously been considered a military dictatorship, and the transfer of power from Azali Assoumani to Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi in May 2006 was the first peaceful transfer in Comorian history.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. The preamble of the constitution guarantees an Islamic inspiration in governance, a commitment to human rights, and several specific enumerated rights, democracy, &quot;a common destiny&quot; for all Comorians. Each of the islands (according to Title II of the Constitution) has a great amount of autonomy in the Union, including having their own constitutions (or Fundamental Law), president, and Parliament. The presidency and Assembly of the Union are distinct from each of the Islands' governments. The presidency of the Union rotates between the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;CfHR_Law-of-the-Union&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/constitutions/docs/ComorosC%20(english%20summary)(rev).doc |format=Word document |title=FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE UNION OF COMOROS (English excerpts) |publisher=Centre for Human Rights, University of Pretoria, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anjouan holds the current presidency rotation, and so Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi is President of the Union; Mohéli and Ngazidja follow in four year terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/km.html AFRICAN ELECTIONS DATABASE], Elections in the Comoros.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comorian [[legal system]] rests on [[Islamic#Law|Islamic law]], an inherited French ([[Napoleonic code]]) legal code, and customary law (mila na ntsi). Village elders, kadis or civilian courts settle most disputes. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the [[legislative]] and the executive. The Supreme Court acts as a Constitutional Council in resolving constitutional questions and supervising presidential elections. As High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court also arbitrates in cases where the government is accused of malpractice. The Supreme Court consists of two members selected by the president, two elected by the Federal Assembly, and one by the council of each island.&lt;ref name=&quot;CfHR_Law-of-the-Union&quot; /&gt;

Around 80 percent of the central government's annual budget is spent on the country’s complex electoral system which provides for a semi-autonomous government and president for each of the three islands and a rotating presidency for the over-arching Union government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= COMOROS: Reforming 'the coup-coup islands' | publisher=[[IRIN]] | url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A referendum took place on May 16, 2009 to decide whether to cut down the government's unwieldy political bureaucracy. 52.7% of those eligible voted, and 93.8% of votes were cast in approval of the referendum. The referendum would cause each island's president to become a governor and the ministers to become councilors.&lt;ref name=allafrica20090519&gt;{{cite news

As of 2008, Comoros and [[Mauritania]] are considered by US-based organization [[Freedom House]] as the only real “[[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]]” of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2008 |title=Freedom House Country Report 2008 |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date=2004-05-10 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, the Comoros were ranked 14th out of 48 sub-Saharan African countries in the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]]. The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance, based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org |title=Mo Ibrahim Foundation |publisher=Mo Ibrahim Foundation |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
{{Main|Military  of Comoros}}
The military resources of the Comoros consist of a small standing army and a 500-member police force, as well as a 500-member defense force. A defense treaty with France provides naval resources for protection of territorial waters, training of Comorian military personnel, and air surveillance. France maintains few senior officers presence in Comoros at government request. France maintains a small maritime base and a [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] Detachment (DLEM) on [[Mayotte]].

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Comoros}}
In November 1975, Comoros became the 143rd member of the [[United Nations]]. The new nation was defined as comprising the entire [[archipelago]], although France continues to maintain control over the island of [[Mayotte]] as an [[overseas department]].&lt;ref&gt;Security Council S/PV. 1888 para 247 S/11967 [http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm] [http://untreaty.un.org/cod/repertory/art33/english/rep_supp5_vol2-art33_e.pdf] {{Wayback|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm|date =20080317010910|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comoros has repeatedly pressed its claim to the island before the [[United Nations General Assembly]], which adopted a series of resolutions under the caption &quot;Question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte&quot;, opining that Mayotte belongs to Comoros under the principle that the territorial integrity of colonial territories should be preserved upon independence. As a practical matter, however, these resolutions have little effect and there is no foreseeable likelihood that Mayotte will become ''de facto'' part of Comoros without its people's consent. More recently, the Assembly has maintained this item on its agenda but deferred it from year to year without taking action. Other bodies, including the UN General Assembly, the [[Organization of African Unity]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Movement of Non-Aligned Countries]] and the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], have similarly questioned French sovereignty over Mayotte.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA31_first-resolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly, [http://un.cti.depaul.edu/Countries/Comoros/1156245840.pdf Forty-ninth session: Agenda item 36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Comoros also is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], the [[European Development Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], and the [[African Development Bank]]. On April 10, 2008 Comoros became the 179th nation to accept the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/application/pdf/kp_ratification.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Comoros}}
Comoros is one of the world's poorest countries. Economic growth and [[poverty reduction]] are major priorities for the government. With a rate of 14.3%, unemployment is considered very high. [[Agriculture]], including [[fishing]], [[hunting]], and [[forestry]], is the leading sector of the economy, and 38.4% of the working population is employed in the [[Primary sector of industry|primary sector]]. High population densities, as much as 1000 per square kilometer in the densest agricultural zones, for what is still a mostly rural, agricultural economy may lead to an environmental crisis in the near future, especially considering the high rate of population growth. The Comoros' real GDP growth was a low 1.9% in 2004 and real GDP per capita was continuing declining annually in 2004. These declines are explained by factors including declining investment, drops in consumption, rising inflation, and an increase in trade imbalance due in part to lowered cash crop prices, especially vanilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=UNION OF THE COMOROS: POVERTY REDUCTION AND GROWTH STRATEGY PAPER (UPDATED INTERIM PAPER) |author=Office of the General Commissioner for Planning, Ministry of Planning and Regional Development |date = October 2005|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPRS1/Resources/Comoros_IPRSP(Oct2005).pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiscal policy is constrained by erratic fiscal revenues, a bloated civil service wage bill, and an external debt that is far above the HIPC threshold. Membership in the franc zone, the main anchor of stability, has nevertheless helped contain pressures on domestic prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/comoros/comoros-financial-sector-profile.html |title=MFW4A |publisher=MFW4A |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comoros has an inadequate transportation system, a young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high [[unemployment]], and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture contributes 40% to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. Comoros is the world's largest producer of [[ylang-ylang]], and a large producer of [[vanilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Comoro Islands. ''African Historical Dictionaries; No. 59''|author=Ottenheimer, Martin and Ottenheimer, Harriet|year=1994|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Metuchen, N.J.|isbn=9780585070216|pages=3, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Comoros claims the [[Banc du Geyser]] and the [[Glorioso Islands]] as part of its exclusive economic zone.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Comoros is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ohada.com&quot;&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Comoros}}
[[File:Moroni Mosque Photo by Sascha Grabow.jpg|thumb|Moroni Mosque]]

With fewer than a million people, the Comoros is one of the least populous countries in the world, but is also one of the most densely populated, with an average of {{convert|275|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}. In 2001, 34% of the population was considered urban, but that is expected to grow, since rural population growth is negative, while overall population growth is still relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, ''World Population Prospects: The 2004 Revision and World Urbanization Prospects: The 2005 Revision'', http://esa.un.org/unup/ 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half the population of Comoros is under the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/129467/Comoros Comoros]&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Major urban centers include [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], [[Mutsamudu]], [[Domoni]], [[Fomboni]], and [[Tsémbéhou]]. There are between 200,000 and 350,000 Comorians in France.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL27778648 FACTBOX-Relations between France and Comoros]&quot;. Reuters. March 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands of the Comoros share mostly African-Arab origins. [[Sunni Islam]] is [[Islam in Comoros|the dominant religion]], representing as much as 98% of the population. Although [[Arab culture]] is firmly established throughout the archipelago, [[Roman Catholicism in Comoros|a minority of the population]] of Mayotte, mostly immigrants from metropolitan France, are [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cn.html |title=CIA World Factbook: Comoros |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] (Christian) and [[Ethnic Groups of South Asia|Indian]] (mostly Ismaili) minorities also exist, as well as minorities mostly descended from early French settlers. [[Chinese people]] are also present on Mayotte and parts of Grande Comore (especially Moroni). A small [[White African|white minority]] of [[French people|French]] with other European (i.e. Dutch, British and Portuguese) ancestry lives in Comoros. Most French left after independence in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The most common language is [[Comorian language|Comorian]], or ''Shikomor'', a Sabaki language related to [[Swahili language|Swahili]], four different variants (Shingazidja, Shimwali, Shinzwani, and Shimaore) being spoken on each of the four islands. French and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are also official languages, along with Comorian. Arabic is widely known as a second language, being the language of Quranic teaching, and French is the language of all other formal education. A [[Malagasy language]], Shibushi, is spoken by approximately a third of the population of Maore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=KM Ethnologue report for Comoros].&lt;/ref&gt; About fifty-seven percent of the population is literate in the [[Latin alphabet]] while more than 90% are literate in the [[Arabic alphabet]]; total literacy is incorrectly estimated at 62.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uis.unesco.org/profiles/EN/EDU/countryProfile_en.aspx?code=1740 UNESCO Institute for Statistics, country profile of Comoros; 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Comorian has no native script, but both Arabic and Latin scripts are used.

=== Health ===
{{main|Health  in Comoros}}
There are 15 physicians per 100,000 persons.&lt;ref name=&quot;afro.who.int&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/home/countries/fact_sheets/comoros.pdf |title=WHO Country Offices in the WHO African Region - WHO &amp;#124; Regional Office for Africa |publisher=Afro.who.int |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comorian language|Comorian]] ({{lang|swb|''Shikomori''}}) is the most widely used language on the Comoros. It is a close relative of [[Swahili language|Swahili]]; like Swahili, it is a Bantu language with approximately 30% of its vocabulary derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. It is one of the three official languages of the Comoros, next to French and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Each island has a slightly different dialect; that of [[Anjouan]] is called ''Shindzwani'', that of Moheli ''Shimwali'', that of Mayotte ''[[Shimaore language|Shimaore]]'', and that of Grande Comore ''Shingazidja''. No [[Official script|official alphabet]] existed in 1992, but [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] scripts were both used even though they are not native to the region.

There is a government-owned national [[newspaper]] in Comoros, [http://www.AlWatwan.net] Al-Watwan, published in [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]]; Kwezi is also published on [[Mayotte]]. Radio Comoros is the national radio service and Comoros National TV is the television service.

===Education===
{{main|Education  in Comoros}}
Almost all of the educated populace of the Comoros have attended [[Quranic school]]s at some point in their lives, often before regular schooling. Here, boys and girls are taught about the [[Qur'an]], and memorize it. Some parents specifically choose this early schooling to offset French schools children usually attend later. Since independence and the ejection of French teachers, the education system has been plagued by poor teacher training and poor results, though recent stability may allow for substantial improvements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakar:181-191&quot; /&gt; In 2000, 44.2 percent of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. There is a general lack of facilities, equipment, qualified teachers, textbooks and other resources. [[Salaries]] for teachers are often so far in arrears that many refuse to work.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;&quot;Comoros&quot;.

{{Kantianism}}

Attributed to [[Immanuel Kant]], the '''critical philosophy''' movement sees the primary task of [[philosophy]] as [[criticism]] rather than justification of knowledge; criticism, for Kant, meant judging as to the  possibilities of knowledge before advancing to knowledge itself (from the Greek ''kritike (techne)'', or &quot;art of judgment&quot;). The initial, and perhaps even sole task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories--including those about philosophy itself--to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism.

&quot;Critical philosophy&quot; is also used as just another name for Kant's philosophy itself. Kant said that philosophy's proper enquiry is not about what is out there in reality, but rather about the character and foundations of experience itself. We must first judge how human reason works, and within what limits, so that we can afterwards correctly apply it to sense experience and determine whether it can be applied at all to metaphysical objects.

However, it was the [[Qin Dynasty]] that first unified China in 221 BC. The last dynasty, the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]], ended in 1911 with the founding of the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (ROC)]] by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the Chinese Nationalist Party. The first half of the 20th century saw China plunged into a period of [[Chinese Civil War|disunity and civil wars]] that divided the country into two main political camps&amp;nbsp;– the Kuomintang and the [[Communist Party of China|communists]]. Major hostilities ended in 1949, when the communists won the civil war and established the People's Republic of China in [[mainland China]]. The KMT-led [[Republic of China]] relocated their capital to [[Taipei]] on [[Taiwan]]; its jurisdiction is now limited to [[Taiwan]], [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and several outlying islands. Since then, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has been involved in political disputes with the [[Republic of China]] over issues of sovereignty and the [[political status of Taiwan]].

The Cultural Revolution, motivated by power struggles within the Party and a fear of the [[Soviet Union]], led to a major upheaval in Chinese society. In 1972, at the peak of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] met [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing to establish relations with the United States. In the same year, the PRC was [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|admitted to the United Nations]] in place of the Republic of China for China's membership of the United Nations, and permanent membership of the Security Council.

After Mao's death in 1976 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]], blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, [[Deng Xiaoping]] quickly wrested power from Mao's anointed successor [[Hua Guofeng]]. Although he never became the head of the party or state himself, Deng was in fact the [[Paramount Leader]] of China at that time, his influence within the Party led the country to [[Chinese economic reform|significant economic reforms]]. The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the [[People's commune|communes]] were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment, a system termed by some&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_e&quot;&gt;[[Martin Hart-Landsberg|Hart-Landsberg, Martin]]; and [[Paul Burkett|Burkett, Paul]].

The PRC adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on 4 December 1982.

In 1989, the death of pro-reform official [[Hu Yaobang]] helped to spark the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], during which students and others campaigned for several months, speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform, including democratic rights and freedom of speech. However, they were eventually put down on 4 June when [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square, resulting in numerous casualties. This event was widely reported and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_f&quot;&gt;Youngs, R.

CPC General Secretary, President [[Jiang Zemin]] and Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], both former mayors of Shanghai, led post-Tiananmen PRC in the 1990s. Under Jiang and Zhu's ten years of administration, the PRC's economic performance pulled an estimated 150&amp;nbsp;million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_h&quot;&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/11/content_244499.htm ''Nation bucks trend of global poverty''] (11 July 2003).

Although the PRC needs economic growth to spur its development, the government has begun to worry that rapid economic growth has negatively impacted the country's resources and environment. Another concern is that certain sectors of society are not sufficiently benefiting from the PRC's economic development; one example of this is the wide gap between urban and rural areas. As a result, under current CPC General Secretary, President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]], the PRC has initiated policies to address these issues of equitable distribution of resources, but the outcome remains to be seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_j&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4913622.stm ''China worried over pace of growth''].

The area under Pakistani-administration is claimed by India.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia and North Korea. Additionally the border between the PRC and the ROC is located in [[territorial waters]]. China has a land border of {{convert|22117|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the [[List of land border lengths|largest in the world]].

The territory of China lies between latitudes [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and longitudes [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. It contains a large variety of [[landscapes]]. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, grasslands can be seen. Southern China is dominated by hill country and low mountain ranges. In the central-east are the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang). Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west, major mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas, with China's highest point at the eastern half of [[Mount Everest]], and high [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]].

A major issue is the continued expansion of deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_au&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4915690.stm &quot;Beijing hit by eighth sandstorm&quot;].

According to China's environmental watchdog, Sepa, China is losing a million acres (4,000&amp;nbsp;km²) per year to [[desertification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_av&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-gathering-sandstorm-encroaching-desert-missing-water-399653.html The gathering sandstorm: Encroaching desert, missing water]&quot;.

Msnbc.msn.com. 24 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

China has a [[climate]] mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which leads to temperature differences between winter and summer. In winter, northern winds coming from high latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from sea areas at lower latitude are warm and moist. The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's extensive and complex [[topography]].

In the Palearctic zone are found such mammals as the horse, camel, [[tapir]], and [[jerboa]]. Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the [[Leopard Cat]], [[bamboo rat]], [[treeshrew]], and various species of monkeys and apes. Some overlap exists between the two regions because of natural dispersal and migration, and deer or antelope, bears, wolves, pigs, and rodents are found in all of the diverse climatic and geological environments. The famous giant panda is found only in a limited area along the Yangtze. There is a continuing problem with trade in endangered species, although there are now laws to prohibit such activities.

China contains also a variety of forest types. Both northeast and northwest reaches contain mountains and cold coniferous forests, supporting animal species which include moose and [[Asiatic black bear]], along with some 120 types of birds. Moist [[conifer]] forests can have thickets of [[bamboo]] as an understorey, replaced by [[rhododendrons]] in higher montane stands of [[juniper]] and [[taxus|yew]]. [[Subtropical]] forests, which dominate central and southern China, support an astounding 146,000 species of flora. Tropical rainforest and seasonal rainforests, though confined to [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan Island]], actually contain a quarter of all the plant and animal species found in China.

Part of the price China is paying for increased prosperity is damage to the environment. Leading Chinese environmental campaigner [[Ma Jun (environmentalist)|Ma Jun]] has warned that water pollution is one of the most serious threats facing China.

The PRC has been playing an increasing role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbors. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_s&quot;&gt;Dillon, Dana; and Tkacik, John, Jr.; [http://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html ''China’s Quest for Asia''], Policy Review, December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134. Retrieved 22 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The EAS, which includes [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]], India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005. The PRC is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), with Russia and the Central Asian republics.

In 2000 the U.S. Congress approved &quot;permanent normal trade relations&quot; (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_t&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/ Clinton signs China trade bill]&quot;.

Sinophobic attitudes often target Chinese [[Chinese diaspora|minorities]] and nationals living outside of China. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_y&quot;&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 ''Malaysia's race rules''].

Much of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]] of Zhou Enlai - non-interference in other states' affairs, non-aggression, peaceful coexistence, and equality and mutual benefits. China's foreign policy is also driven by the concept of &quot;harmony without uniformity&quot; which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences. This has led China to support states that are regarded as dangerous by Western nations, such as Zimbabwe, North Korea, or Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Keith|first=Ronald C.|title=China from the inside out - fitting the People's republic into the world|publisher=PlutoPress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts with foreign countries have occurred at times in its recent history, particularly with the United States; for example, the [[NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|US bombing of the Chinese embassy]] in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident|US-China spy plane incident]] in April 2001.

The relationship between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]] has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its [[World War II|wartime]] past to the satisfaction of the PRC; take for instance [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials and in some [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. However, Sino-Japanese relations have warmed considerably since [[Shinzo Abe]] became the new Japanese Prime Minister in September 2006. A joint historical study conducted by the PRC and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward a new consensus on the issue of [[Japanese war crimes|WWII atrocities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_ac&quot;&gt;[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/09/nanjing_by_the_numbers ''Nanjing by the Numbers''].

Since the 1990s, the PRC has been entering negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, usually by offering concessions and accepting less than half of the disputed territory with each party. The PRC's only remaining land border disputes are a disputed border with India and an undefined border with [[Bhutan]]. China is a party in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the [[East China Sea|East]] and [[South China Sea]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/MA27Ad02.html|title=

While accompanying a rapid economic rise, the PRC since the 1990s seeks to maintain a policy of quiet diplomacy with its neighbors. It does so by keeping economic growth steady and participating in regional organizations and cultivating bi-lateral relations in order to ease suspicion over China's burgeoning military capabilities.

Much progress has been made in the last decade and the PRC continues to make efforts to modernize its military.

The [[Chinese democracy movement]], social activists, and certain members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need to address sociopolitical issues with reform. While economic and social controls have been greatly relaxed in China since the 1970s, [[political freedom]] is still tightly restricted. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states that the &quot;fundamental rights&quot; of citizens include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[property|property rights]]. However, these provisions do not afford significant protection in practice against criminal prosecution by the State.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_ah&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2009/china |title=Human Rights Watch, World Report 2009 |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_ai&quot;&gt;''Will the Boat Sink the Water?: The Life of China's Peasants'' / [[Chen Guidi]] and Wu Chuntao (2006) ISBN 1586483587&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_aj&quot;&gt;''Empire of Lies: The Truth About China in the Twenty-First Century'' / [[Guy Sorman]] (2008) ISBN 1594032165&lt;/ref&gt;

Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] states that the PRC needs &quot;to gradually improve the democratic election system so that state power will truly belong to the people and state power will be used to serve the people.&quot; Despite his status, Wen's comments were later censored by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/13/AR2010101306347.html Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao talks reform, but most countrymen never get to hear what he says]. ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

As the social, cultural and political as well as economic consequences of market reform become increasingly manifest, tensions between the conservative and reformists in the party are sharpening. Some Chinese scholars such as Zhou Tianyong, the vice director of research of the [[Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Party School]], argue that gradual political reform as well as repression of those pushing for overly rapid change over the next thirty years will be essential if China is to avoid an overly turbulent transition to a middle class dominated polity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2005/04/david_cowhig_in.php Part I of summary of Zhou Tianyong's 2004 book Reform of the Chinese Political System] Accessed February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2005/06/zhou_tianyong_r.php Part II of summary of Zhou Tianyong's 2004 book Reform of the Chinese Political System] Accessed February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Chinese look back to the Cultural Revolution and fear chaos if the Communist Party should lose control due to domestic upheavals and so a robust system of monitoring and control is in place to counter the growing pressure for political change.

From its founding in 1949 to late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style centrally [[planned economy]]. [[Private sector|Private businesses]] and capitalism did not exist. To propel the country towards a modern, industrialized communist society, [[Mao Zedong]] instituted the [[Great Leap Forward]]. Following Mao's death and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move to a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Collectivization]] of the [[Agriculture in China|agriculture]] was dismantled and farmlands were privatized to increase productivity. In 1978, China and Japan had normalized diplomatic relations and China had decided to borrow money from Japan in soft loans. Since 1978, Japan has been China's No. 1 foreign donor. China's economy is mainly characterised as a market economy based on private property ownership&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_ax&quot;&gt;

A wide variety of small-scale enterprises were encouraged while the government relaxed price controls and promoted foreign investment. Foreign trade was focused upon as a major vehicle of growth, which led to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs) first in [[Shenzhen]] (near Hong Kong) and then in other Chinese cities. Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured by introducing western-style management system and the unprofitable ones were closed, resulting in massive job losses. By the latter part of 2010, China was reversing some of its economic liberalization initiative whereby state-owned companies were buying up independent businesses in the steel, auto and energy industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-23/china-s-state-planned-economy-is-doomed-to-flop-david-pauly.html &quot;China's State-Planned Economy Is Doomed to Flop: David Pauly&quot;] ''Bloomberg''.

The PRC's success has been primarily due to manufacturing as a low-cost producer. This is attributed to a combination of cheap labor, good infrastructure, relatively high productivity, favorable government policy, and some say, an undervalued exchange rate.

After the [[Sino-Soviet split]], China started to develop its own [[nuclear weapon]]s and delivery systems, successfully detonating its first surface [[nuclear testing|nuclear test]] in 1964 at [[Lop Lake|Lop Nur]]. A natural outgrowth of this was a satellite launching program, which culminated in 1970 with the launching of [[Dong Fang Hong I]], the first Chinese satellite. This made the PRC the fifth nation to independently launch a satellite.

In 1992, the [[Shenzhou spacecraft|Shenzhou]] manned spaceflight program was authorized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abr&quot;&gt;[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_26079.htm China's First Man-made Satellite] (2003).

Domestic air travel has increased significantly, but remains too expensive for most. Long distance transportation is dominated by railways and charter bus systems. Railways are the vital carrier in China; they are monopolized by the state, divided into various railway bureaus in different regions. At the rates of demand it experiences, the system has historically been subject to overcrowding during travel seasons such as ''[[Chunyun]]'' during the [[Chinese New Year]].

The [[Rail transport in the People's Republic of China|PRC's railway system]] is increasing in development. The major cities have rapidly expanding networks of [[Rapid transit|underground]] or [[light rail]] systems. [[Transport in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] has one of the most developed transport systems in the world.

[[File:PRC Population Density.svg|thumb|A population density map of the People's Republic of China. The eastern, coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior.]]

As of July 2010, there are 1,338,612,968 people in the PRC. About 21% (male 145,461,833; female 128,445,739) are 14 years old or younger, 71% (male 482,439,115; female 455,960,489) are between 15 and 64 years old, and 8% (male 48,562,635; female 53,103,902) are over 65 years old. The population growth rate for 2006 was 0.6%.&lt;ref name = pop/&gt;

By end of 2010, the proportion of mainland Chinese people aged 14 or younger was 16.60%, while the number aged 60 or older grew to 13.26%, and totally both 29.86%. This means about 70% of the population is of workable age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13218733 China census shows population ageing and urban]&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's goal is [[one-child policy|one child per family]], with exceptions for ethnic minorities and flexibility in rural areas. The government's goal is to stabilize population growth early in the 21st century, though some projections estimate a population of anywhere ranging from 1.4&amp;nbsp;billion to 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion by 2025. Hence, the country's family planning minister has indicated that China will maintain its one-child policy until at least the year 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2008b&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/10/china.onechild/index.html |title=China to keep one-child policy |publisher=CNN |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Population and Natural Increase Rate of PRC.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Population of China from 1949 to 2008]]

The policy is resisted, particularly in rural areas, because of the need for agricultural labour and a traditional preference for boys (who can later serve as male heirs). Families who breach the policy often lie during the census.&lt;ref name=&quot;censuslie&quot;&gt;[http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/fertl2b.htm USembassy-china.org.cn]{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official government policy opposes forced sterilization or abortion, but allegations of coercion continue as local officials, who are faced with penalties for failing to curb population growth, may resort to forced abortion or sterilization, or manipulation of census figures.

The decreasing reliability of PRC population statistics since family planning began in the late 1970s has made evaluating the effectiveness of the policy difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;censuslie&quot;/&gt; Estimates by Chinese demographers of the [[Total fertility rate|average number of children for a Chinese woman]] vary from 1.5 to 2.0. The government is particularly concerned with the large imbalance in the [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] at birth, apparently the result of a combination of traditional preference for boys and family planning pressure, which led to the ban of using ultrasound devices for the purpose of preventing [[sex-selective abortion and infanticide|sex-selective abortion]].

Another factor is the under-reporting of female children to circumvent the law.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} On the basis of a 2005 report by China's [[National Population and Family Planning Commission]], there were 118.6 boys born for every 100 girls, and in some rural areas the boy/girl ratio could be as high as 130/100.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As this trend of gender imbalance is on the increase, experts warn of increased social instability should this trend continue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loyd2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=2790469|title=China Fears Lopsided Sex Ratio Could Spark Crisis By 2020, There Will Be 30&amp;nbsp;Million More Men than Women – Making it Hard for a Guy to Find a Bride|last=Loyd|first=Beth|date=12 January 2007|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6962650.stm|title=China warned on gender imbalance|date=24 August 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2007a&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6254763.stm|title=Chinese facing shortage of wives|date=12 January 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that over 40 million girls and women are [[Missing women of Asia|'missing' in China]] (Klasen and Wink 2003).&lt;ref&gt;[http://iussp2005.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=51345 Estimation of the Number of Missing Females in China: 1900-2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the Communist Party started the [[Patriotic Health Campaign]], which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as attacking several diseases. This has shown major results as diseases like cholera, typhoid, and scarlet fever were nearly eradicated.

With economic reform after 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition despite the disappearance, along with the People's Communes, of much of the free public health services provided in the countryside. Health care in China became largely private fee-for-service.

In mainland China, the government allows a limited degree of religious freedom, however official tolerance is only extended to members of state-approved religious organizations and not to those who worship underground, such as [[house church]]es. An accurate number of religious adherents is hard to obtain because of a lack of official data, but there is general consensus that religion has been enjoying a resurgence over the past 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6337627.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Survey finds {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} China believers |publisher=BBC News |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by Phil Zuckerman on [[Adherents.com]] found that in 1998, 59% (over 700&amp;nbsp;million)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_473.html |title= Nonreligious, continued...|publisher=Adherents.com&lt;! |date= |accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population was [[irreligious]].

Despite the surveys' varying results, most agree that the traditional religions&amp;nbsp;– [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese folk religion]]s&amp;nbsp;– are the dominant faiths.

China's traditional values were derived from various versions of [[Confucianism]] and conservatism.

A number of more authoritarian and [[rationalism|rational]] strains of thought have also been influential, such as [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]. There was often conflict between the philosophies, such as the individualistic [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucians]], who believed Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today. In recent years, a number of [[New Confucianism|New Confucians]] have advocated that democratic ideals and human rights are quite compatible with traditional Confucian &quot;Asian values.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdee&quot;&gt;Bary, Theodore de. [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccba/cear/issues/fall97/graphics/special/debary/debary.htm &quot;Constructive Engagement with Asian Values&quot;].{{Dead link|date=March 2009}} Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born in the old society but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and a Confucian education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and obedience to the state.

Many observers believe that the period following 1949 is a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others say that the CPC's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]], where many aspects of traditional culture were labeled 'regressive and harmful' or 'vestiges of feudalism' by the regime and thus, were [[Cultural revolution#Destruction of antiques, historical sites and culture|destroyed]]. They further argue that many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as [[Confucianism]], [[Chinese art]], literature, and performing arts like [[Beijing opera]], were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time.

Today, the Chinese government has accepted a great deal of traditional [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] as an integral part of Chinese society, lauding it as an important achievement of the Chinese civilization and emphasizing it as vital to a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese national identity]]. Since the Cultural Revolution ended, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdef&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0133) &quot;China: Traditional arts&quot;.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online] Accessed: 26 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and folk and variety art in particular have gained a new found respectability, and sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdeh&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0138) &quot;China: Folk and Variety Arts&quot;.

Chinese culture and the West were linked by the [[Silk Road]]. Artifacts from the history of the silk route, as well as from the natural history of the [[Gobi desert]], are displayed in the [[Silk Route Museum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdei&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkroutemuseum.com |title=Silk Route Museum |publisher=Silk Route Museum |date= |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdej&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesilkroadfund.org/downloads/SRM_Tour_Promo.pdf |title=Tourism Guide 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=14 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdek&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesilkroadfund.org/silk.pdf |title=First Annual Silk Road Museum International Arts Competition 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=14 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Chinese cuisine}}

[[File:Tianjin lunch of Goubuli.jpg|thumb|Chinese traditional food in Tianjin]]

The overwhelmingly large variety of Chinese cuisine comes mainly from the practice of dynastic period [[Emperor of China|emperors]] hosting banquets with 100 dishes per meal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kong&quot;&gt;Kong, Foong, Ling. [2002]. The Food of Asia. Tuttle Publishing. ISBN 0-7946-0146-4&lt;/ref&gt; A countless number of imperial kitchen staff and [[concubines]] were involved in the food preparation process.

Over time, many dishes became part of the everyday-citizen culture. Some of the highest quality restaurants with recipes close to the dynastic periods include [[Fangshan]]{{dn}} restaurant in [[Beihai Park]], Beijing and the Oriole Pavilion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kong&quot;/&gt; Arguably all branches of [[Cuisine of Hong Kong#Eastern Styles|Hong Kong eastern style]] or even [[American Chinese food]] are in some ways rooted from the original dynastic cuisines.

=== Sports ===

[[File:Wangfujingbasketball.jpg|thumb|left|Evening pickup [[basketball]] game in a Beijing neighborhood]]

China has one of the [[Sport in the People's Republic of China|oldest sporting cultures]] in the world, spanning the course of several millennia. There is, in fact, evidence that a form of [[Association football|football]] was played in China in ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdel&quot;&gt;[http://athleticscholarships.net/history-of-soccer.htm Origins of the Great Game]. 2000. Athleticscholarships.net.

Retrieved 26 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; some of the most popular sports in the country include martial arts, table tennis, badminton, swimming, basketball and snooker. [[Board game]]s such as [[Go (board game)|Go]] (Weiqi), and [[Xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) and recently [[chess]] are also commonly played and have organized competitions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[Physical fitness]] is widely emphasized in [[culture of China|Chinese culture]]. Morning exercises are a common activity and often one can find the elderly practicing [[qigong]] and [[tai chi chuan]] in parks or students doing stretches on school campuses.

Young people are also keen on basketball, especially in urban centers with limited space and grass areas. The [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] has a huge following among Chinese youths, with [[Yao Ming]] being the idol of many.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beech2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yao_ming.html |title=Yao Ming |accessdate=30 March 2007 |last=Beech |first=Hannah |work=Asian Heroes |work=Time Magazine | date=28 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major sporting events were also held in Beijing such as the [[1990 Asian Games]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

Many traditional sports are also played. The popular Chinese dragon boat racing occurs during the [[Dragon Boat Festival]]. In [[Inner Mongolia]], sports such as [[Mongolian wrestling|Mongolian-style wrestling]] and [[horse racing]] are popular. In [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], [[archery]] and [[equestrianism]] are a part of traditional festivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcden&quot;&gt;Qinfa, Ye. [http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm Sports History of China]. About.com. Retrieved 21 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

China has [[China at the Olympics|participated at the olympics]] since 1952. China finished [[2008 Summer Olympics medal table|first in gold medal count]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|most recent Summer Olympic Games]] which were held in Beijing from 8 to 24 August 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdeo&quot;&gt;[http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/INF/GL/95A/GL0000000.shtml Beijing2008.cn]&lt;/ref&gt;

California's diverse geography ranges from the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] at the west side, to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains in the east—from the [[Sequoia sempervirens|Redwood]]–[[Douglas-fir]] forests of the northwest, to the [[Mojave Desert]] areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]], a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest and lowest points in the [[contiguous United States]] ([[Mount Whitney]] and [[Death Valley]]), and has the [[List of U.S. states by coastline|third-longest coastline]] of all states (after [[Alaska]] and [[Florida]]). Earthquakes are a common occurrence due to the state's location along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]: about 37,000 are recorded annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/faq/rate_of_seism.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Seismo.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''California'' once referred to a large area of North America claimed by Spain that included much of modern-day [[Southwestern United States]] and the [[Baja California peninsula]]. Beginning in the late 18th century, the area known as [[Alta California]], comprising the California territory north of the Baja Peninsula, was [[colonized]] by the [[Spanish Empire]] as part of [[New Spain]]. In 1821, Alta California became a part of [[Mexico]] following its successful war for independence. Shortly after the beginning of the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1846, a group of American settlers in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] declared an independent [[California Republic]] in Alta California. Though its existence was short-lived, its flag became the precursor for California's current state flag. American victory in the war led to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], in which Mexico ceded Alta California to the United States. Western areas of Alta California became the state of California, which was admitted as the [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|31st state]] on September 9, 1850.

The [[California Gold Rush]] beginning in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic change, with large scale immigration from the U.S. and abroad and an accompanying economic boom. Key developments in the early 20th century included the emergence of Los Angeles as the center of the American [[entertainment industry]], and the growth of a large, state-wide [[tourism]] sector. The late 20th century saw the development of the [[technology]] and [[information]] sectors, punctuated by the growth of [[Silicon Valley]]. In addition to California's prosperous agricultural [[industry]], other important contributors to its economy include [[aerospace]], [[education]], and [[manufacturing]]. If California were a country, it would be the [[Comparison between U.S. states and countries nominal GDP|eighth-largest economy in the world]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9JS1MLO0.htm &quot;Calif. retains economy that would be 8th largest&quot;], &quot;Businessweek&quot;, December 2, 2010, accessed December 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of countries by population|35th most populous]] nation.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Origin of the name California}}
The word ''California'' originally referred to the entire region composed of what is today the U.S. state of California, plus all or parts of [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], and [[Wyoming]], and the [[Baja California peninsula]] of Mexico.

The name ''California'' is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by [[Black People|Black]] [[Amazons]] and ruled by Queen [[Calafia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Putnam|first=Ruth|editor=Herbert Ingram Priestley|title=California: the name|url=http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924008278347|year=1917|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley|pages=356–361|chapter=Appendix A: Etymology of the Word &quot;California&quot;: Surmises and Usage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vogeley|first=Nancy|date=April 20, 2001|title=How Chivalry Formed the Myth of California|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|publisher=University of Washington|volume=62|issue=2|pages=165–188|url=http://mlq.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/62/2/165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work ''[[Las sergas de Esplandián|The Exploits of Esplandian]]'', written as a sequel to ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' by Spanish adventure writer [[Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo]].&lt;ref name=cpn&gt;Gudde, Erwin G. and William Bright. 2004.

:&lt;blockquote&gt;Know ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California, very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise, which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them, and they lived in the manner of Amazons. They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue. The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, 1917, [http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924008278347#page/n23/mode/1up/ p. 306]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name ''California'' is the fifth-[[List of oldest surviving European place-names in the U.S.|oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S.]] and was applied to what is now the southern tip of Baja California peninsula as the ''[[island of California]]'' by a Spanish expedition led by Diego de Becerra and [[Fortún Ximénez]], who landed there in 1533 at the behest of [[Hernán Cortés]].{{#tag:ref| [[Florida]], [[Dry Tortugas]], [[Cape Canaveral]], and [[Appalachian]] appeared earlier,....From Spanish historian [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]'s accounts, published in 1601.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart 1945&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last= Stewart|first=George |authorlink=George R.

California adjoins the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, [[Oregon]] to the north, [[Nevada]] and [[Arizona]] to the east, and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Baja California]] to the south. With an area of {{convert|160000|sqmi|km2|-3|sp=us}}, it is the third-[[List of U.S. states by area|largest state in the United States]] in size, after [[Alaska]] and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 population and housing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc3-us-pt1.pdf |format=PDF |title=2000 Census of Population and Housing|year=2004 |month=April |publisher=[[US Census Bureau]] |page=29|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it were a country, California would be the 59th-[[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|largest in the world in area]].

In the middle of the state lies the [[California Central Valley]], bounded by the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coastal mountain ranges]] in the west, the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] to the east, the [[Cascade Range]] in the north and the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] in the south. The Central Valley is California's agricultural heartland and grows approximately one-third of the nation's food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peak Oil&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=32 |title=Lessons for California and the U.S. from movie &quot;How Cuba survived Peak Oil&quot; |publisher=Culture Change |author=Alice Friedemann |accessdate=June 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;California's Water Woes Threaten the Entire Country's Food Supply&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/water/140487/california's_water_woes_threaten_the_entire_country's_food_supply/

Divided in two by the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]], the northern portion, the [[Sacramento Valley]] serves as the watershed of the [[Sacramento River]], while the southern portion, the [[San Joaquin Valley]] is the watershed for the [[San Joaquin River]]; both areas derive their names from the rivers that transit them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained sufficiently deep that several inland cities are [[seaport]]s.
[[Image:California Topography-MEDIUM.png|thumb|left|Topographic map of California]]

The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta serves as a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is routed through an extensive network of canals and pumps out of the delta, that traverse nearly the length of the state, including the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population, and provides water to farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. The [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] are located off the [[Southern California|southern]] [[South Coast (California)|coast]].

The Sierra Nevada ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;snowy range&quot;) includes the highest peak in the [[contiguous United States|contiguous forty-eight states]], [[Mount Whitney]], at 14,505&amp;nbsp;ft (4,421 m).&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=April 29, 2005 |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=U.S Geological Survey |accessdate= December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range embraces [[Yosemite Valley]], famous for its glacially carved domes, and [[Sequoia National Park]], home to the [[Sequoiadendron|giant sequoia]] trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, [[Lake Tahoe]], the largest lake in the state by volume.

To the east of the Sierra Nevada are [[Owens Valley]] and [[Mono Lake]], an essential [[bird migration|migratory bird]] habitat. In the western part of the state is [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Though Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including [[Palisade Glacier]], the southernmost glacier in the United States.

About 45 percent of the state's total surface area is covered by forests,&lt;ref name=&quot;Forestry 2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Many of the trees in the [[White Mountains (California)|California White Mountains]] are the oldest in the world; one [[Bristlecone pine]] has an age of 4,700 years.

In the south is a large inland salt lake, the [[Salton Sea]]. The south-central desert is called the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]]; to the northeast of the Mojave lies [[Death Valley]], which contains the lowest, hottest point in [[North America]], [[Badwater Basin]]. The distance from the lowest point of Death Valley to the peak of Mount Whitney is less than 200 miles (322&amp;nbsp;km). Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the [[Colorado River]], from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.

Along the California coast are several major metropolitan areas, including [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the [[San Diego metropolitan area]].

As part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]], California is subject to [[tsunami]]s, [[flood]]s, [[drought]]s, [[Santa Ana winds]], [[wildfire]]s, [[landslide]]s on steep terrain, and has several [[volcanoes]]. It sees numerous [[List of earthquakes in California|earthquake]]s due to several faults, in particular the [[San Andreas Fault]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of California}}
[[Image:Big Sur Coast California.JPG|thumb|right|Coastline at [[Big Sur]].]]
California's climate varies from [[Mediterranean Climate|Mediterranean]] to [[subarctic climate|subarctic]].

Much of the state has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with cool, rainy winters and dry summers. The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Further inland, one encounters colder winters and hotter summers.

Northern parts of the state average higher annual rainfall than the south. California's mountain ranges influence the climate as well: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have a [[mountain climate]] with [[snow]] in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.

[[Image:Snow on the mountains of Southern California.jpg|thumb|[[Snow]] on the [[mountains]] of [[Southern California]].]]

The east side of California's mountains produce a [[rain shadow]], creating expansive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] see hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the southern California mountains experience hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. [[Death Valley]], a desert with large expanses below [[sea level]], is considered the hottest location in [[North America]]; the highest temperature in the [[Western Hemisphere]], {{convert|134|°F|°C|0}}, was recorded there on July 10, 1913.

===Ecology===
{{Main|Ecology of California}}

California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the [[Nearctic ecozone]] and spans a number of terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Checklist of the Scarabaeoidea of the Nearctic Realm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf
|title=Checklist of the Scarabaeoidea of the Nearctic Realm|publisher=digitalcommons.unl.edu  (University of Nebraska State: Papers in Entomology)|year=2003|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CalaverasBigTrees2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Calaveras Big Trees State Park]]]]
California's large number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species includes [[relict]] species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina Ironwood (''Lyonothamnus floribundus''). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or [[adaptive radiation]], whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (''[[Ceanothus]]''). Many California endemics have become endangered, as [[urbanization]], [[logging]], [[overgrazing]], and the introduction of [[exotic species]] have encroached on their habitat.

===Flora and fauna===
California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the [[giant sequoia|largest trees]], the [[coast redwood|tallest trees]], and the [[pinus longaeva|oldest trees]]. California's native grasses are [[perennial plant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Restoring Native Grasses&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may04/grass0504.htm |title=Restoring California's Native Grasses |journal=Agricultural Research magazine |author=David Elstein |month=May |year=2004 |volume= 52 |issue= 5 |page=17 |accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After European contact, these were generally replaced by [[invasive species]] of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;The California Invasive Species List&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf
|title=The California Invasive Species List|publisher=iscc.ca.gov (California Invasive Species Advisory Committee)|date=2010-04-21|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran (desert); upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/California-Flora-and-fauna.html |title=California: flora and fauna|publisher=city-data.com |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The [[Joshua tree]] (Yucca brevifolia) is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of [[aster (genus)|aster]]s. [[Fremont cottonwood]] and [[valley oak]] thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. [[Nemophila]], [[Lamiaceae|mint]], [[phacelia]], [[viola]], and the [[California poppy]] (Eschscholtzia californica)- the state flower- also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;

The transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood ([[Sequoia sempervirens]]) and the &quot;big tree&quot; or giant sequoia (Sequoia gigantea), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). [[Tanbark oak]], [[California laurel]], [[Sugar Pine]], [[Arbutus|madrona]], broad-leaved maple, and [[Douglas-fir]] also grow here. Forest floors are covered with [[swordfern]], alumnroot, [[barrenwort]], and [[trillium]], and there are tickets of [[huckleberry]], [[azalea]], elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, [[tulip]], and [[Lilium columbianum|tiger]] and [[Lilium pardalinum|leopard]] lilies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_1/sequoia/sempervirens.htm|title=Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.|publisher=fed.us (U.S. Forest Service)|date=|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the [[Jeffrey Pine]], [[red fir]], and [[Lodgepole Pine]] to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf [[manzanita]] and [[ceanothus]]; the unique [[Sierra puffball]] is also found here. Right below the timeberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about 10,500&amp;nbsp;ft (3,200 m), begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including [[Sierra primrose]], [[Yellow Columbine|yellow columbine]], [[alpine buttercup]], and [[alpine shooting star]].&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierrahistorical.org/archives/lifezones.html

In the transition zone, there are Colombian [[Black-tailed Deer]], [[American Black Bear|black bear]]s, [[gray fox]]es, [[cougar]]s, [[bobcat]]s, and [[Roosevelt elk]]. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the [[water puppy]] and [[redwood salamander]] are common too. Birds such as the [[kingfisher]], chickadee, [[towhee]], and hummingbird thrive here as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Black-tailed Deer of California&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernhunter.com/Pages/Vol02Issue24/blacktail.html|title=Black-tailed Deer of California|publisher=westernhunter.com|year=2000|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian zone mammals include the [[Mountain Weasel]], [[Snowshoe Hare]], [[Sierra chickadee]], and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the [[blue-fronted jay]], [[Sierra hermit thrush]], [[water ouzel]], and [[Townsend solitaire]]. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the Sierra rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as the hummingbird and [[Clark's Nutcracker]]. Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, [[White-tailed Jackrabbit]], and the [[Bighorn Sheep]]. As of April 2003, the Bighorn Sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the [[mule deer]], coyote, [[mountain lion]], [[Northern Flicker]], and several species of hawk and sparrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;

Aquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Golden trout|golden]], and [[Tahoe trout|Tahoe]]. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include [[White seabass|sea bass]], [[yellowfin tuna]], [[barracuda]], and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;

As of April 2003, 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened.

===Rivers===
{{Main|List of rivers of California}}

The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are looked after by the [[California Coastal Commission]]

The two most prominent rivers within California are the [[Sacramento River]] and the [[San Joaquin River]], which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the [[Pacific Ocean]] through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Several major tributaries feed into the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, including the [[Pit River]], the [[Tuolumne River]], and the [[Feather River]].

The [[Owens River]] takes runoff from the southeastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada and flows into [[Owens Lake]]. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California.

Some other important rivers are the [[Klamath River]] and the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]] in the far north coast, and the [[Colorado River]] on the southeast border with [[Arizona]].

==History==
{{California history sidebar}}
{{Main|History of California}}
Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian [[North America]]; The [[Indigenous peoples of California]] included more than [[Classification of Native Americans#California|70 distinct groups]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s. Large, settled populations lived on the coast and hunted sea mammals, fished for salmon and gathered shellfish; groups in the interior hunted terrestrial game, and gathered nuts, acorns and berries. California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]], [[Pomo people|Pomo]] and [[Salinan]]. Trade, intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups.

The first European to explore the coast as far north as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] was the Portuguese [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]], in 1542, sailing for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Some 37 years later [[England|English]] explorer [[Francis Drake]] also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579. Spanish traders made unintended visits with the [[Manila Galleon]]s on their return trips from the [[Philippines]] beginning in 1565. [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for [[New Spain]].

Spanish [[missionaries]] began setting up 21 [[California Missions]] along the coast of what became known as [[Alta California]] (Upper California), together with small towns and ''presidios''. In 1821 the [[Mexican War of Independence]] gave [[Mexico]] (including California) independence from Spain; for the next 25 years, [[Alta California]] remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexico. Cattle ranches, or ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]'', emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. After Mexican independence from Spain, the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and were [[secularized]] by 1832. The ranchos developed under ownership by [[Californios]] (Spanish-speaking Californians) who had received land grants, and traded cowhides and tallow with [[Boston]] merchants.

Beginning in the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the U.S. and Canada began to arrive in Northern California, harbingers of the great changes that would later sweep the Mexican territory. These new arrivals used the [[Siskiyou Trail]], [[California Trail]], [[Oregon Trail]] and [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts surrounding California. In this period, [[Imperial Russia]] explored the California coast and established a trading post at [[Fort Ross]].
[[Image:Firstbearflag.jpg|thumb|The [[Bear Flag]] of the Republic of California]]

In 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the [[Bear Flag Revolt]]. Afterwards, rebels raised the [[Bear Flag]] (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words &quot;California Republic&quot;) at Sonoma.

|“[We] overthrow a Government which has seized upon the property of the Missions for its individual [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]]; which has ruined and shamefully oppressed the laboring people of California.”
|William Ide|Declaration from the Bear Flag Revolt
}}
The Republic's first and only president was [[William B. Ide]],&lt;ref name=&quot;William B. Ide Adobe SHP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=458|title=William B. Ide Adobe SHP|publisher=California State Parks|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt. His term lasted 22 days and concluded when California was occupied by U.S. forces during the [[Mexican-American War]].

The California Republic was short lived. The same year marked the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846–1848). When Commodore [[John D. Sloat]] of the [[United States Navy]] sailed into [[Monterey Bay]] and began the military occupation of California by the [[United States]]. Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the U.S. forces. After a series of defensive battles in [[Southern California]], including The [[Siege of Los Angeles]], the [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho]], the [[Battle of San Pasqual]], the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel]] and the [[Battle of La Mesa]], the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed by the [[Californios]] on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California. Following the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] that ended the war, the region was divided between Mexico and the U.S.; the western territory of [[Alta California]], was to become the U.S. state of California, and [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]] became U.S. Territories, while the lower region of California, the Baja Peninsula, remained in the possession of [[Mexico]].
[[Image:SanFranciscoharbor1851c sharp.jpg|thumb|left|[[San Francisco]] harbor c. 1850. Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.]]
In 1848 the non-native population of California was estimated to be no more than 15,000. But after gold was discovered, the population burgeoned with U.S. citizens, Europeans and other immigrants during the great [[California Gold Rush]]. By 1854 over 300,000 settlers had come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Gold Rush, 1848–1864|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=118|work=Learn California.org, a site designed for the [[California Secretary of State]]|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 1850, as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], California was admitted to the [[United States]] undivided as a [[Free state (USA)|free state]], denying the expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] to the Pacific Coast.

The seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule was located at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] from 1777 until 1835, when Mexican authorities abandoned California, leaving their missions and military forts behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliam 1846&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilliam |first=Albert |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=VzICAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=PA&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Travels Over the Table Lands and Cordilleras of Mexico: During the Years 1843 and 44] |publisher=John Moore |year=1846 |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 the Constitutional Convention was first held there. Among the duties was the task of determining the location for the new state capital. The first legislative sessions were held in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (1850–1851). Subsequent locations included [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] (1852–1853), and nearby [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] (1853–1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well. The capital has been located in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] since 1854&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Dotson |last2=Ebbert |first2 = Brian S. |year=2006 |title=California's Legislature |edition=2006 |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pdf/caleg11.pdf |location=Sacramento |publisher=California State Assembly |oclc=70700867|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only a short break in 1861 when legislative sessions were held in [[San Francisco]] due to flooding in Sacramento.

[[File:Hollywood-Studios-1922.jpg|thumb|Hollywood film studios, 1922]]
Travel between California and the central and eastern parts of the U.S. was time consuming and dangerous. A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] through [[Donner Pass]] in the Sierra Nevada mountains. After this rail link was established, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens came west, where new Californians were discovering that land in the state, if irrigated during the dry summer months, was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.

Migration to California accelerated during the early-20th century with the completion of major transcontinental [[highway]]s like the [[Lincoln Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|Route 66]]. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union. In order to meet the population's needs, major engineering feats like the [[California Aqueduct|California]] and [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]]s; the [[Oroville Dam|Oroville]] and [[Shasta Dam]]s; and the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay]] and [[Golden Gate Bridge]]s were built across the state. The state government also adopted the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]] in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education.

Meanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the [[studio system]] in [[Hollywood]] in the 1920s. A couple of decades later, [[Stanford University]] and its Dean of Engineering [[Frederick Terman]] began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state, and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/travel/escapes/17Amer.html?pagewanted=1|title=Searching for Silicon Valley|last=Markoff|first=John|date=2009-04-17|work=[[New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these efforts, California is currently regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology and engineering businesses, and as the U.S. center of agricultural production.

===Culture===
{{Main|Culture of California}}

The culture of California is a Western culture and most clearly has its modern roots in the [[culture of the United States]], but also, historically, many [[Hispanic]] influences. As a border and coastal state, Californian culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World of Opportunity&quot;&gt;{{cite web

California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th Century, fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as [[The Beach Boys]] promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers.

In terms of socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more [[American liberalism|liberal]] than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states. In some ways, California is the quintessential [[Blue state|Blue State]]-- accepting of alternative lifestyles, not uniformly religious, and preoccupied with environmental issues.

The [[California Gold Rush|gold rush]] of the 1850s is still seen as a symbol of California's economic style, which tends to generate technology, social, entertainment, and economic fads and booms and related busts.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in California}}
[[File:San-diego-mission-chuch.JPG|[[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]]|thumb|right]]
The largest religious denominations by number of adherents as a percentage of California's population in 2008 were the [[Catholic Church]] with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Affi liation by State in the U.S.|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|work=U.S Religious Landscape Study|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=24 June 2010|page=103|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first priests to come to California were Roman Catholic missionaries from [[Spain]]. Roman Catholics founded [[California missions|21 missions along the California coast]], as well as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. California continues to have a large Roman Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]] and the [[Archdiocese of San Francisco]], the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States.

A [[Pew Research Center]] survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the US: 62 percent of Californians say they are &quot;absolutely certain&quot; of the belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is &quot;very important,&quot; compared to 56 percent nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfland 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Helfand |first=Duke |title= State has a relaxed view on religion – Survey finds Californians are less certain about the existence of God than others in the U.S. |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | publisher= [[Tribune Company]] |date=June 24, 2008 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/24/local/me-faith24 |accessdate=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One potential problem is that a substantial portion of the state's income comes from income taxes on a small proportion of wealthy citizens.

==Energy==
{{Main|Energy use in California}}

Because it is the most populous U.S. state, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. However because of its mild weather and strong environmental movement, its ''[[per capita]]'' energy use is one of the smallest of any U.S. state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

As a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has the some of the most aggressive [[renewable energy]] goals in the United States, with a target for California to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BG4YI20091217 California OKs new transmission for renewables] ''Reuters'', December 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, several [[solar power plants]] such as the [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] facility are located in the [[Mojave Desert]]. [[Wind power in California|California's wind farms]] include [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm|Altamont Pass]], [[San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm|San Gorgonio Pass]], and [[Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm|Tehachapi Pass]]. And a number of dams across the state also provide [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric power]].

The state’s crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast, including the large [[Midway-Sunset Oil Field]]. Natural gas-fired [[power plants]] typically account for more than one-half of State electricity generation.

California is also home to two major [[nuclear power]] plants: [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] and [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station|San Onofre]]. However, voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over [[radioactive waste disposal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

[[File:California Map.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Map of California showing the primary cities and roadways]]
California's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of [[freeway]]s, [[expressway]]s, and [[highway]]s. California is known for its [[car culture]], giving California's cities a reputation for severe [[traffic congestion]]. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the [[California Department of Transportation]], nicknamed &quot;Caltrans&quot;. The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mieszkowski |first=Katharine |url=http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/pulse-of-the-bay/read-while-you-are-waiting-traffic-clear |title=California Is Tops in Worst Roads - Pulse of the Bay |publisher=The Bay Citizen |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/9621456 | work=The Economist | title=A bridge too far gone | date=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first.&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.org/files/19th_annual_highway_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the state's more visible landmarks, the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] was completed in 1937. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. It is simultaneously designated as [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]], which is part of the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] (Spanish for Royal Road or King's Highway), and [[California State Route 1|State Route 1]], also known as the [[Pacific Coast Highway (United States)|Pacific Coast Highway]]. Another of the seven bridges in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]] (often abbreviated the &quot;Bay Bridge&quot;), completed in 1936. This bridge transports approximately 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks, with its two sections meeting at [[Yerba Buena Island]].

[[Los Angeles International Airport]] and [[San Francisco International Airport]] are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial [[airport]]s and many more [[general aviation]] [[List of airports in California|airports]] throughout the state.

California also has several important [[seaport]]s. The giant seaport complex formed by the [[Port of Los Angeles]] and the [[Long Beach, California#Shipping and transportation|Port of Long Beach]] in Southern California is the largest in the country and responsible for handling about a fourth of all container cargo traffic in the United States. The [[Port of Oakland]], fourth largest in the nation, handles trade from the Pacific Rim and delivers most of the ocean containers passing through Northern California to the entire USA.

The [[California Highway Patrol]] is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in terms of employment with over 10,000 employees, and perhaps the most legendary, especially because they have been featured in their own sitcom, CHiPs. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California's state maintained highways and on state property.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles is by far the largest in North America. By the end of 2009, the California DMV had 26,555,006 driver's licenses and ID cards on file.&lt;ref&gt;http://dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/official.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, there were 1.17 million new vehicle registrations in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_17197542 |title=California new-car sales up 13.1 percent in 2010 |publisher=San Jose Mercury News |date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intercity rail travel is provided by [[Amtrak California]], which manages the three busiest intercity rail lines in the U.S. outside the [[Northeast Corridor]], all of which are funded by Caltrans. This service is becoming increasingly popular over flying and ridership is continuing to set records, especially on the LAX-SFO route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/05/BAMU1GU16Q.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Michael | last=Cabanatuan | title=Calif.

Light rail systems are also found in San Jose ([[Santa Clara VTA Light-rail|VTA]]), San Diego ([[San Diego Trolley]]), Sacramento ([[Sacramento Regional Transit District|RT Light Rail]]), and Northern San Diego County ([[Sprinter (San Diego)|Sprinter]]). Furthermore, [[commuter rail]] networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area ([[Altamont Commuter Express|ACE]], [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]], [[Caltrain]]), Greater Los Angeles ([[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]), and San Diego County ([[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]]).

The [[California High-Speed Rail]] Authority was created in 1996 by the state to implement an extensive 700 mile (1127&amp;nbsp;km) rail system. Construction was approved by the voters during the November 2008 general election, a $9.95 billion state bond will go toward its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/08/BAV6140IK5.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Michael | last=Cabanatuan | title=Plan for high-speed rail system released | date=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all counties operate [[bus]] lines, and many cities operate their own bus lines as well. Intercity bus travel is provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and Amtrak Thruway Coach.

==Government and politics==
&lt;!-- Please consider using the daughter article for more detailed or controversial views or topics. Please limit this article to basic overview information and non-controversial views and topics --&gt;

===State government===
{{Main|Government of California}}
[[Image:Sacramento Capitol.jpg|thumb|The [[California State Capitol]] building in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].]]
California is governed as a [[republic]], with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]&amp;nbsp;— the [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[Governor of California|Governor]] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] and [[California State Senate|Senate]]; and the [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Supreme Court of California]] and lower courts. The state also allows direct participation of the electorate by [[initiative]], [[referendum]], [[recall election|recall]], and [[ratification]]. California allows each political party to choose whether to have a [[closed primary]] or a primary where only party members and [[independent (politics)|independents]] vote. The state's capital is [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

The Governor of California and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The [[California State Legislature]] consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly. Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to [[term limit]]s of three terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of two terms.

California's legal system is explicitly based upon English [[common law]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cal Civil Code 22.2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

California's [[judiciary]] is the largest in the United States (with a total of 1,600 judges, while the federal system has only about 840). It is supervised by the seven Justices of the [[Supreme Court of California]]. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the Governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years.

California has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the county, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/30/eveningnews/main2138297.shtml | title=California Is A Political Trendsetter | date=October 30, 2006 | accessdate=February 22, 2011 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second state [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|to recall their state governor]], the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban [[marriage]] for gay couples twice by voters (including [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8 in 2008]]). Voters also passed [[California Proposition 71 (2004)|Proposition 71 in 2004]] to fund [[stem cell]] research, and [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14 in 2010]] to completely change the state's [[primary election]] process. California has also experienced [[California Water Wars|disputes over water rights]]; and a [[tax revolt]], culminating with the passage of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13 in 1978]], limiting state [[property tax]]es.

What has been consistent in the last few decades is that California politics has trended towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Once very [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], having elected Republicans, California is now a reliable [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], Democratic state. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor [[Jerry Brown]]; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], tend to be considered &quot;Moderate Republicans&quot; and more centrist than the national party.

The Democrats also hold a majority in both houses of the state legislature. There are currently 52 Democrats and 27 Republicans in the Assembly; and 25 Democrats and 15 Republicans in the Senate.

The trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections; the Democratic Party candidate has won California's [[electoral vote]]s in the last five elections. Additionally, both the state's current Democratic U.S. Senators, [[Dianne Feinstein]], a native and former mayor of [[San Francisco]], and [[Barbara Boxer]], a former congresswoman from [[Marin County]], have held onto their seats since they were first elected in 1992.

In the U.S. House, the Democrats have held a 34–19 edge since the seating of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California are usually dominated by one or the other party with very few districts that could be considered competitive.

In general, Democratic strength is centered in [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of [[Los Angeles County]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] also remains mostly Republican. One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and San Francisco in the top 10 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and [[Orange, California|Orange]] in the top 10 most conservative cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html | publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research | title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities | date=August 16, 2005 | accessdate=February 20. 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of these cities and towns are within one of five [[metropolitan area]]s. Sixty-eight percent of California's population lives in its three largest metropolitan areas, [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the [[Riverside-San Bernardino Area]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Although smaller, the other two large population centers are the [[San Diego metropolitan area|San Diego]] and [[Sacramento metropolitan area|Greater Sacramento]] metro areas.

The state recognizes two kinds of cities: [[Charter city|charter]] and general law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cal Gov Code 34502&quot;/&gt; General law cities owe their existence to state law and are consequentially governed by it; charter cities are governed by their own city charters. Cities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter cities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities.

In expenditure per pupil, California ranked 29th (of the 50 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]) in 2005–06. In teaching staff expenditure per pupil, California ranked 49th of 51. In overall teacher-pupil ratio, California was also 49th, with 21 students per teacher. Only Arizona and Utah were lower.&lt;ref name=&quot;How&quot;&gt;{{cite web

California's public [[postsecondary education]] offers a unique three tiered system:
*The research university system in the state is the [[University of California]] (UC), a [[public university]] system. There are ten general UC campuses, and a number of specialized campuses in the UC system.
*The [[California State University]] (CSU) system has almost 450,000 students, making it the largest university system in the United States. It is intended to accept the top one-third of high school students. The 23 CSU schools are primarily intended for undergraduate education.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSU Facts 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = CSU Facts 2008

{{Main|Sports in California|List of professional sports teams in California}}
California hosted the [[1960 Winter Olympics]] at [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort]], the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], as well as the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].

California has nineteen [[major professional sports league]] franchises, far more than any other state. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] has seven major league teams spread in three cities, [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. While the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises, it is also the largest metropolitan area not to have a team from the [[National Football League]]. San Diego has two major league teams, and [[Sacramento]] has one.

Home to some of the most prominent universities in the United States, California has long had many respected collegiate sports programs. California home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], among others.

California has also long been a hub for motorsports and auto racing. The city of Long Beach holds an event every year in the month of April, which is host to [[IndyCar Series]] racing through the streets of downtown. Long Beach has hosted [[Formula One]] events there in the past, and also currently hosts an event on the [[American Le Mans Series]] schedule. [[Auto Club Speedway]] is a speedway in Fontana, and currently hosts one to two [[NASCAR]] Sprint Cup Series races a year, and used to host [[Champ Car|CART]] Indycar races. [[Infineon Raceway]] in Sonoma is a multi-purpose facility, featuring a road course and a drag strip. The road course is home to a NASCAR event, an [[IndyCar]] event, and used to host an [[International Motor Sports Association]] sports car event. The drag strip hosts a yearly [[NHRA]] event. [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]] is a roadcourse that currently hosts an ALMS event, and formerly hosted CART events.  The [[Auto Club Raceway at Pomona]] has hosted NHRA drag racing for over 50 years.

The '''Columbia River''' is the largest [[river]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the United States Geological Survey fact sheet, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/pdf/ofr87242.pdf &quot;Largest Rivers in the United States&quot;], &quot;Rivers are considered large on the basis of one or more of three characteristics: total length from source to mouth, area of basin (watershed) drained by the stream, and average rate of flow (discharge) at the mouth.&quot; The Columbia is the largest river of the Pacific Northwest in all three senses.&lt;/ref&gt; The river [[Headwater#Related_usages|rises]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], flows northwest and then south into the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of [[Oregon]] before emptying into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The river is {{convert|1243|mi|km}} long, and its largest tributary is the [[Snake River]]. Its [[drainage basin]] is roughly the size of [[France]] and extends into seven U.S. states and a Canadian province.

By volume, the Columbia is the fourth-largest river in the U.S., and it has the greatest flow of any North American river draining into the Pacific. The river's heavy flow and its relatively steep gradient give it tremendous potential for the generation of electricity. The [[Hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River|14&amp;nbsp;hydroelectric dams]] on the Columbia's [[main stem]] and many more on its tributaries produce more [[hydroelectric power]] than those of any other North American river.

The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region's culture and economy for thousands of years. They have been used for transportation since ancient times, linking the many cultural groups of the region. The river system hosts many species of [[anadromous]] fish, which migrate between [[freshwater]] habitats and the [[Saline water|saline]] Pacific Ocean. These fish—especially the [[salmon]] species—provided the core subsistence for natives; in past centuries, traders from across western North America traveled to the Columbia to trade for fish.

In the late 18th&amp;nbsp;century, a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river; it was followed by a British explorer, who navigated past the [[Oregon Coast Range]] into the [[Willamette Valley]]. In the following decades, [[fur trade|fur trading]] companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic but treacherous [[Columbia River Gorge]], and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers, following both routes to enter it.  [[Steamship]]s along the river linked communities and facilitated trade; the arrival of railroads in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century, many running along the river, supplemented these links.

Since the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century, [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector|private]] sectors have heavily developed the river. The development, commonly referred to as taming or harnessing of the river, has been massive and multi-faceted. To aid ship and barge navigation, [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and [[dredging]] has opened, maintained, and enlarged [[Channel (geography)|shipping channels]]. Since the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, dams have been built across the river for the purposes of power generation, navigation, [[irrigation]], and flood control. Today, a dam-impounded [[reservoir]] lies along nearly every U.S. mile of the once free-flowing river, and much of the Canadian stretch has been impounded as well. Production of [[nuclear power]] has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for [[nuclear weapon]]s was produced for decades at the [[Hanford Site]], which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the U.S. All these developments have had a tremendous impact on river environments, perhaps most notably through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.

==Course==
The Columbia begins its {{convert|1243|mi|km|adj=on}} journey in the southern [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] in British Columbia (BC). [[Columbia Lake]] – {{convert|2690|ft|m|}} above [[sea level]] – and the adjoining [[Columbia Wetlands]] form the river's [[headwaters]]. The trench is a broad, deep, and long [[glacial valley]] between the [[Canadian Rockies]] and the [[Columbia Mountains]] in BC. For its first {{convert|200|mi|km|}}, the Columbia flows northwest along the trench through [[Windermere Lake (British Columbia)|Windermere Lake]] and the town of [[Invermere, British Columbia|Invermere]], a region known in BC as the [[Columbia Valley]], then northwest to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] and into [[Kinbasket Lake]]. Rounding the northern end of the [[Selkirk Mountains]], the river turns sharply south through a region known as the [[Big Bend Country]], passing through [[Revelstoke Lake]] and the [[Arrow Lakes]]. Revelstoke, the Big Bend, and the Columbia Valley combined are referred to in BC parlance as the [[Columbia Country]]. Below the Arrow Lakes, the Columbia passes the cities of [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]], located at the Columbia's [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] with the [[Kootenay River]], and [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], two major population centers of the [[West Kootenay]] region. The [[Pend Oreille River]] joins the Columbia about {{convert|2|mi|0}} north of the [[Canada – United States border|U.S.–Canada border]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas of canada&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Columbia enters [[eastern Washington]] flowing south and turning to the west at the [[Spokane River]] confluence. It marks the southern and eastern borders of the [[Colville Indian Reservation]] and the western border of the [[Spokane Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;colvillehealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river turns south after the [[Okanogan River]] confluence, then southeasterly near the confluence with the [[Wenatchee River]] in central Washington. This C-shaped segment of the river is also known as the &quot;Big Bend&quot;. During the [[Missoula Floods]] 10,000 to 15,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, much of the floodwater took a more direct route south, forming the ancient river bed known as the [[Grand Coulee]]. After the floods, the river found its present course, and the Grand Coulee was left dry. The construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century impounded the river, forming [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake|Lake Roosevelt]], from which water was pumped into the dry [[coulee]], forming the [[reservoir]] of [[Banks Lake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;basinproj&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The river flows past [[The Gorge Amphitheatre]], a prominent concert venue in the Northwest, then through [[Priest Rapids Dam]], and then through the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Nuclear Reservation]]. Entirely within the reservation is [[Hanford Reach]], the only U.S. stretch of the river that is completely free-flowing, unimpeded by dams and not a tidal [[estuary]]. The [[Snake River]] and [[Yakima River]] join the Columbia in the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]] population center. The Columbia makes a sharp bend to the west at the Washington–Oregon border. The river defines that border for the final {{convert|309|mi|km}} of its journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]] joins the Columbia near [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]]. Between The Dalles and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the river cuts through the [[Cascade Range]], forming the dramatic [[Columbia River Gorge]]. No other river except for the [[Klamath River|Klamath]] completely breaches the Cascades—the other rivers that flow through the range also originate in or very near the mountains. The headwaters and upper course of the [[Pit River]] flows through much of the Cascades; in contrast the Columbia cuts through the range nearly a thousand miles from its source in the Rocky Mountains. The gorge is known for its strong and steady winds, scenic beauty, and its role as an important transportation link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river continues west, bending sharply to the north-northwest near Portland and [[Vancouver, Washington]], at the [[Willamette River]] confluence. Here the river slows considerably, dropping sediment that might otherwise form a [[river delta]]. Near [[Longview, Washington]] and the [[Cowlitz River]] confluence, the river turns west again. The Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean just west of [[Astoria, Oregon]], over the [[Columbia Bar]], a shifting [[sandbar]] that makes the river's mouth one of the most hazardous stretches of water to navigate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Columbia drains an area of about {{convert|258000|mi2|km2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSrivers&quot;/&gt; Its drainage basin covers nearly all of [[Idaho]], large portions of British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington, and small portions of [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], and [[Nevada]]; the total area is similar to the size of [[France]].

The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the [[Great Plains]] for [[bison]] hunting, adopted the plains culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture unevenly.

Less affected groups included the [[Molala]], [[Klickitat (tribe)|Klickitat]], [[Wenatchi]], Okanagan, and [[Sinkiuse-Columbia]] peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features.

Some historians believe that Japanese or Chinese vessels blown off course reached the Northwest Coast long before Europeans, possibly as early as 219&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It is a near certainty that Japanese or Chinese people arrived on the northwest coast long before any European.&quot;{{cite book | author=Hayes | first=Derek | title=Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of Exploration and Discovery | place=Seattle, Washington | publisher=Sasquatch Books | year=1999 | page=9 | isbn=1570612153}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether they landed near the Columbia. Evidence exists that Spanish castaways reached the shore in 1679 and traded with the [[Clatsop]]; if these were indeed the first Europeans to see the Columbia, they failed to send word home to Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Hayes | first=Derek | title=Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of Exploration and Discovery | place=Seattle, Washington | publisher=Sasquatch Books | year=1999 | isbn=1570612153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, there was strong interest in discovering a [[Northwest Passage]] that would permit navigation between the Atlantic (or inland North America) and the Pacific Ocean. Many ships in the area, especially those under Spanish and British command, searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to [[Hudson Bay]] or the [[Missouri River]]. The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of [[Bruno de Heceta]], who in 1775 sighted the river's mouth. On the advice of his officers, he did not explore it, as he was short-staffed and the current was strong. He considered it a bay, and called it ''Ensenada de Asunción''. Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river, labeled ''Rio de San Roque'',&lt;ref name=&quot;HistLinkGray&quot;/&gt; or an entrance, called ''Entrada de Hezeta''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;/&gt; Following Heceta's reports, British [[maritime fur trade]]r Captain [[John Meares]] searched for the river in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cape Disappointment State Park |url = http://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/caped.htm |year = 2006  | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He named [[Cape Disappointment (Washington)|Cape Disappointment]] for the non-existent river, not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river's mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Denton, V.L.  ''The Far West Coast'', p. 174.  Toronto, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

What happened next would form the basis for decades of both cooperation and dispute between British and American exploration of, and ownership claim to, the region. [[Royal Navy]] commander [[George Vancouver]] sailed past the mouth in April 1792 and observed a change in the water's color, but he accepted Meares' report and continued on his journey northward.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistLinkGray&quot;/&gt; Later that month, Vancouver encountered the [[United States|American]] captain [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] at the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].

Because the Columbia was at the same latitude as the headwaters of the [[Missouri River]], there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;/&gt; However, when the American explorers [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] charted the vast, unmapped lands of the [[American West]] in their [[Lewis and Clark expedition|overland expedition]] (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the [[Rocky Mountains]], Lewis and Clark built [[dugout canoe]]s and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day [[Tri-Cities, Washington]]. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as [[Bateman Island]], before heading down the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing [[Fort Clatsop]], a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;/&gt;

[[Canada|Canadian]] explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], of the [[North West Company]], spent the winter of 1807–08 at [[Kootenae House]] near the source of the Columbia at present-day [[Invermere, British Columbia]]. Over the next few years he explored much of the river and its northern tributaries. In 1811, he traveled down the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean, arriving at the mouth just after [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[Pacific Fur Company]] had founded Astoria. On his return to the north, Thompson explored the one remaining part of the river he had not yet seen, becoming the first European-American to travel the entire length of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;/&gt;

In 1825 the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) established [[Fort Vancouver]] on the bank of the Columbia, in what is now [[Vancouver, Washington]], as the headquarters of the company's [[Columbia District]], which encompassed everything west of the Rocky Mountains. [[John McLoughlin]], a physician, was appointed [[Factor (agent)|Chief Factor]] of the Columbia District.

In the [[Treaty of 1818]] the United States and Britain agreed that both nations were to enjoy equal rights in [[Oregon Country]] for 10&amp;nbsp;years. By 1828, when the so-called &quot;joint occupation&quot; was renewed for an indefinite period, it seemed probable that the lower Columbia River would in time become the border. For years the Hudson's Bay Company successfully maintained control of the Columbia River and American attempts to gain a foothold were fended off. In the 1830s, however, American religious missions were established at several locations in the lower Columbia River region. And in the 1840s a mass migration of American settlers undermined British control. The Hudson's Bay Company tried to maintain dominance by shifting from the fur trade, which was in sharp decline, to exporting other goods such as salmon and lumber. Colonization schemes were attempted, but failed to match the scale of American settlement. Americans generally settled south of the Columbia, mainly in the Willamette Valley. The Hudson's Bay Company tried to establish settlements north of the river, but nearly all the British colonists moved south to the Willamette Valley. The hope that the British colonists might dilute the American flavor of the valley failed in the face of the overwhelming number of American settlers.  These developments rekindled the issue of &quot;joint occupation&quot; and the [[oregon boundary dispute|boundary dispute]].  While some British interests, especially the Hudson's Bay Company, fought for a boundary along the Columbia River, the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 set the boundary at the 49th&amp;nbsp;parallel.  The Columbia River did become the border between the U.S. territories of [[Oregon Territory|Oregon]] and [[Washington Territory|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Meinig |first= D.W. |authorlink= D.W.

===Opening the passage to Lewiston===
As early as 1881, industrialists proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;opbtimeline&quot;/&gt; Changes to the river over the years have included the construction of [[jetty|jetties]] at the river's mouth, [[dredging]], and the construction of [[canal]]s and [[lock (water transport)|navigation locks]]. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as [[Lewiston, Idaho]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ccrh-hist&quot;/&gt;

The shifting Columbia Bar makes passage between the river and the Pacific Ocean difficult and dangerous, and numerous rapids along the river hinder navigation. Jetties, first constructed in 1886,&lt;ref name=&quot;opbtimeline&quot;/&gt; extend the river's channel into the ocean. Strong currents and the shifting sandbar remain a threat to ships entering the river and necessitate continuous maintenance of the jetties. 

In 1891 the Columbia was dredged to enhance shipping. The channel between the ocean and Portland and Vancouver was deepened from {{convert|17|ft|m}} to {{convert|25|ft|m}}. ''[[The Columbian]]'' called for the channel to be deepened to {{convert|40|ft|m}} as early as 1905, but that depth was not attained until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Essayons.JPG|thumb|alt=A large, almost rectangular black ship with a red hull creates a mild wake as it moves away from the shore into a very large river. Smoke rises above its decks, which are cluttered with antennas, mechanical fittings, and what appear to be self-contained rooms with multiple windows. | The ''Essayons'', one of three Army Corps of Engineers dredges tasked with ongoing maintenance of the Columbia's shipping channel, began service in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hopper Dredges

Efforts to maintain and improve the navigation channel have continued to the present day. In 1990, a new round of studies examined the possibility of further dredging on the lower Columbia. The plans were controversial from the start because of economic and environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1999, Congress authorized deepening the channel between Portland and Astoria from {{convert|40|to(-)|43|ft|m}}, which will make it possible for large container and grain ships to reach Portland and Vancouver.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColDredge&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Work on the project began in 2005 and is expected to conclude in 2010. The project's cost is estimated at $150&amp;nbsp;million. The federal government is paying 65&amp;nbsp;percent, Oregon and Washington are paying $27&amp;nbsp;million each, and six local ports are also contributing to the cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColDredge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
