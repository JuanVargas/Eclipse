Though intentional walks are recorded as such in the records of the [[official scorer]], they are combined with standard, non-intentional walks when calculating a player's on-base percentage, and were only given a separate column with a player's statistics since [[1955 in baseball|1955]].

Batters, on occasion, have been given intentional walks with the bases loaded (effectively giving the offensive team a risk-free run), although this occurs very infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;Holtzman, Jerome (May 2000). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_5_59/ai_64150752/ Free Pass—Players who were intentionally walked with bases loaded - Brief Article]. ''[[Baseball Digest]]''. Retrieved on 2009-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common nickname for the intentional walk is '''four-finger salute''', since most [[manager (baseball)|managers]] call for an intentional walk by holding up four fingers. Outside the professional leagues, such as in high school or college baseball, the manager may simply request to the plate umpire to let the batter go to first instead of having the pitcher waste four outside pitches.

[[Barry Bonds]] is the all time record holder with 688 intentional bases on balls (as of the start of the 2008 season).  The next most is [[Hank Aaron]] with 293.

In [[baseball statistics]], '''total bases''' refers to the number of bases a player has gained with [[hit (baseball)|hits]], i.e., the sum of his hits [[weight function|weighted]] by 1 for a [[single (baseball)|single]], 2 for a [[double (baseball)|double]], 3 for a [[triple (baseball)|triple]] and 4 for a [[home run]].
Only bases attained from [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] count toward this total.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Hit by pitch joe crede.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Joe Crede]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] after being hit by a pitch.]]
In [[baseball]], '''hit by pitch''' ('''HBP'''), or '''hit batsman''' ('''HB'''), is a [[batter (baseball)|batter]] or his equipment (other than his bat) being hit in some part of his body by a pitch from the [[pitcher]]. 

==Official rule==
Per baseball official rule 6.08(b), a batter becomes a [[baserunning|baserunner]] and is awarded first base when he or his equipment (except for his bat):
* is touched by a pitched ball outside of the [[strike zone]],
* ''and'' he attempts to avoid it (or had no opportunity to avoid it),
* ''and'' he did not swing at the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Official info: Official Rules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
If all these conditions are met, the ball is dead, and other baserunners advance if they are forced to vacate their base by the batter taking first. Rule 5.09(a) further clarifies that a hit by pitch is also called when a pitch touches a batter's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/ball_in_play_5.jsp The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Official info: Official Rules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case where a batter swings and the pitch hits him anyway, the ball is dead and a [[strike zone|strike]] is called.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/definition_terms_2.jsp The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Official info: Official Rules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  If the batter does not attempt to avoid the pitch, he is not awarded first base, and the pitch is ruled a strike if in the strike zone and a ball if out of the strike zone. In practice, umpires rarely make this call.  Perhaps the most famous instance of a non-hit by pitch was on May 31, 1968, when [[Don Drysdale]] hit [[Dick Dietz]] with a pitch that would have forced in a run and ended Drysdale's scoreless innings streak at 44.  Umpire Harry Wendelstedt ruled that Dietz made no effort to avoid the pitch, Dietz proceeded to [[fly out]], and Drysdale's scoreless streak continued to a then-record 58 2/3 innings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050629&amp;content_id=1108528&amp;vkey=news_atl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=atl The Official Site of The Atlanta Braves: News: Atlanta Braves News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A hit by pitch can also be called on a pitch that has touched the ground. Such a bouncing pitch is like any other, and if a batter is hit by such a pitch, he will be awarded first unless he made no attempt to avoid it.

A batter hit by a pitch is not credited with a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] or [[at bat]], but is credited with a [[times on base|time on base]] and a [[plate appearance]]; therefore, being hit by a pitch does not increase or decrease a player's [[batting average]] but does increase his [[on-base percentage]]. A batter hit by a pitch with the [[bases loaded]] is also credited with an [[Run batted in|RBI]] per MLB rule 10.04(a)(2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf Divisions Of The Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A pitch ruled a hit by pitch is recorded as a ball in the pitcher's [[pitch count]], since by definition the ball must be outside the strike zone and not have been swung at.

The rule awarding first base to a batter hit by a pitch was instituted in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/rules_chronology.stm Baseball Rules Chronology: 1845-1899 | BaseballLibrary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactical use==
[[Inside pitching]] is a common and legal tactic in [[baseball]], and many players make use of [[brushback pitch]]es, or pitches aimed underneath the chin, commonly referred to as 'chin music', to keep players away from the [[home plate|plate]].  &quot;Headhunter&quot; is a common term for pitchers who have a reputation for throwing these kinds of pitches. However, throwing at a batter intentionally is illegal, and can be very dangerous.  When an [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] believes a pitcher has thrown at a batter intentionally, a warning is issued to the pitcher and the [[manager (baseball)|managers]] of both teams.  From that point on, any pitch thrown at a batter can cause the pitcher and the manager (if believed to have ordered the beanball) of the offending team to be ejected immediately from the game.  Serious offenses such as a ball thrown at the head (called a [[beanball]]) can result in the immediate ejection of the pitcher, and the manager if he ordered the beanball, even without a warning.

Often, if a player is acting rude or unsportsmanlike, or having an extraordinarily good day, the pitcher may intentionally hit the batter, disguising it as a pitch that accidentally slipped his control.  Managers may also order a pitcher to throw such a pitch (sometimes called a &quot;plunking&quot;). These pitches are often aimed at the lower back and slower than normal, designed to send a message more than anything else.  The opposing team usually hits a batter in retaliation for this act.  The plunkings generally end there because of umpire warnings, but in some cases things can get out of hand, and sometimes they lead to the batter [[charging the mound]], [[bench-clearing brawl]]s, and several ejections.  Such plunking duels are more common in the [[American League]] than in the [[National League]], because in the NL the pitchers must bat for themselves and open themselves up to direct retaliation (although hitting a fellow pitcher is a serious breach of baseball etiquette).

==Records==
The all-time record for a player being hit by a pitch is held by [[Hughie Jennings]], who was hit by 287 pitches between 1891 and 1903. The modern-day record is held by [[Craig Biggio]] of the [[Houston Astros]], who had 285 as of the end of the 2007 season when he retired. Prior to Biggio, the modern-day record belonged to [[Don Baylor]], who was hit 267 times.

The all-time single-season record also belongs to Jennings, who was hit 51 times during the 1896 season. [[Ron Hunt]] of the 1971 [[Washington Nationals|Montreal Expos]] was hit 50 times during that year, the modern-day record. The single-game record is three, held by [[Rey Ordóñez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_hbp2.shtml Hit by a Pitch Records by Baseball Almanac&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The career pitching record for most hit batsmen is 205 by Hall-of-Famer [[Walter Johnson]]. The season record is 54 by [[Phil Knell]] in 1891, and the game record is six, held by Ed Knouff and John Grimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_hbp.shtml Hit by Pitch Records by Baseball Almanac&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brady Anderson]] was the first, and currently only, player to be hit by the pitch two times in the same inning.

==Dangers==
To date, only one Major League player has died as a result of being struck by a pitch: [[Ray Chapman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] was hit in the head by [[Carl Mays]] on August 16, 1920, and died the next morning.

It is possible, however, to suffer serious injuries as a result of being hit by a pitch, even when wearing a helmet. On August 18, 1967, [[Red Sox]] batter [[Tony Conigliaro]] was hit almost directly in the left eye by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]]. His cheekbone was shattered, he nearly lost the sight of the eye, was unable to play for over a year, and never regained his earlier batting ability.  (Batting helmets at that time were not required to have an &quot;ear flap&quot;; indeed, it was not until 2002 that all major league batters were required to wear helmets with side protection.) On September 28, 1995, [[Kirby Puckett]], the superstar outfielder of the [[Minnesota Twins]], was struck in the cheek by a [[Dennis Martínez]] fastball, breaking his jaw and loosening two teeth. It would be his last game; during spring training the following year he developed glaucoma, which ended his career.  Most recently, [[Mike Piazza]], then of the [[New York Mets]], was hit in the head by a pitch from [[Julian Tavarez]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] on September 10, 2005.  His helmet shattered, and he suffered a [[concussion]].  Other relatively minor injuries that are possible include broken fingers or hands, broken feet, broken ribs, injuries to the knee, or [[groin]] injuries.

==Legal consequences==
Since inside pitching is a legitimate tactic in baseball, courts have recognized that being hit by a pitch is an inherent risk of the game, so that players cannot sue for any resulting injuries.  On April 6, 2006, in a case arising from a game involving [[community college]] baseball teams, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled that baseball players in California [[Assumption of risk|assume the risk]] of being hit by baseballs ''even if'' the balls were intentionally thrown so as to cause injury.&lt;ref&gt;''Avila v. Citrus Community College Dist.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/38C4t148.htm 38 Cal. 4th 148] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the court's words: &quot;For better or worse, being intentionally thrown at is a fundamental part and inherent risk of the sport of baseball. It is not the function of [[tort law]] to police such conduct.&quot;

==Popular culture==

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:TyCobbTigers.jpg|250px|thumb|right|In [[Major League Baseball]] history, [[Ty Cobb]] had a record 4,191 hits&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=112431&lt;/ref&gt; (later revised to 4,189) by [[1928 in sports|1928]]; [[Pete Rose]] would surpass it 57 years later, and finish with 4,256 career hits.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=121454&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[baseball statistics]], a '''hit''' (denoted by '''H'''), also called a '''base hit''', is credited to a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] when the batter safely reaches [[First baseman|first base]] after hitting the ball into [[fair ball|fair]] territory, without the benefit of an [[error (baseball)|error]] or a [[fielder's choice]].

==Scoring a hit==

To achieve a hit, the batter must reach first base before any fielder can either [[tag out|tag]] him with the ball, throw to another player protecting the base before the batter reaches it, or [[force play|tag first base]] while carrying the ball. The hit is scored the moment the batter reaches first base safely - if the [[baserunning|runner]] is put out while attempting a [[double (baseball)|double]] or [[triple (baseball)|triple]] on the same play, he still gets credit for the hit.

If a batter reaches first base because of offensive interference by a preceding runner (including if a preceding runner is hit by a batted ball), he is also credited with a hit.

===Types of hits===

A hit for one base is called a [[single (baseball)|single]], for two bases a [[double (baseball)|double]], and for three bases a [[triple (baseball)|triple]].  A [[home run]] is also scored as a hit.  Doubles, triples, and home runs are also called [[extra base hit]]s.

An &quot;[[infield hit]]&quot; is a hit where the ball does not leave the infield.  Infield hits are uncommon by nature, and most often earned by speedy runners.

==Pitching a no-hitter==

A [[no-hitter]] is a game in which one of the teams prevented the other from getting a hit. Throwing a no-hitter is rare and considered an extraordinary accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff. In most cases in the professional game, no-hitters are accomplished by a single pitcher who throws a complete game.  A pitcher who throws a no-hitter could still allow runners to reach base safely, by way of [[base on balls|walk]]s, [[error (baseball)|error]]s, [[hit by pitch|hit batsmen]], or batter reaching base due to interference or obstruction.  If the pitcher allows no runners to reach base, the no-hitter is a [[perfect game]].

==History==

In [[1887 in baseball|1887]], [[Major League Baseball]] counted [[Base on balls|bases on balls]] (walks) as hits. The result was skyrocketing [[batting average]]s, including some near .500; [[Tip O'Neill (baseball player)|Tip O'Neill]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]] batted .485 that season, which would still be a major league record if recognized. The experiment was abandoned the following season.

There is some controversy regarding how the records of 1887 should be interpreted. The number of legitimate walks and at-bats are known for all players that year, so computing averages using the same method as in other years is straightforward. In 1968, Major League Baseball formed a Special Baseball Records Committee to resolve this (and other) issues.  The Committee ruled that walks in 1887 should not be counted as hits.  In 2000, Major League Baseball reversed its decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Most current sources list O'Neill's 1887 average as .435, as calculated by omitting his walks.  He would retain his [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] batting championship. However, the variance between methods results in differing recognition for the 1887 [[National League]] batting champion.  [[Cap Anson]] would be recognized, with his .421 average, if walks are included, but [[Sam Thompson]] would be the champion at .372 if they are not.

==Major League Baseball rules==
The official rulebook of [[Major League Baseball]] states in Rule 10.05&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;:
::(a) The official scorer shall credit a batter with a base hit when:
:(1) the batter reaches first base (or any succeeding base) safely on a fair ball that settles on the ground, that touches a fence before being touched by a fielder or that clears a fence;
:(2) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball hit with such force, or so slowly, that any fielder attempting to make a play with the ball has no opportunity to do so;
::Rule 10.05(a)(2) Comment: The official scorer shall credit a hit if the fielder attempting to handle the ball cannot make a play, even if such fielder deflects the ball from or cuts off another fielder who could have put out a runner.
:(3) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball that takes an unnatural bounce so that a fielder cannot handle it with ordinary effort, or that touches the pitcher's plate or any base (including home plate) before being touched by a fielder and bounces so that a fielder cannot handle the ball with ordinary effort;
:(4) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball that has not been touched by a fielder and that is in fair territory when the ball reaches the outfield, unless in the scorer's judgment the ball could have been handled with ordinary effort;
:(5) a fair ball that has not been touched by a fielder touches a runner or an umpire, unless a runner is called out for having been touched by an Infield Fly, in which case the official scorer shall not score a hit; or
:(6) a fielder unsuccessfully attempts to put out a preceding runner and, in the official scorer's judgment, the batter-runner would not have been put out at first base by ordinary effort.
Rule 10.05(a) Comment: In applying Rule 10.05(a), the official scorer shall always give the batter the benefit of the doubt. A safe course for the official scorer to follow is to score a hit when exceptionally good fielding of a ball fails to result in a putout.

::(b) The official scorer shall not credit a base hit when a:
:(1) runner is forced out by a batted ball, or would have been forced out except for a fielding error;
:(2) batter apparently hits safely and a runner who is forced to advance by reason of the batter becoming a runner fails to touch the first base to which such runner is advancing and is called out on appeal. The official scorer shall charge the batter with an at-bat but not a hit;
:(3) pitcher, the catcher or any infielder handles a batted ball and puts out a preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base or to return to his original base, or would have put out such runner with ordinary effort except for a fielding error. The official scorer shall charge the batter with an at-bat but not a hit;
:(4) fielder fails in an attempt to put out a preceding runner and, in the scorer's judgment, the batter-runner could have been put out at first base; or
::Rule 10.05(b) Comment: Rule 10.05(b) shall not apply if the fielder merely looks toward or feints toward another base before attempting to make the putout at first base.
:(5) runner is called out for interference with a fielder attempting to field a batted ball, unless in the scorer's judgment the batter-runner would have been safe had the interference not occurred.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[baseball statistics]], '''on-base percentage (OBP)''' (sometimes referred to as '''on-base average [OBA]''', as the statistic is rarely presented as a true [[percentage]]) is a measure of how often a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] reaches base for any reason other than a [[error (baseball)|fielding error]], [[fielder's choice]], [[Uncaught third strike|dropped/uncaught third strike]], [[Obstruction (baseball)|fielder's obstruction]], or [[catcher's interference]] (the latter two are ignored as either [[Times on base|times-on-base (TOB)]] or [[plate appearance]]s in calculating OBP). OBP is added to [[slugging average]] to determine [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS). It first became an official [[MLB]] statistic in 1984.

==Overview==
Traditionally, the best leadoff hitters in the game have high on-base percentages. The league average for on-base percentage has varied considerably over time; in the modern era it is around .340, whereas it was typically only .300 in the [[dead-ball era]]. On-base percentage can also vary quite considerably from player to player. The record for the highest career OBP by a hitter, based on over 3000 [[plate appearance]]s, is .482 by [[Ted Williams]]. The lowest is by [[Bill Bergen]], who had an OBP of .194.

Though extremely unlikely, it is possible for a player's on-base percentage to be lower than his [[batting average]] (H/AB). However very few players in major league history fall into this category, with the majority of them having under 100 ABs, as it requires having almost no [[base on balls|walks]] or times [[hit by pitch]], with a higher number of [[sacrifice fly|sacrifice flies]] (e.g. if a player has 2 hits in 6 at bats plus a sacrifice fly, his batting average would be .333, but his on-base percentage would be .286).  An example of this phenomenon would be the Hall-of-Fame pitcher Phil Niekro's hitting statistics from 1982.  In 87 AB he never walked, but had four sacrifice hits, leading to a Batting Average of .195 and an OBP of .193.

On-base percentage is calculated using this formula:

:&lt;math&gt;OBP = \frac{H+BB+HBP}{AB+BB+HBP+SF}&lt;/math&gt;

where

*''H'' = [[Hit (baseball)|Hits]]
*''BB'' = [[Base on balls|Bases on Balls (Walks)]]
*''HBP'' = times [[Hit by pitch|Hit By a Pitch]]
*''AB'' = [[At bat]]s
*''SF'' = [[Sacrifice fly|Sacrifice Flies]]

'''NOTE:''' Sacrifice flies were not counted as an official statistic until [[1954 in baseball|1954]]. Before that time, all sacrifices were counted as [[sacrifice hit]]s (SH), which included both sacrifice flies and [[Bunt (baseball)|bunts]]. Sacrifice bunts (sacrifice hits since 1954), which would lower a batter's on-base percentage, are not included in the calculation for on-base percentage, as bunting is an offensive strategy &amp;ndash; often dictated by the manager &amp;ndash; the use of which does not necessarily reflect on the batter's ability and should not be used to penalize him. For calculations of OBP before 1954, or where sacrifice flies are not explicitly listed, the number of sacrifice flies should be assumed to be zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[baseball]], a '''sacrifice fly''' is a batted ball that satisfies four criteria:

* There are fewer than two outs when the ball is hit.
* The ball is hit to the [[outfield]].
* The batter is out because an outfielder or an [[infielder]] running in the outfield catches the ball (or the batter would have been out if not for an [[Error (baseball)|error]]).
* A runner who is already on base scores on the play.

It is called a &quot;sacrifice&quot; fly because the batter presumably intends to cause a teammate to score a run, while sacrificing his own ability to do so.

== Rules ==

As addressed within Rule 10.08(d) of the Official Baseball Rules,&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Baseball Rules&quot;&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp Official Baseball Rules ]&lt;/ref&gt; a sacrifice fly is not counted as a turn [[at bat]] for the batter, though the batter is credited with a [[run batted in]].

The purpose of not counting a sacrifice fly as an at bat is to avoid penalizing hitters for a successful maneuver.  The sacrifice fly is one of two instances in baseball where a batter is not charged with a time at bat after putting a ball in play; the other is the [[sacrifice hit]] (also known as a sacrifice bunt). But, while a sacrifice fly doesn't affect a player's [[batting average]], it counts as a [[plate appearance]] and a lower [[on-base percentage]], and a player on a [[hitting streak]] will have the hit streak end if he has no official at-bats but has a sacrifice fly.  The reason for this is that the sacrifice fly, unlike the sacrifice bunt, is not considered a tactical maneuver (players presumably don't try to hit a fly ball to advance a runner). Unlike a sacrifice bunt, which may be scored if a runner advances from any base to any base, a sacrifice fly is only credited if a runner scores on the play.  Therefore, when a runner on first or second base tags on a fly ball and advances no further than third base, no sacrifice is given and the batter is credited with an out.  Note that, although rarely occurring, if a runner tags and advances from second base (or, theoretically, from first base) all the way to home and scores (without an intervening error) the batter is credited with a sacrifice fly.

The sacrifice fly is credited even if another runner is put out on appeal for failing to [[tag up]], so long as a run scores prior to the third out.  In the case of a fly ball dropped for an error, the sacrifice fly is only credited if the official scorer believes the run would have scored had the ball been caught.

During a sacrifice fly, a runner can attempt to advance bases right as a fielder touches the ball.  If the fielder bobbles the ball, the runner may still tag up, even before when the fielder has full control of the ball (before the fielder is credited with a putout).  The rule works this way because a smart fielder can theoretically purposely bobble the ball and run with it at the same time towards the infield and only completely catch it when he is within a good throwing distance to home plate. As addressed in the Official Baseball Rules,&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Baseball Rules&quot;/&gt;  this was put into the baseball rulebook so it prevented these fielders from intentionally bobbling the ball.

==Records==
The most sacrifice flies by a team in one game is five; the record was established by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in 1988 and tied by the [[Colorado Rockies]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260607127|title=Torrealba's slam, five sac flies power Rockies past Bucs|publisher=ESPN.com|date=June 7, 2006|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then tied again in 2008 by the [[Seattle Mariners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2004351837&amp;zsection_id=2002990524&amp;slug=mari16&amp;date=20080416|title=Seattle Mariners ride flurry of sacrifice flies to 11-6 victory over Kansas City Royals|date=April 16, 2008|first=Larry|last=Stone|publisher=Seattle Times}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most sacrifice flies by one team in an inning is three; the record was established by the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1962 and was matched twice by the [[New York Yankees]] in 2000 and once by the [[New York Mets]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/sacrifice_flies_records.shtml Sacrifice Flies Records by Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the rule was reinstated in its present form, [[Gil Hodges]] of [[Los Angeles Dodgers|the Dodgers]] holds the record for most sacrifice flies in one season with 19, in 1954;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SF_season.shtml Single Season Records], baseball-reference.com.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Murray]] holds the record for most sacrifice flies in a career with 128.&lt;ref name=bbrefcareer&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SF_career.shtml Career Records], baseball-reference.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one active player has recorded over 100: [[Gary Sheffield]] with 111, although [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] had recorded 101 sacrifice flies before announcing his retirement on June 2, 2010.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
Batters have not been charged with a time at-bat for a sacrifice hit since 1893, but baseball has changed the sacrifice fly rule multiple times. The sacrifice fly as a statistical category was instituted in 1908, only to be discontinued in 1931. The rule was again adopted in 1939, only to be eliminated again in 1940, before being adopted for the last time in 1954.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''On-base plus slugging (OPS)''' is a [[Sabermetrics|sabermetric]] [[baseball statistics|baseball statistic]] calculated as the sum of a player's [[on-base percentage]] and [[slugging percentage]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?mode=viewstat&amp;stat=118 www.baseballprospectus.com] or [http://www.baseball1.com/faqs/glossary.html#O rec.sport.baseball].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability of a player to both get on base and to hit for power, two important hitting skills, are represented.   An OPS of .900 or higher in [[Major League Baseball]] puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters.  Typically, the league leader in OPS will score near, and sometimes above, the 1.000 mark.

==Formula==
The basic formula is

&lt;math&gt;OPS = OBP + SLG \,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- Please retain \, above for proper rendering --&gt;

where OBP is on-base average, and SLG is slugging average (NOTE: these are commonly referred to as &quot;on-base percentage&quot; and &quot;slugging percentage&quot; respectively, but they are not percentages at all, any more than &quot;batting average&quot; is a percentage).  These averages are defined

&lt;math&gt;SLG = \frac{TB} {AB}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;OBP = \frac{H+BB+HBP} {AB+BB+SF+HBP}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

*''H'' = [[Hit (baseball)|Hits]]
*''BB'' = [[Base on balls|Bases on balls]]
*''HBP'' = Times [[hit by pitch]]
*''AB'' = [[At bats]]
*''SF'' = [[Sacrifice fly|Sacrifice flies]]
*''TB'' = [[Total bases]]

Although OBP and SLG have different denominators, it is possible to rewrite the expression for OPS using a common denominator.  This expression is mathematically identical to the simple sum of OBP and SLG:

&lt;math&gt;OPS = \frac{AB*(H+BB+HBP)+TB*(AB+BB+SF+HBP)}{AB*(AB+BB+SF+HBP)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretation of OPS==
Unlike many other statistics, a player's OPS does not have a simple intrinsic meaning, despite its usefulness as a comparative statistic.

One fault of OPS is that it weighs on-base average and slugging percentage equally, although on-base average correlates better with scoring runs.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael. &lt;u&gt;Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game&lt;/u&gt;, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics such as [[wOBA]] build on this distinction using [[linear weights]], avoiding OPS' flaws.  Magnifying this fault is that the numerical parts of OPS are not themselves typically equal (league-average slugging percentages are usually 75-100 points higher than league-average on-base percentages).  As a point of reference, the  OPS for all of Major League Baseball in 2008 was .749.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-standard-batting.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==An OPS Scale==
[[Bill James]], in his essay titled &quot;The 96 Families of Hitters&quot; &lt;ref&gt;James, Bill. ''The 96 Families of Hitters''. &lt;u&gt;The Bill James Gold Mine&lt;/u&gt;, 2009, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; uses seven different categories for classification by OPS:

.9000 and Above A&lt;br&gt;
.8333 to .8999 B&lt;br&gt;
.7667 to .8333 C&lt;br&gt;
.7000 to .7666 D&lt;br&gt;
.6334 to .6999 E&lt;br&gt;
.5667 to .6333 F&lt;br&gt;
.5666 and Lower G

This effectively transforms OPS into a 7 point [[Likert Scale]].  Substituting typical Likert scale quality values such as Excellent(A), Very Good(B), Good(C), Average(D), Fair(E), Poor(F) and Very Poor(G) for the A-G categories creates a subjective reference for OPS values.

==History==
On-base plus slugging was first popularized in 1984 by John Thorn and Pete Palmer's book, ''The Hidden Game of Baseball''.&lt;ref&gt;John Thorn and Pete Palmer, ''The Hidden Game of Baseball,'' pp. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' then began carrying the leaders in this statistic in its weekly &quot;By the Numbers&quot; box, a feature that continued for four years.  Baseball journalist [[Peter Gammons]] used and evangelized the statistics, and other writers and broadcasters picked it up.  The popularity of OPS gradually spread, and by 2004 it began appearing on [[Topps]] baseball cards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Schwarz]], ''The Numbers Game,'' pp. 165, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaders==
The top ten [[Major League Baseball]] players in lifetime OPS, with at least 3,000 plate appearances
through [[2010 in baseball|2010]]. &lt;br&gt;
(active players in bold)

# [[Babe Ruth]], 1.1638
# [[Ted Williams]], 1.1155
# [[Lou Gehrig]], 1.0798
# [[Barry Bonds]], 1.0512
# '''[[Albert Pujols]]''', 1.0511
# [[Jimmie Foxx]], 1.0376
# [[Hank Greenberg]], 1.0169
# [[Rogers Hornsby]], 1.0103
# [[Manny Ramírez]], 0.9970
# [[Mark McGwire]], 0.9823


The top 10 is divided evenly between left-handed and right-handed batters, but the top four were all lefties. [[Albert Pujols]] has the highest career OPS for a right-handed batter.

The top ten single-season performances in MLB are (all left-handed hitters):

# Barry Bonds, 1.4217 ({{mlby|2004}})
# Babe Ruth, 1.3818 ({{mlby|1920}})
# Barry Bonds, 1.3807 ({{mlby|2002}})
# Barry Bonds, 1.3785 ({{mlby|2001}})
# Babe Ruth, 1.3586 ({{mlby|1921}})
# Babe Ruth, 1.3089 ({{mlby|1923}})
# Ted Williams, 1.2875 ({{mlby|1941}})
# Barry Bonds, 1.2778 ({{mlby|2003}})
# Babe Ruth, 1.2582 ({{mlby|1927}})
# Ted Williams, 1.2566 ({{mlby|1957}})

The highest single-season mark for a right-handed hitter was 1.2449 by [[Rogers Hornsby]] in ({{mlby|1925}}), (13th on the all-time list). Since 1925, the highest single-season OPS for a right-hander is 1.2224 by [[Mark McGwire]] in ({{mlby|1998}}), which is good for 16th all-time.

==Adjusted OPS (OPS+)==
OPS+, Adjusted OPS, is a closely related statistic.  OPS+ is OPS adjusted for the park and the league in which the player played, but not for fielding position. An OPS+ of 100 is defined to be the league average. An OPS+ of 150 or more is excellent and 125 very good, while an OPS+ of 75 or below is poor.

The basic formula for OPS+ is

&lt;math&gt;OPS+ = 100 * (\frac{OBP} {*lgOBP} + \frac{SLG} {*lgSLG} - 1)&lt;/math&gt;

where *lgOBP is the park adjusted OBP of the league (not counting pitchers hitting) and *lgSLG is the park adjusted SLG of the league.

A common misconception is that OPS+ closely matches the ratio of a player's OPS to that of the league. In fact, due to the additive nature of the two components in OPS+, a player with an OBP and SLG both 50% better than league average in those metrics will have an OPS+ of 200 (twice the league average OPS+) while still having an OPS that is only 50% better than the average OPS of the league.

===Leaders in OPS+===
Through 2010, the career leaders in OPS+ (minimum 3,000 plate appearances, active players in bold) were

&amp;nbsp; 1. [[Babe Ruth]], 206  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 2. [[Ted Williams]], 190 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 3. [[Barry Bonds]], 181 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 4. [[Lou Gehrig]], 178 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 5. [[Rogers Hornsby]], 175 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 6. [[Mickey Mantle]], 172 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 6. '''[[Albert Pujols]]''', 172 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 8. [[Dan Brouthers]], 170 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 8. [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|Joe Jackson]], 170 &lt;br&gt;
10. [[Ty Cobb]], 168 &lt;br&gt;
11. [[Jimmie Foxx]], 163

The only purely right-handed batters to appear on this list are Hornsby, Pujols, and Foxx. Mantle is the only switch-hitter in the group.

The highest single-season performances were:

# [[Barry Bonds]], 268 ({{mlby|2002}})
# [[Barry Bonds]], 263 ({{mlby|2004}})
# [[Barry Bonds]], 259 ({{mlby|2001}})
# [[Fred Dunlap]], 258 ([[1884 in baseball|1884]]) *
# [[Babe Ruth]], 256 ({{mlby|1920}})
# [[Babe Ruth]], 239 ({{mlby|1921}})
# [[Babe Ruth]], 239 ({{mlby|1923}})
# [[Ted Williams]], 235 ({{mlby|1941}})
# [[Ted Williams]], 233 ({{mlby|1957}})
# [[Ross Barnes]], 231 ([[1876 in baseball|1876]]) **
# [[Barry Bonds]], 231 ({{mlby|2003}})

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; - Fred Dunlap's historic 1884 season came in the [[Union Association]], which some baseball experts consider not to be a true major league

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; - Ross Barnes may have been aided by a rule that made a bunt fair if it first rolled in fair territory. He did not play nearly so well when this rule was removed, although injuries may have been mostly to blame, as his fielding statistics similarly declined.

If Dunlap's and Barnes' seasons were to be eliminated from the list, two other Ruth seasons (1926 and 1927) would be on the list. This would also eliminate the only right-handed batter in the list, Barnes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Baseball steal.jpg|thumb|300px|The all-time stolen base leader, [[Rickey Henderson]], swipes third in 1988.]]

In [[baseball]], a '''stolen base''' occurs when a [[baserunner]] successfully advances to the next base while the [[pitcher]] is delivering the ball to [[home plate]].  In [[baseball statistics]], stolen bases are denoted by '''SB'''.  

If the defense makes no attempt to put the baserunner out (for example, if the catcher doesn't even look his way), the play is scored as '''defensive indifference''' (also called '''fielder's indifference'''), and no stolen base is credited to the runner.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackcurry&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/sports/baseball/23score.html?ref=sports Curry, Jack. &quot;Safe at Second, but No Stolen Base to Show for It,&quot; ''The New York Times'', Wednesday, September 23, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defensive indifference is generally only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run.  [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf MLB Rule 10.07(g)] covers defensive indifference.

Successful base-stealing requires not only simple running speed but also good base-running instincts and split-second timing.  The scoring and criteria for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 10.07 of the [[Major League Baseball]] rule book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf MLB Rule 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Ned Cuthbert]], playing for the Philadelphia Keystones in either 1863 or 1865, is documented as the first baseball player to steal a base in a baseball game, although the term stolen base was not used until 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stolen!: A History of Base Stealing|first=Russell|last=Roberts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VTQ8U8iP3hEC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=cuthbert+%22stolen+base%22+1865&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R5Cn4r2s7O&amp;sig=FKU_hmLOWSu8nlucImsHA2WUeHk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w_ruS7-SLYritQPLgq3KDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cuthbert%20%22stolen%20base%22%201865&amp;f=false|year=1999|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a time in the 19th century, stolen bases were credited when a baserunner reached an extra base on a base hit from another player.&lt;ref name = &quot;bid&quot;/&gt;  For example if a runner on [[First baseman|first base]] reached [[Third baseman|third base]] on a single, it would count as a steal.  In 1887, [[Hugh Nicol]] set a still-standing Major League record with 138 stolen bases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SB_season.shtml|title=Single-Season Leaders for Stolen Bases|accessdate=2007-05-17|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which would not have counted under modern rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;bid&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Classic/McPhee/McPhee_bio.html|title=JockBio:  Bid McPhee|accessdate=2007-05-17|publisher=JockBio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern steal rules were fully implemented in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/rules_chronology.stm chronology of baseball rules @ baseball library.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and steals are now only credited when a runner successfully takes an extra base while the ball is being pitched, but not already hit. If the ball is dead on the pitch run on, such as from a foul ball (except caught fly-out),  the steal is not allowed and the runner returns to his time-of-pitch base. In addition, if the situation of the game is such that the steal is of little use (usually in the late innings when the runner would not change the game's outcome by scoring), and the catcher does not attempt to throw out the runner, the runner is not credited with a steal, and the base is attributed to defensive indifference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp|title=Official Rules: Rule 10.07(g)|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MLB HR and SB rates.png|thumb|Graph depicting the yearly number of home runs (blue line) and stolen bases (pink line) per MLB game. The two primary periods in which the stolen base was popular were before 1920 and again in the 1970s and 1980s.|500px]]
Base stealing was popular in the game's early decades, with speedsters such as [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Clyde Milan]] stealing nearly 100 bases in a season.  But the tactic fell into relative disuse after [[Babe Ruth]] introduced the era of the home run &amp;ndash; in 1955, for example, no one in baseball stole more than 25 bases, and [[Dom DiMaggio]] won the AL stolen base title in 1950 with just 15.  However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s base-stealing was brought back to prominence primarily by [[Luis Aparicio]] and [[Maury Wills]], who broke Cobb's modern single-season record by stealing 104 bases in 1962.  Wills' record was broken in turn by [[Lou Brock]] in 1974, and [[Rickey Henderson]] in 1982.  The stolen base remained a popular tactic through the 1980s, perhaps best exemplified by [[Vince Coleman]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], but began to decline again in the 1990s as the frequency of [[home run]]s reached unprecedented heights and the steal-friendly [[artificial turf]] ballparks began to disappear.

==Technique and strategy==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2009}}
A base-stealing runner must begin running as soon as the pitcher has committed himself to throwing a pitch to home plate, neither sooner nor later.  If he begins to run too soon, the pitcher may throw to a base rather than to home&amp;mdash;in this case, the runner is ''picked off'', and will most likely be tagged out.  Before the pitch, the runner will often take a ''lead-off'', walking several steps away from the base as a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] for his next advance.  In some cases, the pitcher may ''hold the runner on'' by throwing to the base several times before pitching, in the hope of dissuading the runner from too big a lead-off.  This action can also result in the runner being tagged out in a pick-off.  Another popular strategy is for the runner to attempt a steal while the hitter is instructed to swing at the pitch if it is at all hittable.  This ''[[hit and run (baseball)|hit-and-run play]]'' can give the runner a good head start to take an extra base on the hit.  But if the hitter fails to hit the ball, the hit-and-run becomes a pure steal attempt, and the runner may be thrown out. Another risk of the hit-and-run is that a caught [[line drive]] could result in an easy [[double play]], although this is offset by the lower likelihood of a ground ball double play.

A second and lesser-known technique is the &quot;delayed&quot; steal. This technique, famously practiced by [[Eddie Stanky]] of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} is where the runner does not break immediately for second when the pitcher commits to the plate. Instead the runner takes two or three large shuffles off the base when the pitcher goes to the plate. This keys the middle infielders and the catcher to let their guard down, as it appears the runner is not stealing, but only getting a good secondary lead in case the ball is hit. In reality the delayed stealer is closing the distance to second base. When the ball crosses the plate the runner breaks for second base, and is essentially stealing the base on the middle infielders who have not covered second base. Additionally, the catcher is not ready to come out of his crouch and cannot throw to second until an infielder gets there. The delayed steal is a deceptive technique that is sometimes executed by even slow runners and many times results in a catcher throwing into center field.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The technique is rarely seen at the Major League level but is used effectively by multiple college programs.

[[Second base]] is the base most often stolen. It is also technically the easiest to steal, as it is farthest from home plate and thus a longer throw from the catcher is required to prevent it. [[Third base]] is a shorter throw for the catcher, and thus more difficult to steal, though a right-handed batter can sometimes help by serving as an obstacle that the catcher must throw around. Third base is generally stolen off the pitcher, since a bigger lead is possible off second base. It is possible for a player to steal [[home plate]], but this requires great daring and aggressiveness as the ball will almost certainly arrive at home plate before the runner.  Thus a [[sacrifice bunt]] or [[Squeeze play (baseball)|squeeze play]] is typically used instead. [[Ty Cobb]] holds the records for most steals of home in a single season (8) as well as for a career (54).{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} [[Jackie Robinson]] was also renowned for the thrilling feat of stealing home, which he famously accomplished in Game 1 of the [[1955 World Series]]. In more recent years, pure steals of home are rare, although a player may steal home plate during a &quot;delayed double steal,&quot; in which a runner on first attempts to steal second, while the runner on third breaks for home as soon as the catcher throws to second base. The most recent &quot;pure&quot; steal of home (i.e., not involving a squeeze play or an additional steal attempt) was on September 9, 2010, when [[Chris Nelson (baseball)|Chris Nelson]] of the [[Colorado Rockies]] stole home against the [[Cincinnati Reds]].

Base stealing is an important characteristic of a particular style of baseball, sometimes called &quot;[[small ball]]&quot; or &quot;manufacturing runs&quot;. A team playing with this style emphasizes doing little things (including risky running plays like base-stealing) to advance runners and score runs, often relying on pitching and defense to keep games close.  The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of the 1960s, led by pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] and speedy shortstop [[Maury Wills]], were a successful example of this style. The antithesis of this would be a team that relies on power hitting. The [[Baltimore Orioles]] of the 1970s, led by manager [[Earl Weaver]], were an example of such a &quot;slugging&quot; team that aspired to score most of its runs via home runs.  Often the &quot;small ball&quot; model is associated with the [[National League]], while power hitting is seen as more associated with the [[American League]]. However, some of the more successful American League teams of recent memory, including the [[2002 in baseball|2002]] [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]], the [[2001 in baseball|2001]] [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[2005 in baseball|2005]] [[Chicago White Sox]] have experienced their success in part as a result of playing &quot;small ball,&quot; advancing runners through means such as the stolen base and the related [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]] play.  Successful teams often combine both styles, with a speedy runner or two complementing hitters with power, such as the 2005 White Sox, who despite playing &quot;small ball&quot;, still hit 200 home runs that season

==Measuring Success==
One of the difficulties in determining how good a player is at stealing bases is whether to judge the cumulative number of steals or the success ratio of steals to [[caught stealing]].  Noted statistician [[Bill James]] has argued that unless a player can steal a high percentage of the time, then the stolen base is not useful, and can even be detrimental to a team.  A success rate of 67 to 70% or better is necessary to make stealing bases worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/stats.shtml Baseball Almanac Stats]&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging the base-stealing abilities of players from earlier eras is also problematic, because caught stealing was not a regularly recorded statistic until the middle of the 20th Century.  [[Ty Cobb]], for example, was known as a great base-stealer, with 892 steals and a success rate of over 83%.  However the data on Cobb's caught stealing is missing from 12 seasons, strongly suggesting he was unsuccessful many more times than his stats indicate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cobbty01.shtml Ty Cobb's stats at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Beltrán]], with 286 steals, has the highest career success rate of all players with over 300 stolen base attempts, at 88.3%.

==Evolution of rules and scoring==
The first mention of the stolen base, in a statistical sense was in the 1877 scoring rules adopted by the [[National League]] which noted credit toward a player's [[total bases]] when a base is stolen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2413&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Scoring rules for 1877-- Batting'', p. 2413&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until 1886 that the stolen base appeared as something to be tracked, but was only to &quot;appear in the summary of the game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2414&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2414&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the stolen base was given its own individual statistical column in the [[box score]], and was defined for purposes of scoring: &quot;...every base made after first base has been reached by a base runner, except for those made by reason of or with the aid of a battery error ([[wild pitch]] or [[passed ball]]), or by batting, [[balk]]s or by being forced off. In short, shall include all bases made by a clean steal, or through a wild throw or muff of the ball by a fielder who is directly trying to put the base runner out while attempting to steal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2415&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2415&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, it was clarified that any attempt to steal must be credited to the runner, and that fielders committing errors during this play must also be charged with an error. This rule also clarified that advancement of another base(s) beyond the one being stolen is not credited as a stolen base on the same play, and that an error is charged to the fielder who permitted the extra advancement. There was clarification that a runner is credited with a steal if the attempt began before a battery error. Finally, batters were credited with a stolen base if they were tagged out after over running the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2415&quot; /&gt;

In 1892, a short-lived rule was added crediting runners with stolen bases if a base runner advanced on a fly out, or if they advanced more than one base on any safe hit or attempted out, providing an attempt was made by the defense to put the runner out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2415&quot; /&gt;  The rule was subsequently ended in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2415&quot; /&gt;

In 1898, stolen base scoring was narrowed to no longer include advancement in the event of a fielding errors, or advancement caused by a hit batsman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2416&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2416&lt;/ref&gt;

1904 saw an attempt to reduce the already wordy slew of rules governing stolen bases, with the stolen base now credited when &quot;...the {{sic|base|runner}} advances a base unaided by a base hit, a put out, (or) a fielding or batter error.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2417&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2417&lt;/ref&gt;

1910 saw the first addressing of the double and triple steal attempts. Under the new rule, when any runner is thrown out, and the other(s) are successful, the successful runners will not be credited with a stolen base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2417&quot; /&gt;

Without using the term, 1920 saw the first rule that would be referred to today as defensive indifference, as stolen bases would not be credited, unless an effort was made to stop the runner by the defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackcurry&quot;/&gt; This is usually called if such is attempted in the ninth inning while that player's team is trailing, unless the runner represents the potential tying run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2418&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2418&lt;/ref&gt;

1931 saw a further narrowing of the criteria for stolen bases being awarded. Power was given to the official scorer, in the event of a muff by the catcher in throwing, that in the judgment of the scorer the runner would have been out, to credit the catcher with an error, and not credit the runner with a stolen base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2419&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2419&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, any successful steal on a play resulting in a wild pitch, passed ball, or balk would no longer be credited as a steal, even if the runner had started to steal before the play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2419&quot; /&gt;

One of the largest rewrites to the rules in history came in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2420-23&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2420-23&lt;/ref&gt; The stolen base  was specifically to be credited &quot;to a runner whenever he advances one base unaided by a base hit, a putout, a forceout, a [[fielder's choice]], a passed ball, a wild pitch, or a balk.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2423&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2423&lt;/ref&gt;

There were noted exceptions, such as denying a stolen base to an otherwise successful steal as a part of a double or triple steal, if one other runner was thrown out in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2423&quot; /&gt; A stolen base would be awarded to runners who successfully stole second base as a part of a double steal with a man on third, if the other runner failed to steal home, but instead was able to return safely to third base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2423&quot; /&gt;  Runners who are tagged out oversliding the base after an otherwise successful steal would not be credited with a stolen base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2423&quot; /&gt;  Indifference was also credited as an exception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2423&quot; /&gt;  Runners would now be credited with stolen bases if they had begun the act of stealing, and the resulting pitch was wild, or a passed ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2423&quot; /&gt;  Finally, for 1950 only, runners would be credited with a stolen base if they were &quot;well advanced&quot; toward the base they were attempting to steal&quot;, and the pitcher is charged with a balk, with the further exception of a player attempting to steal, who would otherwise have been forced to advance on the balk by a runner behind them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2423&quot; /&gt;  This rule was removed in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2423&quot; /&gt;

A clarification came in 1955 that awarded a stolen base to a runner, even if he became involved in a rundown, provided he managed to evade the rundown, and advance to the base he was intending to steal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2426&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2426&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria for being charged with &quot;caught stealing&quot; was fine tuned in 1979, with a runner being charged with being caught if he is put out while trying to steal, oversliding a base (otherwise successfully stolen), or is picked off a base, and tries to advance to the next base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2429&quot;&gt;''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878-1996'', p. 2429&lt;/ref&gt;  Runners would specifically not be charged with being caught, if the player was put out after a wild pitch or passed ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Total Baseball2429&quot; /&gt;

==Stealing first==
{{Main|Uncaught third strike}}
While it is not recorded as a &quot;steal&quot;, in a practical sense a batter can be said to &quot;steal first base&quot; by successfully running to first base (without being tagged or thrown out) in rare circumstances following an [[uncaught third strike]]; the rarely-seen play avoids an &quot;[[out (baseball)|out]]&quot; and gains a baserunner. Statistically, it is recorded as a [[strikeout]] plus a [[passed ball]] or [[wild pitch]], and a &quot;stolen base&quot; statistic does ''not'' accrue and neither is an out recorded for the strikeout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/runner_7.jsp Official Rules: 7.00 The Runner]: 7.08(i), MLB.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In baseball's earlier decades, a runner on second base could &quot;steal&quot; first base, perhaps with the intention of drawing a throw which might allow a runner on third to score (a tactic famously employed by [[Germany Schaefer]]).  However, such a tactic was not recorded as a stolen base, and modern rules forbid going backwards on the basepaths in order to &quot;confuse the defense or make a travesty of the game&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp Official Rules: 7.09 The Runner]: 7.0, MLB.com. Retrieved on 2009-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression &quot;You can't steal [[first base]]&quot; is sometimes used in reference to a player who is fast but not very good at getting [[on-base percentage|on base]] in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6604|title=Prospectus Q &amp; A: Tim Raines|accessdate=2008-06-30|publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[baseball statistics]], a player is credited with a '''plate appearance''' (denoted by '''PA''') each time he completes a turn batting.  A player completes a turn batting when: He [[strikeout|strikes out]] or is declared [[out (baseball)|out]] before reaching first base; or He reaches first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]] or is awarded first base (by a [[base on balls]], [[hit by pitch]], or [[catcher's interference]]); or He hits a [[fair ball]] which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely (''see also'' [[left on base]], [[fielder's choice]], [[force play]])

== Calculating ==
A batter does not have a plate appearance if, while he was at bat, a preceding runner is put out on the basepaths for the third out in a way other than by the batter putting the ball into play (i.e., [[pickoff|picked off]], [[caught stealing]]).  In this case, the same batter continues his turn batting in the next inning with no [[Balls and strikes (baseball)|balls]] or [[strike (baseball)|strikes]] against him.

A batter may or may not be charged with a plate appearance (and possibly at-bat) in the rare instance when he is replaced by a [[pinch hitter]] after having already started his turn at bat. In this case, the pinch hitter would receive the plate appearance (and potential of an at-bat) unless the original batter is replaced when having 2 strikes against him and the pinch hitter subsequently completes the strikeout.  In this case the plate appearance and at-bat are charged to the first batter. (see [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp rule 10.15b])

{{math|PA {{=}} AB + BB + HBP + SH + SF + Times Reached on Defensive Interference}}

Basically, &quot;plate appearances&quot; = [[at bat]]s + some of the scenarios excluded from at bats such as [[base on balls]], [[hit by pitch]], [[Sacrifice hit|sacrifice]] or [[interference (baseball)#Catcher's interference|catcher's interference]] which positively affect the offensive team.

== Other uses ==
In common terminology, the term &quot;at bat&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;plate appearance&quot; (for example, &quot;he fouled off the ball to keep the ''at bat'' alive&quot;).  The intent is usually clear from the context, although the term &quot;official at bat&quot; is sometimes used to explicitly refer to an ''at bat'' as distinguished from a ''plate appearance''. However, terms such as ''turn at bat'' or ''time at bat'' are synonymous with ''plate appearance''.

== Scoring ==
Section 10 of the official rules states what an at bat is not:
&quot;Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player:
(i) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly;
(ii) is awarded first base on four called balls;
(iii) is hit by a pitched ball; or
(iv) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction &quot;

The main use of the plate appearance statistic is in determining a player's eligibility for leadership in some offensive statistical categories, notably [[batting average]]; currently, a player must have 3.1 PAs per game scheduled to qualify for the batting title (for the 162-game schedule, that means 502 PAs). Also, it is often erroneously cited that total plate appearances is the divisor (i.e., denominator) used in calculating [[on base percentage]] (OBP), an alternative measurement of a player's offensive performance; in reality, the OBP denominator does ''not'' include certain PAs, such as [[sacrifice hit]]s and times reached via either catcher’s interference or fielder’s obstruction.

Plate appearances are also used by scorers for &quot;proving&quot; a box score.  If the game has been scored correctly, the total number of plate appearances for a team should equal the total of that team's [[Run (baseball)|runs]], men [[left on base]], and men put [[Out (baseball)|out]].

[[Jimmy Rollins]] owns the major league record for plate appearances in a season with 778 in [[2007 in baseball|2007]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Games played''' (most often abbreviated as '''G''' or '''GP''') is a [[statistic]] used in [[team sports]] to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested.

==Baseball==
In [[baseball]], the [[baseball statistics|statistic]] applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a [[starting lineup]] card or are announced as ''ex ante'' substitutes, whether they actually play or not,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp Section 20 of the official scorer guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; although, in [[Major League Baseball]], the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks.

A [[starting pitcher]], then, may be credited with a game played even as he is not credited with a [[games started|game started]], an [[innings pitched|inning pitched]], or a [[complete game]].

'''Boogie Down Productions''' was a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group that was originally composed of [[KRS-One]], [[D-Nice]], and DJ [[Scott La Rock]]. DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, months after the release of BDP's debut album, ''Criminal Minded''. 

The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the South Bronx, one of the five boroughs of [[New York City]]. The group pioneered the fusion of [[dancehall]] reggae and [[hip hop music]] and their debut LP ''Criminal Minded'' contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx of the late 1980s thus setting the stage for what would eventually become [[gangsta rap]].

==History==
While the origins of hip-hop are believed to be from [[The Bronx]], rival [[hip-hop]] group [[Juice Crew]]'s lyrics were misunderstood to contain a claim in the song [[The Bridge]] that hip hop was directly a result of artists originating from [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]]. Boogie Down and KRS retorted angrily with songs like ''The Bridge is Over'' and ''South Bronx,'' which started one of the first notable hip hop wars as [[MC Shan]], [[Marley Marl]], [[Roxanne Shanté]] and [[Blaq Poet]] all released songs featuring verses personally attacking KRS and Scott La Rock. The Bridge Wars, however, were only short-lived and after the death of Scott La Rock prior to the group's second album, KRS began to concentrate on consciously focused music. 

While ''Criminal Minded'' contained vivid descriptions of South Bronx street life, BDP changed after Scott's death. Producer Lee Smith was dropped and KRS-One adopted &quot;The Teacha&quot; moniker and made a deliberate attempt at creating politically and socially conscious Hip-Hop. BDP were hugely influential in provoking political and social consciousness in Hip-Hop however they were sometimes overshadowed by the political hip hop group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].

The Jamaican influence present in ''Criminal Minded'' is well illustrated by the use of the &quot;Mad Mad&quot; or &quot;Diseases&quot; [[riddim]] started in 1981 with reggae star [[Yellowman|Yellowman's]] song, &quot;Zunguzung&quot;. BDP uses this riff in their song &quot;Remix for P is Free&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJeThDfdzk YouTube - Remix For P Is Free - Boogie Down Productions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was later resampled by artists like [[Black Star]] and [[dead prez]]. As an album regarded by many as the start of the [[gangsta rap]] movement, ''Criminal Minded'' played an important role in reaffirming the social acceptance of having Jamaican roots. BDP referenced reggae in a way that helped to solidify Jamaica's place in modern hip-hop culture.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Wayne. [http://wayneandwax.com/?p=137 &quot;Follow Me Now: The Zigzagging Zunguzung Meme&quot;], May 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BDP Crew==
The membership of BDP changed continuously throughout its existence, the only constant being KRS-One. BDP members and collaborators included Lee Smith, [[Scott La Rock]], [[D-Nice]], [[Kenny Parker]], [[Mad Lion]], [[Channel Live]], [[McBoo]], [[Ms. Melodie]], [[Heather B.]], [[Scottie Morris]], [[Tony Rahsan]], Willie D., RoboCop, Harmony, [[DJ Red Alert]], Jay Kramer, D-Square, Rebekah Foster, Scott Whitehill, Scott King, Chris Tait and Sidney Mills. BDP as a group essentially ended because KRS-One began recording and performing under his own name rather than the group name.

Original member Lee Smith, who has co-producer credit on the original 12” &quot;South Bronx&quot; single, was the last to be inexplicably jettisoned by KRS-One and the future new label after Scott’s love.

In the liner notes on BDP's 1992 album ''Sex and Violence'', KRS-One writes: &quot;BDP in 1995 is KRS-One, Willie D and Kenny Parker! BDP is not D-Nice, Jamal-ski, Harmony, Ms. Melodie and Scottie Morris. They are not down with BDP so stop frontin'.&quot; Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews.com claims that this initiated the ultimate breakup of BDP.&lt;ref&gt;Juon, Steve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computing]] and [[electronics|electronic]] systems, '''binary-coded decimal''' ('''BCD''') is a digital encoding method for [[decimal]] numbers in which each digit is represented by its own [[Binary numeral system|binary]] sequence.  In BCD, a [[numerical digit|numeral]] is usually represented by four [[bit]]s which, in general, represent the decimal range 0 through 9.  Other bit patterns are sometimes used for a [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow).  Uncompressed BCD consumes a [[byte]] for each represented numeral, whereas compressed or packed BCD typically carries two numerals in a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits will represent the full numeral range.

BCD's main virtue is ease of conversion between machine- and human-readable formats, as well as a more precise machine-format representation of decimal quantities.  As compared to typical binary formats, BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic mathematical operations and less efficient usage of storage facilities.

Although BCD is not as widely used as in the past, decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and rounding errors that are inherent to floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://speleotrove.com/decimal/ | title = General Decimal Arithmetic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basics==

As described in the introduction, BCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern:

  Decimal:     0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
  Binary :  0000  0001  0010  0011  0100  0101  0110  0111  1000  1001

As most computers store data in 8-bit [[byte]]s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:
*'''Uncompressed''': each numeral is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the numeral and the remaining bits having no significance.
*'''Packed''': two numerals are encoded into a single byte, with one numeral in the least significant [[nibble]] (bits 0-3) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4-7).
As an example, encoding the decimal number &lt;tt&gt;'''91'''&lt;/tt&gt; using uncompressed BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:

  Decimal:          9          1
  Binary :  0000 1001  0000 0001

In packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:

  Decimal:     9    1
  Binary :  1001 0001

Hence the numerical range for one uncompressed BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.

To represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used.&amp;nbsp; For example, to represent the decimal number &lt;tt&gt;'''12345'''&lt;/tt&gt; in packed BCD, using [[big-endian]] format, a program would encode as follows:

  Decimal:          1     2    3     4    5
  Binary :  0000 0001  0010 0011  0100 0101

Note that the most significant nibble of the least significant byte is zero, implying that the number is in actuality &lt;tt&gt;'''012345'''&lt;/tt&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Also note how packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage as compared to uncompressed BCD; encoding the same number in uncompressed format would consume 67 percent more storage.

[[logical shift|Shifting]] and [[mask (computing)|masking]] operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit.&amp;nbsp; Other [[bitwise operation|logical operation]]s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.

==BCD in Electronics==

BCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By utilizing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to binary.

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.

==Packed BCD==

A common variation of the two-digits-per-byte encoding is called '''packed BCD''' (or simply '''packed decimal'''), which has been in use since the 1960s or earlier and implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. In most representations, one or more bytes hold a decimal integer, where each of the two [[nibble]]s of each byte represent a decimal digit, with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag (although in some representations this nibble may be used as the least significant digit if the packed decimal value does not have a sign at all, i.e., is purely unsigned). As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.

Standard sign values are 1100 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (−). This convention was derived from abbreviations for accounting terms (Credit and Debit), as packed decimal coding was widely used in accounting systems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. Some implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F){{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!--This is the way IBM/370+ hardware and the IBM COBOL VS II compiler does it, so what citation would qualify?--&gt;. ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/books/c0925083170.htm | title = ILE RPG Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and −127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D).

No matter how many bytes wide a [[Word (data type)|word]] is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of ''n'' bytes can contain up to (2''n'')−1 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with ''d'' digits requires ½(''d''+1) bytes of storage space.

For example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from ±9,999,999. Thus the number −1,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:

 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101
 ''1    2    3    4    5    6    7    −''

(Note that, like character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal &amp;mdash; with the most significant two digits &amp;mdash; is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the [[endianness]] of the machine.)

In contrast, a 4-byte binary [[two's complement]] integer can represent values from −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.

While packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; of the memory used is wasted), conversion to [[ASCII]], [[EBCDIC]], or the various encodings of [[Unicode]] is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required.  The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of [[BCD]] exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.

Packed BCD is supported in the [[COBOL]] programming language as the &quot;COMPUTATIONAL-3&quot; (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or &quot;PACKED-DECIMAL&quot; (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD was implemented in the native instruction set of the original [[VAX]] processors from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].

===Fixed-point packed decimal===

[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as [[COBOL]] and [[PL/I]]). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits.  For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:
 12 34 56 7C
 ''12 34.56 7+''

The decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.

===Higher-density encodings===

If a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits.  However, since  2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (1,024) is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed.  Two such encodings are ''[[Chen-Ho encoding]]'' and ''[[Densely Packed Decimal]]''.  The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.

==Zoned decimal==
Some implementations, for example [[IBM]] mainframe systems, support '''zoned decimal''' numeric representations.  Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form.  The upper four bits, called the &quot;zone&quot; bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit.  EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the [[EBCDIC]] codes for the characters &quot;0&quot; through &quot;9&quot;. Similarly, [[ASCII]] systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).

For signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above).  Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value −123:
 F1 F2 D3
 '' 1  2 −3''

===EBCDIC zoned decimal conversion table===

&lt;!-- Note that this table should also include codes A0-A9, B0-B9, and E0-E9 for completeness. --&gt;

===Fixed-point zoned decimal===

Some languages (such as [[COBOL]] and [[PL/I]]) directly support fixed-point zoned decimal values, assigning an implicit decimal point at some location between the decimal digits of a number.  For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:
 F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0
 '' 1  2  7  9. 5 +0''

==IBM and BCD==
{{Main|BCD (6-bit)}}
[[IBM]] used the terms '''binary-coded decimal''' and '''BCD''' for 6-bit ''[[alphanumeric|alphameric]]'' codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCD ''alphamerics'' was used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].

The [[IBM 1400 series]] were character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled ''B, A, 8, 4, 2'' and ''1,''
plus an odd parity check bit (''C'') and a word mark bit (''M'').
For encoding digits ''1'' through ''9'', ''B'' and ''A'' were zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits ''8'' through ''1''.
For most other characters bits ''B'' and ''A'' were derived simply from the &quot;12&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, and &quot;0&quot; &quot;zone punches&quot; in the punched card character code, and bits ''8'' through ''1'' from the ''1'' through ''9'' punches.
A &quot;12 zone&quot; punch set both ''B'' and ''A'', an &quot;11 zone&quot; set ''B'', and a &quot;0 zone&quot; (a 0 punch combined with any others) set ''A''.
Thus the letter '''A''', ''(12,1)'' in the punched card format, was encoded ''(B,A,1)'' and the currency symbol '''$''', ''(11,8,3)'' in the punched card, as ''(B,8,3)''.
This allowed the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases.
One important special case was digit ''0'', represented by a lone ''0'' punch in the card, and ''(8,2)'' in core memory.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Van1401-CodeChart.pdf IBM BM 1401/1440/1460/1410/7010 Character Code Chart in BCD Order]&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory of the [[IBM 1620]] was organized into 5-bit addressable digits, the usual ''8, 4, 2, 1'' plus ''F'', used as a flag bit.  BCD ''alphamerics'' were encoded using digit pairs, with the &quot;zone&quot; in the even-addressed digit and the &quot;digit&quot; in the odd-addressed digit, the &quot;zone&quot; being related to the ''12'', ''11'', and ''0'' &quot;zone punches&quot; as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

In the Decimal Architecture [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] ''alphamerics'' were encoded using digit pairs (using [[two-out-of-five code]] in the digits, '''not''' BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the &quot;zone&quot; in the left digit and the &quot;digit&quot; in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

With the introduction of [[System/360]], IBM expanded 6-bit BCD ''alphamerics'' to 8-bit [[EBCDIC]], allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD ''numeric'' data type was also implemented, providing machine instructions that performed arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.

Today, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as [[IBM DB2]], mainframes, and [[Power6]].  In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per [[byte]]), or &quot;pure&quot; BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software.

==Other computers and BCD==

The [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX|VAX-11]] series included [[Instruction set|instructions]] that could perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This was invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions were encountered, so that programs using them could execute without modification on the newer machines.

In more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications.

==Addition with BCD==

It is possible to perform [[addition]] in BCD by first adding in binary, and then converting to BCD afterwards.  Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 – 10) when the result has a value greater than 9.  For example:

 1001 + 1000 = 10001 = 0001 0001
    9 +    8 =    17 =    1    1

In BCD, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per [[nibble]]. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to that sum to get the correct first two digits:

 0001 0001 + 0000 0110 = 0001 0111
    1    1 +    0    6 =    1    7

which gives two nibbles, 0001 and 0111, which correspond to the digits &quot;1&quot; and &quot;7&quot;. This yields &quot;17&quot; in BCD, which is the correct result.  This technique can be extended to adding multiple digits, by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9.

==Subtraction with BCD==

Subtraction is done by adding the [[ten's complement]] of the [[subtrahend]]. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a [[positive number]], and 1001 is used to represent a [[negative number]]. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 - 432.

In signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The [[ten's complement]] of 432 can be obtained by taking the [[nine's complement]] of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 - 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number -432 can be represented. So, -568 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.

Now that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:

 0000 0011 0101 0111 + 1001 0101 0110 1000 = 1001 1000 1011 1111
    0    3    5    7 +    9    5    6    8 =    9    8   11   15

Since BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:

 1001 1000 1011 1111 + 0000 0000 0110 0110 = 1001 1001 0010 0101
    9    8   11   15 +    0    0    6    6 =    9    9    2    5

Thus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (-925). To check the answer, note that the first bit is the sign bit, which is negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 - 432 should result in a negative number. To check the rest of the digits, represent them in decimal. 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The [[ten's complement]] of 925 is 1000 - 925 = 999 - 925 + 1 = 074 + 1 = 75, so the calculated answer is -75. To check, perform standard subtraction to verify that 357 - 432 is -75.

Note that in the event that there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 - 122), the number with the fewest number of digits must first be padded with zeros before taking the [[ten's complement]] or subtracting. So, with 1053 - 122, 122 would have to first be represented as 0122, and the [[ten's complement]] of 0122 would have to be calculated.

==Background==

The binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others.  The method here can be referred to as ''Simple Binary-Coded Decimal'' (''SBCD'') or ''BCD 8421''.
&lt;!-- It is also sometimes named ''NBCD'' (''Naturally Binary-Coded Decimal''). (where?) --&gt;
In the headers to the table, the '8 4 2 1', ''etc.'', indicates the weight of each bit shown; note that in the fifth column two of the weights are negative. Both ASCII and EBCDIC character codes for the digits are examples of zoned BCD, and are also shown in the table.

The following table represents [[decimal]] digits from 0 to 9 in various BCD systems:

==Legal history==

In the 1972 case [[Gottschalk v. Benson]], the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision which had allowed a patent for converting BCD encoded numbers to binary on a computer.  This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.

==Comparison with pure binary==
&lt;!-- not at all clear why this needs to be here at all, shouldn't the article just describe BCD? (mfc)--&gt;
&lt;!--as an alternative number system for computing and electronics imo a comparison to the standard one is justified (plugwash)--&gt;

===Advantages===
* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values.
* Scaling by a factor of 10 (or a power of 10) is simple; this is useful when a decimal scaling factor is needed to represent a non-integer quantity (e.g., in financial calculations)
* [[Rounding]] at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and  subtraction in decimal does not require rounding.
* Alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact, shift.
* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as [[XML]], or to drive signals for a [[seven-segment display]]) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) time. Conversion from pure [[binary numeral system|binary]] involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see [[Binary numeral system#Conversion_to_and_from_other_numeral_systems|Binary numeral system]]).

===Disadvantages===
* Some operations are more complex to implement.  [[Adder (electronics)|Adder]]s require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. 15&amp;ndash;20 percent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a [[Binary numeral system#Multiplication|binary multiplication]], requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required)
* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding. When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is reduced to about 0.34 percent,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.
&lt;!-- Could add: encoding or decoding is trivial in software using a table lookup, and fast using direct logic otherwise.  In hardware it requires no more than three gate delays. --&gt;
* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.

==Application ==
The [[BIOS]] in many [[personal computer]]s stores the date and time in BCD because the [[MC6818]] real-time clock chip used in the original [[IBM PC AT]] motherboard provided the time encoded in BCD. This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.se.ecu.edu.au/units/ens1242/lectures/ens_Notes_08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- also see MC6818 datasheet --&gt;

The [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] processor used has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions.

Early models of the [[PlayStation 3]] store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1st march 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD [[time formatting and storage bugs|were misinterpreted]] as 16 causing a paradox in the unit's date, rendering most functionalities inoperable.

==Representational variations==
Various BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. [[Programmable calculator]]s manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others typically employ a [[floating-point]] BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as [[infinity]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]]/[[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], and [[Defined and undefined|error]] (a blinking display).

===Signed variations===
Signed decimal values may be represented in several ways. The [[COBOL]] programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:

| &lt;code&gt;F1 F2 &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;

| Signed leading ''(overpunch)''
| Sign nibble in the first (most significant) byte
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;1 F2 F3&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Signed trailing separate
| Separate sign character byte (&lt;code&gt;'+'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'−'&lt;/code&gt;) following the digit bytes
| &lt;code&gt;F1 F2 F3 &lt;u&gt;2B&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Signed leading separate
| Separate sign character byte (&lt;code&gt;'+'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'−'&lt;/code&gt;) preceding the digit bytes
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;2B&lt;/u&gt; F1 F2 F3&lt;/code&gt;
|}

==Alternative encodings==
If errors in representation and computation are more important than the speed of conversion to and from display, a scaled binary representation may be used, which stores a decimal number as a binary-encoded integer and a binary-encoded signed decimal exponent. For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2{{e|-1}}.

This representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment&amp;mdash; particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed this is almost a form of [[fixed point arithmetic]] since the position of the [[radix point]] is implied.

[[Chen-Ho encoding]] provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays. [[Densely Packed Decimal]] is a similar scheme that is used for most of the [[significand]], except the lead digit, for one of the two alternative decimal encodings specified in the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard.

According to ''[[History of Northern Dynasties]]'' and ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', in 545 Tumen's tribe started to rise and frequently invaded the western frontier of Wei. The [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] of [[Western Wei]] [[Yuwen Tai]] sent [[An Nuopanto]] (Nanai-Banda, a [[Sogdian people|Sogdian]] from [[Bukhara]]&lt;ref&gt;Shing Müller, &quot;Sogdian in China um 600 n.

And in the same year he put down a revolt of the [[Tiele people|Tiele tribes]] against their overlords the [[Rouran Khaganate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zizhi159&quot;/&gt; He took advantage of this success and requested a Rouran princess in marriage. But the qaghan of Rouran [[Yujiulü Anagui|Anagui]] refused this request and sent to Bumin a mission and message: ''You are my blacksmith slave. How dare you utter these words?''. Bumin got angry and killed Anagui's mission and cut all relationship with Rouran Khaganate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northern99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhou50&quot;&gt;[[Linghu Defen]] et al., ''[[Book of Zhou]]'', [[:zh:s:周書/卷50|Vol. 50.]] {{Zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zizhi164&quot;&gt;Sima Guang, ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷164|Vol. 164.]] {{Zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher I.

Anagui's &quot;blacksmith&quot; ([[wikt:鍛|鍛]][[wikt:奴|奴]] / 锻奴, Pinyin: duàn nú, Wade-Giles: tuan-nu) insult was recorded in Chinese chronicles and historians accepted that the Kök Türks were indeed blacksmith servants for the Rouran elite,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ma Zhangshou&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fengxiang&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gao Yang&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burhan Oğuz&quot; /&gt; and that &quot;blacksmith slavery&quot; may indicate a kind of vassalage system prevailed in Rouran society.&lt;ref&gt;Larry W.

In 551, Bumin requested a Western Wei princess in marriage. Yuwen Tai permitted it and sent [[Princess Changle]] of Western Wei to Bumin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northern99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhou50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zizhi164&quot;/&gt;　In the same year when [[Emperor Wen of Western Wei|Emperor Wen]] of Western Wei died Bumin sent mission and gave two hundred horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northern99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhou50&quot;/&gt;

The beginning of formal diplomatic relations with China propped up Bumin's authority among the Turks. He eventually united the local Turkic tribes and threw off the yoke of the [[Rouran]] domination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 552 Bumin's army defeated Anagui's forces at the north of [[Six Frontier Towns|Huaihuang]] and then Anagui committed suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhou50&quot;/&gt; With their defeat Bumin proclaimed himself &quot;Illig Qaghan&quot; and made his wife qaghatun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhou50&quot;/&gt; According to the [[Khöshöö Tsaidam Monuments|Bilge Qaghan's memorial conplex]] and the [[Khöshöö Tsaidam Monuments|Kul Tigin's memorial conplex]], Bumin and [[Istemi]] ruled people by Turkic laws and they developed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kultegin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bilge&quot;&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/?lang=e&amp;mod=1&amp;tid=1&amp;oid=16&amp;m=1 Bilge kagan’s Memorial Complex, TÜRIK BITIG]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumin died within several months after proclaiming himself Illig Qaghan. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Istemi]] in the western part and by his son [[Issik Qaghan]] in the eastern part. In less than one century, his khaganate expanded to comprise most of [[Central Asia]].

There was a large influx of Sogdian refugees to his territory because of the persecution of the Zurvanites by Shah Anushirvan Khorasau I.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

His accomplishments are described in the [[Orkhon inscriptions]].

His name literally means &quot;wise chieftain&quot; in Turkic language. In 716, Qapaghan Qaghan was killed in his campaign against [[Tokuz-Oguzes|Toquz Oghuz]] and his severed head was send to [[Changan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot;&gt;''[[Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷194上|Vol. 194-I]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kul Tigin]] and [[Tonyukuk]] carried out a [[coup d'état]] against the previous ruler, his cousin [[Inel Qaghan]] who was son of [[Qapaghan Qaghan]]. They killed Qapaghan's son and brothers and made him a qaghan as Bilge Qaghan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot;/&gt;

Bilge's khaganate spanned vast steppes from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Manchuria]]; he also invaded the western sections of the [[China|Chinese]] territories. After his death from poisoning, several [[stela]]e were erected in [[Orkhon Valley|the capital area]] by the [[Orkhon River]]. These [[Orkhon inscriptions]] are the first known texts in the [[Old Turkic language]]. (Actually the popular name Orkhon inscriptions is out of date and most historians prefer the name [[Khöshöö Tsaidam Monuments]] inscriptions for the stelae of Bilge and Kul Tigin and [[Bain Tsokto]] for the earlier stelae of [[Tonyukuk]].)

He was poisoned by Buyruk Chor&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtad.humanity.ankara.edu.tr/IV-3_Eylul2007/240_47_MTAD4-3_EEkrem.pdf Erkin Ekrem, &quot;Sarı Uygurların Kökeni&quot;, ''Modern Türklük Araştırma Dergisi'', Vol. 4, No. 3, 2007, p. 175.]&lt;/ref&gt; (梅錄啜/梅录啜, méilù chuò, mei-lu-ch'o).

'''{{Audio|Staaatliches_Bauhaus.ogg|Staatliches Bauhaus}}''', commonly known simply as '''Bauhaus''', was a school in [[Germany]] that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught. It operated from 1919 to 1933. At that time the [[German language|German]] term ''{{Audio|De-Bauhaus.ogg|Bauhaus, literally &quot;house of construction&quot;}}'' stood for &quot;School of Building&quot;.

The Bauhaus school was founded by [[Walter Gropius]] in Weimar. In spite of its name, and the fact that its founder was an architect, the Bauhaus did not have an architecture department during the first years of its existence. Nonetheless it was founded with the idea of creating a 'total' work of art in which all arts, including architecture would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style became one of the most influential currents in [[Modern architecture|Modernist architecture]] and modern design.&lt;ref name=&quot;archdic&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in [[art]], [[architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[interior design]], [[industrial design]], and [[typography]].

The school existed in three German cities ([[Weimar]] from 1919 to 1925, [[Dessau]] from 1925 to 1932 and [[Berlin]] from 1932 to 1933), under three different architect-directors: [[Walter Gropius]] from 1919 to 1928, [[Hannes Meyer]] from 1928 to 1930 and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime.

The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For instance: the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from [[Weimar]] to [[Dessau]], even though it had been an important revenue source; when [[Mies van der Rohe]] took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school, and would not allow any supporters of [[Hannes Meyer]] to attend it.

== Bauhaus and German modernism ==

{{details|New Objectivity (architecture)}}
Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], the fall of the [[Hohenzollern dynasty|German monarchy]] and the abolition of censorship under the new, liberal [[Weimar Republic]] allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, previously suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]. Such influences can be overstated: [[Gropius]] himself did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''The Coming of the Third Reich'', p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Just as important was the influence of the 19th century English designer [[William Morris]], who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function.&lt;ref&gt;''Funk and Wagnall's New Encyclopaedia'', Vol 5, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Bauhaus style, also known as the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.

However, the most important influence on Bauhaus was [[modernism]], a cultural movement whose origins lay as far back as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in [[Germany]] before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with [[Gropius]] and the Bauhaus&amp;mdash;the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that mass-production was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit&amp;mdash;were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers' organization [[Deutscher Werkbund]] was formed in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]] to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany's economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).

The entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neues Bauen]]. Beginning in June 1907, [[Peter Behrens]]' pioneering [[industrial design]] work for the German electrical company [[AEG]] successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark [[AEG Turbine Factory]], and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the [[Werkbund]], and both [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meier]] worked for him in this period.

The Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German [[zeitgeist]] (&quot;spirit of the times&quot;) had turned from emotional [[Expressionism]] to the matter-of-fact [[New Objectivity]]. An entire group of working architects, including [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], turned away from fanciful experimentation, and turned toward rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise of a &quot;minimal dwelling&quot; written into the new [[Weimar Constitution]]. [[Ernst May]], Bruno Taut, and [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]], among others, built large housing blocks in [[Frankfurt]] and [[Berlin]]. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the [[Weissenhof Estate]], films, and sometimes fierce public debate.

=== Bauhaus and Vkhutemas ===
{{Main|Vkhutemas}}
Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in Moscow, has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner.&lt;ref name = &quot;GSE&quot;&gt;{{ru icon}} ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia; Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya'', [http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/304.htm ''Вхутемас'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture.&lt;ref name = &quot;GSE&quot; /&gt; Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Paul (1999) ''The Challenge of the Avant-Garde''. New Haven: Yale University Press ISBN 0-300-07762-9, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; but it was less publicised outside the Soviet Union and consequently, is less familiar to the [[West]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fry1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Fry|title=A new design philosophy: an introduction to defuturing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yEc7UGv2xQEC|accessdate=15 May 2011|date=October 1999|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=9780868407531|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Colton, Timothy J. (1995) ''Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press ISBN 0-674-58749-9; p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The second Bauhaus director [[Hannes Meyer]] attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while [[Hinnerk Scheper]] of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, [[El Lissitzky]]'s book ''Russia: an Architecture for World Revolution'' published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects there.

===Weimar===
The school was founded by [[Walter Gropius]] in [[Weimar]] in 1919 as a merger of the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art. Its roots lay in the arts and crafts school founded by the [[William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in 1906 and directed by Belgian [[Art Nouveau]] architect [[Henry van de Velde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius, [[Hermann Obrist]] and [[August Endell]] as possible successors. In 1919, after delays caused by the destruction of [[World War I]] and a lengthy debate over who should head the institution and the socio-economic meanings of a reconciliation of [[fine art|the fine arts]] and [[Applied art|the applied arts]] (an issue which remained a defining one throughout the school's existence), Gropius was made the director of a new institution integrating the two called the Bauhaus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frampton 1992 124&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In 1919 Swiss painter [[Johannes Itten]], German-American painter [[Lyonel Feininger]], and German sculptor [[Gerhard Marcks]], along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor and designer [[Oskar Schlemmer]] who headed the theater workshop, and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]], joined in 1922 by Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter [[Theo van Doesburg]] to Weimar to promote [[De Stijl]] (&quot;The Style&quot;), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect [[El Lissitzky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foster&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Weimarbauhaus6.jpg|thumb|Foyer of the Bauhaus University in Weimar]]
From 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of [[Johannes Itten]], who taught the ''Vorkurs'' or 'preliminary course' that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frampton 1992 124&quot; /&gt; Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of [[Franz Cižek]] and [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]]. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the [[Der Blaue Reiter|Blaue Reiter]] group in [[Munich]] as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]]. The influence of [[Expressionism|German Expressionism]] favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of [[Der Blaue Reiter]] founding member [[Wassily Kandinsky]] to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1922. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer [[László Moholy-Nagy]], who rewrote the ''Vorkurs'' with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favored by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907 when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while [[Hermann Muthesius]] had begun implementing industrial prototypes.&lt;ref name=&quot;foster&quot;/&gt;

Gropius was not necessarily against [[Expressionism]], and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this &quot;new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery,&quot; described &quot;painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future.&quot; By 1923 however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture#Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics|Romanesque cathedrals]] and the craft-driven aesthetic of the &quot;[[Völkisch movement]]&quot;, instead declaring &quot;we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| chapter =Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic pretensions. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called ''Bauhaus'' and a series of books called &quot;Bauhausbücher&quot;.
Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.

[[Weimar]] was in the German state of [[Thuringia]], and the Bauhaus school received state support from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]]-controlled [[Thuringian]] state government. From 1923 the school in Weimar came under political pressure from right-wing circles, until on December 26, 1924 it issued a press release accusing the government and setting the closure of the school for the end of March 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Baumgartner and Josef Helfenstein [http://www.paulkleezentrum.ch/ww/en/pub/web_root/act/wissenschaftliches_archiv/werkphasen/am_bauhaus_in_weimar_1921_1924.cfm  At the Bauhaus in Weimar, 1921–1924], at Zentrum Paul Klee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Droste (2002) [1990] [http://books.google.ie/books?id=ZXB8rX5AsgUC Bauhaus, 1919-1933] p.113&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1924, the Social Democrats lost control of the state parliament to the [[German National People's Party|Nationalists]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school's funding in half. They had already been looking for alternative sources of funding. After the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, a school of industrial design with teachers and staff less antagonistic to the conservative political regime remained in Weimar. This school was eventually known as the Technical University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and in 1996 changed its name to [[Bauhaus University Weimar]].

=== Dessau ===
[[Image:Bauhaus Dessau,Gropiusallee.jpg|thumb|The Bauhaus Dessau]]
Gropius's design for the [[Dessau]] facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] lines of the [[Fagus Factory]] than the stripped down [[Neoclassical architecture#Regional trends|Neo-classical]] of the Werkbund pavilion or the ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' Sommerfeld House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| chapter =Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dessau years saw a remarkable change in direction for the school. According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect [[Mart Stam]] to run the newly-founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam's friend and colleague in the ABC group, [[Hannes Meyer]].

Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928, and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of [[Dessau]], and the headquarters of the [[German Confederation of Trade Unions#Until 1933|Federal School of the German Trade Unions]] (ADGB) in [[Bernau bei Berlin|Bernau]]. Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs, and this approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.

But Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program, and forced the resignations of [[Herbert Bayer]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and other long-time instructors. As a vocal [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist]], he encouraged the formation of a [[communist]] student organization. In the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Gropius fired him in the summer of 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Etlin2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard A. Etlin|title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MTYQuQ2g36MC|accessdate=15 May 2011|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226220864|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin===
Although neither the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] nor [[Hitler]] himself had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like [[Wilhelm Frick]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] had already labeled the Bauhaus &quot;un-German&quot; and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for [[communists]] and social liberals. Indeed, a number of communist students loyal to Meyer moved to the [[Soviet Union]] when he was fired in 1930.

Even before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its &quot;[[degenerate art]]&quot;, and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably [[Jew]]ish influences of &quot;cosmopolitan modernism.&quot; Despite Gropius's protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933. Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the “New Bauhaus” of Chicago:&lt;ref&gt;Jardi, Enric (1991) ''Paul Klee''. Rizzoli Intl Pubns, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mies van der Rohe]] decided to emigrate to the United States for the directorship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now IIT) in Chicago and to seek building commissions.{{Ref_label|fn_1|a|a}} Curiously, however, some Bauhaus influences lived on in [[Nazi Germany]]. When Hitler's chief engineer, [[Fritz Todt]], began opening the new [[autobahn]] (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were &quot;bold examples of modernism&quot; — among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'', 325&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the ultimate aim of all creative activity was building, the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.

During the years under Gropius (1919&amp;ndash;1927), he and his partner [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in [[Berlin]], the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in [[Jena]], and the competition design for the [[Chicago Tribune Tower]], which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in [[Dessau]] is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 [[Haus am Horn]], student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.

In the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed &quot;Laubenganghäuser&quot; (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the headquarters of the Federal School of the [[German Confederation of Trade Unions|German Trade Unions]] (ADGB) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer's approach was to research users' needs and scientifically develop the design solution.

[[Mies van der Rohe]] repudiated Meyer's politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius's &quot;study of essentials&quot;, and Meyer's research into user requirements, Mies advocated a &quot;spatial implementation of intellectual decisions&quot;, which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.

The popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]] and particularly [[Ernst May]], as the city architects of [[Berlin]], [[Dresden]] and [[Frankfurt]] respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in [[Weimar Germany]]. In Taut's case, the housing he built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, is still occupied, and can be reached by going easily from the U-Bahn stop [[Onkel Toms Hütte (Berlin U-Bahn)|Onkel Toms Hütte]].

==Impact==
The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Israel]] (particularly in the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]]) in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled, by the Nazi regime. Tel Aviv, in fact, in 2004 was named to the list of [[world heritage]] sites by the [[UN]] due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3777385.stm | work=BBC News | title=Unesco celebrates Tel Aviv | date=June 8, 2004 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1096 White City of Tel-Aviv - the Modern Movement - UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it had some 4,000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 on.

[[Walter Gropius]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]] re-assembled in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the mid 1930s to live and work in the [[Isokon]] project before the war caught up with them. Both Gropius and Breuer went to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced The Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the [[Alan I W Frank House]] in Pittsburgh, among other projects. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as [[Philip Johnson]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Lawrence Halprin]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], among many others.

In the late 1930s, [[Mies van der Rohe]] re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential [[Philip Johnson]], and became one of the pre-eminent architects in the world. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the [[New Bauhaus]] school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist [[Walter Paepcke]]. This school became the [[Institute of Design IIT|Institute of Design]], part of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. Printmaker and painter [[Werner Drewes]] was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both [[Columbia University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. [[Herbert Bayer]], sponsored by Paepcke, moved to [[Aspen, Colorado]] in support of Paepcke's Aspen projects at the [[Aspen Institute]]. In 1953, [[Max Bill]], together with [[Inge Scholl|Inge Aicher-Scholl]] and [[Otl Aicher]], founded the [[Ulm School of Design]] (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of [[semiotics]] as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the ′Ulm Model′ concept continues to influence international design education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/ Ulm School of Design | HfG Ulm Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology. The machine was considered a positive element, and therefore industrial and product design were important components. ''Vorkurs'' (&quot;initial&quot; or &quot;preliminary course&quot;) was taught; this is the modern day &quot;Basic Design&quot; course that has become one of the key foundational courses offered in architectural and design schools across the globe. There was no teaching of history in the school because everything was supposed to be designed and created according to first principles rather than by following precedent.

One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of [[modern furniture]] design. The ubiquitous [[Cantilever chair]] and the [[Wassily Chair]] designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer [[Mart Stam]] over the rights to the cantilever chair patent. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, thus leading to the patent dispute.)

The physical plant at [[Dessau]] survived [[World War II]] and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of ''Bauhausbühne'' (&quot;Bauhaus Stage&quot;). After [[German reunification]], a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/en/ Current information : english : Stiftung Bauhaus Dessau / Bauhaus Dessau Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.

== Bauhaus artists ==
Bauhaus was not a formal group, but rather a school. Its three architect-directors ([[Walter Gropius]], [[Hannes Meyer]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]) are most closely associated with Bauhaus.

Furthermore a large number of outstanding artists of their time were lecturers at Bauhaus:

It fell into obscurity for many decades, and its existence did not become widely known again until it was printed in 1815 in an edition prepared by the Icelandic scholar [[Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.dk/books?id=uujn741w2Y4C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=thorkelin+1815+beowulf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IUOnJQxsj4&amp;sig=O4irh7bxGouffqjl2PwFn5nh9MQ&amp;hl=da&amp;ei=CVKMTen2HoiUOsb3yaAC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=thorkelin%201815%20beowulf&amp;f=false Bruce Mitchell &amp; Fred C.

In the poem, [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], a hero of the [[Geats]], battles three antagonists: [[Grendel]], who has been attacking the resident warriors of the [[mead hall]] of [[Hroðgar]] (the king of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]), [[Grendel's mother]], and an unnamed [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]]. After the first two victories, Beowulf goes home to [[Geatland]] in [[Sweden]] and becomes king of the Geats. The last fight takes place fifty years later. In this final battle, Beowulf is fatally wounded. After his death, his servants bury him in a [[tumulus]] in Geatland.

==Historical background==
[[Image:Beowulf geography names.png|left|thumb|Approximate central regions of tribes mentioned in Beowulf with the location of the [[Angeln|Angles]]. See [[Scandza]] for details of Scandinavia's political fragmentation in the 6th century.]]

The events described in the poem take place in the late 5th century, after the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had begun migration and settlement in England, and before the beginning of the 7th century, a time when the Saxons were either newly arrived or in close contact with their fellow [[Germanic peoples|Germanic kinsmen]] in Scandinavia and [[Northern Germany]]. The poem could have been transmitted in England by people of [[Geat]]ish origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;nortonanth&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of English Literature | publisher = W. W. Norton and Co., Ltd |page = 19| year = 1986 |isbn= 0393954722 |author = M. H. Abrams, general ed..}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that ''Beowulf'' was first composed in the 7th century at [[Rendlesham, Suffolk|Rendlesham]] in [[East Anglia]], as [[Sutton Hoo]] also shows close connections with Scandinavia, and also that the East Anglian royal dynasty, the [[Wuffing]]s, were descendants of the [[Geat]]ish [[Wulfing]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;chickering&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Beowulf: a Dual-Language Edition | location = New York, NY| publisher = Doubleday | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newton&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Newton |first= Sam | title = The Origins of Beowulf and the Pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia | location = Woodbridge, Suffolk, England| publisher = Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd.| year = 1993 | isbn = 0859913619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have associated this poem with the court of King [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]], or with the court of King [[Canute the Great|Canute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Ottarshogen.jpg|thumb|''[[Ohthere]]'s mound'']]

The poem deals with [[legend]]s, i.e., it was composed for entertainment and does not separate between fictional elements and real historic events, such as the raid by King [[Hygelac]] into [[Frisia]], ca. 516. Scholars generally agree that many of the personalities of ''Beowulf'' also appear in Scandinavian sources (specific works designated in the following section).&lt;ref name=&quot;shippey&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shippey |first= T. A. | title = Wicked Queens and Cousin Strategies in Beowulf and Elsewhere, Notes and Bibliography | journal = In the Heroic Age| issue= 5| year = 2001 | month= Summer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not only concern people (e.g., [[Healfdene]], [[Hroðgar]], [[Halga]], [[Hroðulf]], [[Eadgils]] and [[Ohthere]]), but also [[Norse clans|clans]] (e.g., [[Scylding]]s, [[Yngling|Scylfings]] and [[Wulfings]]) and some of the events (e.g., the [[Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern]]). As far as Sweden is concerned, the dating of the events in the poem has been confirmed by archaeological excavations of the [[barrows]] indicated by [[Snorri Sturluson]] and by Swedish tradition as the graves of [[Ohthere]] (dated to c. 530) and his son [[Eadgils]] (dated to c. 575) in [[Uppland]], Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;klingmark&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Klingmark |first= Elisabeth |title = Gamla Uppsala, Svenska kulturminnen 59 |language = Swedish | publisher = Riksantikvarieämbetet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nerman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Nerman|first= Birger|title = Det svenska rikets uppkomst |location= Stockholm | year= 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heritageboard&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = Swedish National Heritage Board | accessdate=2007-10-01 | url = http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/en/places_to_visit/our_historical_sites/ottar_s_mound.html |title = Ottar's Mound }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, recent archaeological excavations at [[Lejre]], where Scandinavian tradition located the seat of the Scyldings, i.e., [[Heorot]], have revealed that a hall was built in the mid-6th century, exactly the time period of ''Beowulf''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niles HT&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niles |first= John D. | title = Beowulf's Great Hall | journal = History Today |volume = 56 | issue= 10 | year = 2006 | month= October |url = http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=31861&amp;amid=30234433| pages= 40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three halls, each about 50 metres long, were found during the excavation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niles HT&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Eadgil's barrow.PNG|left|thumb|Finds from [[Eadgils]]' mound, left, excavated in 1874 at [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]] In [[Sweden]] supported ''Beowulf'' and the sagas.]]

The majority view appears to be that people such as King Hroðgar and the Scyldings in ''Beowulf'' are based on real people in 6th-century Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap4.pdf |last = Anderson |first = Carl Edlund |year= 1999 |title= Formation and Resolution of Ideological Contrast in the Early History of Scandinavia (Ph.D. thesis) | publisher = University of Cambridge, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic (Faculty of English) |page = 115 |accessdate = 2007-10-01|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''[[Finnsburg Fragment]]'' and several shorter surviving poems, ''Beowulf'' has consequently been used as a source of information about Scandinavian personalities such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic personalities such as [[Offa of Angel|Offa]], king of the continental [[Angles]].

19th-century archeological evidence may confirm elements of the ''Beowulf'' story. [[Eadgils]] was buried at [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]], according to [[Snorri Sturluson]]. When Eadgils' mound (to the left in the photo) was excavated in 1874, the finds supported ''Beowulf'' and the sagas. They showed that a powerful man was buried in a large barrow, c 575, on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. These remains include a [[Franks|Frankish]] sword adorned with gold and garnets and a [[tafl]] game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a costly buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. This would have been a burial fitting a king who was famous for his wealth in Old Norse sources. [[Ongenþeow]]'s barrow (to the right in the photo) has not been excavated.&lt;ref name=&quot;klingmark&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nerman&quot;/&gt;

==Sources and analogues==
Provenance (i.e. date of composition, author, geographic origin, etc.), identified sources and [[Analogue (literature)|analogues]] for ''Beowulf'' cannot be proven. Both of these are important in regards to the uncertainty surrounding the ''Beowulf'' manuscript, as the works from which it draws from or influences suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries from which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was &quot;popular&quot; and where its &quot;popularity&quot; took it). There are five main categories in which potential sources and/or analogues are included: [[Scandinavia]]n parallels, [[Classics|classical]] sources, [[Early Irish literature|Irish]] sources and analogues, [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] sources, and echoes in other [[Old English]] texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot;&gt;Andersson, Theodore M..&quot;Sources and Analogues.&quot; ''A Beowulf Handbook.'' Eds. Bjork, Robert E. and John D. Niles. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1998. 125–148. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early studies into Scandinavian sources/analogues proposed that ''Beowulf'' was a translation of an original Scandinavian work, but this idea has been discarded. In 1878, [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]] made the connection between ''Beowulf'' and the ''[[Grettis saga]]''. This is currently one of the only [[Scandinavia]]n [[Analogue (literature)|analogues]] to receive a general consensus of potential connection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot; /&gt; Tales concerning the [[Scylding|Skjöldungs]], possibly originating as early as the 6th century, were later used as a narrative basis in such texts as ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka]]''. Some scholars see ''Beowulf'' as a product of these early tales along with ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' and ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka]]''. Paul Beekman Taylor used the [[Ynglinga saga|''Ynglingasaga'']] as proof that the ''Beowulf'' poet was likewise working from [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot; /&gt;

Friedrich Panzer attempted to contextualize ''Beowulf'' and other Scandinavian works, including ''Grettis saga'', under the international [[folklore|folktale]] type 301B, or [[Bear's Son Tale|&quot;The Bear's Son&quot; tale]]. However, although this approach—the &quot;shift&amp;nbsp;... from the quasi-historical or legendary materials&amp;nbsp;... to the folktale line of inquiry&quot;--was seen as a step in the right direction, &quot;The Bear's Son&quot; tale was seen as too universal. In a term coined by [[Peter Jørgensen (entomologist)|Peter Jørgensen]], the &quot;two-troll tradition,&quot; a more concise frame of reference was found. The &quot;two-troll tradition&quot; refers to &quot;a [[Norse art|Norse]] [[Ecotype|'ecotype']] in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants, usually of different sexes.&quot; Both ''Grettis saga'' and ''Beowulf'' fit this [[folklore|folktale]] type.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot; /&gt;

Scholars who favored [[Early Irish literature|Irish]] parallels directly spoke out against [[Scandinavia|pro-Scandinavian]] theories, citing them as unjustified. [[Wilhelm Grimm]] is noted to be the first person to ever link ''Beowulf'' with Irish folklore. Max Deutschbein is noted as the first person to present the argument in academic form. He suggested the Irish [[Bricriu|''Feast of Bricriu'']] as a source for ''Beowulf''—a theory that was soon denied by Oscar Olson. Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm Von Sydow argued against both Scandinavian translation and source material due to his theory that ''Beowulf'' is fundamentally [[Christianity|Christian]] and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been [[paganism|pagan]] in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot; /&gt;

In the late 1920s, Heinzer Dehmer suggested ''Beowulf'' as contextually based in the [[folklore|folktale]] type “The Hand and the Child,” due to the [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of the “monstrous arm”—a motif that distances ''Grettis saga'' and ''Beowulf'' and further aligns ''Beowulf'' with Irish parallelism. [[James Carney (scholar)|James Carney]] and Martin Puhvel also agree with this “Hand and the Child” contextualization. Carney also ties ''Beowulf'' to Irish literature through the ''[[Táin Bó]]'' ''[[Fráech]]'' story. Puhvel supported the “Hand and the Child” theory through such motifs as “the more powerful giant mother, the mysterious light in the cave, the melting of the sword in blood, the phenomenon of battle rage, swimming prowess, combat with water monsters, underwater adventures, and the bear-hug style of wrestling.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot; /&gt;

Attempts to find [[Classics|classical]] or [[Late Latin]] influence or analogue in ''Beowulf'' are almost exclusively linked with [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Odyssey]]'' or [[Virgil|Virgil's]] ''[[Aeneid]]''. In 1926, [[Albert Stanburrough Cook|Albert S. Cook]] suggested a Homeric connection due to equivalent formulas, [[metonymy|metonymies]], and analogous voyages. James A. Work's essay, “Odyssean Influence on the ''Beowulf'',” also supported the Homeric influence. He stated that encounter between Beowulf and [[Unferð|Unferth]] was parallel to the encounter between Odysseus and [[Nisus and Euryalus|Euryalus]] in Books 7–8 of the ''Odyssey''. This theory of Homer's influence on ''Beowulf'' remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely “comparative literature.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot; /&gt;

[[Frederick Klaeber|Friedrich Klaeber]] somewhat led the attempt to connect ''Beowulf'' and [[Virgil]] near the start of the 20th century, claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] world is contingent on Virgil. Similarly, in 1971, [[Alistair Campbell]] stated that the [[apologue]] technique used in ''Beowulf'' is so infrequent in the epic tradition aside from when Virgil uses it that the poet who composed ''Beowulf'' could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across [[Virgil|Virgil's]] writings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot; /&gt;

Whether seen as a pagan work with “Christian coloring” added by scribes or as a “Christian historical novel, with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as [[Regionalism (literature)|'local color']], as Margaret E. Goldsmith did in “The Christian Theme of ''Beowulf'',” &lt;ref name=&quot;Irving&quot;&gt;Irving, Edward B., Jr.. “Christian and Pagan Elements.” ''A Beowulf Handbook.'' Eds. Bjork, Robert E. and John D. Niles. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1998. 175–192. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; it cannot be denied that [[Christianity]] pervades the text, and with that, the use of the [[Bible]] as a source. ''Beowulf'' channels [[Book of Genesis|''Genesis'']], [[Book of Exodus|''Exodus'']], and [[Book of Daniel|''Daniel'']] &lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson&quot; /&gt; in its inclusion of references to [[Book of Genesis|God's creation of the universe]], the story of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], [[Noah]] and the [[Noah's Ark|flood]], [[devil]]s or the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|Devil]], [[Hell]], and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Irving&quot; /&gt;

The [[Bible]] can fall into both the category of [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] sources and also this category, as the ''Beowulf'' poet would have relied on [[Old English]] translations.

==Story==
The main protagonist, [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], a hero of the [[Geat]]s, comes to the aid of [[Hrothgar]], the king of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], whose great hall, [[Heorot]], is plagued by the monster [[Grendel]]. Beowulf kills both Grendel and [[Grendel's mother]], the latter with a magical sword.

Later in his life, Beowulf is himself king of the Geats, and finds his realm terrorized by a [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]] whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacks the dragon with the help of his ''[[thegn]]s'', but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon into its lair, at [[Earnanæs]], but only his young Swedish relative [[Wiglaf]] dares join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded. He is buried in a [[tumulus]] by the sea.

Beowulf is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins [[in medias res]] (&quot;into the middle of affairs&quot;) or simply, &quot;in the middle&quot;, which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been going on for some time. The poet who composed Beowulf, while objective in telling the tale, nonetheless uses a certain style to maintain excitement and adventure within the story. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages are spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valor.

===Structured by battles===
Jane Chance (Professor of English, [[Rice University]]) in her 1980 article &quot;The Structural Unity of Beowulf: The Problem of Grendel's Mother&quot; argued that there are two standard interpretations of the poem: one view which suggests a two-part structure (i.e., the poem is divided between Beowulf's battles with [[Grendel]] and with the dragon) and the other, a three-part structure (this interpretation argues that Beowulf's battle with [[Grendel's mother]] is structurally separate from his battle with Grendel).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chance&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chance |first=Jane|title = The Structural Unity of Beowulf: The Problem of Grendel's Mother | publisher = Indiana University Press |location= Bloomington, Indiana |editor =Helen Damico and Alexandra Hennessey Olsen | year = 1990 |page= 248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance stated that, &quot;this view of the structure as two-part has generally prevailed since its inception in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' in ''Proceedings of the British Academy 22'' (1936).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chance&quot;/&gt; In contrast, she argued that the three-part structure has become &quot;increasingly popular.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chance&quot;/&gt;

====First battle: Grendel====
[[Image:Beowulf challenged by the coastguard by E Paul.jpg|thumb|Beowulf is challenged by a Danish coast guard, Evelyn Paul (1911).]]''Beowulf'' begins with the story of King Hroðgar, who built the great hall [[Heorot]] for his people. In it he, his wife [[Wealhþeow]], and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating, until Grendel, an outcast from society who is angered by the singing, attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hroðgar's warriors while they sleep. But Grendel dares not touch the throne of Hroðgar, because it is described as protected by a powerful god. Hroðgar and his people, helpless against Grendel's attacks, abandon Heorot.

Beowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hroðgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to help Hroðgar.

Beowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. After they fall asleep, Grendel enters the hall and attacks, devouring one of Beowulf's men. Beowulf, who bears no weapon as this would be an unfair advantage over the unarmed beast, has been feigning sleep and leaps up to clench Grendel's hand. The two battle until it seems as though the hall might collapse. Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades can not pierce Grendel's skin as he is immune to human weapons. Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes to die.

====Second battle: Grendel's mother====
The next night, after celebrating Grendel's death, Hroðgar and his men sleep in Heorot. Grendel's mother appears and attacks the hall. She kills Hroðgar's most trusted warrior, [[Æschere]], in revenge for Grendel's death.

Hroðgar, Beowulf, and their men track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. Beowulf prepares himself for battle; he is presented with a sword, [[Hrunting]], by a warrior called Unferth. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hroðgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf dives into the lake. He is swiftly detected and attacked by Grendel's mother. However, she is unable to harm Beowulf through his armour and drags him to the bottom of the lake. In a cavern containing Grendel's body and the remains of men that the two have killed, Grendel's mother and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.

At first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail. Beowulf, finding that Hrunting cannot harm his foe, discards it in fury. Beowulf is again saved from his opponent's attack by his armour and, grasping a mighty sword of the giants from Grendel's mother's armoury (which no other man could have hefted in battle), Beowulf beheads her. Traveling further into the lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs its head. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the &quot;ninth hour&quot; (l. 1600, &quot;nōn&quot;, about 3pm).&lt;ref name=&quot;jack&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Jack |first=George |title = Beowulf: A Student Edition | page = 123 |publisher= Oxford University Press, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returns to Heorot, where Hroðgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword [[Nægling]], his family's heirloom.

====Third battle: The dragon====
[[Image:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|thumb|A 1908 depiction of Beowulf fighting the unnamed dragon by J. R. Skelton.]]Beowulf returns home and eventually becomes king of his own people. One day, late in Beowulf's life, a slave steals a golden cup from the lair of an unnamed [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]] at [[Earnaness]]. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon. Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon but finds himself overmatched. His men, upon seeing this display and fearing for their lives, creep back into the woods. One of his men, however, Wiglaf, who finds great distress in seeing Beowulf's plight, comes to Beowulf's aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf dies from his wounds.

Beowulf is buried in Geatland on a cliff overlooking the sea, where sailors are able to see his [[tumulus]]. The dragon's treasure is buried with him, in accordance with Beowulf's wishes, rather than distributed to his people. There is a curse associated with the hoard.

===Structured by funerals===
It is widely accepted that there are three funerals in ''Beowulf.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Owen-Crocker | first = Gale | authorlink =| title = The Four Funerals in Beowulf: And the Structure of the Poem | location = New York | publisher = Manchester University Press | pages = 1–5, 23, 31, 34, 44, 52, 65–69, 84–86, 104–105 | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funerals are also paired with the three battles described above.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; The three funerals share similarities regarding the offerings for the dead and the change in theme through the description of each funeral. Gale Owen-Crocker (Professor of Anglo-Saxon, [[University of Manchester]]) in ''The Four Funerals in Beowulf'' (2000) argues that a passage in the poem, commonly known as “The Lay of the Last Survivor” (lines 2247-66), is an additional funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; The funerals are themselves involved in the ritual of hoarding: the deposition of sacrificial objects with both religious and socio-economic functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarzia&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tarzia| first = Wade| title = ''The Hoarding Ritual in Germanic Epic Tradition.'' | publisher = The [[Journal of Folklore Research]] 26:2| pages = 99–121 | year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scyld Scefing (lines 1–52)====
The first funeral in the poem is of [[Scyld|Scyld Scefing]] (translated in some versions as &quot;Shield Shiefson&quot;) the king of the Danes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Greenblatt| first = Stephen | authorlink = Stephen Greenblatt | coauthors = M.H. Abrahams | title = The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Volume A: Middle Ages | location = New York | publisher = Norton &amp; Company | pages = 34–35, 57–58, 81, 99–100 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[:Wikt:fit#Etymology 3|fitt]] helps the poet illustrate the settings of the poem by introducing Hrothgar’s lineage. The funeral leads to the introduction of the hero, Beowulf and his confrontation with the first monster, Grendel. This passage begins by describing Scyld’s glory as a “scourge of many tribes, a wrecker of mead-benches.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; Scyld’s glory and importance is shown by the prestigious death he obtains through his service as the king of the Danes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; His importance is proven once more by the grand funeral given to him by his people: his funeral at sea with many weapons and treasures shows he was a great soldier and an even greater leader to his people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; The poet introduces the concepts of a heroic society through Scyld. The possessions buried with the king are elaborately described to emphasize the importance of such items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; The importance of these earthly possessions are then used to establish this dead king’s greatness in respect to the treasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; Scyld’s funeral helps the poet to elaborate on the glory of battle in a heroic society and how earthly possessions help define a person‘s importance. This funeral also helps the poet to develop the plot to lead into the confrontation between the protagonist, Beowulf, and the main antagonist, Grendel.

====Hildeburg’s kin (lines 1107–24)====
The second funeral in the poem is that of [[Hildeburh|Hildeburg’s]] kin and is the second fitt of this poem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; The funeral is sung in Heorot to celebrate Beowulf's victory over Grendel. It also signifies the beginning of the protagonist’s battle against Grendel's mother. The death of Hildeburg’s brother, son(s), and husband are the results of battle. The battle also leads to Scyld’s death and mirrors the use of funeral offerings for the dead with extravagant possessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; As with the Dane’s king, Hildeburg’s relatives are buried with their armour and gold to signify their importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; However, the relatives’ funeral differs from the first as it was a cremation ceremony. Furthermore, the poet focuses on the strong emotions of those who died while in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; The gory details of “heads melt[ing], gashes [springing] open...and the blood [springing] out from the body’s wounds” &lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; describes war as a horrifying event instead of one of glory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; Although the poet maintains the theme of possessions as important even in death, the glory of battle is challenged by the vicious nature of war. The second funeral displays different concepts from the first and a change of direction in the plot that leads to Beowulf's fight against Grendel's Mother.

====Lay of the Last Survivor (lines 2247–66)====
&quot;The Lay of the Last Survivor&quot; is arguably an addition to the other three funerals in ''Beowulf'' because of the striking similarities that define the importance of the other burials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; The parallels that identify this passage with the other three funerals are the similar burial customs, changes in setting and plot, and changes of theme. The lament appears to be a funeral because of the Last Survivor’s description of burial offerings that are also found in the funerals of Scyld Scefing, Hildeburg’s kin, and Beowulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; The Last Survivor describes the many treasures left for the dead such as the weapons, armour and gold cups &lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; that have strong parallels to Scyld’s “well furbished ship...,bladed weapons and coats of mail,”&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; Hildeburg’s Kin’s “blood-plastered coats of mail [and] boar-shaped helmets”&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; and Beowulf's treasure from the dragon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt;

An additional argument towards viewing this passage as a funeral lies in the statement, “tumbling hawk [and] swift horse”&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; mentioned in the poem. This is an animal offering which was a burial custom during the era of the poem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; Moreover this passage, like the other funerals, signifies changes in setting and plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; One can also argue that it is the 3rd part to the poem since it describes the settings during the time lapse for the final battle between Beowulf and the Dragon. The poet also describes death in battle as horrifying, a concept continued from the second part of the poem, through the Last Survivor’s eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt;

====Beowulf’s funeral (lines 3137–82)====
[[Image:Skalunda gravhög.jpg|thumb|The barrow of [[Skalunda]], a barrow that was identified by the archaeologist [[Birger Nerman]] as Beowulf's burial mound.&lt;ref name=&quot;ewald&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ewald |first= Gustav | title = Är Skalunda hög kung Beowulfs grav? | journal =Västgöta-Bygden |volume = 1 | year = 1950 | language=Swedish | pages= 335–336}}(Om *Birger Nermans och °Carl Otto Fasts idéer angående hednatima kungars gravplats.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The fourth and final funeral of the poem is Beowulf's funeral. After the final battle against the dragon, Beowulf receives fatal wounds and dies. The greatness of Beowulf's life is demonstrated through this funeral, particularly through the many offerings of his people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; In addition, the immense hoard of the dragon is buried with the hero. The poet also bestows on Beowulf more significance than the others through his description of the cremation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen-Crocker&quot;/&gt; “Weohstan’s son (pause) commanded it be announced to many men (pause) that they should fetch from afar wood for the pyre.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt; for their leader’s funeral. The dragon’s remains are thrown into the sea, a parallel to Scyld’s burial in his ship. Beowulf's funeral is the fourth fitt of the poem and acts as an [[epilogue]] for the hero who is the, “most gracious and fair-minded, kindest to his people and keenest to win fame
.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Greenblatt&quot;/&gt;

==The Beowulf manuscript==
''Beowulf'' survives in a single manuscript dated on paleographical grounds to the late tenth or early eleventh century. The manuscript measures 195 x 130&amp;nbsp;mm.

===Provenance===
The earliest known owner of the ''Beowulf'' manuscript is the 16th-century scholar [[Laurence Nowell]], after whom the manuscript is named, though its official designation is ''Cotton Vitellius A.XV'' because it was one of [[Robert Bruce Cotton]]'s holdings in the middle of the 17th century. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil’s household as a [[tutor]] to his ward, [[Earl of Oxford|Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt;

It suffered damage in the [[Cotton Library]] fire at [[Ashburnham House]] in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss. Kevin Kiernan, professor of English at the [[University of Kentucky]], is foremost in the computer digitization and preservation of the manuscript (the Electronic Beowulf Project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/eBeowulf/guide.htm|title=Electronic Beowulf |accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=The University of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;), using fibre-optic backlighting to further reveal lost letters of the poem.

The poem is known only from this single manuscript, which is estimated to date from close to [[1000|AD 1000]]. Kiernan has argued from an examination of the manuscript that it was the author's own working copy. He dated the work to the reign of [[Canute the Great]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt; The poem appears in what is today called the ''Beowulf'' manuscript or [[Nowell Codex]] (British Library MS Cotton Vitellius A.xv), along with other works. The earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by [[Franciscus Junius (the younger)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kiernan| first= Kevin | authorlink= | title=Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript | location=Ann Arbor, MI | publisher=University of Michigan | page= footnote 69 pg 162, 90, 258, 257, 171, xix–xx, xix, 3, 4, 277–278 , 23–34, 29, 29, 60, 62, footnote 69 162| year=1996 | nopp = true|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_s61FWPxcCoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|isbn=0-472-08412-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt;

Reverend [[Thomas Smith (scholar)|Thomas Smith]] and [[Humfrey Wanley]] undertook the task of cataloguing the Cotton library, in which the Nowell Codex was held. Smith’s catalogue appeared in 1696, and Humfrey’s in 1705.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/eblj/2005articles/pdf/article1.pdf |last = Joy |first = Eileen A |year= 2005|title= Thomas Smith, Humfrey Wanley, and the Little-Known Country of the Cotton Library | publisher = Electronic British Library Journal |pages = 2, 24, 24, footnote 24 |accessdate = 2008-03-03|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beowulf manuscript itself is mentioned in name for the first time in a letter in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley’s assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the Beowulf script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley &quot;I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy&quot;/&gt; It has been theorized that Smith failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy&quot;/&gt;

===The two scribes===
The Beowulf manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes: Scribe A and Scribe B, the latter of whom took over at line 1939. The handwriting of the two scribes is ill-matched.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt; The script of Scribe B is archaic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt; Both scribes proofread their work down to even the most minute error. Scribe B slaved over the poem for many years 'with great reverence and care to restoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt; Scribe A's revisions can be broken down into three categories &quot;the removal of dittographic material; the restoration of material that was inadvertently omitted or was about to be omitted; and the conversion of legitimate, but contextually incorrect words to the contextually proper words. These three categories provide the most compelling evidence that the scribe was generally attentive to his work while he was copying, and that he later subjected his work to careful proofreading.&quot; The work of Scribe B bears a striking resemblance to the work of the first scribe of the [[Blickling homilies]], and so much so that it is believed they derive from the same [[scriptorium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt; From knowledge of books held in the library at [[Malmesbury Abbey]] and available as source works, and from the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the text, the transcription may have been made there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lapidge|first=Michael |title=Anglo-Latin literature, 600–899|publisher=Hambledon Press|location=London|year=1996|page=299|isbn=1-852-85011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for at least a century, some scholars have maintained that the description of Grendel’s lake in Beowulf was borrowed from [[St. Paul]]’s vision of Hell in Homily 16 of the Blickling homilies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt; Most intriguing in the many versions of the Beowulf FS is the transcription of alliterative verse. From the First scribe's edits, emenders such as Klaeber were forced to alter words for the sake of the poem. &quot;The lack of alliteration in line 1981 forced Klaeber in his edition, for example, to change ''side'' (the scribe's correction) to ''heal''. The latter scribe revealed not only astute mechanical editing, but also unbridled nourishment of the physical manuscript itself.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Kiernan 1996&quot;&gt;Kevin Kiernan. Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years Beowulf scholars have put the work of the scribes under intense scrutiny, many debate whether the scribes even held a copy as some believe they worked solely from oral dictation. Men such as [[Benjamin Thorpe]] saw many errors in rhetoric and diction, implying that the transcribing made little to no sense. Most intriguing however becomes the abhorrence of Scribe A's mechanical editing. This reveals the strength of Beowulf's oral history as poetic flow were prioritized over dialect/ grammatical coherency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Kiernan 1996&quot;/&gt;

===Transcription===
Icelandic scholar [[Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin]] made the first transcriptions of the manuscript in 1786 and published the results in 1815, working under a historical research commission of the Danish government. He made one himself, and had another done by a professional copyist who knew no Anglo-Saxon. Since that time, the manuscript has crumbled further, and the Thorkelin transcripts remain a prized secondary source for Beowulf scholars. The recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to these transcripts. Their accuracy has been called into question, however (''e.g.,'' by Chauncey Brewster Tinker in ''The Translations of Beowulf'',&lt;ref name=&quot;chaucey&quot;&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/25942 Gutenberg copy] of Chauncey Brewster Tinker's ''The Translations of Beowulf'' (1903)&lt;/ref&gt; a comprehensive survey of 19th-century translations and editions of ''Beowulf''), and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in Thorkelin's time is unclear.

==Authorship and date==
''Beowulf'' was written in England, but is set in Scandinavia. It has variously been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries. It is an epic poem told in historical perspective; a story of epic events and of great people of a heroic past. Although its author is unknown, its themes and subject matter are rooted in [[Germanic heroic poetry]], in Anglo-Saxon tradition recited and cultivated by [[scop]]s.

Opinion differs as to whether the composition of the poem is contemporary with its transcription, or whether the poem was composed at an earlier time (possibly as one of the [[Bear's Son Tales]]) and orally transmitted for many years, and then transcribed at a later date. Lord (1960:{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}) felt strongly the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance, though likely taken at more than one sitting.
Kiernan (1996) argues on the basis of [[paleography|paleographical]] and [[codicology|codicological]] evidence, that the poem is contemporary with the manuscript.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan 1996&quot;&gt;Kiernan (1996) {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiernan's reasoning has in part to do with the much-discussed political context of the poem: it has been held by most scholars, until recently, that the poem was composed in the 8th century on the assumption that a poem eliciting sympathy for the Danes could not have been composed by Anglo-Saxons during the Viking Ages of the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan (1996) {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiernan argues against an 8th-century provenance because this would still require that the poem be transmitted by Anglo-Saxons through the Viking Age, holds that the paleographic and codicological evidence encourages the belief that Beowulf is an 11th-century composite poem, and states that Scribe A and Scribe B are the authors and that Scribe B is the more poignant of the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan 1996&quot;/&gt;

The view of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] is that the poem retains a much too genuine memory of [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the [[Christianization of England]] around AD 700.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolkien&quot;/&gt; Tolkien's conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century is defended by [[Tom Shippey]] (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, 'Tolkien and the Beowulf-poet' in: ''Roots and Branches'' (2007), [[Walking Tree Publishers]] ISBN 978-3-905703-05-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A suggestion made by [[John Mitchell Kemble]] (1849) and defended by Jäching (1976) puts a ''terminus post quem'' of the early 9th century on the [[Battle of Finnburg|Finnesburg]] episode at least. Kemble identifies the character of [[Hnaef]] son of [[Hoc (Beowulf)|Hoc]] with the historical [[Alamanni]]c nobleman [[Hnabi]] son of [[Huoching]] (d. ca. 788), worked into the earlier episode set in Frisia around AD 800 at the earliest.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jänichen ''Die alemannischen Fürsten Nebi und Berthold und ihre Beziehungen zu den Klöstern St. Gallen und Reichenau'', Blätter für deutsche Landesgeschichte (1976), pp. 30–40.[http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000316,00041.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th century date is due to scholars who argue that, rather than transcription of the tale from the oral tradition by a literate monk, ''Beowulf'' reflects an original interpretation of the story by the poet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolkien&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heaney&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Heaney |first= Seamus |work =Beowulf: The Poem |title= Beowulf: A New Verse Translation |year=2000 |location = New York |publisher = Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate over oral tradition===
The question of whether ''Beowulf'' was passed down through [[oral tradition]] prior to its present [[manuscript]] form has been the subject of much debate, and involves more than the mere matter of how it was composed. Rather, given the implications of the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]] and [[oral tradition]], the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.

Scholarly discussion about ''Beowulf'' in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesize a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the firedrake narrative). These fragments would be held for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaizing.&lt;ref name=COLORING210-217&gt;&quot;The Christian Coloring of Beowulf&quot; (F. A. Blackburn, PMLA 12 (1897), 210–17)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BENSON193-213&gt;&quot;The Pagan Coloring of Beowulf&quot; (Larry D. Benson, in Old English Poetry: fifteen essays. R.P. Creed, ed. Providence (Rhode Island): Brown University Press, 1967: 193–213).&lt;/ref&gt; There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one Christianity and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem, separated from each other by hundreds of years; it sees the poem as originally the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself a convert perhaps or one whose forbears had been pagan, a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary milieus and was capable of a masterful &quot;repurposing&quot; of poetry from the oral tradition; this early Christian poet saw virtue manifest in a willingness to sacrifice oneself in a devotion to justice and in an attempt to aid and protect those in need of help and greater safety; good pagan men had trodden that noble path and so this poet presents pagan culture with equanimity and respect; yet overlaid upon this early Christian poet's composition are verses from a much later reformist &quot;fire-and-brimstone&quot; Christian poet who vilifies pagan practice as dark and sinful and who adds satanic aspects to its monsters.

[[M. H. Abrams]] and [[Stephen Greenblatt]] assert in their introduction to ''Beowulf'' in the ''[[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]'' that, &quot;The poet was reviving the heroic language, style, and pagan world of ancient Germanic oral poetry […] it is now widely believed that ''Beowulf'' is the work of a single poet who was a [[Christian]] and that his poem reflects well-established Christian tradition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;norton&quot;&gt;

However, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]], which hypothesizes that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them. In his landmark work, ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', [[Albert Lord]] refers to the work of [[Francis P. Magoun]] and others, saying “the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate. This exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that Beowulf was composed orally.”&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Albert. ''The Singer of Tales.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1960. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of ''Beowulf'' and other [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] poetry for evidence of oral-formulaic composition has met with mixed response. While &quot;themes&quot; (inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event, such as the &quot;arming the hero&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Zumthor|Zumthor, Paul]]. “The Text and the Voice.” Transl. Marilyn C. Englehardt. New Literary History 16(1984):67–92&lt;/ref&gt; or the particularly well-studied &quot;hero on the beach&quot; theme&lt;ref&gt;Crowne, D.K. 'The Hero on the Beach: An Example of Composition by Theme in Anglo-Saxon Poetry', Neuphilologische Mitteilungen, 61 (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;) do exist across Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic works, some scholars conclude that Anglo-Saxon poetry is a mix of oral-formulaic and literate patterns, arguing that the poems both were composed on a word-by-word basis and followed larger formulae and patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Larry D. &quot;The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry&quot; Publications of the Modern Language Association 81 (1966):, 334–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Benson argued that the interpretation of ''Beowulf'' as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyze the poem in a unified manner, and with due attention to the poet’s creativity. Instead, he proposed that other pieces of Germanic literature contain &quot;kernels of tradition&quot; from which ''Beowulf'' borrows and expands upon.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Larry. &quot;The Originality of ''Beowulf''&quot; ''The Interpretation of Narrative.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1970. pp 1–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1985. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, Ann Watts published a book in which she argued against the imperfect application of traditional, Homeric, oral-formulaic theory to Anglo-Saxon poetry. She also argued that the two traditions are not comparable and should not be regarded as such.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Ann C. ''The Lyre and the Harp: A Comparative Reconsideration of Oral Tradition in Homer and Old English Epic Poetry''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1969. p. 124, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, in a paper published four years later which argued that the ''Beowulf'' text is of too varied a nature to be completely constructed from formulae and themes.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Thomas. &quot;How Free Was the ''Beowulf'' Poet?&quot; ''Modern Philology.'' 1973. p. 111-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Miles Foley]] held, specifically with reference to the ''Beowulf'' debate,&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 109 f.&lt;/ref&gt; that while comparative work was both necessary and valid, it must be conducted with a view to the particularities of a given tradition; Foley argued with a view to developments of oral traditional theory that do not assume, or depend upon, finally unverifiable assumptions about composition, and that discard the oral/literate dichotomy focused on composition in favor of a more fluid continuum of traditionality and textuality.&lt;ref&gt;Bäuml, Franz H. &quot;Varieties and Consequences of Medieval Literacy and Illiteracy&quot;, in Speculum, Vol. 55, No. 2 (1980), pp.243–244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, Eric Alfred.

Marilyn C. Englehardt. ''New Literary History'' 16(1984):67–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in the view of Ursula Schaefer, the question of whether the poem was &quot;oral&quot; or &quot;literate&quot; becomes something of a [[red herring]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Ursula. Vokalitat: Altenglische Dichtung zwischen Mundlichkeit und Schriftlichkeit, ScriptOralia 39 (Tubingen: Gunter Narr Verlag, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the poem is created, and is interpretable, within both noetic horizons. Schaefer’s concept of &quot;vocality&quot; offers neither a compromise nor a synthesis of the views which see the poem as on the one hand Germanic, pagan, and oral and on the other Latin-derived, Christian, and literate, but, as stated by Monika Otter: &quot;...a 'tertium quid', a modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has a logic and aesthetic of its own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Dialect===
{{Old English topics}}
The poem mixes the [[West Saxon]] and [[Anglian dialects]] of Old English, though it predominantly uses West Saxon, as do other Old English poems copied at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

There is a bewildering array of linguistic forms in the Beowulf manuscript. It is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that Beowulf has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt; The poem retains a complicated mix of the following dialectical forms: [[Mercian]], [[Northumbrian]], Early West Saxon, Kentish and Late West Saxon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt; Kiernan argues that it is virtually impossible that there could have been a process of transmission which could have sustained the complicated mix of forms from dialect to dialect, from generation to generation, and from scribe to scribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt;

Kiernan’s argument against an early dating based on a mixture of forms is long and involved, but he concludes that the mixture of forms points to a comparatively straightforward history of the written text as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... an 11th-century MS; an 11th-century Mercian poet using an archaic poetic dialect; and 11th-century standard literary dialect that contained early and late, cross-dialectical forms, and admitted spelling variations; and (perhaps) two 11th-century scribes following slightly different spelling practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to this view, Beowulf can largely be seen to be the product of antiquarian interests and that it tells readers more about &quot;an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon’s notions about Denmark, and its pre-history, than it does about the age of [[Bede]] and a 7th- or 8th-century Anglo-Saxon’s notions about his ancestors’ homeland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiernan2&quot;/&gt;
There are in Beowulf rather more than thirty-one hundred distinct words, and almost thirteen hundred occur exclusively, or almost exclusively, in this poem and in the other poetical texts. Considerably more than one-third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are in round numbers three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in Beowulf, and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ''ge''-(reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ''ge''-, are simple nouns. at the highest reckoning not more than one-fourth is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie Girvan. Beowulf and the Seventh Century Language and Content. Methuen &amp; Company Ltd. # New Feller Lane: Lodon EC4. 1971. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form and metre==
An Old English poem such as ''Beowulf'' is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used [[alliterative verse]], a form of [[poetry|verse]] that uses [[alliteration]] as the principal structuring device to unify lines of poetry, as opposed to other devices such as [[rhyme]]. This is a technique in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through similarity in initial sound. In addition, the two halves are divided by a [[caesura]]: &quot;Oft '''Sc'''yld '''Sc'''efing \\ '''sc'''eaþena þreatum&quot; (l. 4).

The poet has a choice of [[epithets]] or formulae to use in order to fulfill the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced the same way as they are in modern English. The letter &quot;h&quot;, for example, is always pronounced (Hroðgar: HROTH-gar), and the digraph &quot;cg&quot; is pronounced like &quot;dj&quot;, as in the word &quot;edge&quot;. Both f and s vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern v and z, respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern f in &quot;fat&quot; and s in &quot;sat&quot;. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, þ, and eth, ð&amp;nbsp;— representing both pronunciations of modern English &quot;th&quot;, as in &quot;cloth&quot; and &quot;clothe&quot;&amp;nbsp;— are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of f and s. Both are voiced (as in &quot;clothe&quot;) between other voiced sounds: oðer, laþleas, suþern. Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in &quot;cloth&quot;): þunor, suð, soþfæst.

[[Kenning]]s are also a significant technique in ''Beowulf.'' They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the &quot;swan-road&quot; or the &quot;whale-road&quot;; a king might be called a &quot;ring-giver.&quot; There are many kennings in ''Beowulf'', and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of [[elision|elided]] [[metaphor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Beowulf.&quot; ''Norton Anthology of English Literature''. ed. Stephen Greenblatt. 8th Edition. pp 29–33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] argued that the poem is an [[elegy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolkien&quot; /&gt;

==Interpretation and criticism==
In historical terms, the poem's characters would have been [[Norse paganism|Norse pagans]] (the historical events of the poem took place before the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]]), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had largely converted from their native [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] around the 7th century&amp;nbsp;— both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of [[Germanic paganism]]. ''Beowulf'' thus depicts a [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] warrior society, in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance. [[M. H. Abrams]] and [[Stephen Greenblatt]] note that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although Hrothgar and Beowulf are portrayed as morally upright and enlightened Pagans, they fully espouse and frequently affirm the values of Germanic heroic poetry. In the poetry depicting warrior society, the most important of human relationships was that which existed between the warrior&amp;nbsp;— the [[Thegn|thane]] – and his lord, a relationship based less on subordination of one man's will to another's than on mutual trust and respect. When a warrior vowed loyalty to his lord, he became not so much his servant as his voluntary companion, one who would take pride in defending him and fighting in his wars. In return, the lord was expected to take care of his thanes and to reward them richly for their valor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton30&quot;&gt;

This society was strongly defined in terms of [[kinship]]; if someone was killed, it was the duty of surviving [[Family|kin]] to exact revenge either with their own lives or through [[weregild]], a payment of reparation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton30&quot;/&gt;

Stanley B. Greenfield (professor of English, [[University of Oregon]]) has suggested that references to the human body throughout ''Beowulf'' emphasize the relative position of thanes to their lord. He argues that the term “shoulder-companion” could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord ([[Hrothgar]]). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new &quot;arm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Stanley. (1989) ''Hero and Exile.'' London: Hambleton Press, 59&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Greenfield argues, the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with [[Unferth]] (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unferth is described as “at the king’s feet” (line 499). Unferth is also a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and “generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action.” &lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Stanley. (1989) ''Hero and Exile.'' London: Hambleton Press, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Richard North (professor of English, University College London) argues that the ''Beowulf'' poet interpreted &quot;[[Norse mythology|Danish myths]] in [[Christian]] form&quot; (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: &quot;As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of ''Beowulf'' liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given [...] that [[Anglo-Saxons]] saw the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] as '[[heathen]]s' rather than as foreigners.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;North&quot;&gt;Richard North, &quot;''The King's Soul: Danish Mythology in Beowulf'',&quot; in the ''Origins of Beowulf: From Vergil to Wiglaf'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 195&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Grendel]] are described as descendants of [[Cain]], a fact which some scholars link to [[The Cain Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, David:&quot;Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory. University of Toronto Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a very slow and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager (Professor of literature, [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]]) notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
That the scribes of Cotton Vitellius A.XV were Christian is beyond doubt; and it is equally certain that Beowulf was composed in a Christianized England, since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries. Yet the only Biblical references in Beowulf are to the Old Testament, and Christ is never mentioned. The poem is set in pagan times, and none of the characters is demonstrably Christian. In fact, when we are told what anyone in the poem believes, we learn that they are pagans. Beowulf’s own beliefs are not expressed explicitly. He offers eloquent prayers to a higher power, addressing himself to the “Father Almighty” or the “Wielder of All.” Were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the Christians subsequently appropriated? Or, did the poem’s author intend to see Beowulf as a Christian Ur-hero, symbolically refulgent with Christian virtues?&lt;ref name=&quot;nhum&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last = Yeager |first= Robert F. | publisher = National Endowment For The Humanities | accessdate=2007-10-02 | url = http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-03/yeager.html |title = Why Read Beowulf?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writer [[E. Talbot Donaldson]] seemed extremely certain in his criticism of the poem, focusing on the exact age and locational elements that surrounded the poem itself. He claimed that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago during the first half of the eighth century. Donaldson also believes the writer to be a native of what was then West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth century manuscript &quot;which alone preserves the poem&quot; originated in the kingdom of the [[West Saxons]] – as it is more commonly known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuso, F. Joseph 1975&quot;&gt;*Tuso, F. Joseph. &quot;Beowulf: The Donaldson Translation Backgrounds and Sources Criticism.&quot; Norton and Company; New York, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the 1731 fire that seriously damaged the manuscript, Donaldson claims that several lines and words have been lost from the poem. Concerning language, Donaldson argues that the reason as to why Beowulf is difficult to connect with is because there have been numerous transcriptions starting from the poem's composition up until it was copied into manuscript form. Even though there has been many debates about whether there are Christian entities present within the poem, Donaldson is certain that &quot;the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and...poem reflects a Christian tradition&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuso, F. Joseph 1975&quot;/&gt; He points out the use of God and his recognized will as well as describing Grendel as a descendant of Cain. He also mentions the inclusion of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] in the poem as the dead await God's judgement while the damned such as Grendel and his mother are to be thrust into the flames of Hell.

The author and Merton professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[Oxford University]] [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] criticized his contemporaries' own literary criticism of the poem as being confused by their interest in its historical implications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolkien&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tolkien | first = J.

'''''Blazing Saddles'''''  is a 1974 [[satire|satirical]] [[Western film|Western]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Mel Brooks]]. Starring [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Gene Wilder]], the film was written by Brooks, [[Andrew Bergman]], [[Richard Pryor]], Norman Steinberg, and Al Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 Director and Leading Actors]&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was nominated for three [[Academy Award]]s, and is ranked No. 6 on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs]] list.

Brooks appears in multiple supporting roles, including Governor William J. [[Le Pétomane|Le Petomane]] and a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking Indian chief. The supporting cast also includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]], [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]], and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader  [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself.

The film satirizes the [[racism]] obscured by myth-making [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] accounts of the [[American Old West|American West]], with the hero being a [[African American|black]] sheriff in a mostly white town.  The film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from a [[jazz]] band in the Wild West to a rustler referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' to [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[camel]]s.

==Plot==
In the [[American Old West]] of 1874, construction on a new railroad runs into [[quicksand]]. The route has to be changed, which will require it to go through Rock Ridge, a [[frontier|frontier town]] where everyone has the last name of &quot;Johnson&quot; (including a &quot;[[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson]]&quot;, a &quot;[[Dr. Samuel Johnson]]&quot;, a &quot;[[Van Johnson]]&quot; and an &quot;[[Olsen and Johnson|Olson N. Johnson]]&quot;.) The conniving State [[Attorney General]] Hedley [[Hedy Lamarr|Lamarr]] ([[Harvey Korman]]) wants to buy the land along the new railroad route cheaply by driving the townspeople out. He sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart ([[Slim Pickens]]), to scare them away, prompting the townsfolk to demand that Governor William J. LePetomane ([[Mel Brooks]]) appoint a new [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]]. The Attorney General convinces the dim-witted LePetomane to select Bart ([[Cleavon Little]]), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged for hitting Taggart in the head with a shovel. Lamarr believes a black lawman will so offend the townspeople that they will either abandon the town or [[lynching|lynch]] the new sheriff.

With his quick wits and the assistance of [[alcoholism|drunken]] [[gunslinger]] Jim ([[Gene Wilder]]), also known as &quot;The Waco Kid&quot; (&quot;I must have killed more men than [[Cecil B. DeMille]]&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;blzngsddlsqts&quot;&gt;[http://www.garnersclassics.com/qblazing.htm Quotes from ''Blazing Saddles'' (1974) &amp;ndash; GarnersClassics.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; Bart works to overcome the townsfolk's hostile reception. He defeats and befriends Mongo ([[Alex Karras]]), an immensely strong (but exceptionally dim-witted) henchman sent by Taggart to kill Bart, and beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp ([[Madeline Kahn]]) at her own game. He inspires the town to lure and defeat Lamarr's newly recruited and diverse army of thugs (which Lamarr characterized as ideally consisting of &quot;rustlers, cutthroats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperadoes, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, half-wits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, hornswagglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers, shit kickers - and [[Methodism|Methodists]]&quot;).  In a scene where Lamarr hires his villains, the candidates include [[outlaw motorcycle club|bikers]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], banditos, [[Crusades|crusaders]], Nazis and [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansmen]].

The resulting fight between the townsfolk and Lamarr's army of thugs breaks the [[fourth wall]]; the fight spills out from the Warner Bros. film lot into a neighboring musical set (being directed by [[Dom DeLuise]]), then into the studio [[Refectory|commissary]], where a pie fight ensues, and finally pouring out into the surrounding streets.

The film ends with Bart shooting Lamarr in the groin at the 'premiere' of ''Blazing Saddles'' outside [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], saving the town, and joining Jim inside the theater to view the end of the movie, persuading people of all colors and creeds to live in harmony and, finally, riding (in a [[limousine]]) off into the sunset.

;Notes
* [[Count Basie]] appears as himself in a cameo, with his band, which plays &quot;[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]&quot;.
* Mel Brooks also appears in a cameo as one of Hedley Lamarr's toughs, wearing sunglasses and a [[bomber jacket]]. He also dubbed the voice for one of the [[Germany|German]] chorus boys backing Madeline Kahn's performance of &quot;I'm Tired&quot;, speaking lines such as &quot;Give her a break!&quot;, &quot;She's not a snake&quot; and, &quot;Don't you know she's pooped?!&quot;

==Production==
In the DVD commentary, Brooks explains that the original title of the film, ''Tex X'' (as in the name of Black Muslim leader [[Malcolm X]]), was rejected, along with ''Black Bart'' and  ''Purple Sage''. Finally, Brooks concocted the title ''Blazing Saddles'' while taking a shower.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/dvd/review/2001/05/08/blazing/ 2001 Review], mostly of Brooks's [[audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary]], from [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blazing Saddles'' was Brooks' first film shot in [[anamorphic format]]. To date, this film and ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' are the only Brooks films in this format.

Brooks had repeated conflicts with studio executives over the cast and content. They objected to both the highly provocative script and to the &quot;irregular&quot; activities of the writers (particularly Richard Pryor, who reportedly led all-night writing jams where loud music and drugs played a prominent role). Brooks wanted Pryor to play the sheriff, but Warner executives expressed concern over Pryor's reliability because of his heavy drug use and the belief that he was mentally unstable.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;/&gt; In a similar vein, Gene Wilder was the second choice to play the Waco Kid. He was quickly brought in to replace [[Gig Young]] after the first day of filming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949574/bio IMDb Biography for Gig Young]&lt;/ref&gt;

After screening the movie, the head of Warner Bros. complained about the use of the word &quot;[[nigger]]&quot;, a flatulent campfire scene and Mongo punching a horse, and told Brooks to remove these elements. As Brooks' contract gave him control of the final cut, the complaints were disregarded and the elements remained. The only element removed was a scene in which Lili tried to seduce Bart in the dark, prompting him to quip, &quot;That's my arm you're sucking&quot;.

Brooks wanted the movie's title song to reflect the western genre, and advertised in the trade papers for a &quot;[[Frankie Laine]]-type&quot; sound. Several days later, Laine himself visited Brooks' office to offer his services. Brooks had not told Laine that the movie was a comedy: &quot;'Frankie sang his heart out... and we didn't have the heart to tell him it was a spoof&amp;nbsp;— we just said, 'Oh, great!'. He never heard the whip cracks; we put those in later.  We got so lucky with his serious interpretation of the song.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;libretto&quot;&gt;From the libretto of the La-LaLand Records soundtrack album&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview included in the DVD release of ''Blazing Saddles'', Brooks claimed that [[Hedy Lamarr]] threatened to sue, saying the film's running &quot;Hedley Lamarr&quot; joke infringed her right to publicity. This is lampooned when Hedley corrects Governor Le Petomane's pronunciation of his name, and Le Petomane replies with &quot;What the hell are you worried about? This is 1874, you'll be able to sue ''her!&quot;''. Brooks says he and the actress settled out of court for a small sum. In the same interview, Brooks related how he managed to convince [[John Wayne]] to read the script after meeting him in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio commissary.  Wayne was impressed with the script, but politely declined a cameo, fearing it was &quot;too dirty&quot; for his family image.  He is also said to have told Brooks that he &quot;would be first in line to see the film, though&quot;.

==Influences==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
The plot (i.e. thwarting a ruthless scheming land-grabber) was a spoof of countless Western movies and cliches, including ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''.

The film, town, and many of the scenes, music, and themes in ''Blazing Saddles'' were parodies of the classic [[Gary Cooper]] film ''[[High Noon]]''. The church scene in particular was imitated down to the costumes and 'murmuring' of the townsfolk. Brooks' ''The Ballad Of Rock Ridge'' uses motifs and melodies that echo [[The Ballad of High Noon|&quot;Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'&quot;]], performed by [[Tex Ritter]].

Madeline Kahn's role, Lili Von Shtupp, is a parody of [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s Frenchie in the 1939 western film ''Destry Rides Again'', while &quot;I'm Tired&quot; is a parody of Dietrich's &quot;[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)]]&quot;, a song written by [[Frederick Hollander]] for ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930). 'Shtup' is a [[Yiddish]] verb meaning &quot;to stuff, poke, or fill&quot; but which is commonly used as a vulgarism best translated into English as &quot;to fuck&quot; (and which is considered as crude in polite society as its English counterpart). (When broadcast on television, Lili's last name is usually changed to &quot;Shhhhhh...&quot; to avoid use of the vulgarism, but is still written normally on the title card.)

Some references to Mel Brooks' first film ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' include the  playing of &quot;[[Springtime for Hitler]]&quot; before the introduction of Lili von Shtupp, Governor Le Petomane's echoes of [[Max Bialystock]]'s line &quot;Hello Boys!&quot; and the use of the theme from &quot;The French Mistake&quot; when Hedley Lamarr and others escape the movie studio lot after breaking the [[fourth wall]].

The scene under Hedley Lamarr's office window involving Boris, the [[Quasimodo]]-like hangman, is used again in a larger fashion in Brooks' 1993 comedy, ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'' with [[Robert Ridgely]] reprising his role.

The extensions to the [[ISO 9660]] standard for [[Unix]] [[Filesystem]] attributes are named as [[Rock Ridge]] extensions after the movie's town.

==Reception==
While the film is widely considered a classic comedy today, critical reaction was mixed when the film was first released.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[Vincent Canby]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=BLAZING%20SADDLES%20(MOVIE) Review of ''Blazing Saddles''] by [[Vincent Canby]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|“''Blazing Saddles'' has no dominant personality, and it looks as if it includes every gag thought up in every story conference. Whether good, bad, or mild, nothing was thrown out.  [[Woody Allen|Mr. [Woody] Allen's]] comedy, though very much a product of our Age of Analysis, recalls the wonder and discipline of people like [[Buster Keaton|Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]]. Mr. Brooks's sights are lower. His brashness is rare, but his use of anachronism and anarchy recalls not the great film comedies of the past, but the middling ones like the Hope-Crosby [[Road to...|&quot;Road&quot; pictures]]. With his talent he should do much better than that.”}}

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars and called it a &quot;crazed grabbag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a [[rubber chicken]]. Mostly, it succeeds. It's an audience picture; it doesn't have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course! What does that matter while Alex Karras is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19740207/REVIEWS/401010306/1023|title=Blazing Saddles | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film grossed $119.5 million in the box office becoming only the tenth film in history up to that point to pass the $100 million mark.&lt;ref&gt;http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=blazingsaddles.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a certified &quot;fresh&quot; rating of 89%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blazing_saddles/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In the scene where Lamarr addresses his band of bad guys, he says, &quot;You men are only risking your lives, while I am risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]!&quot; Harvey Korman did not, in fact, get an Oscar nod, but the film did receive three other [[Academy Award]]s nominations in 1974: [[Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] for [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Academy Award for Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music, Original Song]]. The film also nabbed two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] awards nominations, for [[BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer|Best Newcomer]] ([[Cleavon Little]]) and [[BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].

The film won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for &quot;[[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen]]&quot; for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/awards Awards for Blazing Saddles (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''Blazing Saddles'' was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/awards&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[film critic]] [[Dave Kehr]] queried if the historical significance of ''Blazing Saddles'' lay in the fact that it was the first film from a major [[major film studios|studio]] to have a [[fart]] joke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://davekehr.com/?p=148 National Film Registry Announces New Titles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===TV pilot===
A [[television pilot]] was produced for CBS based on [[Andrew Bergman]]'s initial story, titled ''Black Bart,''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0121113|Black Bart}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the original title of the film. It featured [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Bart and [[Steve Landesberg]] as the drunk sidekick. Mel Brooks had little if anything to do with the pilot, as writer Andrew Bergman is listed as the sole creator. The pilot did not sell, but CBS aired it once on April 4, 1975. It was later included as a bonus feature on the ''Blazing Saddles'' 30th Anniversary DVD and the [[Blu-ray]] disc.

===Musical adaptation===
With the production of musical adaptations of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'', rumors spread about a possible adaptation of ''Blazing Saddles''. Brooks joked about the concept in the final number in ''Young Frankenstein'', in which the full company sings, &quot;next year, ''Blazing Saddles''!&quot; In 2010, Mel Brooks confirmed this, saying that the musical could be finished within a year. No creative team or plan has been announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/137884-Back-on-the-Horse-Mel-Brooks-Penning-Songs-for-Blazing-Saddles- Back on the Horse: Mel Brooks Penning Songs for Blazing Saddles Musical]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
After nearly 35 years, the first-ever official, studio-licensed release, in any format, of the full music soundtrack to ''Blazing Saddles'' came out from [[La-La Land Records]] on August 26, 2008. Remastered from original studio vault elements, this Limited Edition CD features the classic songs from the film as well as composer [[John Morris]]' score.  Bonus tracks on the album include special instrumental versions of all the songs, and the disc features exclusive liner notes featuring comments from Mel Brooks and John Morris. It has been released as a &quot;limited edition&quot; of 3,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lalalandrecords.com/BlazingSaddles.html ''Blazing Saddles'' press release at La-La Land Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Bruce Sterling''' (born April 14, 1954) is an American [[science fiction author]], best known for his novels and his work on the ''[[Mirrorshades (book)|Mirrorshades]]'' anthology, which helped define the [[cyberpunk]] genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;egs&quot;&gt;[http://www.egs.edu/faculty/bruce-sterling/biography/ Bruce Sterling] faculty page at [[European Graduate School]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Sterling is, along with [[William Gibson]], [[Rudy Rucker]], [[John Shirley]], [[Lewis Shiner]], and [[Pat Cadigan]], one of the founders of the cyberpunk movement in science fiction, as well as its chief [[ideological]] promulgator, and one whose [[polemic]]s on the topic earned him the nickname &quot;Chairman Bruce&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Nisi Shawl |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2008758249_br22sterling.html |title=Books &amp;#124; &quot;The Caryatids&quot;: four clones need a home &amp;#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the first organizers of the [[Turkey City Writer's Workshop]], and is a frequent attendee at the [[Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop]]. He won [[Hugo Award]]s for his novelettes ''[[Bicycle Repairman]]'' and ''[[Taklamakan (story)|Taklamakan]]''.

His first novel, ''Involution Ocean'', published in 1977, features the world Nullaqua where all the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is contained in a single, miles-deep [[Impact crater|crater]]; the story concerns a ship sailing on the [[ocean]] of dust at the bottom, which hunts creatures called dustwhales that live beneath the surface. It is partially a science-fictional [[pastiche]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]].

From the late 1970s onwards, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the [[Shaper/Mechanist universe]]: the [[solar system]] is colonised, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do [[genetic engineering]] on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[civilization]]s; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that many of these effectively vanish from the [[galaxy]], reminiscent of [[Technological singularity|The Singularity]] in the works of [[Vernor Vinge]]. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collection ''Crystal Express'' and the collection ''Schismatrix Plus'', which contains the original novel ''Schismatrix'' and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. [[Alastair Reynolds]] identified ''Schismatrix'' and the other Shaper/Mechanist stories as one of the greatest influences on his own work.&lt;ref name=&quot;ar&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Bruce Sterling at ARE 2010.jpg|thumb|Bruce Sterling at the 2010 [[Augmented Reality Event]]]]

In the 1980s, Sterling edited the science fiction critical [[fanzine]] [[Cheap Truth]], under the alias of Vincent Omniaveritas. He wrote a column called ''[[Catscan (magazine column)|Catscan]]'', for the now-defunct science fiction critical magazine, [[SF Eye]].

He recently contributed a chapter to ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'' (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. [[DJ Spooky]].

From April 2009 through May 2009, he was an editor at [[Cool Tools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/003672.php |title=Cool Tools: New Editor, Same Deal |publisher=Kk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2003/10/hello_world/ |title=HELLO WORLD &amp;#124; Beyond The Beyond |publisher=Wired.com |date=2003-10-30 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling has blogged at [http://blog.wired.com/sterling/ &quot;Beyond the Beyond&quot;], which is hosted by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.

===Projects===
He has been the instigator of three projects which can be found on the Web -
* The [[Dead Media Project]] - A collection of &quot;research notes&quot; on dead media technologies, from [[Inca]]n [[quipu]]s, through Victorian [[phenakistoscope]]s, to the departed [[video game]] and home computers of the 1980s. The Project's homepage, including Sterling's original ''Dead Media Manifesto'' can be found at http://www.deadmedia.org
* The [[Viridian Design Movement]] - his attempt to create a &quot;green&quot; design movement focused on high-tech, stylish, and ecologically sound design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigpicture.tv/index.php?id=83&amp;cat=&amp;a=224&lt;/ref&gt; The Viridian Design home page, including Sterling's ''Viridian Manifesto'' and all of his ''Viridian Notes'', is managed by [[Jon Lebkowsky]] at http://www.viridiandesign.org. The Viridian Movement helped to spawn the popular &quot;bright green&quot; environmental weblog [[Worldchanging]]. WorldChanging contributors include many of the original members of the Viridian &quot;curia&quot;.
* Embrace the Decay - a web-only art piece commissioned by the LA Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moca.org/museum/dg_detail.php?&amp;dgDetail=bsterling&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating contributions solicited through The Viridian Design 'movement', Embrace the Decay was the most visited piece/page at LA MOCA's Digital Gallery, and included contributions from Jared Tarbell of [http://www.levitated.net/ levitated.net] and co-author of several books on advanced Flash programming, and Monty Zukowski, creator of the winning 'decay algorithm' sponsored by Bruce.

===Neologisms===
Sterling has a habit of coining [[neologisms]] to describe things which he believes will be common in the future, especially items which already exist in limited numbers.
* In the December 2005 issue of Wired magazine, Sterling coined the term buckyjunk. Buckyjunk refers to future, difficult-to-recycle consumer waste made of carbon nanotubes (aka buckytubes, based on buckyballs or [[fullerene|buckminsterfullerene]]).
* In July 1989, in ''SF Eye #5'', he was the first to use the word &quot;[[slipstream (genre)|slipstream]]&quot; to refer to a type of speculative fiction between traditional science fiction and fantasy and mainstream literature.
* In December 1999 he coined the term &quot;Wexelblat disaster&quot;, for a disaster caused when a natural disaster triggers a secondary, and more damaging, failure of human technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/101-125/00120.html |title=Viridian Note 00120: Viridian Disasters (Storms in France) |publisher=Viridiandesign.org |date=1999-12-27 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2004 he suggested a type of technological device (he called it &quot;[[spime]]&quot;) that, through pervasive [[RFID]] and [[GPS]] tracking, can track its history of use and interact with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/401-450/00422_the_spime.html |title=Viridian Note |publisher=Viridiandesign.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the speech where he offered &quot;spime&quot;, he noted that the term &quot;[[blobject]]&quot;, with which he is sometimes credited, was passed on to him by industrial designer [[Karim Rashid]]. The term may originally have been coined by [[Steven Skov Holt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/julaug/features/curve.html |title=STANFORD Magazine: July/August 2005 &gt; Thrown a Curve |publisher=Stanfordalumni.org |date=2003-07-02 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brain abscess''' (or cerebral abscess) is an [[abscess]] caused by inflammation and collection of infected material, coming from local (ear infection, [[dental abscess]], infection of [[paranasal sinus]]es, infection of the [[mastoid]] air cells of the temporal bone, [[epidural abscess]]) or remote ([[Human lung|lung]], [[Human heart|heart]], [[kidney]] etc.) infectious sources, within the [[human brain|brain]] tissue. The infection may also be introduced through a skull fracture following a [[head trauma]] or surgical procedures. Brain abscess is usually associated with [[congenital heart disease]] in young children. It may occur at any age but is most frequent in the third decade of life.

==Features==
The symptoms of brain abscess are caused by a combination of increased [[intracranial pressure]] due to a space-occupying lesion (headache, vomiting, confusion, [[coma]]), infection (fever, fatigue etc.) and focal neurologic brain tissue damage ([[hemiparesis]], [[aphasia]] etc.). The most frequent presenting symptoms are headache, drowsiness, [[mental confusion|confusion]], [[seizure]]s, [[hemiparesis]] or speech difficulties together with fever with a rapidly progressive course. The symptoms and findings depend largely on the specific location of the abscess in the brain. An abscess in the cerebellum, for instance, may cause additional complaints as a result of [[brain stem]] compression and [[hydrocephalus]]. [[Neurological examination]] may reveal a stiff neck in occasional cases (erroneously suggesting meningitis). The famous triad of fever, headache and focal neurologic findings are highly suggestive of brain abscess.

==Pathophysiology==
===Bacterial===
Anaerobic and microaerophilic cocci and gram-negative and gram-positive [[anaerobic infection|anaerobic]] bacilli are the predominate bacterial isolates. Many brain abscesses are polymicrobical. The predominant organisms include: [[Staphylococcus aureus]], aerobic and anaerobic streptococci (especially [[Streptococcus intermedius]]), [[Bacteroides]], [[Prevotella]], and [[Fusobacterium]] species, Enterobacteriaceae, [[Pseudomonas]] species, and other anaerobes.&lt;ref&gt;Brook I. Microbiology and antimicrobial treatment of orbital and intracranial complications of sinusitis in children and their management.  Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2009;73:1183-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Less common organisma include: ''Haemophillus influenzae'', ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' and ''Neisseria meningitides''.&lt;ref&gt;Brook I. Brain abscess in children: microbiology and management.  J Child Neurol. 1995;10:283-8&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bacterial abscesses rarely (if ever) arise ''de novo'' within the brain, although establishing a cause can be difficult in many cases.  There is almost always a primary lesion elsewhere in the body that must be sought assiduously, because failure to treat the primary lesion will result in relapse.  In cases of trauma, for example in compound skull fractures where fragments of bone are pushed into the substance of the brain, the cause of the abscess is obvious.  Similarly, bullets and other foreign bodies may become sources of infection if left in place.  The location of the primary lesion may be suggested by the location of the abscess: infections of the middle ear result in lesions in the [[middle cranial fossa|middle]] and [[posterior cranial fossa|posterior]] cranial fossae;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Macewan W | year=1893 | title=Pyogenic Infective Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord | location=Glasgow | publisher=James Maclehose and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[congenital heart disease]] with right-to-left shunts often result in abscesses in the distribution of the [[middle cerebral artery]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ingraham FD, Matson DD | title=Neurosurgery of Infancy andChildhood | location=Springfield, Ill | publisher=Charles C Thomas | year=1954 | pages=377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Raimondi AJ, Matsumoto S, Miller RA | title=Brain abscess in children with congenital heart disease | journal=J Neurosurg | volume=23 | pages=588&amp;ndash;95 | year=1965 | doi=10.3171/jns.1965.23.6.0588 | pmid=5861142 | issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and infection of the [[frontal sinus|frontal]] and [[ethmoid sinus|ethmoid]] sinuses usually results in collection in the subdural sinuses.

===Other organisms===
[[fungus|Fungi]] and [[parasite]]s may also cause the disease. Fungi and parasites are especially associated with immunocompromised patients. Other causes include: [[Nocardia asteroides]], ''Mycobacterium'', Fungi (e.g., [[Aspergillus]], [[Candida (fungus)|Candida]], [[Cryptococcus]], Mucorales, ''Coccidioides'', [[Histoplasma capsulatum]], [[Blastomyces dermatitidis]], Bipolaris, Exophiala dermatitidis, [[Curvularia pallescens]], Ochroconis gallopava, Ramichloridium mackenziei), Protozoa (e.g., [[Toxoplasma gondii]], [[Entamoeba histolytica]], [[Trypanosoma cruzi]], [[Schistosoma]], Paragonimus), Helminths (e.g., Taenia solium), [[Toxoplasma gondii]], and [[Pseudallescheria boydii]].Organisms that are most frequently associated with brain abscess in patients with [[AIDS]] are [[poliovirus]], ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', though in infection with the latter organism, symptoms of [[meningitis]] generally predominate.

These organisms are associated with certain predisposing conditions: 
Sinus and dental infections - Aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Bacteroides), Fusobacterium, S aureus, and Enterobacteriaceae; Penetrating trauma - S aureus, aerobic streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Clostridium spp. Pulmonary infections - Aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Bacteroides), Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, and  Nocardia. Congenital heart disease - Aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, and S aureus. HIV infection - T gondii, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Cryptococcus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Transplantation - Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mucorales, Nocardia, and T gondii. Neutropenia - Aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucorales.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Brain Abscess at MRI (T1 + contrast) -- showing a small ring-enhancing lesion with mild surrounding edema adjacent to the ventricular catheter and ventricular dilatation..jpg|300px|thumb|MRI (T1 with contrast) showing the ring-enhancing lesion. From a rare case report of an abscess formed as a complication of the CSF shunt. Jamjoom et al., 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;jamjoom09&quot;/&gt;]]
The diagnosis is established by a [[computed tomography]] (CT) (with contrast) examination. At the initial phase of the inflammation (which is referred to as [[cerebrit]]is), the immature lesion does not have a capsule and it may be difficult to distinguish it from other space-occupying lesions or infarcts of the brain.  Within 4–5 days the inflammation and the concomitant dead brain tissue are surrounded with a capsule, which gives the lesion the famous [[ring-enhancing lesion]] appearance on CT examination with contrast (since intravenously applied contrast material can not pass through the capsule, it is collected around the lesion and looks as a ring surrounding the relatively dark lesion). [[Lumbar puncture]] procedure, which is performed in many infectious disorders of the central nervous system is contraindicated in this condition (as it is in all space-occupying lesions of the brain) because removing a certain portion of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] may alter the concrete intracranial pressure balances and causes the brain tissue to move across structures within the skull ([[brain herniation]]).

Ring enhancement may also be observed in cerebral hemorrhages (bleeding) and some brain [[tumor]]s. However, in the presence of the rapidly progressive course with fever, focal neurologic findings (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.) and signs of increased intracranial pressure, the most likely diagnosis should be the brain abscess.

==Treatment==
The treatment includes lowering the increased intracranial pressure and starting intravenous [[antibiotic]]s (and meanwhile identifying the causative organism mainly by blood culture studies).

Surgical drainage of the abscess remains part of the standard management of bacterial brain abscesses.  The location and treatment of the primary lesion also crucial, as is the removal of any foreign material (bone, dirt, bullets, and so forth).

There are few exceptions to this rule: [[Haemophilus influenzae]] meningitis is often associated with subdural effusions that are mistaken for subdural empyemas.  These effusions resolve with antibiotics and require no surgical treatment.  [[Tuberculosis]] can produce brain abscesses that look identical to conventional bacterial abscesses on CT imaging. Surgical drainage or aspiration is often necessary to identify ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', but once the diagnosis is made no further surgical intervention is necessary.

==Prognosis==
It was once fatal before the [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] era, now, if the abscess is treated before the person goes into a coma, then the death rate has been estimated from 5% to 20% although it is greater in cases of multiple abscesses, when  raised intracranial pressure is observed and depending on the level of neurological dysfunction on presentation. Early treatment and the patients overall health has an effect on prognosis. Other factors include: antibiotic resistance or the abscess location. An abscess deep within the brain is more difficult to treat than others.

'''Bud Spencer''' (born '''Carlo Pedersoli''' on 31 October 1929) is an  [[Italy|Italian]] actor, filmmaker and former swimmer (he was the first Italian to swim 100m in less than a minute). He is known for past roles in [[spaghetti western]]s together with his long time filmpartner [[Terence Hill]]. Growing from a successful swimmer in his youth, he got a degree in law, and has registered several patents.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0817881/bio Bud Spencer on imdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Spencer was born in [[Borgo Santa Lucia|Santa Lucia]], a historical [[rione]] of the city of [[Naples]]. He married [[Maria Amato]] in 1960, with whom he had three children: Giuseppe (1961), Christine (1962) and Diamante (1972). He changed his screen name in 1967 reportedly chosen to pay homage to [[Spencer Tracy]] as well as his favorite beer, [[Budweiser Budvar Brewery|Budweiser]]. Other sources report that he found it funny to call himself &quot;bud&quot; despite his weight and his height at 1.94  m.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

===Swimming and water polo career===
A successful swimmer in his youth, Spencer was the first Italian to swim the 100 m [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] in less than one minute. He achieved this on 19 September 1950, when he swam the 100 m in 59.5 s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgendaDiana Salsomaggiore&quot;&gt;[http://www.agendadiana.com/visualizza_gara.php?id_gara=5789 Italian swimming records]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1951 Mediterranean Games]], he won a silver medal in the same 100m freestyle event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agendadiana.com/visualizza_gara.php?id_gara=8211 Mediterranean Games, 1951]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Spencer participated in the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], reaching the semi-finals in the 100 m freestyle (58.8 s heats, 58.9 s semi final).&lt;ref name=&quot;Helsinki 1952&quot;&gt;[http://www.aafla.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1952/OR1952.pdf Helsinki 1952 official report]&lt;/ref&gt; [[1956 Summer Olympics|Four years later]], in [[Melbourne]], he also entered the semi-finals in the same category (58.5 s heat, 59.0 s semi final).&lt;ref name=&quot;Melbourne 1956&quot;&gt;[http://www.aafla.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1956/OR1956.pdf Melbourne 1956 official report]&lt;/ref&gt; As a water polo player, he won the Italian Championship in 1954, with [[S.S. Lazio]]. His swimming career ended abruptly in 1957.

On 17 January 2005 he was awarded with the ''Caimano d'oro'' (Gold Caiman) by the [[Italian Swimming Federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedersoli award&quot;&gt;[http://www.federnuoto.it/federazione.asp?p=articolo&amp;id=5758 Pedersoli receives the Gold Caiman {{it icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 24 January 2007, he received from the Italian Swimming Federation's president [[Paolo Barelli]], swim and water polo coach diplomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedersoli diploma&quot;&gt;[http://www.federnuoto.it/federazione.asp?p=articolo&amp;id=11340 Pedersoli receives two coach diplomas {{it icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting career===
Spencer's first movie role was that of a member of the [[Praetorian]] guard in ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', a film shot in [[Italy]], in 1951.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; During the 1950s and part of the 1960s, Spencer appeared in some Italian films but &quot;his career was strictly minor league until the late 1960s.&quot;&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

Spencer met [[Terence Hill]], with whom he made a large number of [[Italian Western]]s and other films together, including (named using their most common US titles):

#''Hannibal'' (1959)
#''[[God Forgives... I Don't!]]'' (1967)
#''[[Ace High (1968 film)|Ace High]]'' (1968)
#''[[Boot Hill (film)|Boot Hill]]'' (1969)
#''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'' (1970)
#''[[Blackie the Pirate]]'' (1971)
#''[[Trinity Is Still My Name]]'' (1971)
#''[[All the Way, Boys]]'' (1972)
#''[[Watch Out, We're Mad]]'' (1974)
#''[[Two Missionaries]]'' (1975)
#''[[Crime Busters]]'' (1976)
#''[[Odds and Evens (film)|Odds and Evens]]'' (1978)
#''[[I'm For the Hippopotamus]]'' (1979)
#''[[Who Finds a Friend Finds a Treasure]]'' (1981)
#''[[Go For It!]]'' (1983)
#''[[Double Trouble (1984 film)|Double Trouble]]'' (1984)
#''[[Miami Supercops]]'' (1985)
#''[[Troublemakers (film)|Troublemakers]]'' (1994)

Films with Spencer in solo performance include:
#''[[The Five Man Army]]'' (1969)
#''[[It Can Be Done Amigo]]'' (1972)
#''[[Piedone, the cop]]'' (1973)
#''[[They Call Him Bulldozer]]'' (1978)
#''[[The Sheriff and the Satellite Kid]]'' (1979)
#''[[Everything Happens to Me (1980 film)|Everything Happens to Me]]'' (1980)
#''[[Banana Joe (film)|Banana Joe]]'' (1982)
#''[[Superfantagenio]]'' (1986)

Many of these have alternate titles, depending upon the country and distributor. Some have longer Italian versions that were edited for release abroad.  These films gathered popularity for both actors, especially in Europe.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; Practically all of Spencer's roles have him playing an omnipotent buffoon castigating  cretinous henchmen in  hysterical ways.

The main dubber of Bud Spencer in Italy is [[Glauco Onorato]] who, with his characteristic voice, successfully enriched the character of Bud Spencer with many particularities. In some movies the dubber is [[Sergio Fiorentini]] ([[Botte di Natale]], [[Al limite]] and the series of [[Detective Extralarge]]). In the movie [[Oggi a te domani a me]] the dubber is [[Ferruccio Amendola]]

Spencer also wrote the complete or partial [[screenplay]] for some of his movies. His fan base is particularly large in [[Europe]]. His feature film career slowed down after 1983, shifting more toward television. In the 1990s, he acted in the TV action-drama &quot;[[Extralarge]]&quot;.

===Personal life===
After appearing in ''Più forte, ragazzi!'', Spencer became a jet airplane and helicopter pilot.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; He established [[Mistral Air]] in 1984, an air-mail company that also transports pilgrims, but later sold it to [[Poste Italiane]] to buy a textile mill that produced clothes for children.

===Career in politics===
In 2005, Pedersoli entered politics, unsuccessfully standing as regional counselor in [[Lazio]] for the [[Forza Italia]] party. Spencer has stated: &quot;In my life, I've done everything. There are only three things I haven't been - a ballet dancer, a jockey and a politician. Given that the first two jobs are out of the question, I'll throw myself into politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; The opposition criticised him for engaging in &quot;politica spettacolo&quot; (&quot;showbiz politics&quot;).&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

'''Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/brigitte_bardot |title=Films and Music by Brigitte Bardot |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycelebrations.com/092800.htm |title=Daily Celebrations ~ Brigitte Bardot, Cat Transformed ~ 25 August ~ Ideas to motivate, educate, and inspire |publisher=Dailycelebrations.com |date= |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|bʁiʒit baʁdo}}, {{IPA-en|ˈbrɪdʒɨt bɑrˈdoʊ|lang}}; born 28 September 1934) is a French former [[model (person)|fashion model]], actress and singer, and animal rights activist.

In her early life, Bardot was an aspiring ballet dancer. She started her acting career in 1952 and, after appearing in 16 films, became world-famous due to her role in her then-husband [[Roger Vadim]]'s controversial film ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]''. She later starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s 1963 cult film, ''[[Contempt (film)|Contempt]]''. She was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress]] for her role in [[Louis Malle]]'s 1965 film, ''[[Viva Maria!]]''.

She caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s 1959 essay, ''The Lolita Syndrome'', which described Bardot as a &quot;locomotive of women's history&quot; and built upon [[existentialist]] themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France.&lt;ref name=guardot/&gt;

Bardot retired from the [[entertainment industry]] in 1973. During her career in [[show business]] Bardot starred in 47 films, performed in numerous musical shows, and recorded 80 songs. She was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]] in 1985 but refused to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-how-does-the-french-honours-system-work-and-why-has-kylie-been-decorated-822752.html The Big Question: How does the French honours system work, and why has Kylie been decorated?] The Independent. 8 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After her retirement, Bardot established herself as an [[animal rights]] activist. During the 1990s, she became controversial due to her criticism of immigration, [[Islamization]] and [[Islam in France]], and has been fined five times for &quot;[[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;race fine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bardot fine for stoking race hate|date=3 June 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434193.stm|accessdate=3 June 2008|publisher=BBC News  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bardot fined for racist remarks|date=16 June 2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/793390.stm|accessdate=4 June 2008|publisher=BBC News  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Brigitte Bardot was born in Paris to Anne-Marie 'Toty' Mucel (1912–1978) and Louis 'Pilou' Bardot (1896–1975). Her father had an engineering degree and worked with his own father in the family business. Toty was sixteen years younger and they married in 1933. She grew up in a middle-class Roman Catholic family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/sep/27/profile-brigitte-bardot-and-god-created-bardot/|title=Profile: Brigitte Bardot – And God created Bardot|publisher=[[Sunday Tribune]]|date=27 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2010|first=Valerie|last=Shanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigitte's mother enrolled her and her younger sister Marie-Jean ('Mijanou', born 5 May 1938) in dance. Mijanou eventually gave up dancing lessons to complete her education, whereas Brigitte decided to concentrate on a ballet career. In 1947, Bardot was accepted to [[Conservatoire de Paris|The National Superior Conservatory of Paris for Music and Dance]] and for three years attended the ballet classes of Russian choreographer Boris Knyazev. (One of her classmates was [[Leslie Caron]]; fellow ballerinas nicknamed Bardot: Bichette [Little Doe]).&lt;ref&gt;Caron, Leslie (2009), Thank Heaven, Plume Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; By the invitation of her mother's acquaintance, she modeled in a fashion show in 1949. In the same year, she modeled for a fashion magazine &quot;''Jardin des Modes''&quot; managed by journalist Hélène Lazareff. She appeared on an 8 March 1950 cover of [[ELLE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/830:112/1/Brigitte_Bardot.htm |title=Brigitte Bardot Biography |publisher=The Biography Channel |date= |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was noticed by a young film director, [[Roger Vadim]], while babysitting. He showed an issue of the magazine to director and screenwriter [[Marc Allégret]] who offered Bardot the opportunity to audition for &quot;''Les lauriers sont coupés''&quot; thereafter. Although Bardot got the role, the shooting of the film was cancelled but it made her consider becoming an actress. Moreover, her acquaintance with Vadim, who attended the audition, influenced her further life and career.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt;

==Career==

Although the [[European cinema|European film industry]] was then in its ascendancy, Bardot was one of the few European actresses to have the mass media's attention in the United States.

Brigitte Bardot debuted in a 1952 [[comedy film]] ''Le Trou Normand'' (English title: ''Crazy for Love''). In the same year she married Roger Vadim. From 1952 to 1956 she appeared in seventeen films; in 1953 playing a part in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s [[stageplay]] &quot;''L'Invitation au château''&quot; (&quot;''The Invitation to the Castle''&quot;). She received media attention when she attended the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in April 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt;

Her films of the early and mid 1950s were generally lightweight romantic dramas, some of them historical, in which she was cast as [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingénue]] or [[siren]], often in varying states of undress. She played [[bit part]]s in three English-language films, the British comedy ''[[Doctor at Sea (film)|Doctor at Sea]]'' (1955) with [[Dirk Bogarde]], ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'' (1954), in which she was understudy for the [[Helen of Troy|title role]] but only appears as Helen's handmaid, and ''Act of Love'' (1954) with [[Kirk Douglas]]. Her French-language films were dubbed for international release.

Roger Vadim was not content with this light fare. The [[French New Wave|New Wave]] of [[French cinema|French]] and [[Italian cinema|Italian]] art directors and their stars were riding high internationally, and he felt Bardot was being undersold. Looking for something more like an art film to push her as a serious actress, he showcased her in ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]'' (1956) with [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]]. The film, about an immoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was an international success.

There was a popular claim that Bardot did more for the French international trade balance than the entire French car industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt;

In Bardot's early career, professional photographer Sam Levin's photos contributed to her image of sensuality. One of Levin's pictures shows Brigitte from behind, dressed in a white corset.

[[British people|British]] photographer [[Cornel Lucas]] made iconic images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s that have become representative of her public persona.

She divorced Vadim in 1957 and in 1959 married actor [[Jacques Charrier]], with whom she starred in ''[[Babette Goes to War]]'' in 1959. The paparazzi preyed upon her marriage, while she and her husband clashed over the direction of her career. Her films became more substantial, but this brought pressure of dual celebrity as she sought critical acclaim while remaining a glamour model for most of the world.

''[[A Very Private Affair|Vie privée]]'' (1960), directed by [[Louis Malle]] has more than an element of her life story in it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The scene in which, returning to her apartment, Bardot's character is harangued in the elevator by a middle-aged cleaning lady calling her offensive names, was based on an actual incident, and is a resonant image of celebrity in the mid-20th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Bardot was awarded a [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Award]] for Best Foreign actress for the role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000003/awards Awards for Brigitte Bardot] IMDB. Retrieved on 21 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, Bardot withdrew to the seclusion of [[Southern France]] where she had bought the house ''La Madrague'' in [[Saint-Tropez]] in May 1958.

In 1963, she starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s critically acclaimed film ''[[Contempt (film)|Contempt]]''.

Brigitte Bardot was featured in many other films along with notable actors such as [[Alain Delon]] (''Famous Love Affairs'', ''[[Spirits of the Dead]]''), [[Jean Gabin]] (''[[In Case of Adversity]]''), [[Sean Connery]] (''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]''), [[Jean Marais]] (''[[Royal Affairs in Versailles]]'', ''School for Love''), [[Lino Ventura]] (''Rum Runners''), [[Annie Girardot]] (''The Novices''), [[Claudia Cardinale]] (''[[The Legend of Frenchie King]]''), [[Jeanne Moreau]] (''[[Viva Maria!]]''), [[Jane Birkin]] (''[[Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman]]'').

In 1973, Bardot announced that she was retiring from acting at the age of 39 as &quot;a way to get out elegantly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Modesto Bee-7 June 1973&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Brigitte Bardot Gives Up Films At Age Of 39 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-EpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AYEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3388%2C1836097 |agency=UPI |newspaper=The Modesto Bee |publisher=|location=Modesto, California |date=7 June 1973 |page=A-8 |accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She participated in various musical shows and recorded many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly in collaboration with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], Bob Zagury and [[Sacha Distel]], including &quot;Harley Davidson&quot;, &quot;Je Me Donne A Qui Me Plait&quot;, &quot;Bubble gum&quot;, &quot;Contact&quot;, &quot;Je Reviendrais Toujours Vers Toi&quot;, &quot;L'Appareil A Sous&quot;, &quot;La Madrague&quot;, &quot;On Demenage&quot;, &quot;Sidonie&quot;, &quot;Tu Veux, Ou Tu Veux Pas?&quot;, &quot;Le Soleil De Ma Vie&quot; (the cover of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s &quot;[[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]&quot;) and the notorious &quot;[[Je t'aime... moi non plus]]&quot;. Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release this duet and he complied with her wishes; the following year he re-recorded a version with [[British people|British]]-born model and actress [[Jane Birkin]], which became a massive hit all over Europe. The version with Bardot was issued in 1986 and became a popular download hit in 2006 when [[Universal Records]] made their back catalogue available to purchase online, with this version of the song ranking as the third most popular download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6058742.stm|title=Bardot revived as download star|date=17 October 2006|work=BBC News |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 21 December 1952, at the age of 18, Bardot was married to director [[Roger Vadim]]. In order to receive permission from Bardot's parents to marry her, Vadim, originally an [[Orthodox Christian]], was urged to convert to Catholicism. They divorced five years later, but remained friends and collaborated in later work. Bardot had an affair with her co-star in ''And God Created Woman'', [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] (married at the time to French actress [[Stephane Audran]]), followed by her divorce from Vadim.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Brigitte|last=Bardot| title=Initiales B.B.|publisher=[[Grasset &amp; Fasquelle]] | year=1996 | isbn=2-246-52601-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Jeffrey Robinson{{!}}Robinson, Jeffrey]] | title=Bardot&amp;nbsp;— Two Lives| publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] (London)|First British Edition| year=1994 | id=ASIN: B000KK1LBM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two lived together for about two years. Their relationship was complicated by Trintignant's frequent absence due to [[military service]] and Bardot's affair with musician [[Gilbert Bécaud]], and they eventually separated.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;

The 9 February 1958 edition of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported on the front page that Bardot was recovering in Italy from a reported nervous breakdown. A suicide attempt with sleeping pills two days earlier was denied by her public relations manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblog&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 1959, she married actor Jacques Charrier, by whom she had her only child, a son, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier (born 11 January 1960). After she and Charrier divorced in 1962, Nicolas was raised in the Charrier family and did not maintain close contact with Bardot until his adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;

Bardot's other husbands were German millionaire playboy [[Gunter Sachs]] (14 July 1966&amp;nbsp;– 1 October 1969) and Bernard d'Ormale (16 August 1992&amp;nbsp;– present). She is reputed to have had relationships with many other men including pop singer [[Mike Sarne]] a few days after her honeymoon with Sachs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8503379/Gunter-Sachs.html&lt;/ref&gt; her ''[[La Vérité (film)|La Vérité]]'' co-star [[Sami Frey]], musicians [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[Sacha Distel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt; In the late 1950s, she shared an exchange she considered ''la croisée de deux sillages'' (&quot;the crossing of two wakes&quot;) with actor and true crime author [[John Gilmore (writer)|John Gilmore]], then an actor in France who was working on a New Wave film with [[Jean Seberg]]. Gilmore told ''[[Paris Match]]'': 'I felt a beautiful warmth with Bardot but found it difficult to discuss things in any depth whatsoever.' In the 1970s, she lived with the sculptor Miroslav Brozek and posed for some of his sculptures.

In 1974, Bardot appeared in a nude photo shoot in the Italian edition of [[Playboy]] magazine, which celebrated her 40th birthday.

==Animal welfare activism==
In 1973, just before her fortieth birthday, Bardot announced her retirement. After appearing in more than forty motion pictures and recording several music albums, most notably with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], she chose to use her fame to promote [[animal rights]].

In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals.&lt;ref name=foundationhistory&gt;

In August 2010, she addressed a letter to the Danish Queen, [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] appealing for the sovereign to halt the [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands|killing of dolphins]] in the [[Faroe Islands]]. In the letter, Bardot describes the activity as a &quot;macabre spectacle&quot; that &quot;is a shame for Denmark and the Faroe Islands.&quot; She continued: &quot;This is not a hunt but a mass slaughter&quot; and also described it as an &quot;outmoded tradition that has no acceptable justification in today's world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hp3_Cignx_N58PNXB4Qirma6ofdQ Brigitte Bardot pleads to Denmark in dolphin 'slaughter'] AFP. 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2011, French culture minister Frédéric Mitterrand officially inscribed bullfighting on a list enumerating the country's cultural heritage, a decision which Bardot is currently publicly contesting. &quot;French culture is a culture of enlightenment and has nothing to do with bloody things like bullfighting,&quot; she wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37567/animal-lover-brigitte-bardot-lowers-her-horns-as-french-culture-ministry-embraces-bullfighting/ Animal Lover Brigitte Bardot Lowers Her Horns as French Culture Ministry Embraces Bullfighting] ARTINFO.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book she wrote in 1999, called &quot;Le Carré de Pluton&quot; (Pluto's Square), Bardot criticizes the procedure used in the [[ritual slaughter]] of sheep during the Muslim festival of [[Eid al-Adha]]. Additionally, in a section in the book entitled, ''Open Letter to My Lost France'', Bardot writes: &quot;...my country, France, my homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims.&quot;. For this comment, a French court fined her 30,000 [[franc]]s in June 2000. She had previously been fined in 1997 for the original publication of this open letter in [[Le Figaro]] and again 1998 for making similar remarks.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/793390.stm |title=Bardot fined for racist remarks |publisher=BBC News  |date=16 June 2000 |accessdate=13 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC News Bardot racism conviction upheld|date=11 May 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1324707.stm|accessdate=17 January 2008|publisher=BBC News  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bardot anti-Muslim comments draw fire |date=14 May 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3027955.stm|accessdate=17 January 2008|publisher=BBC News  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2003 book, ''Un cri dans le silence'' (&quot;''A Scream in the Silence''&quot;), she warned of an “[[Islamicization]] of France”, and said of Muslim immigration:
{{quote|Over the last twenty years, we have given in to a subterranean, dangerous, and uncontrolled infiltration, which not only resists adjusting to our laws and customs but which will, as the years pass, attempt to impose its own.|&lt;ref name=&quot;Orland&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Brigitte Bardot's Cry In The Silence|date=2 September 2003|url=http://vdare.com/misc/orland_silence.htm|accessdate=14 January 2008|publisher=By David Orland}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In May 2003, the [[MRAP (French NGO)|Movement Against Racism and for Friendship between Peoples]] (MRAP) announced they were going to sue Bardot for the comments.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The &quot;[[Human Rights League (French-speaking Belgium)|Ligue des droits de l'homme]]&quot; ([[Human Rights League (French-speaking Belgium)|Human Rights League]]) announced they were considering similar legal proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc4&quot;/&gt;

In the book, she also made comparisons of her close gay friends to today's homosexuals who, &quot;jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly [[heterosexuality|heteros]] put them through&quot; and that some contemporary homosexuals behave like &quot;fairground freaks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/may/15/france.davidhearst|title= Anti-gay, anti-Islam Bardot to be sued|last=Webster|first=Paul|coauthors=David Hearst|date=5 May 2003|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=3 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her own defence, Bardot wrote in a letter to a French gay magazine, saying, &quot;Apart from my husband—who maybe will cross over one day as well—I am entirely surrounded by homos.

On 10 June 2004, Bardot was again convicted by a French court for &quot;inciting racial hatred&quot; and fined €5,000, the fourth such conviction/fine the French courts gave her.&lt;ref name=&quot;indybay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Larent |first=Shermy |url=http://www.indybay.org/news/2003/05/1610376.php |title=Brigitte Bardot unleashes colourful diatribe against Muslims and modern France |publisher=Indybay |date=12 May 2003 |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardot denied the racial hatred charge and apologized in court, saying: &quot;I never knowingly wanted to hurt anybody.

In 2008, she was once more convicted of inciting racial/religious hatred in relation to a letter she wrote, a copy of which she sent to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] when he was [[Interior Minister of France]]. The letter stated her objections to Muslims in France [[Dhabihah|ritually slaughtering sheep]] by slitting their throats without anesthetizing them first but also expressed that she was &quot;fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its habits&quot; in reference to Muslims.

The prosecutor stated that she was tired of charging Bardot with offences related to racial hatred.&lt;ref name = &quot;race fine&quot;/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]] she branded the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] vice-presidential candidate, [[Sarah Palin]] a &quot;disgrace to women&quot;. She criticized the former governor of [[Alaska]] for her stance on [[global warming]] and [[gun control]]. She was also offended by Palin's support for Arctic oil exploration and for her lack of consideration in protecting [[polar bears]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/sarah-palin/3158058/Brigitte-Bardot-calls-Sarah-Palin-a-disgrace-to-women.html Brigitte Bardot calls Sarah Palin a 'disgrace to women'] The Telegraph. 8 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 2010, she lashed out at director [[Kyle Newman]] regarding his plans on making a biographical film on her life. Her response was, &quot;Wait until I'm dead before you make a movie about my life!&quot;. Bardot even warned Newman that if the project progresses &quot;sparks will fly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spy210115&quot;&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Bb buzios.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Brigitte Bardot in [[Armação dos Búzios|Buzios]], Brazil]]
In fashion the Bardot neckline (a wide open neck that exposes both shoulders) is named after her. Bardot popularized this style which is especially used for knitted sweaters or jumpers although it is also used for other tops and dresses.

Bardot is recognized for popularizing [[bikini]] swimwear in early films such as ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini|Manina]]'' (''Woman without a Veil'', 1952), in her appearances at [[Cannes]] and in many photo shoots.

Bardot also brought into fashion the ''[[choucroute]]'' (&quot;Sauerkraut&quot;) hairstyle (a sort of [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hair style]]) and [[gingham]] clothes after wearing a checkered pink dress, designed by Jacques Esterel, at her wedding to Charrier.&lt;ref name=femstyle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femminastyle.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=9 |title=Style Icon : Brigitte Bardot |publisher=Femminastyle.com |date= |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the subject for an [[Andy Warhol]] painting.

In addition to popularizing the bikini swimming suit, Bardot has also been credited with popularizing the city of [[St. Tropez]] and the town of [[Armação dos Búzios|Buzios, Brazil]], which she visited in 1964 with her boyfriend at the time, Brazilian musician [[Bob Zagury]].&lt;ref name=buzios&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buziosonline.com.br/indexe.htm |title=BuziosOnline., Character and stories.

Bardot was idolized by young [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MilesPage69&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Barry Miles{{!}}Miles, Barry]] | title=[[Many Years From Now]] | publisher=[[Vintage (publisher)|Vintage]]–[[Random House]] | year=1998 | isbn=0-7493-8658-4}} p69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp171&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Bob Spitz{{!}}Spitz, Bob]] | title=The Beatles: The Biography| publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] (New York)| year=2005 | isbn=1-84513-160-6}} p171&lt;/ref&gt; They made plans to shoot a film featuring [[The Beatles]] and Bardot, similar to ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', but the plans were never fulfilled.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt; Lennon's first wife [[Cynthia Powell]] lightened her hair color to more closely resemble Bardot, while [[George Harrison]] made comparisons between Bardot and his first wife [[Pattie Boyd]], as Cynthia wrote later in ''A Twist of Lennon''. Lennon and Bardot met in person once, in 1968 at the Mayfair Hotel, introduced by Beatles press agent [[Derek Taylor]]; a nervous Lennon took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] before arriving, and neither star impressed the other. (Lennon recalled in a memoir, &quot;I was on acid, and she was on her way out.&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;LennonPage24&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=[[John Lennon{{!}}Lennon, John]] | title=[[Skywriting by Word of Mouth]] | publisher=[[Harper Collins]] | year=1986 | isbn=0060156562}} p24&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the liner notes of his first (self-titled) album, musician [[Bob Dylan]] dedicated the first song he ever wrote to Bardot. He also mentioned her by name in &quot;I Shall Be Free&quot;, which appeared on his second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]''.

She dabbled in pop music and played the role of a [[glamour model]]. In 1965, she appeared as herself in the Hollywood production ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965) starring [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]].

In 1970, the sculptor [[Aslan (pin up)|Alain Gourdon]] used Bardot as the model for a bust of [[Marianne]], the French national emblem.

In 2007, she was named among ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's 100 Sexiest Film Stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=98 Empireonline.com]. Retrieved 19 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-ever official exhibition looking at Bardot's influence and legacy opened in Paris on 29 September 2009 – a day after her 75th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connexionfrance.com/expatriate-news-article.php?art=375 Brigitte Bardot at 75: the exhibition] The Connexion&amp;nbsp;— The Newspaper for English speakers on France, Connexion edition: September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''banjo''' is a [[stringed instrument]] with, typically, four or five strings, which vibrate a [[membrane]] of plastic material or animal hide stretched over a circular frame. Simpler forms of the instrument were fashioned by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] [[Africa]]ns in [[Colonial America]], adapted from several African instruments of the same basic design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibma.org/about.bluegrass/history/index.asp Bluegrass Music: The Roots].&quot; [[International Bluegrass Music Association|IBMA]]. Retrieved on 2006-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The banjo is usually associated with [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], [[classical music]], [[Irish traditional music]] and [[bluegrass music]]. Historically, the banjo occupied a central place in [[African American music|African traditional music]], before becoming popular in the [[minstrel show]]s of the 19th century.  In fact, blacks influenced early development of the music that became country and bluegrass, through the introduction of the banjo and through the innovation of musical techniques for both the banjo and fiddle.&lt;ref&gt;Winship, David.[http://www.birthplaceofcountrymusic.org/index.cgi?CONTEXT=cat&amp;cat=10043 &quot;The African American Music Tradition in Country Music].&quot; BCMA, Birthplace of Country Music Alliance.

Recently, the banjo has enjoyed inclusion in a wide variety of musical genres, including pop crossover music, [[indie rock]] and [[Celtic punk]].

There are several theories concerning the origin of the name ''banjo''. It may derive from the [[Kimbundu]] term ''mbanza''. Some [[etymologist]]s believe it comes from a [[dialect]]al pronunciation of the Portuguese &quot;[[bandora (instrument)|bandore]]&quot; or from an early anglicisation of the Spanish word &quot;[[bandurria]]&quot;, though other research suggests that it may come from a [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]]n term for a [[bamboo]] stick formerly used for the instrument's neck.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Various instruments are known in [[Africa]] with a skin head and gourd (or similar shell) body.&lt;ref name=&quot;myspace.com&quot;&gt;Pestcoe, Shlomoe and Adams, Greg C., ''Banjo Roots Research: Exploring the Banjo’s African American Origins &amp; West African Heritage'', 2010. Essay can be found online at [http://www.myspace.com/banjoroots/blog].&lt;/ref&gt; The African instruments differ from early [[Afro American]] banjos in that the necks do not possess a Western-style fingerboard and tuning pegs, instead having stick necks, with strings attached to the neck with loops for tuning.&lt;ref name=&quot;myspace.com&quot;/&gt; Banjos with fingerboards and tuning pegs are known from the Caribbean as early as the 17th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Pestcoe, Shlomoe and Adams, Greg C., ''Banjo Roots Research: Exploring the Banjo’s African American Origins &amp; West African Heritage'', 2010.

Essay can be found online at [http://www.myspace.com/banjoroots/blog].&lt;/ref&gt; 18th and early 19th century writers transcribed the name of these instruments variously as &quot;bangie&quot;, &quot;banza&quot;, &quot;banjer&quot; and &quot;banjar&quot;. Instruments similar to the banjo (e.g., the Japanese ''[[shamisen]]'', Persian ''[[Tar (lute)|tar]]'' and Morroccan ''[[sintir]]'') have been played in many countries.  Another likely ancestor of the banjo is the ''[[akonting]]'', a spike folk lute played by the [[Jola people|Jola tribe]] of [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]], and the ''ubaw-akwala'' of the [[Ibo people|Igbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Murder at Montpelier: Ibo Africans in Virginia |first=Douglas B. |last=Chambers |publisher=Univ.

Early, African-influenced banjos were built around a [[gourd]] body and a wooden stick neck. These instruments had varying numbers of strings, though often including some form of drone. The five-string banjo was popularized by [[Joel Walker Sweeney]], an American [[minstrel show|minstrel]] performer from [[Appomattox Court House]], [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Metro Voloshin, ''The Banjo, from Its Roots to the Ragtime Era: An Essay and Bibliography'' Music Reference Services Quarterly, Vol. 6(3) 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s Sweeney became the first white man to play the banjo on stage{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. His version of the instrument replaced the gourd with a drum-like sound box and included four full-length strings alongside a short fifth-string. There is no proof, however, that Sweeney invented either innovation. This new banjo came to be tuned g'cgbd'. This is not quite a straight [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of the e'aeg#b' tuning of the banjar; the B string of the banjo has the lowest pitch (a straight transposition would be g'c'gbd'.) Banjos were introduced in Britain by Sweeney's group, the American [[Virginia Minstrels]], in the 1840s, and became very popular in music halls.&lt;ref name=Zither&gt;[http://www.shlomomusic.com/zitherbanjo.htm Information on the banjo and development of the Zither-banjo].&lt;/ref&gt;

== The modern banjo ==
The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a [[guitar]], has gained popularity. In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast [[arpeggiated]] plucking, though there are many different playing styles.

The body, or &quot;pot&quot;, of a modern banjo typically consists of a circular rim (generally made of wood, though metal was also common on older banjos) and a tensioned head, similar to a drum head. Traditionally the head was made from animal skin, but today is often made of various synthetic materials. Most modern banjos also have a metal &quot;tone ring&quot; assembly that helps further clarify and project the sound, however many older banjos did not include a tone ring

The banjo is usually tuned with friction [[tuning peg]]s or [[planetary gear]] tuners, rather than the [[worm gear]] [[machine head]] used on guitars. Frets have become standard since the late 19th century, though fretless banjos are still manufactured and played by those wishing to execute [[glissando]] or otherwise achieve the sound and feeling of early playing styles.

Modern banjos are typically strung with metal strings. Usually the fourth string is [[Strings_(music)#Winding|wound]] with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. Some players may string their banjos with nylon or gut strings to achieve a more mellow, old-time tone.

=== Open-back and resonator ===
Some banjos have a separate resonator plate on the back of the pot, designed to project the sound forward and give the instrument more volume. This type of banjo is usually used in [[bluegrass music]], though resonator banjos are played by players of all styles, and are also used in old-time as a substitute for electric amplification when playing in large venues.

Open-back banjos generally have a mellower tone and weigh less than resonator banjos. They usually have a different setup than a resonator banjo, often with a higher string action (string action refers to how high the strings are positioned above the fingerboard.)

== Five-string banjo == &lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect &quot;[[Five-string banjo]]&quot; --&gt;
[[Image:Adrienne Young's banjo.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Typical Banjo.]]

The modern 5-string banjo is a variation on Sweeney's original design. The fifth string is usually the same gauge as the first, but starts from the fifth fret, three quarters the length of the other strings. (The long-necked Vega [[Pete Seeger]] model starts the fifth string from the eighth fret.)  This lets the string be tuned to a higher open pitch than possible for the full-length strings. The short fifth string means that, unlike many string instruments, strings pitches on a five string banjo do not go in order from lowest to highest across the fingerboard. Instead, from low to high, they go fourth, third, second, first, and fifth. This is a form of [[reentrant tuning]].

The short fifth string presents special problems for a [[capo]]. For small changes (going up or down one or two semitones, for example) it is possible simply to re-tune the fifth string. Otherwise, various devices called ''fifth string capos'' can effectively shorten the string. Many banjo players use model railroad spikes or titanium spikes (usually installed at the seventh fret and sometimes at others), that they hook the string under to press it down on the [[fret]].

[[Image:Banjo range.png|thumb|right|Range of five-string banjo tuned g'cgbd'.]]

Many tunings are used for the five-string banjo. Probably the most common, particularly in bluegrass, is the Open-G tuning g'dgbd'. In earlier times, the tuning g'cgbd' was commonly used instead. Other tunings found in old-time music include double C (g'cgc'd'), &quot;sawmill&quot; (g'dgc'd') also called &quot;mountain modal&quot; and open D (f#'df#ad'.) These tunings are often taken up a tone, either by tuning up or using a [[capo]]. For example &quot;old-time D&quot; tuning (a'dad'e') - commonly reached by tuning up from double C - is often played to accompany fiddle tunes in the key of D and Open-A (a'eac#'e') is usually used for playing tunes in the key of A.

While the size of the five string banjo is largely standardized, smaller and larger sizes are available including the long-neck or ''Seeger neck'' variation designed by [[Pete Seeger]]. Petite variations on the 5-string banjo have been available since the 1890s. S.S. Stewart introduced the [[banjeaurine]], tuned one fourth above a standard five-string. Piccolo banjos are smaller, and tuned one octave above a standard banjo. Between these sizes and the standard there is the A-scale banjo, which is two frets shorter and usually tuned one full step above standard tunings. A &quot;Stealth&quot; brand banjo is a modern 5 string banjo with a 22.5&quot; scale length, similar to a guitar.

[[Image:Woman plays banjo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A five-string banjo.]]

American [[old-time music]] typically uses the five-string open back banjo. It is played in a number of different styles, the most common being [[clawhammer]] or frailing, characterized by the use of a downward rather than upward motion when striking the strings with a fingernail. Frailing techniques use the thumb to catch the fifth string for a [[drone (music)|drone]] after each strum or twice in each action (&quot;double thumbing&quot;), or to pick out additional melody notes in what is known as &quot;drop-thumb.&quot; [[Pete Seeger]] popularised a [[Folk music|folk]] style by combining clawhammer with &quot;up picking&quot;, usually without the use of [[fingerpick]]s. Another common style of old-time banjo playing is ''Fingerpicking banjo'' or ''classic banjo''. This style is based upon [[parlor-style guitar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trischka&quot;&gt;Trischka, Tony (1992). ''Banjo Songbook'', p.20. ISBN 0825601975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emphasis original.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Banjo forward roll on G major chord.mid|Play}}.]][[Bluegrass music]], which uses the five-string resonator banjo almost exclusively, is played in several common styles.  These include [[Scruggs style]], named after [[Earl Scruggs]]; melodic, or [[Keith style]], named for [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]]; and three-finger style with single string work, also called Reno style after [[Don Reno]]. In these styles the emphasis is on arpeggiated figures played in a continuous eighth-note rhythm, known as [[banjo roll|rolls]]. All of these styles are typically played with [[fingerpick]]s.

The five-string banjo has been used in classical music since before the turn of the 20th century. [[contemporary classical music|Contemporary and modern]] works have been written or arranged for the instrument by [[Béla Fleck]], [[Tony Trischka]], [[Steve Martin]], [http://www.timlake.com Tim Lake], [[George Crumb]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Jo Kondo]], [[Paul Elwood]], [[Hans Werner Henze]] (notably in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Henze)|Sixth Symphony]]), Daniel Mason of [[Hank Williams III]]'s Damn Band, [[Beck]], [[the Water Tower Bucket Boys]], [[J.P. Pickens]], Peggy Honeywell, [[Norfolk &amp; Western]], Putnam Smith, [[Iron &amp; Wine]], [[The Avett Brothers]], and [[Sufjan Stevens]].

The first 5-string electric solid-body banjo was developed by Charles (Buck) Wilburn Trent, Harold &quot;Shot&quot; Jackson, and David Jackson in 1960.

The '''plectrum banjo''' is a standard banjo without the short drone string. It usually has 22 frets on the neck and a scale length of 26 to 28&amp;nbsp;inches, and was originally tuned cgbd'. It can also be tuned like the top four strings of a guitar, which is known as &quot;Chicago tuning.&quot; As the name suggests, it is usually played with a guitar-style [[plectrum|pick]] (that is, a single one held between thumb and forefinger), unlike the five-string banjo, which is either played with a [[thumbpick]] and two fingerpicks, or with bare fingers. The plectrum banjo evolved out of the five-string banjo, to cater to styles of music involving strummed chords. The plectrum is also featured in many early jazz recordings and arrangements.

[[Image:Item-it-250f-(irish-tenor)-1419 lg.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Irish tenor banjo from Gold Tone]]
The shorter-necked, '''tenor banjo''' is also typically played with a plectrum. It became a popular instrument after about 1910. Early models used for melodic picking typically had 17 frets on the neck and a scale length of 19½ to 21½&amp;nbsp;inches. By the mid-1920s, when the instrument was used primarily for strummed chordal accompaniment, 19-fret necks with a scale length of 21¾ to 23&amp;nbsp;inches became standard. The usual tuning is cgd'a', like a [[viola]] or [[mandola]], but some players (particularly in [[Irish traditional music]]) tune it Gdae′ like an [[octave mandolin]], which lets the banjoist duplicate fiddle and mandolin fingering. The invention and/or popularisation of this tuning is usually attributed to [[Barney McKenna]], banjoist with [[The Dubliners]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

The tenor banjo was a common rhythm instrument in early 20th-century dance bands. Its volume and timbre suited early jazz (and jazz-influenced popular music styles) and could both compete with other instruments (such as [[brass instruments]] and [[saxophone]]s) and be heard clearly on acoustic recordings. [[George Gershwin]]'s [[Rhapsody in Blue]], in [[Ferde Grofe]]'s original jazz orchestra arrangement, includes tenor banjo, with widely-spaced chords not easily playable on plectrum banjo in its conventional tuning(s). With development of the archtop and electric guitar, the tenor banjo largely disappeared from jazz and popular music, though keeping its place in traditional &quot;Dixieland&quot; jazz.

Rarer than either the tenor or plectrum banjo is the ''cello banjo''. It's normally tuned CGda, one octave below the tenor banjo like the cello and mandocello. It played a role in banjo orchestras in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Bass banjos have been produced in both upright bass formats and with standard, horizontally-carried banjo bodies.

Four-string banjos, both plectrum and tenor, can be used strictly for chordal accompaniment (as in early jazz), strictly for single string melody playing (as in Irish traditional music), in &quot;chord melody&quot; style (a succession of chords are played in which the highest notes carry the melody), in tremolo style (both on chords and single strings) and a mixed technique called duo style, which combines single string tremolo and rhythm chords. Fingerstyle opportunities of tenor banjo retuned to open G tuning dgd'g' or lower open D tuning Adad' (three finger picking, frailing) are explored by [[Mirek Patek]].

[[Eddie Peabody]] was the greatest proponent of the plectrum banjo in the early to mid twentieth century. [[Johnny Baier]], [[Bill Lowrey (musician)|Bill Lowrey]], Steve Peterson, and [[Buddy Wachter]] are prominent contemporary four-string banjoists currently working professionally. [[Harry Reser]], who also played plectrum banjo, was arguably the best tenor banjoist of the same era and wrote a large number of works for tenor banjo as well as instructional material. He was well known in the banjo player community up until his passing in 1965. His single string and &quot;chord melody&quot; technique and ability arguably set the &quot;high mark&quot; that many subsequent tenor players endeavor to attain. Other prominent professional tenor performers were [[Mike Pingitore]] and [[Roy Smeck]]. Smeck was an influential performer on many fretted instruments, including the four-string banjo.  He also wrote a number of solos and instructional books. Prominent contemporary tenor players are [[Don Vappie]], [[Ken Aoki]], [[Steve Di Bonaventura]], [[David Bandrowski]], the late [[Narvin Kimball]] of [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]] fame, and [[Charlie Tagawa]]. Tagawa has been the music director of the [[Peninsula Banjo Band]], one of the most prominent banjo bands in the U.S., since 1966. He was a student and devotee of Harry Reser. In the United Kingdom, [[Frank Lawes]] was one of the most prolific composers of four string banjo music.

The four-string banjo is used from time to time in musical theater. Examples include: [[Hello, Dolly!]], [[Mame]], [[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]], [[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]], [[Oklahoma!]], [[Half a Sixpence]], [[Annie]], [[Barnum]], [[The Threepenny Opera]], [[Monty Python's Spamalot]], and countless others. [[Joe Raposo]] had used it variably. in the imaginative 7-piece orchestration for the long-running TV show [[Sesame Street]], and has sometimes had it overdubbed with itself or an [[electric guitar]]. The banjo is still (albeit rarely) in use in the show's arrangement currently.

==Six-string banjos==
[[Image:Banjo.png|left|thumb|300px|Old 6-string zither banjo]]

The 6-string banjo began as a British innovation by William Temlet, one of England's earliest banjo makers. He opened a shop in London in 1846, and sold banjos with closed backs and up to 7 strings. He marketed these as &quot;zither&quot; Banjos from his 1869 patent. American Alfred Davis Cammeyer (1862–1949), a young violinist-turned banjo concert player, devised the 5/6-string Zither banjo around 1880. It had a wood resonator and metal &quot;wire&quot; strings (the 1st and 2nd melody strings and 5th &quot;thumb&quot; string. The 3rd melody string was gut and the 4th was silk covered) as well as frets and guitar-style tuning machines.

A Zither banjo usually has a closed back and sides with the drum body (usually metal) and skin tensioning system suspended inside the wooden rim/back, the neck and string tailpiece was mounted on the wooden outer rim, the short string usually led through a tube in the neck so that the tuning peg could be mounted on the peg head. They were often made by builders who used guitar tuners that came in banks of three and so if 5 stringed had a redundant tuner. The banjos could also be somewhat easily converted over to a six string banjo.  British [[opera]] diva [[Adelina Patti]] advised Cammeyer that the zither-banjo might be popular with English audiences (which was certainly true as it was invented there), and Cammeyer went to London in 1888. Due to his virtuoso playing he helped show that banjos could be used for more sophisticated music than was normally played by [[blackface]] minstrels, he was soon performing for London society, where he met Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]], who recommended that Cammeyer progress from writing banjo arrangements of music to composing his own music.  (Interesting to note that, supposedly unbeknownst to Cammeyer, William Temlett had patented a 7-string closed back banjo in 1869, and was already marketing it as a &quot;zither-banjo.&quot;)

In the late 1890s Banjo maker F.C Wilkes developed a 6-string version of the banjo with the 6th string &quot;tunnelled&quot; through the neck. It is arguable that Arthur O. Windsor had much influence in creating and perfecting the Zither banjo and creating the open-back banjo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zither-banjo.org/pages/windsornew.htm&lt;/ref&gt; along with other modifications to the banjo type instruments, such as the non-solid attached resonator that banjos' today have (Gibson lays claim to this modification on the American Continent). Windsor claims to be the first in creating the hollow neck banjo with a truss rod, and he buried the 5th string in the neck after the 5th fret so to put the tuning peg on the peg-head rather than in the neck. Gibson lays claim to perfecting the banjo with the tone rings.

The six-string or banjitar was the instrument of the early jazz great [[Johnny St. Cyr]], as well as of jazzmen [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Danny Barker]], [[Papa Charlie Jackson]] and [[Clancy Hayes]], as well as the blues and gospel singer The [[Reverend Gary Davis]]. Nowadays, it sometimes appears under such names as guitanjo, [[Guitjo (six-string)|guitjo]], ganjo, banjitar, or bantar.  Today, musicians as diverse as [[Keith Urban]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Taj Mahal]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[David Hidalgo]] and [[Doc Watson]] play the 6-String banjo.

Rhythm guitarist [[Dave Day]] of 1960's proto-punks [[The Monks]] replaced his guitar with a six-string, gut-strung banjo on which he played guitar chords. This instrument sounds much more metallic, scratchy and wiry than a standard electric guitar, due to its amplification via a small microphone stuck inside the banjo's body.

==Banjo hybrids and variants==
A number of hybrid instruments exist, crossing the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use the body of a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include  the [[Banjo Mandolin|banjo mandolin]], the [[Banjolin]], and the banjo [[ukulele]] or [[banjolele]], most famously played by the English comedian [[George Formby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4029395.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=George Formbys Little Strad banjolele up for sale | date=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were especially popular in the early decades of the twentieth century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric amplification.

Instruments using the five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, that of a [[bouzouki]] or [[dobro|resonator guitar]]) have also been made, such as the banjola. A 20th-Century [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] instrument very similar to the banjo is called [[cümbüs]].

'''Baseball''' is a [[bat-and-ball]] sport played between two teams of nine players each. The goal is to score [[run (baseball)|runs]] by hitting a thrown [[Baseball (ball)|ball]] with a [[baseball bat|bat]] and touching a series of four [[base (baseball)|bases]] arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot square, or diamond. Players on one team (the [[Baseball rules#Batting team|batting team]]) take turns hitting against the [[pitcher]] of the other team (the [[Baseball rules#Fielding team|fielding team]]), which tries to stop them from scoring runs by getting hitters [[out (baseball)|out]] in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammate's [[Hit (baseball)|hit]] or other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn at bat for each team constitutes an [[inning (baseball)|inning]] and nine innings make up a professional game. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.

Evolving from older bat-and-ball games, an early form of baseball was being played in England by the mid-eighteenth century. This game and the related [[rounders]] were brought by British and Irish immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version of baseball developed]]. By the late nineteenth century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. Baseball on the professional, amateur, and youth levels is now popular in North America, parts of Central and South America and the Caribbean, and parts of East Asia. The game is sometimes referred to as ''hardball'', in contrast to the derivative game of [[softball]].

In North America, professional [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams are divided into the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL). Each league has three divisions: East, West, and Central. Every year, the major league champion is determined by [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] that culminate in the [[World Series]]. Four teams make the playoffs from each league: the three regular season division winners, plus one [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] team. Baseball is the leading team sport in both Japan and Cuba, and the top level of play is similarly split between two leagues: Japan's [[Central League]] and [[Pacific League]]; Cuba's [[Cuban National Series|West League and East League]]. In the National and Central leagues, the pitcher is required to bat, per the traditional rules. In the American, Pacific, and both Cuban leagues, there is a tenth player, a [[designated hitter]], who bats for the pitcher. Each top-level team has a [[Farm team#Baseball|farm system]] of one or more [[Minor league baseball|minor league teams]]. These teams allow younger players to develop as they gain on-field experience against opponents with similar levels of skill.

The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly ''[[la soule]]'', with similarities to baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other old French games such as ''théque'', ''la balle au bâton'', and ''la balle empoisonée'' also appear to be related.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 71–72, 75, 89, 147–149, 150, 160, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game [[rounders]], popular in Great Britain and Ireland. ''[[Baseball Before We Knew It|Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game]]'' (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of [[stoolball]] and &quot;tut-ball&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 86, 87, 111–113, 118–121, 135–138, 144, 160; Rader (2008), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It has long been believed that [[cricket]] also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that the sport may have been imported to England from [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mason, Chris|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7919429.stm |title=Cricket 'Was Invented in Belgium'|date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2009-03-03 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', by [[John Newbery]]. It contains a rhymed description of &quot;base-ball&quot; and a [[woodcut]] that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 139, 140, 151, 164, 178, 179, et seq.; {{cite web|author=Hellier, Cathy|url=http://www.history.org/history/teaching/enewsletter/volume2/june04/pocketbook.cfm |title=Mr. Newbery's Little Pretty Pocket-Book |accessdate=2008-04-12 |publisher=Colonial Williamsburg Foundation}} See [[s:A Little Pretty Pocket-book/Base-Ball|Wikisource edition of ''A Little Pretty Pocket-Book'']].&lt;/ref&gt; English lawyer William Bray recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]]; Bray's diary was verified as authentic in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/baseball/2799671/Major-League-Baseball-told-Your-sport-is-British-not-American.html|title=Major League Baseball Told: Your Sport Is British, Not American|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-03|work=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early form of the game was apparently brought to North America by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the continent by both British and Irish immigrants. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town's new meeting house.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 58, 160, 300, 307, 310; {{cite web|author=Miller, Doug|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050802&amp;content_id=1154441&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Pittsfield: Small City, Big Baseball Town|date=August 2, 2005|accessdate=2009-02-03 |publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1796, a version of the game was well-known enough to earn a mention in a German scholar's book on popular pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, &quot;''englische Base-ball''&quot; involved a contest between two teams, in which &quot;the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate&quot;. Only one out was required to retire a side.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 67–75, 181; Gutsmuths quoted: p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. These games were often referred to locally as &quot;[[town ball]]&quot;, though other names such as &quot;round-ball&quot; and &quot;base-ball&quot; were also used.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 4–5, 11–15, 25, 33, 59–61, et. seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest examples to receive a detailed description—albeit five decades after the fact, in a letter from an attendee to ''Sporting Life'' magazine—took place in Beachville, [[Ontario]], in 1838. There were many similarities to modern baseball, and some crucial differences: five bases (or ''byes''); first bye just {{convert|18|ft|m|}} from the home bye; batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The once widely accepted story that [[Abner Doubleday]] invented baseball in [[Cooperstown, New York]], in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. xiv–xix, 15–18, 32–38, 42–47, et seq.; Rader (2008), pp. 7, 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1845, [[Alexander Cartwright]], a member of New York City's Knickerbockers club, led the codification of the so-called [[Knickerbocker Rules]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, common to bat-and-ball games of the day, of &quot;soaking&quot; or &quot;plugging&quot;—effecting a [[putout]] by hitting a runner with a thrown ball—was barred. The rules thus facilitated the use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers' game close to the modern one, though a ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand pitching was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), p. 84; Koppett (2004), p. 2; Rader (2008), p. 8; Sullivan (1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; While there are reports that the [[New York Knickerbockers]] played games in 1845, the contest now recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]: the &quot;New York Nine&quot; defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 32, 80, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.&lt;ref&gt;Tygiel (2000), pp. 8–14; Rader (2008), pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The game turns professional====
In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the &quot;national pastime&quot; or &quot;national game&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tygiel (2000), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing body, the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. In 1863, the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a [[fair ball]] on the first bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by [[African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 27; Sullivan (1997), pp. 68, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 43, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The first professional league, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute [[National Association as a major league|its status as a major league]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The more formally structured [[National League]] was founded in 1876.  As the oldest surviving major league, the National League is sometimes referred to as the &quot;senior circuit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 83, 130, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other major leagues formed and failed. In 1884, African American [[Moses Fleetwood Walker|Moses Walker]] (and, briefly, his brother Welday) played in one of these, the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; An injury ended Walker's major league career, and by the early 1890s, a [[gentlemen's agreement]] in the form of the [[baseball color line]] effectively barred black players from the white-owned professional leagues, major and minor.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]] formed, but quickly folded. Several independent African American teams succeeded as [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstormers]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1884, overhand pitching was legalized.&lt;ref name=R71&gt;Rader (2008), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, [[softball]], under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game.&lt;ref&gt;Heaphy, Leslie, &quot;Women Playing Hardball&quot;, in ''Baseball and Philosophy: Thinking Outside the Batter's Box'', ed. Eric Bronson (Open Court, 2004), pp. 246–256: p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by 1893; the last major change—counting [[foul ball]]s as [[Strike zone|strikes]]—was instituted in 1901.&lt;ref name=R71/&gt; The National League's first successful counterpart, the [[American League]], which evolved from the minor [[Western League (original)|Western League]], was established that year.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 243–246.&lt;/ref&gt; The two leagues, each with eight teams, were rivals that fought for the best players, often disregarding each other's contracts and engaging in bitter legal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fred Merkle]], sixth in line, committed a [[baserunning]] gaffe in a crucial 1908 game that became famous as Merkle's Boner.]]
A modicum of peace was eventually established, leading to the National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's [[Minor league baseball|minor professional leagues]].&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 110; Zimbalist (2006), p. 22. See {{cite web|title=National Agreement for the Government of Professional Base Ball Clubs|url=http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm|publisher=roadsidephotos.sabr.org|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Series]], pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The [[Boston Americans]] of the American League defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] of the National League.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], under [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]], refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 141–150; Sullivan (1998), pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

As professional baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the [[reserve clause]], which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check.&lt;ref&gt;Burk (2001), pp. 56, 100, 102, 103, 113, 143, 147, 170, et seq.; Powers (2003), pp. 17–21, 27, 83, 121, 122, 160–164, 177; Rader (2008), pp. 60–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner [[Charles Comiskey]] and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the [[Chicago White Sox]] conspired to [[Match fixing|throw]] the [[1919 World Series]]. The [[Black Sox Scandal]] led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 39, 47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Commissioner of Baseball|major league baseball commissioner]], [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the [[Negro National League (1920–1931)|Negro National League]]; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the [[Eastern Colored League]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), pp. 117, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise of Ruth and racial integration====
Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early twentieth century was lower scoring and pitchers, the likes of [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Christy Mathewson]], were more dominant. The &quot;inside game&quot;, which demanded that players &quot;scratch for runs&quot;, was played much more aggressively than it is today: the brilliant and often violent [[Ty Cobb]] epitomized this style.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[dead-ball era]] ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition, coupled with superior materials available after World War I, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of bringing the outfield fences closer in, making [[home run]]s more common.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the legendary player [[Babe Ruth]], the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. The club with which Ruth set most of his slugging records, the [[New York Yankees]], built a reputation as the majors' premier team.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s and early 1930s, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] invested in several [[Minor league baseball|minor league clubs]] and developed the first modern &quot;farm system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burk (2001), pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Negro National League (1933–1948)|Negro National League]] was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the [[Negro American League]]. The [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|first elections]] to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] took place in 1936. In 1939 [[Little League Baseball]] was founded in Pennsylvania. By the late 1940s, it was the organizing body for [[Amateur baseball in the United States|children's baseball leagues]] across the United States.

With America's entry into World War II, many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well. [[Chicago Cubs]] owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]] led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye — the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] existed from 1943 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lesko, Jeneane|title=League History|url=http://www.aagpbl.org/league/history.cfm|publisher=All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association|year=2005|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural [[College World Series]] was held in 1947, and the [[Babe Ruth League]] youth program was founded.  This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: [[Jackie Robinson]] was signed by the National League's [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]—where Branch Rickey had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers. [[Larry Doby]] debuted with the American League's [[Cleveland Indians]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), pp. 180, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born [[Chico Carrasquel]] and black Cuban-born [[Minnie Miñoso]], became the first Hispanic [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Stars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;P111&quot;&gt;Powers (2003), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball: White Sox and Fans Speak Same Language, With a Spanish Accent|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3DD113FF935A15753C1A9639C8B63|work=New York Times|date=October 26, 2005|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing competition as varied as television and [[American football|football]], baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 3; Bjarkman (2005), p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simm&quot;&gt;Simmons, Rob, &quot;The Demand for Spectator Sports&quot;, in ''Handbook on the Economics of Sport'', ed. Wladimir Andreff and Stefan Szymanski (Edward Elgar, 2006), pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial integration|Integration]] proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the sixteen major league teams had a black player on the roster.&lt;ref name=&quot;P111&quot;/&gt; That year, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; No major league team had been located west of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The majors' final all-white bastion, the [[Boston Red Sox]], added a black player in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;P111&quot;/&gt; With the integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Heaphy (2003), pp. 121, 218–224.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] [[expansion team]], and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped [[Roger Maris]] break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), pp. 307, 308; Sullivan (2002), pp. 163, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major league expansion in sixty years, each league now had ten teams.

====Attendance records and the age of steroids====
The players' union became bolder under the leadership of former [[United Steelworkers]] chief economist and negotiator [[Marvin Miller]], who was elected executive director in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 170, 172–175.&lt;/ref&gt; On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, the [[strike zone]] was reduced and the height of the [[Baseball field#Pitcher's mound|pitcher's mound]] was lowered. The following year, both the National and American leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also in 1969, [[Curt Flood]] of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' [[1972 Major League Baseball strike|first general players' strike]] took place in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 156–168, 175, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the [[designated hitter]] rule the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (2002), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was [[Seitz decision|effectively struck down]], leading to the [[Free agent|free agency system]].&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 178, 180, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|1981]] and [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|1994]], the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in ninety years.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 184–187, 191, 192, 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), pp. 376, 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IMG 7473 Roy Halladay.jpg|thumb|200px|left|In May 2010, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' [[Roy Halladay]] pitched the twentieth major league [[perfect game]]. That October, he pitched only the second [[no-hitter]] in MLB postseason history.]]
The addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, and again in the abbreviated 1994 season.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 249, 250.&lt;/ref&gt; After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Sammy Sosa]] [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|both surpassed]] Maris's decades-old single season home run record and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Barry Bonds]] established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by [[Banned substances in baseball|the abuse of illegal steroids]] (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271; Zimbalist (2007), pp. 195, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing [[Hank Aaron]], as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MajorAtRec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Regular-Season Attendance Just Shy Of Last Year's Record|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/124427|work=Street &amp; Smith's SportsBusiness Daily|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MinorAtRec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Minor League Baseball History|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as well as many other players, including storied pitcher [[Roger Clemens]]—have been implicated in the [[History of baseball in the United States#The steroid era|steroid abuse scandal]], their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 292–293; Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271, 275–277.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilgers, Laura|title=Youth Sports Drawing More than Ever|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/07/03/rise.kids.sports/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=July 5, 2006|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, which became known as the &quot;Year of the Pitcher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Drellich, Evan|title=Year of the Pitcher Extends to Postseason|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101006&amp;content_id=15461864&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|publisher=Major League Baseball|date=October 6, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10}} {{cite web|author=Gregory, Sean|title=Giants Win World Series: Year of the Pitcher Ends With a Fitting Duel|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/11/02/giants-win-world-series-year-of-the-pitcher-ends-with-a-fitting-duel/|publisher=Time|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Speier, Alex|title=Year of the Pitcher, or Year of the Umpire?|url=http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/alex-speier/2010/10/08/year-pitcher-or-year-umpire|publisher=WEEI|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball, widely known as America's pastime, is well-established in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), p. 73; Burk (2001), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the [[Montreal Expos]] joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion [[Toronto Blue Jays]] joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]].

In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at [[Parque Los Berros]] in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]]. A few days after the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], they used the &quot;wooden leg captured (by the Fourth Illinois regiment) from General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Terry (1909), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition and whose national team has been one of the world's strongest since international play began in the late 1930s (all organized baseball in the country has officially been amateur since the [[Cuban Revolution]]). The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938).&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. 356, 123, 137, xxiv, 11, 233; Gmelch (2006), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japanese major leagues]]—the [[Central League]] and [[Pacific League]]—have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil (2000), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan has a professional minor league system as well, though it is much smaller than the American version—each team has only one farm club in contrast to MLB teams' four or five.&lt;ref name=RW&gt;{{cite web|author=Whiting, Robert|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20070411c1.html|title=Is the MLB Destroying Japan's National Pastime?|date=April 11, 2007|accessdate=2009-02-08|work=Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American nations, most prominently [[Venezuela]] (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955).&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. xxiv, xxv; Burgos (2007), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1970s, the annual [[Caribbean Series]] has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the [[Dominican Winter League]], [[Liga Mexicana del Pacífico|Mexican Pacific League]], [[Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League]], and [[Venezuelan Professional Baseball League]]. In Asia, [[South Korea]] (1982), [[Taiwan]] (1990), and China (2003) all have professional leagues.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. 362, 368; Gmelch (2006), pp. 100, 75, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many European countries have professional leagues as well, the most successful, other than the [[Honkbal Hoofdklasse|Dutch league]], being the [[Serie A1 (baseball)|Italian league]] founded in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the [[2004 Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. The [[Israel Baseball League]], launched in 2007, folded after one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mayo, Jonathan|title=Perspective: Baseball in the Holy Land|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090127&amp;content_id=501366&amp;vkey=news_milb&amp;fext=.jsp|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=January 28, 2009|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads. Other competitions between national teams, such as the [[Baseball World Cup]] and the [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic baseball tournament]], have been administered by the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF) since its formation in 1938. As of 2009, the IBAF has 117 member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Baseball Federation (Confederations/Member Federations)|url=http://www.ibaf.org/|publisher=International Baseball Federation|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's baseball]] is played on an organized amateur basis in many of the countries where it is a leading men's sport. Since 2004, the IBAF has sanctioned the [[Women's Baseball World Cup]], featuring national teams.

After being admitted to the Olympics as a [[Olympic sport|medal sport]] beginning with the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Games]], baseball was dropped from the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]] at the 2005 [[International Olympic Committee]] [[117th IOC Session|meeting]]. It remained part of the [[2008 Summer Olympic Games|2008 Games]]. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fewer Sports for London Olympics |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4658925.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=July 8, 2005|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the [[National Hockey League]] now does during the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

==Rules and gameplay==
{{Main|Baseball rules}}

A game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense ([[Batting (baseball)|batting]] or hitting) and defense (fielding or pitching). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an [[inning (baseball)|inning]]. A game consists of nine innings. One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points ([[run (baseball)|runs]]) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped [[baseball field|baseball diamond]]. A player bats at [[home plate]] and must proceed [[counterclockwise]] to first base, second base, third base, and back home in order to score a run. The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record [[out (baseball)|outs]], which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's [[Batting order (baseball)|batting order]] comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, [[extra innings]] are played to resolve the contest. Children's games are often scheduled for fewer than nine innings.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston (2000), p. 15; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|title=Official Rules/Foreword|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.01–1.03)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00—Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/4.00—Starting and Ending a Game (Rule 4.10)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|350px|right|Diagram of a [[baseball field]] (the term ''diamond'' may be used to refer to the square area defined by the four bases or to the entire playing field). The dimensions given are for professional and professional-style games. Children often play on smaller fields.]]
The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the [[infield]]; the area farther beyond the infield is the [[outfield]]. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). Fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.04–1.07)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00—Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic tools of baseball: the [[baseball (ball)|ball]], the [[baseball bat|bat]], and the [[baseball glove|glove or mitt]]:
*The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9&amp;nbsp;inches (23 centimeters) in circumference. It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.&lt;ref&gt;Porterfield (2007), p. 23; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rule 1.09)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34&amp;nbsp;inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42&amp;nbsp;inches (106 centimeters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rule 1.10a)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|author=Fitzgerald, Stephen et al.|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2005/0176531.html|title=Polymer Composite Baseball Bat Endcap (U.S. Patent Application 20050176531)|date=November 8, 2005|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=FreePatentsOnline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.12–1.15)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston (2000), pp. 21, 30, 31; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game (Rule 1.16)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the [[pitcher]], stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the [[catcher]], squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the [[Baseball positions|standard arrangement]], there is a [[first baseman]] positioned several steps to the left of first base, a [[second baseman]] to the right of second base, a [[shortstop]] to the left of second base, and a [[third baseman]] to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are [[left fielder]], [[center fielder]], and [[right fielder]]. A neutral [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] sets up behind the catcher.&lt;ref&gt;Porterfield (2007), pp. 16–18, 25, 34, 35; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf|title=Official Rules/9.00—The Umpire (Rule 9.03a)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David-ortiz-batters-box.JPG|thumb|left|Awaiting a pitch: batter, catcher, and umpire]]
Play starts with a batter standing at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a ''runner'' (or, until the play is over, a ''batter-runner''). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being [[putout|put out]] (see below) is said to be ''safe'' and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a [[hit (baseball)|hit]]. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a [[Single (baseball)|single]]. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a [[Double (baseball)|double]]; third base, a [[Triple (baseball)|triple]]. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), it is a [[home run]]: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an [[error (baseball)|error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf|title=Official Rules/5.00—Putting the Ball in Play.

Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base ''must'' attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes [[Dead ball (baseball)|dead]] and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has [[flyout|flied out]] and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they [[tag up]] or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a [[stolen base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00—Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf|title=Official Rules/5.00—Putting the Ball in Play.

A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded [[strikeout|strikes out]]. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a [[base on balls]] or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if any part of the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch before the batter either swings at it or it contacts the ground.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the [[strike zone]], a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLBR2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00—Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strike is called when one of the following happens:
*The batter lets a well-pitched ball (one within the strike zone) go through to the catcher.
*The batter swings at any ball (even one outside the strike zone) and misses, or [[foul tip]]s it directly into the catcher's hands.
*The batter hits a [[foul ball]]—one that either initially lands in foul territory or initially lands within the diamond but moves into foul territory before passing first or third base. If there are already two strikes on the batter, a foul ball is not counted as a third strike; thus, a foul ball cannot result in the immediate strikeout of the batter. (There is an exception to this exception: a two-strike foul [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] is recorded as a third strike.)
A ball is called when the pitcher throws a pitch that is outside the strike zone, provided the batter has not swung at it.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLBR2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|title=Official Rules/6.00—The Batter (Rule 6.08)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf|title=Official Rules/9.00—The Umpire (Rules 9.02a, 9.04a)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Navy baseball.jpg|right|thumb|A [[shortstop]] tries to [[tag out]] a runner who is sliding headfirst, attempting to reach second base.]]
While the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. Among the various ways a member of the batting team may be put out, five are most common:
*The [[strikeout]]: as described above, recorded against a batter who makes three strikes before putting the ball into play or being awarded a free advance to first base.
*The [[flyout]]: as described above, recorded against a batter who hits a ball in the air that is caught by a fielder, whether in fair territory or foul territory, before it lands, whether or not the batter has run.
*The [[force play|ground out]]: recorded against a batter (in this case, batter-runner) who hits a ball that lands in fair territory which, before the batter-runner can reach first base, is retrieved by a fielder who touches first base while holding the ball or relays it to another fielder who touches first base while holding the ball.
*The [[force play|force out]]: recorded against a runner who is required to attempt to advance—either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory, or because the runner immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The ground out is technically a special case of the force out.
*The [[tag out]]: recorded against a runner who is touched by a fielder with the ball or a glove holding the ball, while the runner is not touching a base.
It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play—a [[double play]]. Even three—a [[triple play]]—is possible, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] or bench.  A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat—every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|title=Official Rules/6.00—The Batter (Rule 6.05)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/07_the_runner.pdf|title=Official Rules/7.00—The Runner (Rules 7.08, 7.10)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual player's turn batting or [[plate appearance]] is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting [[caught stealing]] (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston (2000), p. 100; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf|title=Official Rules/3.00—Game Preliminaries (Rule 3.03)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|title=Official Rules/6.00—The Batter (Rules 6.01, 6.04)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the [[designated hitter]] (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.&lt;ref&gt;Porterfield (2007), p. 19; Thurston (2000), p. 153; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf|title=Official Rules/6.00—The Batter (Rule 6.10)|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
===Player rosters===

A [[manager (baseball)|manager]] will often have both a right-handed and a left-handed reliever warm up to maximize strategic options.]]
Roster, or squad, sizes differ between different leagues and different levels of organized play. Major League Baseball teams maintain twenty-five-player active rosters. A typical twenty-five-man roster in a league without the DH rule, such as MLB's National League, features:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|url=http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090404&amp;content_id=4127882&amp;vkey=pr_was&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=was|title=Nationals Finalize 25-Man Roster|date=2009-04-04|accessdate=2009-04-21|publisher=Washington Nationals/Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*eight [[position player]]s—catcher, four infielders, three outfielders—who play on a regular basis
*five [[starting pitcher]]s who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation
*six [[relief pitcher]]s, including one specialist [[Closer (baseball)|closer]], who constitute the team's [[bullpen]] (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)
*one backup, or substitute, catcher
*two backup infielders
*two backup outfielders
*one specialist [[pinch hitter]], or a second backup catcher, or a seventh reliever

===Other personnel===
The [[manager (baseball)|manager]], or head coach of a team, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more [[Coach (baseball)|coaches]]; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play.&lt;ref&gt;Walfoort, Cleon, &quot;Most 'Signs' Given by Coaches Are Merely Camouflage&quot;, ''Baseball Digest'', December 1960–January 1961, pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed on the playing field during a game.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Fans Speak Out&quot; [''Baseball Digest'' staff], ''Baseball Digest'', August 1999, pp. 9–10; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/03_game_preliminaries.pdf|title=Official Rules/3.00—Game Preliminaries (Rule 3.15)|accessdate=2009-04-27|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any baseball game involves one or more [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]], who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 293; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf|title=Official Rules/9.00—The Umpire|accessdate=2009-02-18|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy and tactics==
Many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bast, Andrew|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/146842|title=Southpaw's Revenge|date=July 18, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-08|work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Davis, Hank, ''Small-town Heroes: Images of Minor League Baseball'' (Univ. of Iowa Press, 1997), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pitching and fielding tactics===
[[File:Baseball pick-off attempt.jpg|right|thumb|A [[first baseman]] receives a [[pickoff]] throw, as the runner dives back to first base.]]
The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. Among the wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the [[fastball]], the [[changeup]] (or off-speed pitch), and two [[breaking ball]]s—the [[curveball]] and the [[slider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Walsh, John|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/fastball-slider-changeup-curveball-an-analysis/|title=Fastball, Slider, Change-up, Curveball—An Analysis|date=December 20, 2007|accessdate=2009-02-21|publisher=Hardball Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may [[Glossary of baseball (S)#shake off|shake off the sign]] and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and [[Glossary of baseball (L)#lead|taking a lead]], the pitcher may attempt a [[pickoff]], a quick throw to a fielder [[covering a base|covering the base]] to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a [[pitchout]], a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), pp. 126–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a [[Glossary of baseball (S)#shift|shift]], with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may [[Glossary of baseball (P)#playing in|play in]], moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a [[Glossary of baseball (G)#ground ball|ground ball]], though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.&lt;ref name=SB45&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batting and baserunning tactics===
[[File:The bunt.jpg|right|thumb|A batter squares to bunt, moving his hands up the barrel of the bat to increase his control and deaden the ball on impact.]]
Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The [[Hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]] is sometimes employed with a skillful [[contact hitter]]: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), pp. 5, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sacrifice bunt]] calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into [[scoring position]] even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a [[Squeeze play (baseball)|squeeze play]].&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), pp. 42–43, 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter in this case gets credit for a [[sacrifice fly]].&lt;ref name=SB45/&gt; The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is [[Glossary of baseball (A)#ahead in the count|ahead in the count]] (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to [[Glossary of baseball (T)#take sign|take]], or not swing at, the next pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings and Bennett (2003), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctive elements==
Baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following, games such as [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], and [[Association football|soccer]]. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none of them is the variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The [[comparison between cricket and baseball]] demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sport.

===No clock to kill===
[[File:A worn-out baseball.JPG|thumb|left||A well-worn baseball]]
In clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead [[Stalling (gaming)|killing the clock]] rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Mount, Nicholas James, &quot;Team Sports&quot;, in ''Encyclopedia of Time'', ed. Samuel L. Macey (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1994), pp. 588–590: p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[first-class cricket]]: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.&lt;ref&gt;Eastaway, Rob, ''What Is a Googly?: The Mysteries of Cricket Explained'' (Anova, 2005), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.

While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the twentieth century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960.&lt;ref name = &quot;HB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bodley, Hal|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2004-02-26-bodley_x.htm|title=Baseball Wants Just a Few More Minutes|date=February 26, 2004|accessdate=2009-02-03|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters).&lt;ref name = &quot;JG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Greenfield, Jeff|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988721,00.html|title=Midnight Baseball|date=July 13, 1998|accessdate=2009-02-03|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of merely 2:45.&lt;ref name = &quot;HB&quot;/&gt; The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently.&lt;ref name = &quot;HB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;JG&quot;/&gt; Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanfs.org/en/pages/027087.html|title=Japan's Pro Baseball Teams Start Eco-Project to Cut Energy Use by 6%|date=July 13, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-18|publisher=Japan for Sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual focus===
For a team sport, baseball places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: &quot;the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke and Dawson (1915), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting the game with both football and basketball, scholar Michael Mandelbaum argues that &quot;baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbaum (2005), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. As described by Mandelbaum,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is impossible to isolate and objectively assess the contribution each [football] team member makes to the outcome of the play.... [E]very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates all the time. In baseball, by contrast, every player is more or less on his own.... Baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and total responsibility. A baseball player lives in a glass house, and in a stark moral universe.... Everything that every player does is accounted for and everything accounted for is either good or bad, right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbaum (2005), pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the [[Partnership (cricket)|batting partnership]] and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the [[wicket]] for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Richard, &quot;Baseball in England&quot;, ''Badminton Magazine'', August 1896, pp. 157–158: &quot;The scoring is one of the most interesting features in this new importation from America [baseball]. Every detail of play is recorded, and a man's mistakes are tabulated as well as his successes.... A line in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, ''caught'' Stoddart, ''bowled'' J. T. Hearne; 30.'... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis.... The man who catches a ball is thought worthy of mention, but the man who muffs one does not suffer by publicity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniqueness of each baseball park===
{{Main|Baseball park}}

Unlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of Major League and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} from home plate to the fences in left and right field and {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} to center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game. (Rule 1.04a)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at [[Minute Maid Park]], which became the home of the [[Houston Astros]] in 2000, the [[Crawford Boxes]] in left field are only {{convert|315|ft|m|0}} from home plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nightengale, Bob|date=August 20, 2008|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-08-20-bestseats-minutemaid_N.htm|title=No. 8: Out in Left Field in Houston's Crawford Boxes|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's [[Fenway Park]], in use since 1912: the [[Green Monster]] is {{convert|310|ft|m|0}} from home plate down the line and {{convert|37|ft|m|0}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fenway from Legend's Box.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The [[Green Monster]] is visible beyond the playing field on the left.]]
Similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a flyout in a park with more expansive foul ground.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or [[inside-the-park home run]].&lt;ref&gt;Puhalla, Krans, and Goatley (2003), p. 198; {{cite web|author=Shaikin, Bill|date=May 27, 2006|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/27/sports/sp-angels27|title=Guerrero Becomes Mr. Inside|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the image to the left shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00—Objectives of the Game. (Rule 1.04)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as [[AstroTurf]]. Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shaikin, Bill|date=October 8, 2002|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/08/sports/sp-angnote8|title=No Fly Ball Routine in Dome|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;Puhalla, Krans, and Goatley (2003), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is [[Coors Field]], home of the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Its high altitude—{{convert|5282|ft|m|0}} above sea level—is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues.&lt;ref&gt;Keri (2007), pp. 295–301.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wrigley Field]], home of the [[Chicago Cubs]], is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off [[Lake Michigan]] are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Steve|date=September 30, 2008|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&amp;content_id=3575106|title=Wrigley's Winds Don't Rattle Lowe|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball {{convert|330|ft|m|-1}} into right field might result in an easy catch on the [[warning track]] at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed [[pull hitter]]s, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sheinin, Dave|date=March 26, 2008|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402798.html|title=After Move, a Breaking In Process|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=Washington Post}} See also Powers (2003), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
{{Main|Baseball statistics}}

Organized baseball lends itself to [[statistics]] to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late nineteenth century, a former cricket player, English-born [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] of [[Brooklyn, New York]], was responsible for the &quot;development of the [[Box score (baseball)|box score]], tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the [[batting average]], and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.&quot;&lt;ref name=T16&gt;Tygiel (2000), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The statistical record is so central to the game's &quot;historical essence&quot; that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball.&lt;ref name=T16/&gt; In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian [[Alan Schwarz]] describes as a &quot;tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (2004), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Official Baseball Rules administered by Major League Baseball require the [[official scorer]] to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The [[Baseball scorekeeping|score report]] is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; General managers, managers, and [[scout (sport)|baseball scouts]] use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.

[[File:Baseball steal.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rickey Henderson]]—the major leagues' all-time leader in runs and stolen bases—stealing third base in a 1988 game.]]
Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rules 10.02a, 10.04, 10.21b)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[At bats]]: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where the batter's ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners
* Hits: times reached base because of a batted, fair ball without fielding error or [[fielder's choice]]
* Runs: times circling the bases and reaching home safely
* [[Run batted in|Runs batted in]] (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter's action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error
* Home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error
* Batting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting ability
The basic baserunning statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rule 10.07)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball
* Caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a base
[[File:Cy young pitching.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cy Young]]—the holder of many major league career marks, including wins and innings pitched, as well as losses—in 1908. MLB's annual [[Cy Young Award|awards for the best pitcher in each league]] are named for Young.]]
The basic pitching statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rules 10.15, 10.17, 10.19, 10.21a, 10.21e)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Win (baseball)|Wins]]: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)
* [[Loss (baseball)|Losses]]: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished
* [[Save (baseball)|Saves]]: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher's team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or [[Baseball field#On-deck circles|on deck]]; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings
* [[Innings pitched]]: outs recorded while pitching divided by three
* Strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter
* [[Winning percentage]]: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)
* [[Earned run average]] (ERA): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitched
The basic fielding statistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rules 10.09, 10.10, 10.12, 10.21d)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Putout]]s: times the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise directly effects an out
* [[Assist (baseball)|Assists]]: times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball
* [[Error (baseball)|Error]]s: times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and the batting team benefits as a result
* [[Total chances]]: putouts plus assists plus errors
* [[Fielding average]]: successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chances

Among the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as ''situational statistics''. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher [[intentional base on balls|intentionally walk]] the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Albert, Jim, and Jay Bennett, &quot;Situational Effects&quot;, ch. 4 in ''Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game'', 2d ed. (Springer, 2003), pp. 71–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabermetrics===
''[[Sabermetrics]]'' refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, [[Bill James]], and derives from the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR).&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Scott, ''The Mind of Bill James: How a Complete Outsider Changed Baseball'' (Doubleday, 2006), p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo (2007), pp. 20–21, 67; Schwarz (2004), p. 233; Lewis (2003), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[On-base percentage]] measures a batter's ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rule 10.21f)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Slugging percentage]] measures a batter's ability to hit for power. It is calculated by taking the batter's [[total bases]] (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00—The Official Scorer (Rule 10.21c)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:
* [[On-base plus slugging]] (OPS) measures a batter's overall ability. It is calculated by adding the batter's on-base percentage and slugging percentage.&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo (2007), pp. 22, 67, 140; Schwarz (2004), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched]] (WHIP) measures a pitcher's ability at preventing hitters from reaching base. It is calculated exactly as its name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo (2007), pp. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity and cultural impact==
Writing in 1919, philosopher [[Morris Raphael Cohen]] described baseball as America's national religion.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Morris Raphael, &quot;Baseball as a National Religion&quot; (1919), in Cohen, ''The Faith of a Liberal'' (Transaction, 1993 [1946]), pp. 334–336: p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of sports columnist [[Jayson Stark]], baseball has long been &quot;a unique paragon of American culture&quot;—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stark, Jayson|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&amp;id=3892788|title=A-Rod Has Destroyed Game's History|date=February 8, 2009|accessdate=2009-02-08|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes &quot;how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of [[San Pedro de Macorís]], has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. 159–165.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the local winter league and major league ball are closely followed in Puerto Rico; major league Hall-of-Famer [[Roberto Clemente]] remains one of the greatest national heroes in the island's history.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western Hemisphere, baseball is also one of the leading sports in Canada, [[Colombia]], Mexico, the [[Netherlands Antilles]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], and Venezuela. In Asia, it is among the most popular sports in South Korea and Taiwan.

The major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience.&lt;ref&gt;Riess (1991), pp. 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.&lt;ref&gt;Riess (1991), pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, Major League Baseball set a revenue record of $6.5&amp;nbsp;billion, matching the NFL's revenue for the first time in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kercheval, Nancy|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=asFEMjfiKA5s|title=Major League Baseball Revenue Reaches Record, Attendance Falls|date=October 1, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-08|publisher=Bloomberg.com}} {{cite web|author=Battista, Judy|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/sports/football/10nfl.html?_r=1&amp;em|title=Feeling Pinch, N.F.L.

In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific leagues, was estimated at $1&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant.

===Baseball in popular culture===
Baseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of [[English language idioms derived from baseball|English-language idioms have been derived from baseball]]; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used [[Baseball metaphors for sex|sexual euphemisms]]. The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the [[1922 World Series]]: famed sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] announced [[play-by-play]] from New York City's [[Polo Grounds]] on [[WABC (AM)#As WJZ|WJZ]]–[[Newark, New Jersey]], which was connected by wire to [[WGY (AM)|WGY]]–[[Schenectady, New York]], and [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]]–[[Springfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudel (2008), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[baseball cap]] has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lam, Andrew|url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=96855813a910dda0453a6675c0d934f6l|title=Too Much Self Esteem Spoils Your Child|publisher=New America Media|date=July 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-05-02}} {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3660333.stm|title=Happy 50th, Baseball Caps|publisher=BBC News|date=April 27, 2004|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, [[Ernest Thayer]]'s poem &quot;[[Casey at the Bat]]&quot;, appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a &quot;clutch situation&quot;, the poem became the source of [[vaudeville]] and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many [[List of sports films#Baseball|baseball movies]], including the [[Academy Award]]–winning ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'' (1942) and the Oscar nominees ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984) and ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989).

The game's rich literary tradition includes the short fiction of [[Ring Lardner]] and novels such as [[Bernard Malamud]]'s ''[[The Natural]]'' (the source for the movie), [[Robert Coover]]'s ''[[The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.]]'', and [[W. P. Kinsella]]'s ''[[Shoeless Joe (novel)|Shoeless Joe]]'' (the source for ''Field of Dreams''). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of [[Damon Runyon]]; the columns of Grantland Rice, [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]], and [[Peter Gammons]]; and the essays of [[Roger Angell]]. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are [[Lawrence S. Ritter]]'s ''[[The Glory of Their Times]]'', [[Roger Kahn]]'s ''[[The Boys of Summer (book)|The Boys of Summer]]'', and [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]'s ''[[Moneyball]]''. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher [[Jim Bouton]]'s tell-all chronicle ''[[Ball Four]]'' is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neyer, Rob|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/ballfour/neyer.html|title='Ball Four' Changed Sports ''and'' Books|publisher=ESPN.com|date=June 15, 2000|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. [[Baseball card]]s were introduced in the late nineteenth century as [[trade card]]s. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader [[trading card]] industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), pp. 16–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[fantasy sports]] began in 1980 with the invention of [[fantasy baseball#Rotisserie League Baseball|Rotisserie League Baseball]] by New York writer [[Daniel Okrent]] and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active Major League Baseball players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as [[fantasy baseball]], it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), pp. 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports–related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800&amp;nbsp;million on the hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2008/7/emw1084994.htm|title=Fantasy Sports Industry Grows to a $800 Million Industry with 29.9 Million Players|work=EMediaWire.com|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2003), pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 9 '''fielding positions''' in [[baseball]]. Each [[Baseball scorekeeping#Defensive positions|position]] conventionally has an associated number (from 1 to 9) which is used [[official scorer|to score]] [[putout]]s.  For example:
*If the third baseman fields a ball and throws it to first, it is recorded as a 5–3 [[out (baseball)|out]].
*A [[double play]] where the second baseman fields, throws to the shortstop covering second base, who throws to the 1st baseman is recorded as a 4–6–3 double play.

The fielding positions in baseball are the basis for the famous comedy routine ''[[Who's On First?]]'', created by the team of [[Abbott and Costello]].

The '''history of baseball in the United States''' can be traced to the 18th century, when amateurs played a baseball-like game by their own informal rules using improvised equipment. The popularity of the sport inspired the semipro and professional baseball clubs in the 1860s.

==Early history==

In 1828, an article published in a Hagerstown, Maryland, newspaper briefly describes a young girl who's drawn away from her daily chores to play a familiar game with her friends. In &quot;A Village Sketch,&quot; author Miss Mitford wrote: ''&quot;Then comes a sun-burnt gipsy of six, beginning to grow tall and thin and to find the cares of the world gathering about her; with a pitcher in one hand, a mop in the other, an old straw bonnet of ambiguous shape, half hiding her tangled hair; a tattered stuff petticoat once green, hanging below an equally tattered cotton frock, once purple; her longing eyes fixed on a game of baseball at the corner of the green till she reaches the cottage door, flings down the mop and pitcher and darts off to her companions quite regardless of the storm of scolding with which the mother follows her runaway steps.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;The Torch Light and Public Advertiser (Hagerstown, MD), November 27, 1828&lt;/ref&gt;

The first team to play baseball under modern rules were the [[New York Knickerbockers]]. The club was founded on September 23, 1845, as a social club for the upper middle classes of New York City, and was strictly [[amateur]] until it disbanded. The club members, led by [[Alexander Cartwright]], formulated the &quot;Knickerbocker Rules&quot;, which in large part dealt with organizational matters but which also laid out rules for playing the game. One of the significant rules prohibited &quot;soaking&quot; or &quot;plugging&quot; the runner; under older rules, a fielder could put a runner out by hitting the runner with the thrown ball, similar to the common schoolyard game of [[kickball]]. The Knickerbocker Rules required fielders to tag or force the runner, as is done today, and avoided a lot of the arguments and fistfights that resulted from the earlier practice.

Writing the rules didn't help the Knickerbockers in the first known competitive game between two clubs under the new rules, played at Elysian Fields in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] on June 19, 1846. The self-styled &quot;New York Nine&quot; humbled the Knickerbockers by a score of 23 to 1. Nevertheless, the Knickerbocker Rules were rapidly adopted by teams in the New York area and their version of baseball became known as the &quot;New York Game&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;Massachusetts Game&quot;, played by clubs in the Boston area).

As late as 1855, the New York press was still devoting more space to coverage of [[cricket]] than to baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, sixteen New York area clubs, including the Knickerbockers, formed the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP). The NABBP was the first organization to govern the sport and to establish a championship. Aided by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], membership grew to almost 100 clubs by 1865 and to over 400 by 1867, including clubs from as far away as [[California]]. During the Civil war, soldiers from different parts of the United States played baseball together, leading to a more unified national version of the sport. Beginning in 1869, the NABBP permitted [[professional]] play, addressing a growing practice that had not been permitted under its rules to that point. The first and most prominent professional clubs of the NABBP era were the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] in Ohio, which lasted only two years. Businessman [[Iver Whitney Adams]] then courted manager Harry Wright and founded the &quot;Boston Red Stockings&quot;
and the [[Boston Base Ball Club]] January 20, 1871.

== Growth ==
Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], baseball competed for public interest with [[cricket]] and regional variants of baseball, notably [[town ball]] played in [[Philadelphia]] and the [[Massachusetts Game]] played in [[New England]]. In the 1860s, aided by the War, [[Knickerbocker Rules|&quot;New York&quot; style]] baseball expanded into a national game, as its first governing body, The [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] was formed. The NABBP soon expanded into a true national organization, although most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern part of the country. In its 12-year history as an amateur league, the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]] won seven championships, establishing themselves as the first true dynasty in the sport, although the [[New York Mutuals]] were widely considered to be one of the best teams of the era as well.

By the end of [[1865 in baseball|1865]], almost 100 clubs were members of the NABBP.  By 1867, it ballooned to over 400 members, including some clubs from as far away as [[List of baseball parks in San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Louisiana]]. One of these clubs, the Chicago White Stockings, won the championship in 1870.  Today known as the [[Chicago Cubs]], they are the oldest team in American organized sports.  Because of this growth, regional and state organizations began to assume a more prominent role in the governance of the sport.

==Professionalism==

The NABBP was initially established upon principles of [[amateurism]]. However, even early in its history some star players, such as [[Jim Creighton|James Creighton]] of [[Excelsior of Brooklyn|Excelsior]], received compensation, either secretly or indirectly.  In [[1866 in sports|1866]], the NABBP investigated [[Athletic of Philadelphia]] for paying three players including [[Lip Pike]], but ultimately took no action against either the club or the players. To address this growing practice, and to restore integrity to the game, at its December [[1868 in sports|1868]] meeting the NABBP established a professional category for the [[1869 in sports|1869]] season. Clubs desiring to pay players were now free to declare themselves [[professional]].

The [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] were the first to so declare themselves as openly professional, and were easily the most aggressive in recruiting the best available players. Twelve clubs, including most of the strongest clubs in the NABBP, ultimately declared themselves professional for the [[1869 in sports|1869]] season.

The first attempt at forming a &quot;[[Major North American professional sports teams|major league]]&quot; produced the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], which lasted from 1871 to 1875.  The now all professional Chicago White Stockings, financed by businessman [[William Hulbert]], became a charter member of the league along with the Red Stockings, who had dissolved and moved to Boston. The White Stockings were close contenders all season, despite the fact that the [[Great Chicago Fire]] had destroyed the team's home field and most of their equipment. The White Stockings finished the season in second place, but ultimately were forced to drop out of the league during the city's recovery period, finally returning to National Association play in 1874. Over the next couple seasons, The [[Ivers Whitney Adams#Baseball|Boston Red Stockings]] dominated the league and hoarded many of the game's best players, even those who were under contract with other teams. After [[Davy Force]] signed with Chicago, and then breached his contract to play in Boston, Hulbert became discouraged by the &quot;contract jumping&quot; as well as the overall disorganization of the N.A., and thus spearheaded the movement to form a stronger organization. The end result of his efforts was the formation a much more &quot;ethical&quot; league, which became known as the [[National League|National Base Ball League]].  After a series of rival leagues were organized but failed, (most notably the [[American Association (19th century)|American Base Ball Association]], which spawned the clubs which would ultimately become the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]) the current [[American League]], evolving from the minor Western League of 1893, was established in 1901.

==Rise of the major leagues==

In 1870, a schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers. The NABBP split into two groups. The [[National Association of Professional Baseball Players|National Association of ''Professional'' Base Ball Players]] operated from 1871 through 1875, and is considered by some to have been the first major league. Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.

William Hulbert's National League, which was formed after the National Association proved ineffective, put its emphasis on &quot;clubs&quot; rather than &quot;players&quot;. Clubs now had the ability to enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs in turn were required to play their full schedule of games, rather than forfeiting scheduled games once out of the running for the league championship, as happened frequently under the National Association. A concerted effort was made to reduce the amount of gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt.

At the same time, a &quot;[[gentlemen's agreement]]&quot; was struck between the clubs to [[Baseball color line|exclude non-white players]] from professional baseball, a bar that remained until 1947. It is a common misconception that [[Jackie Robinson]] was the first African-American major-league ballplayer; he was actually only the first after a long gap (and the first in the modern era). [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] and his brother Welday Walker were unceremoniously dropped from major and minor-league rosters in the 1880s, as were other African-Americans in baseball. An unknown number of African-Americans played in the major leagues by representing themselves as Indians, or South or Central Americans. And a still larger number played in the minor leagues and on amateur teams as well. In the majors, however, it was not until the signing of Robinson (in the National League) and [[Larry Doby]] (in the American League) that baseball began to remove its color bar.

The early years of the National League were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated &quot;reserve clause&quot;, which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitive leagues formed regularly, and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the American Association (1881–1891), sometimes called the &quot;beer and whiskey league&quot; for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the National League and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series—the first attempt at a [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]].

The [[Union Association]] survived for only one season (1884), as did the [[Players League]] (1890), an attempt to return to the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] structure of a league controlled by the players themselves. Both leagues are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers because of the perceived high caliber of play (for a brief time anyway) and the number of star players featured. However, some researchers have disputed the major league status of the Union Association, pointing out that franchises came and went and contending that the St. Louis club, which was deliberately &quot;stacked&quot; by the league's president (who owned that club), was the only club that was anywhere close to major league caliber.

In fact, there were dozens of leagues, large and small, at this time. What made the National League &quot;major&quot; was its dominant position in the major cities, particularly New York City, the edgy, emotional nerve center of baseball. The large cities offered baseball teams national media distribution systems and fan bases that could generate revenues enabling teams to hire the best players in the country.

A number of other leagues, including the venerable Eastern League, threatened the dominance of the National League. The Western League, founded in 1893, became particularly aggressive. Its fiery leader [[Ban Johnson]] railed against the National League and promised to build a new league that would grab the best players and field the best teams. The Western League began play in April 1894 with teams in [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]] (the only league team that has not moved since), [[Cleveland Indians|Grand Rapids]], [[Oakland Athletics|Indianapolis]], [[Minnesota Twins|Kansas City]], [[Baltimore Orioles|Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis Millers|Minneapolis]], [[Chicago White Sox|Sioux City]] and [[Boston Red Sox|Toledo]]. Prior to the 1900 season, the league changed its name to the [[American League]] and moved several franchises to larger, strategic locations. In 1901 the American League declared its intent to operate as a major league.

The resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes. One of the most famous involved star second baseman [[Napoleon Lajoie]], who in 1901 went across town in Philadelphia from the National League Phillies to the American League Athletics. Barred by a court injunction from playing baseball in the state of Pennsylvania the next year, Lajoie was traded to the Cleveland team, where he played and managed for many years.

The war between the American and National caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. On September 5, 1901 [[Patrick T. Powers]], president of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]] announced the formation of the second [[Minor League Baseball|National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]], the NABPL or &quot;NA&quot; for short.

These leagues did not consider themselves &quot;minor&quot; – a term that did not come into vogue until St. Louis Cardinals GM [[Branch Rickey]] pioneered the farm system in the 1930s. Nevertheless, these financially troubled leagues, by beginning the practice of selling players to the more affluent National and American leagues, embarked on a path that eventually led to the loss of their independent status.

[[Image:John E Sheridan Pennsylvania Georgetown Baseball c1901.jpg|thumb|300px|Poster for [[Penn Quakers|University of Pennsylvania]] vs. [[Georgetown University]] baseball game, circa 1901, by [[John E. Sheridan (illustrator)|John E. Sheridan]].]]

Ban Johnson had other designs for the NA. While the NA continues to this day, he saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might some day want to expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.

After 1902 both leagues and the NABPL signed a new National Agreement which achieved three things:

*First and foremost, it governed player contracts that set up mechanisms to end the cross-league raids on rosters and reinforced the power of the hated [[reserve clause]] that kept players virtual slaves to their baseball masters.

*Second, it led to the playing of a &quot;[[Baseball/World Series|World Series]]&quot; in 1903 between the two major league champions. The first World Series was won by Boston of the American League.

*Lastly, it established a system of control and dominance for the major leagues over the independents. There would not be another Ban Johnson-like rebellion from the ranks of leagues with smaller cities. Selling player contracts was rapidly becoming a staple business of the independent leagues. During the rough and tumble years of the American-National struggle, player contracts were violated at the independents as well: Players that the team had developed would sign deals with the National or American leagues without any form of compensation to the indy club.

The new agreement tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause national league contracts. Baseball players were a commodity, like cars. $5,000 bought a player's skill set. It set up a rough classification system for independent leagues that regulated the dollar value of contracts, the forerunner of the system refined by Rickey and used today.

It also gave the NA great power. Many independents walked away from the 1901 meeting. The deal with the NA punished those other indies who had not joined the NA and submitted to the will of the 'majors.' The NA also agreed to the deal to prevent more pilfering of players with little or no compensation for the players' development. Several leagues, seeing the writing on the wall, eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.

==The dead-ball era: 1900 to 1919==
[[Image:Cy young.jpg|thumb|Cy Young, 1911 baseball card]]
{{Main|Dead-ball era}}

At this time the games tended to be low scoring, dominated by such pitchers as [[Walter Johnson]], [[Cy Young]], [[Christy Mathewson]], and [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] to the extent that the period 1900–1919 is commonly called the &quot;Dead-ball era&quot;. The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. Baseballs cost three dollars apiece, a hefty sum at the time, which in 1900 would be equal to ${{Inflation|US|3|1900}} today; club owners were therefore reluctant to spend much money on new balls if not necessary. It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game. By the end of the game, the ball would be dark with grass, mud, and tobacco juice, and it would be misshapen and lumpy from contact with the bat. Balls were only replaced if they were hit into the crowd and lost, and many clubs employed security guards expressly for the purpose of retrieving balls hit into the stands—a practice unthinkable today.

As a consequence, home runs were rare, and the &quot;inside game&quot; dominated—singles, [[bunt (baseball)|bunts]], [[stolen base]]s, the hit-and-run play, and other tactics dominated the strategies of the time.

Despite this, there were also several superstar hitters, the most famous being [[Honus Wagner]], held to be one of the greatest [[shortstop]]s to ever play the game, and Detroit's [[Ty Cobb]], the &quot;Georgia Peach.&quot; Cobb was a mean-spirited man, fiercely competitive and loathed by many of his fellow professionals, but his career [[batting average]] of .366 has yet to be bested.

==Overview==
In the very early part of the 20th century, known as the &quot;[[dead-ball era]]&quot;, baseball rules and equipment favored the &quot;inside game&quot; and the game was played more violently and aggressively than it is today. This period ended in the 1920s with several changes that gave advantages to hitters. In the largest parks, the outfield fences were brought closer to the infield. In addition, the strict enforcement of new rules governing the size, shape and construction of the ball caused it to travel

The first professional black baseball club, the Cuban Giants, was organized in 1885. Subsequent professional black baseball clubs played each other independently, without an official league to organize the sport. [[Rube Foster]], a former ballplayer, founded the [[Negro National League (1920-1931)|Negro National League]] in 1920. A second league, the [[Eastern Colored League]], was established in 1923. These became known as the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]], though these leagues never had any formal overall structure comparable to the Major Leagues. The Negro National League did well until 1930, but folded during the [[Great Depression]].

From 1942 to 1948, the [[Negro League World Series]] was revived. This was the golden era of Negro League baseball, a time when it produced some of its greatest stars. In [[1947 Major League Baseball season|1947]], [[Jackie Robinson]] signed a contract with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] that had prevented talented African American players from entering the white-only major leagues. Although the transformation was not instantaneous, baseball has since become fully [[racial integration|integrated]]. In 1948, the Negro Leagues faced financial difficulties that effectively ended their existence.

Pitchers dominated the game in the 1960s and early 1970s. In [[1973 Major League Baseball season|1973]], the [[designated hitter]] (DH) rule was adopted by the American League, while in the National League pitchers still bat for themselves to this day. The DH rule now constitutes the primary difference between the two leagues.

During the late 1960s, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Baseball Players Union]] became much stronger and conflicts between owners and the players' union led to major work stoppages in 1972, 1981, and 1994. The [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|1994 baseball strike]] led to the cancellation of the World Series, and was not settled until the spring of 1995. In the late 1990s, functions that had been administered separately by the two major leagues' administrations were united under the rubric of [[Major League Baseball]].

===The Merkle incident===
The [[1908 Major League Baseball season|1908 pennant races]] in both the AL and NL were among the most exciting ever witnessed. The conclusion of the National League season, in particular, involved a bizarre chain of events, often referred to as the Merkle Boner. On September 23, 1908, the [[1908 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[1908 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] played a game in the [[Polo Grounds]]. Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman [[Fred Merkle]], later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two out and the game tied. Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game. However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, ran toward the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice. The Cubs' second baseman, [[Johnny Evers]], noticed this. In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored. Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out. Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game. Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary. It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the [[1908 World Series|World Series]] (the last Cubs Series victory to date, as it turns out).

For his part, Merkle was doomed to endless criticism and vilification throughout his career for this lapse, which went down in history as &quot;[[Merkle's Boner]]&quot;. In his defense, some baseball historians have suggested that it was not customary for game-ending hits to be fully &quot;run out&quot;, it was only Evers's insistence on following the rules strictly that resulted in this unusual play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/Jaybird926/merkle.htm|title=Fred Merkle and the 1908 Giants|accessdate=June 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, earlier in the 1908 season, the identical situation had been brought to the umpires' attention by Evers; the umpire that day was the same Hank O'Day. While the winning run was allowed to stand on that occasion, the dispute raised O'Day's awareness of the rule, and directly set up the Merkle controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Cait. Crazy '08&lt;/ref&gt;

===New places to play===
Turn of the century baseball attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the [[1901 Major League Baseball season|1901 season]] was 3,247.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenn.com/sports/baseball/mlb/ml_numbers.html|author=Kenn Tomasch|title=Historical attendance figures for Major League Baseball|date=May 24, 2005|accessdate=June 19, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060511134344/http://www.kenn.com/sports/baseball/mlb/ml_numbers.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built for many of the larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Detroit]], [[Shibe Park]], home of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], [[Ebbets Field]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[Manhattan]], [[Boston]]'s [[Fenway Park]] along with [[Wrigley Field]] and [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago. Likewise from the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]] to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising [[Negro Leagues]] professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre [[World War I]] peak of 5,836 in [[1909 Major League Baseball season|1909]], before falling back during the war. Where there weren't professional teams, there were semi-pro teams, traveling teams [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]], company clubs and amateur men's leagues. In the days before television, if you wanted to see a game, you had to go to the ballpark.

===The &quot;Black Sox&quot;===
[[File:ShoelessJoeJackson.jpg|thumb|148px|Shoeless Joe Jackson]]
{{Main|Black Sox Scandal}}
The fixing of baseball games by gamblers and players working together had been suspected as early as the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk2.html |title=History Files – Chicago Black Sox |publisher=Chicagohs.org |date=December 13, 2001 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hal Chase]] was particularly notorious for throwing games, but played for a decade after gaining this reputation; he even managed to parlay these accusations into a promotion to manager. Even baseball stars such as [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Tris Speaker]] have been credibly alleged to have fixed game outcomes. When MLB's complacency during this &quot;Golden Age&quot; was eventually exposed after the [[1919 World Series]], it became known as the [[Black Sox scandal]].

After an excellent regular season (88–52, .629 W%,) the [[1919 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] were heavy favorites to win the 1919 World Series. Arguably the best team in baseball, The White Sox had a deep lineup, a strong pitching staff, and a good defense. Even though the National League champion [[1919 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] had a superior regular season record (96–44, .689 W%,) no one, including [[gamblers]] and [[bookmaker]]s, anticipated the Reds having a chance. When the Reds triumphed 5–3, many pundits cried foul.

At the time of the scandal, the White Sox were arguably the most successful franchise in baseball, with excellent gate receipts and record attendance. At the time, most baseball players were not paid especially well and had to work other jobs during the winter to survive. Some elite players on the big-city clubs made very good salaries, but Chicago was a notable exception.

For many years, the White Sox were owned and operated by [[Charles Comiskey]], who paid the lowest player salaries, on average, in the American League. The White Sox players all intensely disliked Comiskey and his penurious ways, but were powerless to do anything, thanks to baseball’s so-called &quot;reserve clause,&quot; that prevented players from switching teams without their team owner's consent.

By late 1919, Comiskey’s tyrannical reign over the Sox had sown deep bitterness among the players, and White Sox first baseman [[Chick Gandil|Arnold &quot;Chick&quot; Gandil]] decided to conspire to throw the 1919 World Series.  He persuaded gambler [[Joseph &quot;Sport&quot; Sullivan]], with whom he had had previous dealings, that the fix could be pulled off for $100,000 total (which would be equal to ${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1919}}}} today), paid to the players involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk3.html |title=History Files – Chicago Black Sox |publisher=Chicagohs.org |date=December 13, 2001 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New York gangster [[Arnold Rothstein]] supplied the $100,000 that Gandil had requested through his lieutenant [[Abe Attell]], a former featherweight [[boxing]] champion.

After the 1919 series, and through the beginning of the [[1920 Major League Baseball season|1920 baseball season]], rumors swirled that some of the players had conspired to purposefully lose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk4a.html |title=History Files – Chicago Black Sox |publisher=Chicagohs.org |date=December 13, 2001 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At last, in 1920, a [[grand jury]] was convened to investigate these and other allegations of fixed baseball games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk5.html |title=History Files – Chicago Black Sox |publisher=Chicagohs.org |date=December 13, 2001 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight players ([[Swede Risberg|Charles &quot;Swede&quot; Risberg]], [[Chick Gandil|Arnold &quot;Chick&quot; Gandil]], [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|&quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson]], [[Happy Felsch|Oscar &quot;Happy&quot; Felsch]], [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Buck Weaver|George &quot;Buck&quot; Weaver]], [[Fred McMullin]], and [[Lefty Williams|Claude &quot;Lefty&quot; Williams]]) were indicted and tried for conspiracy.  The players were ultimately acquitted.

However, the damage to the reputation of the sport of baseball led the team owners to appoint Federal judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] to be the first [[Commissioner of Baseball]].  His first act as commissioner was to ban the &quot;Black Sox&quot; from professional baseball for life.

==The Negro leagues==
{{Main|Negro league baseball}}
Until July 5, 1947, baseball had two histories. One fills libraries, while baseball historians are only just beginning to chronicle the other fully. African Americans have played baseball as long as white Americans. Players of color, both [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], played for white baseball clubs throughout the early days of the organizing amateur sport. [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] is considered the first African-American to play at the major league level, in 1884.

The '''[[Negro Leagues]]''' were American professional [[baseball]] leagues comprising predominantly African-American teams. The term may be used broadly to include professional black teams outside the leagues and it may be used narrowly for the [[#Significant Negro Leagues|seven relatively successful leagues beginning 1920]] that are sometimes termed &quot;Negro Major Leagues&quot;.

The first professional team, established in [[1885 in baseball|1885]], achieved great and lasting success as the [[Cuban Giants]], while the first league, the [[National Colored Base Ball League]], failed in [[1887 in baseball|1887]] after only two weeks due to low attendance. The [[Negro American League]] of [[1951 in baseball|1951]] is considered the last major league season and the last professional club, the [[Indianapolis Clowns]], operated amusingly rather than competitively from the mid-1960s to 1980's.

===The first international leagues===
While many of the players that made up the black baseball teams were African-Americans, many more were [[Latin Americans]] from nations that deliver some of the greatest talents that make up the major league rosters of today. Black players moved freely through the rest of baseball, playing in [[Canadian Baseball]], [[Mexican Baseball]], [[Caribbean Baseball]], and Central America and South America where more than a few found that level of fame that they were unable to attain in the country of their birth.

==Babe Ruth and the end of the dead-ball era==
[[File:Babe Ruth2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Babe Ruth]] in 1920.]]
[[Image:MLB attendance vs population.png|thumb|Graph depicting the yearly MLB attendance versus total U.S. population|250px|right]]
It was not the Black Sox scandal by which an end was put to the dead-ball era, but by a rule change and a single player.

Some of the increased offensive output can be explained by the 1920 rule change outlawing tampering with the ball, which pitchers had often done to produce &quot;spitballs&quot;, &quot;shine balls&quot; and other trick pitches which had 'unnatural' flight through the air. Umpires were also required to put new balls into play whenever the current ball became scuffed or discolored. This rule change was enforced all the more stringently following the death of [[Ray Chapman]], who was struck in the temple by a pitched ball from [[Carl Mays]] in a game on August 16, 1920 (he died the next day). Discolored balls, harder for batters to see and therefore harder for batters to dodge, have been rigorously removed from play ever since. There are two side effects. One, of course, is that if the batter can see the ball more easily, the batter can hit the ball more easily. The second is that without scuffs and other damage, pitchers are limited in their ability to control spin and so to cause altered trajectories.

At the end of the 1919 season Harry Frazee, then owner of the [[Boston Red Sox]], sold a group of his star players to the [[New York Yankees]]. Amongst them was [[Babe Ruth|George Herman Ruth]], known affectionately as &quot;Babe&quot;. The story that he did so in order to fund theatrical shows on Broadway for his actress lady friend is unfounded. [[No, No, Nanette]] was indeed first produced in 1925 by Harry Frazee, though the sale of baseball superstar Babe Ruth to the [[New York Yankees]] had occurred five years earlier. In the lore of the [[Curse of the Bambino]], Frazee supposedly financed the production by selling Ruth, yet drawing a lhhine five years apart from the sale's proceeds to the production costs of the musical are circumstantial at best.

Ruth's career mirrors the shift in dominance from pitching to hitting at this time. He started his career as a pitcher in 1914, and by 1916 was considered one of the dominant left-handed pitchers in the game. When Edward Barrow, managing the Red Sox, converted him to an outfielder, ballplayers and sportswriters were shocked. It was apparent, however, that Ruth's bat in the lineup every day was far more valuable than Ruth's arm on the mound every fourth day. Ruth swatted an unprecedented 29 home runs in his last season in Boston. The next year, as a Yankee, he would hit 54 and in 1921 he hit 59. His 1927 mark of 60 home runs would last until 1961, and, because of two record books (one for 154 game season and one for 162 game season), longer still.

[[File:Hank Greenberg 1937 cropped.jpg |thumb |Hall of Famer [[Hank Greenberg]]]]
Ruth's power hitting ability demonstrated a new way to play the game, and one that was extremely popular with the crowds. Accordingly, the ballparks were expanded, sometimes by building outfield seating which shrunk the size of the outfield and made home run hitting more practical. In addition to Ruth, hitters such as [[Rogers Hornsby]] also took advantage, with Hornsby compiling extraordinary figures for both power and average in the early 1920s. By the late 1920s and 1930s all the good teams had their home run hitting &quot;sluggers&quot;: the Yankees' [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Jimmie Foxx]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Hank Greenberg]] in [[Detroit]] and Chicago's [[Hack Wilson]] were the most storied. While the American League championship, and to a lesser extent the [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]], would be dominated by the Yankees, there were many other excellent teams in the inter-war years. Also, the National League's [[St. Louis Cardinals]] would win three titles themselves in nine years, the last with a group of players known as the &quot;[[Gashouse Gang]]&quot;.

The first radio broadcast of a baseball game was on August 5, 1921 over Westinghouse station KDKA from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. Harold Arlin announced the Pirates-Phillies game. Attendances in the 1920s were consistently better than they had been before the war. The interwar peak average attendance was 8,211 in 1930, but baseball was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]] and in 1933 the average fell below five thousand for the only time between the wars.

1933 also saw the introduction of the All-Star game, a mid-season break in which the greatest players in each league play against one another in a hard fought but officially meaningless demonstration game. In 1936 the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] was instituted and five players elected: [[Ty Cobb]], [[Walter Johnson]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Honus Wagner]]. The Hall formally opened in 1939.

==The war years==
The beginning of US involvement in [[World War II]] necessitated depriving the game of many players who joined the armed forces, but the major leagues continued play throughout the duration. In 1941, a year which saw the premature death of [[Lou Gehrig]], Boston's great left fielder [[Ted Williams]] had a batting average over .400 — the last time anyone has achieved that feat. During the same season [[Joe DiMaggio]] hit successfully in 56 consecutive games, an accomplishment both unprecedented and unequaled. Both Williams and DiMaggio would miss playing time in the services, with Williams also flying later in the [[Korean War]]. During this period [[Stan Musial]] led the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to the 1942, 1944 and 1946 World Series titles. The war years also saw the founding of the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]].

Baseball boomed after [[World War II]]. 1945 saw a new attendance record and the following year average crowds leapt nearly 70% to 14,914. Further records followed in 1948 and 1949, when the average reached 16,913. While average attendances slipped to somewhat lower levels through the 1950s, 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, they remained well above pre-war levels, and total seasonal attendance regularly hit new highs from 1962 onwards as the number of major league games increased.

==Racial integration in baseball{{anchor | Racial integration in baseball}}==&lt;!--This section is linked by [[Jackie Robinson]]--&gt;
{{See|baseball color line|Jackie Robinson}}
The post-War years in baseball also witnessed the racial integration of the sport. Participation by [[African American]]s in organized baseball had been precluded since the 1890s by formal and informal agreements, with only a few players surreptitiously being included in lineups on a sporadic basis.

American society as a whole moved toward integration in the post-War years, partially as a result of the distinguished service by [[African American]] military units such as the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], [[366th Infantry Regiment]], and others. During the baseball winter meetings in 1943, noted [[African American]] athlete and actor [[Paul Robeson]] campaigned for integration of the sport.&lt;ref name=West&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/resources/pdf/hs_in_robinson_rickey.pdf |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson, Interview Essay |accessdate=April 15, 2009 |first=Jean |last = West}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;II ended, several team managers considered recruiting members of the [[Negro Leagues]] for entry into organized baseball. In the early 1920s, [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]' manager [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]] slipped a black player, [[Charlie Grant]], into his lineup (reportedly by passing him off to the front office as an Indian), and McGraw's wife reported finding names of dozens of Negro players that McGraw fantasized about signing, after his death. [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] owner Bill Bensawanger reportedly signed [[Josh Gibson]] to a contract in 1943, and the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] were also said to be interested in his services. But those efforts (and others) were opposed by [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], baseball's powerful commissioner and a staunch segregationist. [[Bill Veeck]] claimed that Landis blocked his purchase of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] because he planned to integrate the team. While this is disputed, Landis was opposed to integration, and his death in 1944 (and subsequent replacement as Commissioner by [[Happy Chandler]]) removed a major obstacle for black players in the major leagues.

[[File:Robinson-contract.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Robinson (left) with [[Branch Rickey]], signing the contract for Robinson's 1948 season]]
The general manager who would be eventually successful in breaking the color barrier was [[Branch Rickey]] of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. Rickey himself had experienced the issue of segregation. While playing and coaching for his college team at Ohio Wesleyan University, Rickey had a black teammate named Charles Thomas. On one particular road trip through southern Ohio his fellow player was refused a room in a hotel. Although Rickey was able to get the player into his room for that night, he was taken aback when he reached his room to find Thomas upset and crying about this injustice. Rickey related this incident as an example of why he wanted a full de-segregation of the nation, not only in baseball.

In the mid-1940s, Rickey had compiled a list of Negro League ballplayers for a potential major league contract. Realizing that the first [[African American]] signee would be a magnet for prejudicial sentiment, however, Rickey was intent on finding a player with a distinguished personality and character that would allow him to tolerate the inevitable abuse. Rickey's sights eventually settled on [[Jackie Robinson]], a shortstop with the [[Kansas City Monarchs]]. Although likely not the best player in the Negro Leagues at the time, Robinson was an exceptional talent, was college-educated, and had the marketable distinction of serving as an officer during World War II. More importantly, Robinson possessed the inner strength to handle the inevitable abuse to come.  To prepare him for the task, Robinson first played in 1946 for the Dodgers' [[minor league]] team, the [[Montreal Royals]], which proved an arduous emotional challenge, but he also enjoyed fervently enthusiastic support from the [[Montreal]] fans.  On April 15, 1947, Robinson broke the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]], which had been tacitly recognized for over 50 years, with his appearance for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] at [[Ebbets Field]].

Eleven weeks later, on July 5, 1947, the [[American League]] was integrated by the signing of [[Larry Doby]] to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Over the next few years a handful of black baseball players made appearances in the majors, including [[Roy Campanella]] (teammate to Robinson in Brooklyn) and [[Satchel Paige]] (teammate to Doby in Cleveland).&lt;ref name=break&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coe.ksu.edu/nlbemuseum/resource/lps/BarrierBreakers.pdf |title=Barrier Breakers (Negro League Baseball Museum)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paige, who had pitched more than 2400 innings in the Negro Leagues, sometimes two and three games a day, was still effective at 42, and still playing at 59. His ERA in the Major Leagues was 3.29.

However, the initial pace of [[Racial integration|integration]] was slow. By 1953, only six of the sixteen major league teams had a black player on the roster.&lt;ref name=&quot;P111&quot;&gt;[[#Powers|Powers]] (2003), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Red Sox]] became the last major league team to integrate their roster with the addition of [[Pumpsie Green]] and [[Ozzie Virgil, Sr.|Ozzie Virgil]] on July 21, 1959.&lt;ref name=break/&gt; While limited in numbers, the on-field performance of early black major league players was outstanding. In the fourteen years from 1947–1960, black players won one or more of the [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] awards nine times.&lt;ref name=break/&gt;

While never prohibited in the same fashion as African Americans, [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] players also benefitted greatly from the integration era. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born [[Chico Carrasquel]] and Cuban-born (and black) [[Minnie Miñoso]], became the first Hispanic [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Stars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;P111&quot;/&gt;

According to some baseball historians, Robinson and the other African American players helped reestablish the importance of baserunning and similar elements of play that were previously de-emphasized by the predominance of power hitting.

From 1947 to the 1970s, African American participation in baseball rose steadily. By 1974, 27% of baseball players were African American.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/Story?id=3001708&amp;page=1 |title=Where Are the Blacks in Major League baseball? |date=April 2, 2007 |first=Rebecca |last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this on-field experience, minorities began to experience long-delayed gains in managerial positions within baseball. In 1975, [[Frank Robinson]] (who had been the 1956 [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] with the [[Cincinnati Reds]]) was named player-manager of the [[Cleveland Indians]], making him the first African American manager in the major leagues.

Although these front-office gains continued, Major League Baseball saw a lengthy slow decline in the percentage of black players after the mid-1970s. By 2007, black players made up less than 9% of the major leagues. While this trend is largely attributed to an increased emphasis on the recruitment of players from Latin America (with the number of Hispanic players in the major leagues rising to 29% by 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/aug/13/blacks-hispanics-not-on-the-same-team/ |publisher=Washington Times |title=Blacks, Hispanics not on the same team |date=08-13-2007 accessdate=04-20-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9561056 |title=Frank Robinson on Jackie Robinson's Legacy |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |date=April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;), other factors have been cited as well. [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] player [[Dave Winfield]], for instance, has cited the fact that urban America places less emphasis and provides less resources for youth baseball than in the past.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Despite this continued prevalence of Hispanic players, the percentage of black players rose again in 2008 to 10.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4070584|title=Study: Black players increased in 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2009 |date=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arturo Moreno]] became the first Hispanic owner of a MLB franchise when he purchased the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] in 2004.

In 2005, a Racial and Gender Report Card on Major League Baseball was issued, which generally found positive results on the inclusion of African Americans and Latinos in baseball, and gave Major League Baseball a grade of &quot;A&quot; or better for opportunities for players, managers and coaches as well as for MLB's central office.&lt;ref name=Lapchick&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050414 |title=Where's the next D-Train? |first=Richard |last=Lapchick}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, 37% of major league players were people of color: Latino (26 percent), African-American (9 percent) or Asian (2 percent). Also by 2004, 29% of the professional staff in MLB's central office were people of color, 11% of team vice presidents were people of color, and seven of the league's managers were of color (four African-Americans and three Latinos).&lt;ref name=Lapchick/&gt;

==The Major Leagues move west==
{{see|Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s-1960s}}
Baseball had been in the West for almost as long as the National League and the American League had been around. It evolved into the [[Pacific Coast League]], which included the [[Hollywood Stars]], [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland Oaks]], [[Portland Beavers]], [[Sacramento Solons]], [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]], [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]], [[Seattle Rainiers]].

The PCL was huge in the West. A member of the [[Minor League Baseball|National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]], it kept losing great players to the National and the American leagues for less than $8,000 a player.

The PCL was far more independent than the other &quot;minor&quot; leagues, and rebelled continuously against their Eastern masters. Clarence [[Pants Rowland]], the President of the PCL, took on baseball commissioners [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] and [[Happy Chandler]] at first to get better equity from the major leagues, then to form a third major league. His efforts were rebuffed by both commissioners. Chandler and several of the owners, who saw the value of the markets in the West, started to plot the extermination of the PCL. They had one thing that Rowland did not: The financial power of the Eastern major league baseball establishment.

No one was going to back a PCL club building a major-league size stadium if the National or the American League was going to build one too, and potentially put the investment in the PCL ballpark into jeopardy.

===1953–1955===
Until the 1950s, major league baseball franchises had been largely confined to the northeastern United States, with the teams and their locations having remained unchanged from 1903 to 1952. The first team to relocate in fifty years was the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]], who moved in 1953 to Milwaukee, where the club set attendance records. In 1954, the St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore and were re-named the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. In 1955, the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] moved to Kansas City.

===National League Baseball leaves New York===
In 1958 the New York market ripped apart. The Yankees were becoming the dominant draw, and the cities of the West offered generations of new fans in much more sheltered markets for the other venerable New York clubs, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]. Placing these storied, powerhouse clubs in the two biggest cities in the West had the specific design of crushing any attempt by the PCL to form a third major league. Eager to bring these big names to the West, Los Angeles gave Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour of the city and asked him to pick his spot. The Giants were given the lease to the PCL [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] digs while [[Candlestick Park]] was built for them.

===California===
{{see|Dodgers–Giants rivalry}}
The logical first candidates for major league &quot;expansion&quot; were the same metropolitan areas that had just attracted the Dodgers and Giants. It is said that the Dodgers and Giants—National League rivals in New York City—chose their new cities because Los Angeles (in [[southern California]]) and San Francisco (in [[northern California]]) already had a fierce rivalry{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} (geographical, economic, cultural and political), dating back to the state's founding. The only California expansion team—and also the first in Major League Baseball in over 70 years—was the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] (later the California Angels, the Anaheim Angels, and, as of 2005, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim), who brought the American League to southern California in 1961. Northern California, however, would later gain its own American League team, in 1968, when the [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]] would move again, settling in Oakland, across [[San Francisco Bay]] from the Giants.

===1961–1962===
Along with the Angels, the other 1961 expansion team was the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Washington Senators]], who joined the American League and took over the nation's capital when the [[Washington Senators (1901-1960)#Washington Nationals/Senators: 1901–1960|previous Senators]] moved to Minnesota and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]. 1961 is also noted as being the year in which [[Roger Maris]] surpassed Babe Ruth's single season home run record, hitting 61 for the New York Yankees, albeit in a slightly longer season than Ruth's. To keep pace with the American League—which now had ten teams—the National League likewise expanded to ten teams, in 1962, with the addition of the [[Houston Astros|Houston Colt .45s]] and [[New York Mets]].

[[Image:OaklandColiseum.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, opened in 1966, was built in part to lure the Athletics from Kansas City.]]

===1969===
In 1969, the American League expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], the latter in a longtime PCL stronghold, were admitted to the league. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving to Milwaukee and becoming today's [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. The National League also added two teams that year, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. The Padres were the last of the core PCL teams to be absorbed. The Coast League did not die, though. It reformed, and moved into other markets, and endures to this day as a Class AAA league.

===1972–1998===
In 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area and became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].

In 1977, the American League expanded to fourteen teams, with the newly formed [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Toronto Blue Jays]].  Sixteen years later, in 1993, the National League likewise expanded to fourteen teams, with the newly formed [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]].

Beginning with the 1994 season, both the AL and the NL were divided into three divisions (East, West, and Central), with the addition of a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team (the team with the best record among those finishing in second place) to enable four teams in each league to advance to the preliminary [[Division Series|division series]]. However, due to the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike]] (which canceled the [[1994 World Series]]), the new rules did not go into effect until the [[1995 World Series]].

In 1998, the AL and the NL each added a fifteenth team, for a total of thirty teams in [[Major League Baseball]]. The [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] joined the National League, and the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]—now called simply the Rays—joined the American League. In order to keep the number of teams in each league at an even number (14 – AL, 16 – NL), Milwaukee changed leagues and became a member of the National League.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [[Major League Baseball#League organization]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
In 2005, the Montreal Expos moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], and began play as the [[Washington Nationals]].

==Pitching dominance and rules changes==
[[Image:MLB runs.png|thumb|Graph showing, by year, the average number of runs per MLB game|250px]]
By the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968 [[Carl Yastrzemski]] won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in history. That same year, [[Detroit Tigers]] pitcher [[Denny McLain]] won 31 games — making him the last pitcher to win 30 games in a season. [[St. Louis Cardinals]] starting pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12.

In response to these events, major league baseball implemented certain rules changes in 1969 to benefit the batters. The pitcher's mound was lowered, and the [[strike zone]] was reduced.

In 1973 the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, made a move to increase scoring even further by initiating the [[designated hitter]] rule.

==Players assert themselves==

[[File:Sandy Koufax.jpg |thumb|180px|Hall of Famer [[Sandy Koufax]], who refused to re-sign his contract]]
From the time of the formation of the Major Leagues to the 1960s, when it came to the control of the game of baseball the team owners held the whip hand. After the so-called &quot;Brotherhood Strike&quot; of 1890 and the failure of the [[Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players]] and its Players National League, the owners control of the game seemed absolute. It lasted over 70 years despite a number of short-lived players organizations. In 1966, however, the players enlisted the help of [[trade union|labor union]] activist [[Marvin Miller]] to form the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA). The same year, [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]] – both [[Cy Young Award]] winners for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] – refused to re-sign their contracts, and the era of the reserve clause, which held players to one team, was coming toward an end.

The first legal challenge came in 1970. Backed by the MLBPA, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] outfielder [[Curt Flood]] took the leagues to court to negate a player trade, citing the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] and [[antitrust]] legislation. In 1972 he finally lost his case in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] by a vote of 5 to 3, but gained large-scale public sympathy, and the damage had been done. The reserve clause survived, but it had been irrevocably weakened. In 1975 [[Andy Messersmith]] of the Dodgers and [[Dave McNally]] of the [[Montreal Expos]] played without contracts, and then declared themselves free agents in response to an arbitrator's ruling. Handcuffed by concessions made in the Flood case, the owners had no choice but to accept the collective bargaining package offered by the MLBPA, and the reserve clause was effectively ended, to be replaced by the current system of free-agency and arbitration.

While the legal challenges were going on, the game continued. In 1969 the [[New York Mets|&quot;Miracle Mets&quot;]], just 7 years after their formation, recorded their first winning season, won the National League East and finally the World Series.

On the field, the 1970s saw some of the longest standing records fall and the rise of two powerhouse dynasties. In Oakland, the [[Oakland Athletics|Swinging A's]] were overpowering, winning the Series in '72, '73 and '74, and five straight division titles. The strained relationships between teammates, who included [[Catfish Hunter]], [[Vida Blue]] and [[Reggie Jackson]], gave the lie to the need for &quot;chemistry&quot; between players. The National League, on the other hand, belonged to the [[Cincinnati Reds|Big Red Machine]] in Cincinnati, where [[Sparky Anderson]]'s team, which included [[Pete Rose]] as well as [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] Tony Perez, [[Johnny Bench]] and [[Joe Morgan]], succeeded the A's run in 1975.

The decade also contained great individual achievements as well. On April 8, 1974, [[Hank Aaron]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]] hit his 715th career home run, surpassing [[Babe Ruth]]'s all-time record. He would retire in 1976 with 755. There was great pitching too: between 1973 and 1975, [[Nolan Ryan]] threw 4 [[no-hitter|&quot;no-hit&quot; game]]s. He would add a record-breaking fifth in 1981 and two more before his retirement in 1993, by which time he had also accumulated 5,715 strikeouts, another record, in a 27-year career.

==The marketing and hype era==
{{cleanup|section|date=September 2007}}
From the 1980s onward, the major league game has changed dramatically from a combination of effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility. These events lead to greater labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, changes in the way that the game is played, and problems with the use of performance enhancing substances like [[steroids]] tainting the race for records. Through this period crowds generally rose. Average attendances first broke 20,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1993. That year total attendance hit 70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records.

===The science of the sport changes the game===
During the 1980s, the science of conditioning and workouts greatly improved. Weight rooms and training equipment were improved. Trainers and doctors developed better diets and regimens to make athletes bigger, healthier, and stronger than they had ever been.

Another major change that had been occurring during this time was the adoption of the [[pitch count]]. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now pitching coaches watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 125 to 175, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms. Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.

Along with the expansion of teams, the addition of more pitchers needed to play a complete game stressed the total number of quality players available in a system that restricted its talent searches at that time to America, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

===Television===
Baseball had been watched live since the mid 20th century. Television sports' arrival in the 1950s increased attention and revenue for all major league clubs at first. The television programming was extremely regional. It hurt the minor and independent leagues most. People stayed home to watch [[Maury Wills]] rather than watch unknowns at their local baseball park. Major League Baseball, as it always did, made sure that it controlled rights and fees charged for the broadcasts of all games, just as it did on radio. It brought additional revenues and attention both from the broadcast itself, and from the increases in attendance and merchandise sales that expanded audiences allowed.

The national networks began televising national games of the week, opening the door for a national audience to see particular clubs. While most teams were broadcast, emphasis was always on the league leaders and the major market franchises that could draw the largest audience.

===The rise of cable===
In the 1970s the cable revolution began. The Atlanta Braves became a power contender with greater revenues generated by [[TBS (TV network)|WTBS]], [[Ted Turner]]'s Atlanta-based Super-Station, that broadcast &quot;America's Team&quot; to cable households nationwide. The roll out of [[ESPN]], then regional sports networks (now mostly under the umbrella of [[Fox Sports Net]]) changed sports news and particularly impacted baseball. Potboiled down to the thirty-second game highlight, and now under the microscope of news organizations that needed to fill 24 hours of time, the amount of attention paid to major league players magnified to staggering levels from where it had been just 20 years prior.

It brought with it increased attention for individual players, who reached super-star status nationwide on careers that often were not as compelling as those who had come before them in a less media intense time.

As player contract values soared, and the number of broadcasters, commentators, columnists, and sports writers also soared. The competition for a fresh angle on any story became fierce. Media pundits began questioning the high salaries that the players received. Coverage began to become intensely negative. Players personal lives, which had always been off-limits unless something extreme happened, became the fodder of editorials, insider stories on television, and features in magazines. When the use of performance-enhancing drugs became an issue, the gap between the sports media and the players whom they covered widened further.

With the development of [[satellite television]] and [[digital cable]], Major League Baseball launched baseball channels with season subscription fees, making it possible for fans to watch virtually every game played as they played.

====Team Networks====
The next round became the single-team cable networks. [[YES Network]] &amp; NESN, the New York Yankees &amp; Boston Red Sox cable television networks, took in millions to broadcast games not only in New York and Boston but around the country. These networks generated as much revenue or more annually for large market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox as their entire baseball operations did. By making these separate companies, these owners were able to exclude the money from consideration of deals.

===Sponsorships, endorsements, &amp; merchandise===
Television and greater media coverage in magazines and newspapers trying to attract a new generation of non-readers also brought in the sponsors, and even more money, that would attract players to new financial opportunities and bring in other elements to the business of baseball that would impact the game.

Baseball memorabilia and souvenirs, including baseball cards, exploded in price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading. This would explode yet again in the late 1990s, as the [[Internet]], and the website [[eBay]] provided venues for collectors of all things baseball to trade with each other. Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values. This in turn brought in new businessmen whose sole means of making a living was acquiring autographs and memorabilia from the athletes. Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.

Beyond the staple billboards, large corporations like NIKE and Champion fought to make sure that their logos were seen on the clothing and shoes worn by athletes on the field. This kind of association branding became a new revenue stream. In the late 1990s and into the dawn of the 21st century, the dugout, the backstops behind home plate, and anywhere else that might be seen by a camera all became fair game for inserting advertising.

===Player wealth and influence===
Players who had been dramatically underpaid for generations were now replaced by players who were paid extremely well for their services.

*'''Sports agents'''
By the 1970s a new generation of [[sports agents]] were hawking the talents of players who knew baseball but didn't know how the business end of the game was played. The agents broke down what the teams were generating in revenue off of the players' performances. They calculated what their player might be worth to energize a television contract, or provide more merchandise revenue, or put more fans into seats.

*'''Side deals'''
The athletes signed shoe deals, baseball card sponsorships, and commercial endorsements for products of every size and shape.

*'''Business and strategy changes'''
Sky high salaries also changed many of the strategies of the game. Players rarely were &quot;sent&quot; down to the minors if they failed to perform.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Who could justify paying a slumping player millions to sit in Toledo where the major league fans couldn't pay their way? Other players in the Triple-A level of the minor leagues, who used to rise on merit, became trapped under these overpaid &quot;stars.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also, in order to make the media happy, trades, rather than call-ups, became the order of the day.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} It was much better to buy someone else's shortstop who was a known quantity to the national sports media than to take a chance on a player with no name value and no visibility if you were in a major market ballclub.

Tactics on the field changed too. Risky moves that could get players hurt, and sideline millions of dollars in payroll on the disabled list, became less common. Stealing home, a popular tactic of great stars of the day like Ty Cobb or Pete Rose, became infrequent occurrences.

The perception of players by the general public changed from larger-than-life heroes to a more cynical view of many of them as spoiled and overpaid.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This was fed by the growing legions of television reporters, commentators, and print sports writers who also started asking questions about what justified the kind of money being paid to these players.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

With players seeking greener pastures when their contracts came up, fewer players became career members of one ballclub. In the modern era, it is unusual to see a player stay with any one club for more than a few years if they are good enough to command a better salary.

Players with any ability increasingly gravitated towards the money.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Large market clubs like the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, and the Chicago Cubs given big revenues from their cable television operations signed more and more of the big name players away from mid-sized and smaller market baseball clubs that could not afford to compete with them for salaries.

===Owners and players feud in the 1980s===
All was not well with the game. The many contractual disputes between players and owners came to a head in 1981. Previous players' strikes (in 1972, 1973 and 1980) had been held in preseason, with only the 1972 [[1972 Major League Baseball strike|stoppage]] — over benefits — causing disruption to the regular season from April 1 to April 13. Also, in 1976 the owners had locked the players out of [[Spring training]] in a dispute over [[free agent|free agency]].

The crux of the 1981 dispute was about compensation for the loss of players to free agency. After losing a top-rank player in such a way the owners wanted a mid-rank player in return, the so-called ''sixteenth player'' (each club was allowed to protect 15 players from this rule). Losing lower rated free agents would have correspondingly smaller compensation. The players, only recently freed from the bondage of the reserve clause, found this unacceptable, and withdrew their labor, [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|striking]] on June 12. Immediately, the U.S. Government [[National Labor Relations Board]] ruled that the owners had not been negotiating in good faith, and installed a federal mediator to reach a solution. Seven weeks and 713 games were lost in the middle of the season, before the owners backed down on July 31, settling for much lower ranked players as compensation. By then much of the season had been lost, and the season was continued as distinct halves starting August 9, with the playoffs reorganized to reflect this.

Throughout the 1980s then, baseball seemed to prosper. The competitive balance between franchises saw fifteen different teams make the [[World Series]], and nine different champions during the decade. Also, every season from 1978 through 1987 saw a different World Series winner, a streak unprecedented in baseball history. Turmoil was, however, just around the corner. In 1986 [[Pete Rose]] retired from playing for the [[Cincinnati Reds]], having broken [[Ty Cobb]]'s record by accumulating 4,256 hits during his career. He continued as Reds manager until, in 1989 it was revealed that he was being investigated for sports gambling, including the possibility that he had bet on teams with which he was involved. While Rose admitted a gambling problem, he denied having bet on baseball. Federal prosecutor John Dowd investigated and, on his recommendation, Rose was banned from organised baseball, a move which precluded his possible inclusion in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]]. In a meeting with Commissioner [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Giamatti]], Rose, having failed in a legal action to prevent it, accepted his punishment. It was, essentially, the same fate that had befallen the Black Sox seventy years previously. (Rose, however, would continue to deny that he bet on baseball until he finally confessed to it in his 2004 autobiography.)

===Strike two (1994)===
{{Main|1994 Major League Baseball strike}}
Labor relations were still strained. There had been a two-day strike in 1985 (over the division of television revenue money), and a [[1990 Major League Baseball lockout|32-day spring training lockout]] in 1990 (again over salary structure and benefits). By far the worst action would come in 1994. The seeds were sown earlier: in 1992 the owners sought to renegotiate salary and [[free agent|free-agency]] terms, but little progress was made. The standoff continued until the beginning of 1994 when the existing agreement expired, with no agreement on what was to replace it. Adding to the problems was the perception that &quot;small market&quot; teams, such as the struggling [[Seattle Mariners]] could not compete with high spending teams such as those in [[New York Yankees|New York]] or [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]]. Their plan was to institute TV [[revenue sharing]] to increase equity amongst the teams and impose a [[salary cap]] to keep expenditures down. Players felt that such a cap would reduce their potential earnings.

The players officially went on strike on August 12, 1994. In September 1994 Major League Baseball announced the cancellation of the [[World Series]] for the first time since 1904.

===Home run mania and the second coming of baseball===
[[Image:Mark mcgwire.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Mark McGwire]] hits a home run during his last Major League season in 2001]]
The cancellation of the [[1994 World Series]] was a severe embarrassment for Major League Baseball. Americans were cursed, outraged, frightened, angered, frustrated, and plagued to their core as a result of the strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActOfWar&quot;/&gt; Fans had declared the strike as an act of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActOfWar&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Maske, Mike|title=After the Strike, Baseball's Disgusted Fans Decide to Strike Back|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 30, 1995|page=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were few signs of the predicted &quot;outrage&quot; on the part of the fans, attendance figures and broadcast ratings were lower in 1995 than before the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]. However, it would be a decade until baseball would recover from the strike.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

On September 6, 1995, [[Baltimore Orioles]] [[shortstop]] [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] played his 2,131st consecutive game, breaking [[Lou Gehrig]]'s 56-year-old record. This was the first high-profile moment in baseball after the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]. Ripken continued his streak for another three years, voluntarily ending it at 2,632 [[MLB consecutive games played streaks|consecutive games played]] on September 20, 1998.

In 1997, the [[Florida Marlins]] won the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] in just their fifth season. This made them the youngest expansion team to win the Fall Classic (with the exception of the 1903 [[Boston Red Sox]] and later the 2001 [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], who won in their fourth season). Virtually all the key players on the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|1997 Marlins]] team were soon traded or let go to save payroll costs (although the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|2003 Marlins]] did win a second [[2003 World Series|world championship]]).

1998 was what many consider to be one of the game's greatest seasons. [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[first baseman]] [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Chicago Cubs]] [[outfielder]] [[Sammy Sosa]] that year engaged in a [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|home run race]] for the ages. With both rapidly approaching [[Roger Maris]]'s record of 61 home runs (set in 1961), seemingly the entire nation watched as the two power hitters raced to be the first to break the record. McGwire reached 62 first on September 8, 1998, with Sosa also eclipsing it later. Sosa finished with 66 home runs, just behind McGwire's unheard-of 70. However, recent [[anabolic steroid|steroid]] allegations have marred the season in the minds of many fans.

That same year, the [[New York Yankees]] won a record 125 games, including going 11–2 in the postseason, to win the World Series as what many consider to be one of the greatest teams of all time.

McGwire's record of 70 would last a mere three years following the meteoric rise of veteran [[San Francisco Giants]] [[left fielder]] [[Barry Bonds]] in 2001. In 2001 Bonds knocked out 73 [[List of Major League Baseball home run champions|home runs]], breaking the record set by McGwire by hitting his 71st on October 5, 2001. In addition to the home run record, Bonds also set single-season marks for [[base on balls]] with 177 (breaking the previous record of 170, set by [[Babe Ruth]] in 1923) and [[slugging percentage]] with .863 (breaking the mark of .847 set by Ruth in 1920). Bonds continued his torrid home run hitting in the next few seasons, hitting his 660th career home run on April 12, 2004, tying him with his godfather [[Willie Mays]] for third place on the all-time career [[List of top 500 Major League Baseball home run hitters|home run]] list. He hit his 661st home run the next day, April 13, to take sole possession of third place. Only three years later Bonds surpassed the great Hank Aaron to become baseball's most prolific home run hitter.

However, both Bonds' accomplishments in the 2000s have not been without controversy. During his run, journalists questioned McGwire about his use of the steroid-precursor [[androstenedione]], and in March 2005 was unforthcoming when questioned as part of a Congressional inquiry into steroids. Bonds has also has been dogged by allegations of steroid use and his involvement in the [[BALCO]] drugs scandal, as his personal trainer [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] pled guilty to supplying steroids (without naming Bonds as a recipient). Neither Bonds nor McGwire has failed a drug test at any time since there was no steroid-testing until 2003 after the new August 7, 2002 agreement between owners and players was reached. McGwire retired after the 2001 season.

The 1990s also saw Major League Baseball expand into new markets as four new teams joined the league. In 1993, the [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]] began play, and in just their fifth year of existence, the Marlins became the first wild card team to win the championship. {{See|1997 World Series}}

The year 1998 brought two more teams into the mix, the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] and the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], the latter of which become the youngest expansion franchise to win the championship. {{See|2001 World Series}}

For the most part, the late 1990s were dominated by the [[New York Yankees]], who won four out of five [[World Series]] championships from 1996–2000. However, this may nor may not have happened if the strike in 1994 had not happened, as they had the best record in the American League that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Costello|first=Brian|title ='94 YANKS CUT SHORT|work=[[New York Post]] |date=August 8, 2004|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yankees1990s&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Amore|first=Dom|title=IMAGINE: [[Buck Showalter|BUCK]]'S YANKEES, BUT NOT [[Derek Jeter|JETER]]'S|work=[[The Hartford Courant]]|date=May 15, 2005|page=E8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Strike&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Curry|first=Jack|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/26/sports/baseball-lost-games-lost-dreams.html?pagewanted=print|title=Lost Games, Lost Dreams|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 26, 2002|page=D1|authorlink=Jack Curry}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Yankees dynasty began, the team, like baseball itself, was still reeling from the strike and the lost opportunities from 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yankees1990s&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Strike&quot;/&gt;

==The steroid era==
===Drugs, baseball, and records===
The lure of big money pushed players harder and harder to perform at their peaks. There is only so much conditioning that one can do to obtain an edge without inducing injury. The wearying travel schedule and 162-game season meant that [[amphetamine]]s, usually in the form of pep pills known as &quot;greenies&quot;, had been widespread in baseball since at least the 1960s. Baseball's drug scene was no particular secret, having been discussed in [[Sports Illustrated]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1969/0623.html |title=SI.com – Jun. 23, 1969 |publisher=Dynamic.si.cnn.com |date=June 23, 1969 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Jim Bouton]]'s groundbreaking book ''[[Ball Four]],'' but there was virtually no public backlash.  Two decades later, however, some Major League players turned to newer [[performance enhancing drugs]], including [[ephedra]] and improved [[steroids]].

A memo circulated in 1991 by baseball commissioner [[Fay Vincent]] said, &quot;The possession, sale or use of any illegal drug or controlled substance by Major League players and personnel is strictly prohibited ... [and those players involved] are subject to discipline by the Commissioner and risk permanent expulsion from the game.... This prohibition applies to all illegal drugs and controlled substances, including steroids…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/tom_verducci/04/05/week1.mailbag/1.html|author=Tom Verducci|title=Circus Act|date=April 5, 2006|accessdate=June 19, 2006|publisher=Sports Illustrated|work=SI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some general managers of the time do not remember this memo, and it was not emphasized or enforced.

Ephedra, a Chinese herb used to cure cold symptoms, and also used in some allergy medications, sped up the heart and was considered by some to be a weight-loss short-cut. Overweight pitcher [[Steve Bechler]], who wanted to stay on the Baltimore Orioles roster, took just such a shortcut. He collapsed on February 17, 2003 while pitching, and was soon pronounced dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorleaguenews.com/features/articles2003/030703.html|title=Bechler Death Spotlights Ephedra|accessdate=July 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bechler's death raised concerns over the use of performance enhancing drugs in baseball. Ephedra was banned, and soon the furor died down.

The 1998 home run race had generated nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds run for the all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's [[testosterone]] level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease. Some athletes have said that the main advantage to steroids is not so much the additional power or endurance that they can provide, but that they can drastically shorten rehab time from injury.

Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] imposed a very strict anti-drug policy upon its minor league players, who are not part of the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (the PA). Random drug testing, education and treatment, and strict penalties for those caught were the rule of law. Anyone on a Major League team's forty man roster, including 15 minor leaguers that are on that list, were exempt from that program. Some called Selig's move a public relations stunt, or window dressing.

In a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' cover story in 2002, a year after his retirement, [[Ken Caminiti]] admitted that he had used steroids during his National League MVP-winning 1996 season, and for several seasons afterwards. Caminiti died unexpectedly of an apparent heart attack in [[The Bronx]] at the age of 41; he was pronounced dead on October 10, 2004 at New York's [[Lincoln Hospital (Bronx, New York)|Lincoln Memorial Hospital]]. On November 1, the New York City Medical Examiners Office announced that Caminiti died from &quot;acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and opiates,&quot; but coronary artery disease and cardiac hypertrophy (an enlarged heart) were also contributing factors.

In 2005, [[José Canseco]] published ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits &amp; How Baseball Got Big]]'' admitting steroid usage and claiming that it was prevalent throughout major league baseball. When the United States Congress decided to investigate the use of steroids in the sport, some of the games most prominent players came under scrutiny for possibly using steroids. These include [[Barry Bonds]], [[Jason Giambi]], and [[Mark McGwire]]. Other players, such as Canseco and [[Gary Sheffield]], have admitted to have either knowingly (in Canseco's case) or not (Sheffield's) using steroids. In confidential testimony to the [[BALCO]] [[Grand Jury]] (that was later leaked to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''), Giambi also admitted steroid use. He later held a press conference in which he appeared to affirm this admission, without actually saying the words. And after an appearance before Congress where he (unlike McGwire) emphatically denied using steroids, &quot;period,&quot; slugger [[Rafael Palmeiro]] became the first major star to be suspended (10 days) on August 1, 2005 for violating Major League Baseball's newly strengthened ban on controlled substances, including steroids, adopted on August 7, 2002, starting in the 2003 season. Many lesser players (mostly from the minor leagues) have tested positive for use, as well.

In 2006, the Commissioner of Baseball tasked former United States Senator George J. Mitchell to lead an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball (MLB) and on December 13, 2007, the 409-page [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]] was released ('Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball'). The report described the use of anabolic steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) in MLB and assessed the effectiveness of the MLB Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Mitchell also advanced certain recommendations regarding the handling of past illegal drug use and future prevention practices. The report names 89 MLB players who are alleged to have used steroids or drugs.

Baseball has been taken to task for turning a blind eye to its drug problems. It benefited from these drugs in the ever-increasingly competitive fight for airtime and media attention. MLB and its Players Association finally announced tougher measures, but many felt that they did not go far enough. {{See|List of Major League Baseball players suspended for steroids}}

In December 2009, Sports Illustrated named Baseball's Steroid Scandal as the number one sports story of the decade of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Lee [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/magazine/specials/2000s/12/12/top.stories/index.html &quot;2000s: Top 10 Stories&quot;] SI.com. Retrieved December 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The BALCO steroids scandal===
In 2002, a major scandal arose when it was discovered that a company called [[BALCO]] (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), owned by [[Victor Conte]], had been producing so-called &quot;[[designer steroids]]&quot;, (specifically [[tetrahydrogestrinone|&quot;the clear&quot;]] and &quot;[[the cream]]&quot;) which are steroids that cannot be detected by current drug testing policies. In addition, the company had connections to several [[San Francisco]] Bay Area sports trainers and athletes, including the trainers of [[Jason Giambi]] and [[Barry Bonds]]. This revelation lead to a vast criminal investigation into BALCO's connections with athletes from baseball and many other sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbcenter.com/steriods.php|title=Steroids in Baseball|author=Eric Gartman|accessdate=June 19, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060409065531/http://www.mlbcenter.com/steriods.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During grand jury testimony in December 2003 – which was illegally leaked to the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] and published in December 2004 – Giambi allegedly admitted to using many different steroids, including fertility drugs (which could account for his declining health in the past few years). Bonds said that [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance which others speculated as being &quot;the cream&quot; and &quot;the clear.&quot; The paper reported that these substances were probably designer steroids. Bonds said that at the time he did not believe them to be steroids and thought they were flaxseed oil and other health supplements.

Various baseball pundits, fans, and even players have taken this as confirmation that Bonds used illegal steroids. Bonds never tested positive in tests performed in 2003, 2004, and 2005, which may be attributable to successful obfuscation of continued use as documented in the 2006 book [[Game of Shadows]].

===The Power Age===
[[Image:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|right|To meet the Power Age, [[Citi Field]] was built in New York to favor teams built on pitching, defense, and speed.]]
While the introduction of steroids certainly increased the power production of greats there were other factors that drastically increased the power surge after 1994. The factors cited are: smaller sized ballparks than in the past, &quot;juiced baseballs&quot; implying that the balls are wound tighter thus travel further following contact with the bat, &quot;watered down pitching&quot; implying that lesser quality pitchers are up in the Major Leagues due to too many teams. Albeit that these factors did play a large role in increasing home run thus scoring totals during this time, others that directly impact ballplayers have an equally important role. As noted earlier one of those factors is anabolic steroids which have the capability of increasing muscle mass, which enables hitters to not only hit &quot;mistake&quot; pitches farther, but it also enables hitters to adjust to &quot;good&quot; pitches such as a well-placed fastball, slider, changeup, or curveball, and hit them for home runs{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. Another such factor is better nutrition, as well as training and training facilities/equipment which can work with (or without) steroids to produce a more potent ballplayer and further enhance his skills.

Routinely in today's baseball age we see players reach 40 and 50 home runs in a season, a feat that even in the 1980s was considered rare.  Many modern baseball theorists believe that a new pitch will swing the balance of power back to the pitcher. A pitching revolution would not be unprecedented—several pitches have changed the game of baseball in the past, including the [[slider]] in the 50's and 60's and the [[fastball|split-fingered fastball]] in the 70's to 90's. Since the 1990s, the [[changeup]] has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers such as [[Tim Lincecum]], [[Pedro Martinez]], [[Trevor Hoffman]], [[Greg Maddux]], [[Tom Glavine]], [[Johan Santana]], and [[Cole Hamels]].

The '''Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award''' ('''MVP''') is an annual [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) award given to one outstanding player in the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]]s. Since 1931, it has been awarded by the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]] (BBWAA). The winner receives the [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] Memorial Baseball Award, which is named in honor of the first [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|MLB commissioner]], who served from 1920 to 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN 1763&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=Gary|coauthors=Palmer, Pete|title=The ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia|publisher=Sterling Publishing Co|location=New York City, New York|year=2007|edition=Fourth|page=1763|isbn=978-1-4027-4771-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; MVP voting takes place before the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] but the results are not announced until after the [[World Series]]. The BBWAA began polling three writers in each league city in 1938, reducing that number to two per league city in 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;&gt;Gillette &amp; Palmer, pp. 1764–1765&lt;/ref&gt;

[[First basemen]], with 34&amp;nbsp;winners, have won the most MVPs among [[infielder]]s, followed by [[second basemen]]&amp;nbsp;(16), [[third basemen]]&amp;nbsp;(15), and [[shortstop]]s&amp;nbsp;(14). Of the 23&amp;nbsp;[[pitcher]]s who have won the award, 14 are [[right-handed]] while nine are [[left-handed]]. [[Carl Hubbell]] and [[Hal Newhouser]] are the only pitchers to win multiple times, Newhouser winning consecutively in 1944 and 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;BD 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 2000|title=Major League Baseball's Most Valuable Player Award Winners|journal=Baseball Digest|publisher=Century Publishing Co.|location=Evanston, Illinois|volume=59|issue=12|pages=86–89|issn=0005-609X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=my0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; No pitcher has been named MVP since [[Dennis Eckersley]] in 1992.

==Chalmers Award (1911–1914)==
[[File:Ty-Cobb-1913-NPC-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Ty Cobb]] won the first American League Chalmers Award in 1911 and was at the center of the controversy over the previous season's award.|alt=Ty Cobb looking just to the left of the camera.]]
Before the [[1910 Major League Baseball season|1910 season]], Hugh Chalmers of [[Chalmers Automobile]] announced he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest [[batting average]] in Major League Baseball at the end of the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the [[Detroit Tigers]]' widely disliked&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2tkOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K2oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2104,4686963|title=Mirrors of Sport|last=Doyle|first=Havey|date=July 4, 1941|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|page=18|accessdate=January 19, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014142.html|title=He was a pain ... but a great pain|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Nap Lajoie]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]]. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] hits against the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]]. American League President [[Ban Johnson]] said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway, and Chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot; /&gt;

The [[1911 Major League Baseball season|following season]], Chalmers created the Chalmers Award. A committee of baseball writers were to convene after the season to determine the &quot;most important and useful player to the club and to the league&quot;. Since the award was not as effective at advertising as Chalmers had hoped, it was discontinued after 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot; /&gt;

==League Awards (1922–1929)==
[[File:Babe Ruth2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Babe Ruth]] was ineligible for the award in his famous 1927 season by the rules of the American League award because he had previously won in 1923.|alt=A man in full baseball attire wears a pinstriped jersey and a hat with overlapping white &quot;N&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

==Baseball Writers Association of America's Most Valuable Player (1931–present)==
The BBWAA first awarded the modern MVP after the [[1931 Major League Baseball season|1931 season]], adopting the format the National League used to distribute its league award. One writer in each city with a team filled out a ten-place ballot, with ten points for the recipient of a first-place vote, nine for a second-place vote, and so on. In 1938, the BBWAA raised the number of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then occurred in 1961, when the number of voters was lowered to two per league city.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot; /&gt;

In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''Rookie of the Year Award''' is annually given to one player from each league as voted on by the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]] (BBWAA). The award was established in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA, which selected an annual winner from 1940 through 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vass&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=History of the rookie award filled with controversy |journal=Baseball Digest |last=Vass |first=George |date=July 1998 |volume=57 |issue=7 |issn=0005-609X |pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award became national in 1947; [[Jackie Robinson]], the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]]' [[first baseman]], won the inaugural award. One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor has been given to one player each in the [[National League|National]] and [[American League]]. Originally, the award was known as the [[J. Louis Comiskey]] Memorial Award, named after the [[Chicago White Sox]] owner of the 1930s. The award was renamed the '''Jackie Robinson Award''' in July 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sports News |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=1987-07-14 |accessdate=2009-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 40 years after Jackie Robinson broke the [[baseball color line]].

Of the 128 players named Rookie of the Year, 14 have been elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]]—Jackie Robinson, five American League players, and eight others from the National League. The award has been shared twice: once by [[Butch Metzger]] and [[Pat Zachry]] of the National League in 1976; and once by [[John Castino]] and [[Alfredo Griffin]] of the American League in 1979. Members of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers have won the most awards of any franchise (with 16), twice the total of the [[New York Yankees]] (eight), who have produced the most in the American League. [[Fred Lynn]] and [[Ichiro Suzuki]] are the only two players who have been named Rookie of the Year and [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in the same year, and [[Fernando Valenzuela]] is the only player to have won Rookie of the Year and the [[Cy Young Award]] in the same year.

==Qualifications and voting==
[[File:HideoNomo.png|thumb|right|200px|alt=A man stretches his arms behind his head while wearing a baseball glove and a white baseball uniform with green sleeves and cap.|[[Hideo Nomo]] won in 1995, the first of several players to win with past professional baseball experience in [[Nippon Professional Baseball]].]]
From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter used discretion as to who qualified as a rookie. In 1957, the term was first defined as someone with fewer than 75 [[at bat]]s or 45 [[innings pitched]] in any previous Major League season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vass&quot;/&gt; This guideline was later amended to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vass&quot;/&gt; The current standard of 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (excluding time in [[military service]] or on the [[disabled list]]) before September 1 was adopted in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vass&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/rules_regulations.jsp |title=MLB Miscellany: Rules, regulations and statistics |accessdate=2008-07-10 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, each voter names three rookies: a first-place choice is given five points, a second-place choice three points, and a third-place choice one point. The award goes to the player who receives the most overall points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vass&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;almanac&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_roy.shtml |title=Rookie of the Year Award / Jackie Robinson Award |accessdate=2008-07-24 |date=2008 |publisher=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edinson Volquez]] received three second-place votes in 2008 balloting despite no longer being a rookie under the award's definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;longosoto&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081110&amp;content_id=3672838 |title=Longoria, Soto are Rookies of the Year |accessdate=2009-09-09 |date=2008-11-10 |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=1107 |title=The BBWAA and Edinson Volquez |accessdate=2009-09-09 |date=2008-11-16 |publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award has drawn criticism in recent years because several players with experience in [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] (NPB) have won the award, such as [[Hideo Nomo]] in 1995, [[Kazuhiro Sasaki]] in 2000, and Ichiro Suzuki in 2001. The current definition of rookie status for the award is based only on Major League experience, but some feel that past NPB players are not true rookies because of their past professional experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnrookie&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1658488 |title=Berroa barely edges Matsui for AL honor |accessdate=2008-07-10 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Wayne |last=Graczyk |title=MLB should eliminate 'rookie' label for Japanese veterans |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20070527wg.html |publisher=''[[The Japan Times]]'' |date=2007-05-27 |accessdate=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue arose in 2003 when [[Hideki Matsui]] narrowly lost the AL award to [[Ángel Berroa]]. [[Jim Souhan]] of the ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' said he did not see Matsui as a rookie in 2003 because &quot;it would be an insult to the Japanese league to pretend that experience didn't count.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;espnrookie&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Japan Times]]'' ran a story in 2007 on the labeling of [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]], [[Kei Igawa]], and [[Hideki Okajima]] as rookies, saying &quot;[t]hese guys aren't rookies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;/&gt; Past winners such as Jackie Robinson, [[Don Newcombe]], and Sam Jethroe had professional experience in the [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]].

In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''National League Championship Series''' ('''NLCS''') is a round in the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] that determines who wins the [[National League]] pennant and advances to [[Major League Baseball]]'s championship, the [[World Series]], facing the winner of the [[American League Championship Series]]. The reigning National League Champions are the [[San Francisco Giants]].

Prior to [[1969 in baseball|1969]], the National League champion (the &quot;[[List of National League pennant winners|pennant winner]]&quot;) was determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season. There were four ''ad hoc'' three-game playoff series due to ties under this formulation (in [[1946 in baseball|1946]], [[1951 in baseball|1951]], [[1959 in baseball|1959]] and [[1962 in baseball|1962]]), as also happened once ([[1948 in baseball|1948]]) in the [[American League]] (the AL, however, used a single-game playoff).

A structured postseason series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In [[1985 in baseball|1985]], the format changed to best-of-seven.

The NLCS and ALCS, since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 2–3–2 format: Since 1995, games 1, 2, 6 and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home field advantage, and Games 3, 4 and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. Home field advantage is given to the team that has the better record, with the exception that the team that made the postseason as the [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|Wild Card]] team cannot get home field advantage. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage was alternated between divisions each year regardless of regular season record.

In [[1981 in baseball|1981]], a [[1981 National League Division Series|divisional series]] was held due to a split season caused by a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]].

In [[1994 in baseball|1994]], the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, the [[National League Division Series]] (NLDS). The winners of that round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS. The NLDS was first played in 1995 due to the cancellation of the 1994 postseason during another players' strike.

The [[Milwaukee Brewers]] are the only National League team not to have played in the NLCS. However, the Brewers, as an American League team from 1969 through 1997, played in and won the [[1982 American League Championship Series]].

==Most Valuable Player Award==
:''See: [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award#National League winners]]''
A Most Valuable Player ([[MVP]]) award is given to the outstanding player in each series, though voters can consider performances made during the divisional series.  The MVP award has been given to a player on the losing team twice, in 1986 to Mike Scott of the Houston Astros and in 1987 to Jeff Leonard of the San Francisco Giants.

Although the National League began its LCS MVP award in 1977, the American League did not begin its LCS MVP award till 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_lcs.jsp?feature=mvp League Championship Series Most Valuable Players] (MLB.com/News/Awards/History/ ).

{{Mlbplayoffs}}
In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''American League Championship Series''' ('''ALCS'''), played in October, is a round in the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] that determines the winner of the [[American League]] pennant. The winner of the series advances to play the winner of the [[National League Championship Series]] in [[baseball]]'s championship, the [[World Series]].

It started in [[1969 in baseball|1969]], when the American League was reorganized into two divisions, East and West. The winners of each division played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In [[1985 in baseball|1985]], the format changed to best-of-seven. In [[1994 in baseball|1994]], the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, known as the [[American League Division Series]] or ALDS. The winners of that round then advanced to the best-of-seven ALCS. This is the system currently in use.

The ALCS and NLCS, since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 2–3–2 format: Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has [[home field advantage]], and Games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. The series concludes when one team records its fourth win. Since 1995, home field advantage has been given to the team that has the better regular season record, unless that team happens to be the Wild Card team. In that case, the other team gets home field advantage, because by rule the Wild Card team is never allowed home field advantage in a Division Series or LCS. In the event that both teams have identical records in the regular season, home field advantage goes to the team that has the winning head-to-head record. From 1969-1993, home field advantage alternated between the two divisions.

==Most Valuable Player Award==
:''See: [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award#American League winners]]''
The [[Lee MacPhail#Lee MacPhail MVP Award|Lee MacPhail]] Most Valuable Player (MVP) award is given to the outstanding player in the ALCS. No MVP award is given for Division Series play.

      <comment>/* Determining the matchups */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''American League Division Series''' ('''ALDS''') determines which two teams from the [[American League]] will advance to the [[American League Championship Series]]. The Division Series consists of two concurrent best-of-five series, featuring the three division winners and a [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team (the non-division winning team with the best record).

==History==
The Division Series was implemeneted in 1981 as a result of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|midseason strike]] with first place teams before the strike taking on the first place teams after.  After 1993, it was implemented for good when Major League Baseball restructured each league into three divisions, but their next playing was in 1995 due to the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|cancellation of the 1994 playoffs]].  In 1981, a split-season format forced the first ever divisional playoff series, in which the [[1981 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] won the Eastern Division series over the [[1981 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] (who were in the American League until 1998) in five games while the [[1981 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] swept the [[1981 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] in three games in the Western Division. The Yankees have currently played in the most division series in history, with fifteen appearances.  The [[Toronto Blue Jays]] are the only team to have never played in the ALDS and are the last team to win the World Series under the old 4 division format.

===Determining the matchups===
Since 1998, the wild-card team has been assigned to play the division winner with the best winning percentage (outside of their own division) in one series, and the other two division winners meet in the other series. However, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record are from the same division, the wild-card team plays the division winner with the second-best record, and the remaining two division leaders play. The two series winners move on to the best-of-seven ALCS.  Home field advantage goes to the team with the better regular season record, except for the wild card team, which never receives the home field advantage.

Beginning in 2007, MLB has implemented a new rule to give the team from the league that wins the All-Star Game with the best regular season record a slightly greater advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= 2007-09-12 | title = AL's top team to pick first-round format | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2007-09-11-Options_N.htm | publisher = [[USA Today]] | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | first=Bob | last=Nightengale}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to spread out the Division Series games for broadcast purposes, the two ALDS series follow one of two off-day schedules. Starting in 2007, after consulting the [[MLBPA]], MLB has decided to allow the team with the best record in the league that wins the All-Star Game to choose whether to use the seven-day schedule (1-2-off-3-4-off-5) or the eight-day schedule (1-off-2-off-3-4-off-5). The team only gets to choose the schedule; the opponent is still determined by win-loss records.

Currently,{{When|date=February 2011}} the Division Series follows a 2-2-1 format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/news/pressbox_story.jsp?ymd=20070514&amp;content_id=1964536&amp;vkey=pressbox&amp;fext=.jsp Major League Baseball announces revamped postseason schedule], MLB.com Press Releases&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher seed plays at home in Games 1 and 2.  The lower seed plays at home in Game 3 and Game 4 (if necessary).  If a Game 5 is needed, the teams return to the higher seed's field.

Historically, MLB had also used a 2-3 format in a best-of-5 series, but no longer uses that format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1984_NLCS.shtml 1984 NL Championship Series], Baseball-Reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1997_ALDS1.shtml 1997 AL Division Series], Baseball-Reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''National League Division Series''' ('''NLDS''') determine which two teams from the [[National League]] will advance to the [[National League Championship Series]]. The Division Series consist of two best-of-five series, featuring the three division winners and a [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team.

==History==
The Division Series was implemeneted in 1981 as a result of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|midseason strike]] with first place teams before the strike taking on the first place teams after.  After 1993, it was implemented for good when Major League Baseball restructured each league into three divisions, but their next playing was in 1995 due to the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|cancellation of the 1994 playoffs]].  Previously, because of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] in [[1981 in baseball|1981]], a split-season format forced a divisional playoff series, in which the [[1981 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] won the Eastern Division series over the [[1981 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] three games to two while the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] beat the [[1981 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] three games to two in the Western Division. The team with the best overall record in the major leagues, the [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], failed to win their division in either half of that season and were controversially excluded, as were the [[1981 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], who finished with the NL's second-best record. The [[Atlanta Braves]] have currently played in the most NL division series with eleven appearances.  One team has yet to play in an NL division series, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The [[Washington Nationals]] also have only appeared as the Montreal Expos.

===Format===
Since 1998, the wild-card team has been assigned to play the division winner with the best winning percentage in one series, and the other two division winners meet in the other series. However, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record are from the same division, the wild-card team plays the division winner with the second-best record, and the remaining two division leaders play. The two series winners move on to the best-of-seven NLCS. The winner of the wild card has won the first round 7 out of the 11 years since the re-alignment and creation of the NLDS. According to [[Nate Silver]], the advent of this playoff series, and especially of the wild card, has caused teams to focus more on &quot;getting to the playoffs&quot; rather than &quot;winning the pennant&quot; as the primary goal of the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nate Silver]], &quot;Selig's Dream: The Wild Card as Enabler of Pennant Races,&quot; in Steven Goldman, Ed., ''It Ain't Over 'til It's Over'' (New York: Basic Books): 170-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the Division Series follows a 2-2-1 format. &lt;ref&gt;[http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/news/pressbox_story.jsp?ymd=20070514&amp;content_id=1964536&amp;vkey=pressbox&amp;fext=.jsp pressbox.mlb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The higher seed plays at home in Games 1 and 2. The lower seed plays at home in Game 3 and Game 4 (if necessary). If a Game 5 is needed, the teams return to the higher seed's field.

Historically, MLB had also used a 2-3 format in a best-of-5 series, but no longer uses that format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1984_NLCS.shtml 1984 NLCS - Baseball References]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1997_ALDS1.shtml 1997 ALDS1 - Baseball References]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently no award for the Most Valuable Player of the Division Series.

The '''2001 World Series''' (also known as the &quot;'''November Series'''&quot;), the 97th edition of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series|championship series]], took place between the [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] of the [[National League]] and the [[2001 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] of the [[American League]]. The Diamondbacks won the best-of-seven series four games to three. The series went down as one of the most memorable in baseball history, featuring two extra-inning games and three late-inning comebacks. It ended on a Game 7 [[Glossary of baseball (W)#walk-off home run|walk-off hit]] in the form of a bases loaded bloop single off the bat of [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]]. This was the third World Series to end in this way after {{wsy|1997}} and {{wsy|1991}}.

This was the first World Series ever played in the state of Arizona. Under the current [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] format, the World Series would not open in the city of the [[National League]] champion again until {{wsy|2010}}. This was the last World Series not to feature a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team until {{wsy|2008}}.

With the win by the Diamondbacks, they became the first World Series champion from a [[Western United States|Far West state]] other than [[California]].

[[Randy Johnson]] and [[Curt Schilling]] were the co-MVPs of the 2001 World Series, combining for a 4–0 record and a 1.40 ERA and striking out 45 Yankees in {{frac|39|1|3}} innings.

==Background==
The Arizona Diamondbacks reached the Series in just their fourth season of existence, breaking a record previously held by the [[Florida Marlins]], and took on the three-time defending champion New York Yankees, who were trying to become the first team to win four straight titles since the Yankees' five consecutive titles from {{wsy|1949}} to {{wsy|1953}}. Additionally, the Series would take place in [[New York City]] only seven weeks after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], representing a remarkable boost in morale for the fatigued city. Arizona captured the Series, four games to three, thereby dethroning the defending World Champions and earning their first title. The Diamondbacks win also ended the tongue-in-cheek &quot;Curse Of The Balboni.&quot; In 1985, [[Kansas City Royals]]'s [[Steve Balboni]] set a team record with 36 home runs in that season and the Royals went on to win their first World Series. Since then, no team who had employed a 36+ home run player had won the World Series. The Diamondbacks' Luis Gonzalez, with his 57 regular-season home runs, broke the &quot;curse.&quot;

Arizona won the first two games at home handily, but New York won the next three in close contests at Yankee Stadium, including two dramatic ninth-inning comebacks against Arizona closer [[Byung-Hyun Kim]]. Arizona won the sixth game behind [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]], who then came in to pitch in relief of Curt Schilling in Game 7. The Diamondbacks won the game 3–2, with Jay Bell scoring the winning run on a [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bloop|bloop]] single by [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], in the bottom of the ninth inning off the Yankees' ace closer, [[Mariano Rivera]]. Johnson, credited with the Game 7 win, became the first pitcher to win three games in the same World Series since [[Detroit Tiger]]'s [[Mickey Lolich]] in {{wsy|1968}}.  

The home team won every game in the Series. This had only happened twice before, in {{wsy|1987}} and {{wsy|1991}}; in both cases, the [[Minnesota Twins]] won the Series. This Series was the subject of an [[HBO]] documentary ''[[Nine Innings from Ground Zero]]'' in 2004.

Though the series went to the maximum seven games, the Diamondbacks outscored the Yankees 37–14 as a result of large margins of victory achieved by Arizona in [[Bank One Ballpark]] relative to the one run margins at Yankee Stadium. Arizona held powerhouse New York to an .183 batting average, the lowest in a seven-game Series. The previous record was .185 by the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[1985 World Series]] when they lost to the [[Kansas City Royals]].

In addition to breaking the &quot;Curse of The Balboni&quot;, Luis Gonzalez put an end to the so-called &quot;[[Ex-Cubs Factor]]&quot; jinx. The D-backs not only defied that &quot;jinx&quot; to win the Series, but two of the three ex-Cubs (Grace and Gonzalez) actively participated in the Series-winning rally.

==September 11 and the month of November==
Due to the postponement of MLB games as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]], the World Series began Saturday, October 27, 2001, the latest start date ever for a World Series until the [[2009 World Series]] which started on October 28. The last three games were the first major-league games (other than exhibitions) played in the month of November. This was just the fourth time that no World Series champion was decided within the traditional month of October. The previous three occurrences were in {{wsy|1904}} (no series), {{wsy|1918}} (series held in September due to [[World War I]]), and {{wsy|1994}} (no series due to [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|work stoppage]]).

Arizona showed no fear and chased Yankees starter [[Mike Mussina]] after just three innings. The Yankees gave up five unearned runs and the Diamondbacks rode Curt Schilling's seven strong innings to a 9–1 rout. [[Craig Counsell]] homered off Mussina in the first and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] hit a two-run home run in the third and scored twice. Although the Yankees scored one run on one hit in the first, they were only able to get two more hits after that and held hitless after the fourth inning.

The Big Unit pitched a complete game shutout, allowing only four baserunners and three hits while striking out eleven Yankees. [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] hit a three-run homer in the seventh off Yankee starter [[Andy Pettitte]] as Arizona won 4–0 and took a commanding two games to none lead as the Series headed to New York City.

The game was opened in New York by President [[George W. Bush]], who threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch]], a strike to Yankees backup catcher [[Todd Greene]]. Bush became the first sitting President to throw out a World Series first pitch since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in {{wsy|1956}}. He also threw it from the mound where the pitcher would stand (unlike most ceremonial first pitches which are from in front of the mound) and threw it for a strike. Chants of ''&quot;[[U-S-A! cheer|U-S-A]], U-S-A&quot;'' rang throughout Yankee Stadium. Yankees starter [[Roger Clemens]] allowed only three hits and struck out nine in seven innings of work.  Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] pitched two innings for the save. [[Scott Brosius]] broke a sixth inning tie with an RBI single to left.

Arizona manager [[Bob Brenly]] took a gamble and started [[Curt Schilling]] on three days' rest. It worked as Schilling pitched seven strong innings, allowing just one run, Shane Spencer's solo homer in the third, and three hits. Yankees' [[Orlando Hernandez]] pitched {{frac|6|1|3}} solid innings, but gave up a game-tying home run to Mark Grace in the fourth. The Diamondbacks took a 3–1 lead in the top of the eighth on an [[Erubiel Durazo]] double and a fielder's choice, which prompted Brenly to bring in closer [[Byung-Hyun Kim]] for a two inning save. Kim, at 22, became the first Korean-born player to play in the World Series. Kim struck out the side in the eighth, but the Yankees began their comeback in the ninth. First, Jeter tried bunting, but was out by one step. Then [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] lined an opposite-field single in front of left fielder Luis Gonzalez. After [[Bernie Williams (born 1968)|Bernie Williams]] struck out, [[Tino Martinez]] hit a two-run home run on the first pitch he saw from Kim over the right-center field wall, tying the game 3–3. Brenly stuck with his closer as the game headed into extra innings. When the scoreboard clock in Yankee Stadium passed midnight, World Series play in November began, with the message on the scoreboard &quot;Welcome to November Baseball&quot;. Derek Jeter
hit an opposite field walk-off home run on a 3–2 pitch count from Kim. This walk-off home run gave the Yankees a 4–3 victory and tied the Series at two, making Jeter the first player to hit a November home run and earning him the tongue-in-cheek nickname of &quot;[[Derek Jeter|Mr. November]]&quot;. &lt;!--Jeter would become only the third person in New York City sports history to get such a nickname, following [[Reggie Jackson]], who got &quot;Mr. October&quot; for hitting three home runs in the [[1977 World Series]] to help the Yankees to a World Series win and [[Mark Messier]], who got &quot;Mr. June&quot; for captaining the [[New York Rangers|Rangers]] to the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup in 1994]], as that happened in the month of June.--&gt;

For Game 5, Brenly started [[Miguel Batista]], who pitched a strong {{frac|7|2|3}} scoreless innings. Mussina bounced back from his poor Game 1 start, but allowed solo home runs to [[Steve Finley]] and [[Rod Barajas]] in the fifth. With the Diamondbacks leading 2–0 in the ninth, Brenly again went to his closer, and for the second night in a row Byung-Hyun Kim failed to hold the lead. [[Jorge Posada]] doubled to open the inning, but Kim retired the next two batters. Then, with two outs in the ninth [[Scott Brosius]] hit a 1–0 pitch over the left field wall to tie the game at two. Yankee Stadium erupted after the Brosius home run. For the second straight night, the game went into extra innings following a ninth inning home run and the Yankees won it in the twelfth when [[Alfonso Soriano]] knocked in [[Chuck Knoblauch]] with a base hit off [[Albie Lopez]]. New York went ahead three games to two in the series as the teams headed back to Arizona. In the top of the ninth inning, with the Yankees down 2–0, [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] (retiring after the series) was serenaded by Yankees fans chanting his name in unison.

With Arizona in a must-win situation, the Diamondbacks provided Randy Johnson all the offense he would ever need. Johnson struck out seven in seven innings of work, giving up just two runs. The Diamondbacks rocked Yankees starter Andy Pettitte for six runs after two innings and nine more runs against reliever [[Jay Witasick]] in one and a third innings before [[Randy Choate]] and [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] kept them scoreless for the rest of the game. They hit six doubles and [[Danny Bautista]] went 3-for-4 with five RBIs. They set a World Series record with 22 hits and handed New York its most lopsided loss in 293 postseason games. The 15–2 win evened the series at three games apiece and set up a Game 7 for the ages between Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, again pitching on three days' rest.

It was a matchup of two twenty-game winners in the Series finale that would crown a new champion. Clemens at 39 years old became the oldest Game 7 starter ever. Schilling had already started two games of the Series and pitched his 300th inning of the season on just three days' rest. The two aces matched each other inning by inning and after seven full, the game was tied at 1–1. The Diamondbacks scored first in the sixth inning with a [[Steve Finley]] single and a [[Danny Bautista]] double (Bautista would be called out at third base). The Yankees responded with an RBI single from [[Tino Martinez]], which drove in [[Derek Jeter]]. Brenly stayed with Schilling into the eighth, and the move backfired as [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit a solo home run on an 0–2 pitch. After Schilling got one out, he gave up a single to [[David Justice]], and he left the game trailing 2–1. Brenly brought in [[Miguel Batista]] to get out [[Derek Jeter]] and then in an unconventional move, brought in the previous night's starter Randy Johnson, who had thrown 104 pitches, in relief to keep it a one-run game. It proved to be a smart move, as Johnson retired all four Yankees he faced.

With the Yankees ahead 2–1 in the bottom of the eighth, manager [[Joe Torre]] turned the game over to his ace closer [[Mariano Rivera]] for a two-inning save. Rivera was one of the strongest closers in the game, and had pitched brilliantly throughout the postseason up to that point. Rivera struck out the side in the eighth, including Arizona's sluggers Luis Gonzalez, Matt Williams, and Danny Bautista, which lowered his ERA in the postseason to a major league-best of 0.70. Although he was sharp in the eighth, this game would end in the third ninth-inning comeback of the Series.

Mark Grace led off the inning with a single to center on a 1–0 pitch. The real turning point was Rivera's errant throw to second base on a bunt attempt by Damian Miller on an 0–1 pitch, putting runners on first and second. Derek Jeter tried to reach for the ball, but got tangled in the legs of pinch-runner [[David Dellucci]], who was sliding in an attempt to break up the double play. Rivera appeared to regain control when he fielded [[Jay Bell]]'s bunt and threw out Dellucci at third base, but third baseman [[Scott Brosius]] decided to hold the ball instead of throwing to first to attempt to complete the [[double play]]. Midre Cummings was sent in to pinch-run for Damien Miller. With Cummings at second and Bell at first, the next batter, [[Tony Womack]], drove a double down the right-field line on a 2–2 pitch that evened the score and blew the save. Bell went to third and the Yankees pulled the infield and the outfield in as the potential winning run stood at third with less than two outs. After Rivera hit [[Craig Counsell]] with an 0–1 pitch, the bases were loaded. On an 0–1 pitch, [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] lofted a soft single over the drawn-in Derek Jeter that barely reached the outfield grass, plating Jay Bell with the winning run. This ended New York's bid for a fourth consecutive title and brought Arizona its first championship in just its fourth year of existence, making the Diamondbacks the fastest expansion team to win a World Series, as well as first major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona. This was the first time since {{wsy|1991}} that the home team won in all seven games of a World Series.

In 2009, Game 7 was chosen by ''Sports Illustrated'' as the [[List of 2009 all-decade Sports Illustrated awards and honors#Major League Baseball|Best Postseason Game of the Decade]] (2000–2009).

==Media coverage==
For the second consecutive year, [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] carried the World Series over its network with its top broadcast team, [[Joe Buck]] and [[Tim McCarver]] (himself a [[List of New York Yankees broadcasters|Yankees broadcaster]]). This was the first year of Fox's exclusive rights to the World Series (in the previous contract, Fox only broadcast the World Series in even numbered years while [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] broadcast it in odd numbered years), which it has held ever since (this particular contract also had given Fox exclusive rights to the entire baseball postseason, which aired over its family of networks; the contract was modified following [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s purchase of [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]] shortly after the World Series ended, as ESPN regained their postseason rights following a year of postseason games on ABC Family, Fox Family's successor). [[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio]] provided national radio coverage for the fourth consecutive year, with [[Jon Miller]] and [[Joe Morgan]] calling the action.

Locally, the Series was carried over [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]] in the Phoenix area and [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in New York. [[Greg Schulte]] called play-by-play for the Diamondbacks while [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]] and [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]] alternated duties on the Yankees coverage. This would be Sterling and Kay's last World Series working together, and Game 7 would be the last Yankee broadcast on WABC. Kay moved to television and the new [[YES Network]] the following season and [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] picked up radio rights to the Yankees.

==Aftermath==
After the Yankees lost the World Series, several players moved onto other teams or retired, the most notable changes being the signing of [[Jason Giambi]] to replace Martinez, and the retirements of Brosius and O'Neil. Martinez would later finish his career with the Yankees in 2005 after spending the previous three years in St. Louis and Tampa Bay. The Yankees would lose the [[2003 World Series]] to the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] and wouldn't win another World Series until 2009, when they defeated the defending champions, the [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], in six games. 

After winning the NL West again in 2002 the Diamondbacks were swept 3–0 by St. Louis in the NLDS. From here they declined, losing 111 games in 2004 as Bob Brenly was fired during that season. With the exception of another NL West title in 2007, Arizona would become one of the worst teams in baseball over the rest of the decade. Schilling was traded to the Boston Red Sox after the 2003 season and in 2004 helped lead them to their first world championship since 1918. He helped them win another championship in 2007 and retired after four years with Boston, missing the entire 2008 season with a shoulder injury. Johnson was traded to the Yankees after the 2004 season, a season that saw him throw a perfect game against the Atlanta Braves, though he would be traded back to the Diamondbacks two years later and finish his career with the [[2009 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in 2009.  Only one Diamondback from 2001 is still active, [[Rod Barajas]], and only [[Derek Jeter]], [[Mariano Rivera]], and [[Jorge Posada]] remain from the 2001 AL Champion Yankees, as of 2010.

From 2004 through 2007, the Yankee's misfortune in the postseason continued, with the team losing the ALCS to the Boston Red Sox in 2004, the ALDS to Anaheim in 2005, the ALDS to Detroit in 2006, and the ALDS to Cleveland in 2007. [[Joe Torre]]'s contract was allowed to expire and he was replaced by [[Joe Girardi]] in 2008, a season in which the Yankees would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993.

[[Buster Olney]], who covered the Yankees for the [[New York Times]] before joining ESPN, would write a book titled ''[[The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty]]''. The book is a play by play account of Game 7 in addition to stories about key players, executives, and moments from the 1996–2001 dynasty. In a 2005 reprinting, Olney included a new epologue covering the aftermath of the 2001 World Series up to the Boston Red Sox epic comeback from down 3–0 in the [[2004 ALCS]].

==DVD==
On October 11, 2005 A&amp;E Home Video released the New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001) DVD set. Game 4 of the 2001 World Series is included in the set. On April 29, 2008 The Arizona Diamondbacks 2001 World Series DVD set was released. All seven games are included.

The '''1903 World Series''', the first modern [[World Series]] to be played in [[Major League Baseball]], matched the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]] against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a best-of-nine series, with Boston prevailing five games to three, winning the last four.

Pittsburgh pitcher [[Sam Leever]] injured his shoulder while trap-shooting, so his teammate [[Deacon Phillippe]] had to pitch five complete games for Pittsburgh. Phillippe won three of his games, but it was not enough to overcome the club from the new American League. Boston pitchers [[Bill Dinneen]] and [[Cy Young]] led Boston to victory.

In Game 1, Phillippe set a World Series record by striking out ten Boston batters. That record lasted barely one day, as Dinneen struck out eleven Pittsburgh batters in Game 2.

[[Honus Wagner]], bothered by injuries, batted only 6 for 27 (.222) in the Series and committed six errors.  The shortstop was deeply distraught by his performance.  The following spring, Wagner (who led the league in 1903 in batting average) refused to send his portrait to a &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; for batting champions. &quot;I was too bum last year,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburgh Series. What does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch?  I would be ashamed to have my picture up now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In this World Series, the Boston Americans came back from a three games to one deficit, winning the final four games (in a best-of-nine Series rather than the now standard best-of-seven). Such a comeback would not happen again until the Pirates came back to defeat the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] in the [[1925 World Series]], and has happened only ten times in baseball history.  The Pirates repeated this feat in [[1979 World Series|1979]] against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].&lt;/s&gt;

Much was made of the influence of Boston's &quot;[[Royal Rooters]]&quot;, who traveled to Pittsburgh and sang their theme song &quot;[[Tessie]]&quot; to distract the opposing players (especially Honus Wagner). Boston would end up winning three out of the four games at Pittsburgh.

The Pirates' benevolent owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]] added his share of the gate receipts to the players' share, so the losing team's players actually finished with a larger individual share than the winning team's.

The Series brought the new American League prestige and proved its best could beat the best of the National League, thus strengthening the demand for future World Series competitions.

==Background==
===Earlier post-season contests===
The winners of the [[National League]] and [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] had played post-season contests from 1884 to 1891 called &quot;The Championship of the United States&quot; and &quot;World's Championship Series&quot;. The Series ended when the American Association folded in 1891.  The National League did hold a series of post-season contests on and off between its first and second place finisher for the rest of the decade. The [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] (then called the Superbas) and [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], who finished first and second in 1900, played a five-game playoff in Pittsburgh that the Dodgers won three games to one.&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, Dennis and Jeanne Burke, ''Honus Wagner: A Biography.'' Pittsburgh; University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995, pp. 85–86''&lt;/ref&gt;

===A new league===
In 1901, [[Ban Johnson]], president of the [[Western League (U.S. baseball)|Western League]], a minor league organization, formed the [[American League]] to take advantage of the National League's 1900 contraction from twelve teams to eight.  Johnson and fellow owners raided the senior circuit and signed away many star players, including [[Cy Young]] and [[Jimmy Collins]].  Johnson had a list of 46 National Leaguers he targeted for the American League; by 1902, all but one had made the jump.&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The constant raiding, however, scotched the idea of a championship between the two leagues. Pirates owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]], whose team ran away with the 1902 National League pennant, was open to a post-season contest and even said he would allow the American League champion to stock his roster with All-Stars.&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Johnson had spoken of putting a team in [[Pittsburgh]] and even attempted to raid the Pirates' rosters in August 1902, which soured Dreyfuss.  At the end of the season, though, the Pirates played a group of American League All-Stars in a four-game exhibition series, winning two games to one, with one tie.&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The leagues finally called a truce in the winter of 1902–03 and formed the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|National Commission]] to preside over organized baseball. The following season, the Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates had secured their pennants by September. That August, Dreyfuss challenged the American League to an eleven game championship series.  Encouraged by Johnson and National League President [[Harry Pulliam]], Americans owner Henry J. Killilea met with Dreyfuss in Pittsburgh in September and instead agreed to a best-of-nine championship, with the first three games played in Boston, the next four in Pittsburgh, and the remaining two (if necessary) in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant point about this agreement was that it was an arrangement primarily between the two clubs rather than a formal arrangement between the leagues. In short, it was a voluntary event, a fact which would result in no Series at all for [[1904 World Series|1904]], and eventually to the formal establishment of the Series as a compulsory event starting in [[1905 World Series|1905]].

==The teams==
[[Image:1903 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 1903 Pittsburgh Pirates]]
The Pirates won their third straight pennant in 1903 thanks to a powerful line-up that included legendary shortstop [[Honus Wagner]], who hit .355 and drove in 101 runs, player-manager [[Fred Clarke]], who hit .351, and [[Ginger Beaumont]], who hit .341 and led the league in hits and runs.  The Pirates' pitching was weaker than it had been in previous years but boasted 24-game winner [[Deacon Phillippe]] and 25-game winner [[Sam Leever]].&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, pp. 119, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans had a strong pitching staff, led by Cy Young, who went 28–9 in 1903 and became the all-time wins leader that year.  [[Bill Dineen]] and [[Long Tom Hughes]], right-handers like Young, had won 21 games and 20 games each.  The Boston outfield, featuring [[Chick Stahl]] (.274), [[Buck Freeman]] (.287, 104 [[RBI]]s) and [[Patsy Dougherty]] (.331, 101 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored) was considered excellent.&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1903 World Series - Boston Americans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 1903 Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates]]
Although the Pirates had dominated their league for the previous three years, they went into the series riddled with injuries and plagued by bizarre misfortunes.  Otto Krueger, the team's only [[utility player]], was beaned on September 19 and never fully played in the series.  16-game winner Ed Doheny left the team three days later, exhibiting signs of [[paranoia]]; he was committed to an [[insane asylum]] the following month.&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Leever had been battling an injury to his pitching arm (which he made worse by entering a [[trapshooting]] competition).  Worst of all, Wagner, who had a sore [[thumb]] throughout the season, injured his right leg in September and was never 100 percent for the post-season.&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some sources say Boston were heavy underdogs. Boston [[bookies]] actually gave even odds to the teams (and only because [[Dreyfuss]] and other &quot;sports&quot; were alleged to have bet on Pittsburgh to bring down the odds).&lt;ref&gt;DeValeria, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  The teams were generally thought to be evenly matched, with the Americans credited with stronger pitching and the Pirates with superior offense and fielding.  The outcome, many believed, hinged on Wagner's health.  &quot;If Wagner does not play, bet your money at two to one on Boston,&quot; said the [[Sporting News]], &quot;but if he does play, place your money at two to one on Pittsburgh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in DeValeria, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game 1===
[[Image:1903 world series crowd.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Crowd outside the 1903 World Series]]

Thursday, October 1, 1903 at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]

The Pirates started Game 1 strong, scoring six runs in the first four innings. They extended their lead to 7–0 on a solo home run by Jimmy Sebring in the seventh, the first home run in World Series history. Boston tried to mount a comeback in the last three innings, but it was too little, too late, as they ended up losing by a score of 7–3 in the first ever World Series game. Both Phillippe and Young threw complete games, with Phillippe striking out ten and Young fanning five, but Young also gave up twice as many hits and allowed three earned runs to Phillippe's two.

===Game 2===
Friday, October 2, 1903 at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]

After starting out strong in Game 1, the Pirates simply shut down offensively, managing to get a meager three hits, all of which were singles. Pirates starter Sam Leever went only one inning and gave up three hits and two runs before being replaced by Bucky Veil in the second inning due to injury, who finished the game for Pittsburgh. Bill Dinneen struck out eleven and pitched a complete game for the Americans, while Patsy Dougherty hit home runs in the first and sixth innings to produce two of the Boston's three runs.

Saturday, October 3, 1903 at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]

Deacon Phillippe, pitching on only one day rest, started Game 3 for the Pirates, and did not let them down as he pitched his second complete game victory of the series to put the Pirates up two games to one.

===Game 4===
Tuesday, October 6, 1903 at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park (III)]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]

After two days of rest, Deacon Phillippe was ready to pitch his second straight game. He threw his third complete game victory of the series against Bill Dinneen, who was pitching in his second start of the series. However, Phillippe's second straight victory was almost not to be, as the Americans, down 5–1 in the top of the ninth, staged a rally to bring the game within one. The comeback attempt failed, though, as Phillippe managed to put an end to it and give the Pirates a commanding 3–1 series lead.

===Game 5===
Wednesday, October 7, 1903 at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park (III)]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]

Game 5 was a pitcher's duel for the first five innings, with Boston's Cy Young and Pittsburgh's Brickyard Kennedy giving up no runs. That changed at the top of the sixth, however, when the Americans scored a then-record six runs that inning. Young, on the other hand, managed to keep his shutout intact before finally giving up a pair of runs in the bottom of the eighth. He went the distance and struck out four for his first World Series win.

===Game 6===
Thursday, October 8, 1903 at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park (III)]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]

Game 6 featured a rematch between the starters of Game 2, Bill Dinneen (Boston) and Sam Leever (Pittsburgh). This time, Leever would pitch the entire game, but despite throwing a complete game he was outmatched by Dinneen, who ended up with his second complete game victory of the series. After losing three of the first four games of the World Series, the underdog Boston Americans had tied the series at three games apiece.

===Game 7===
Saturday, October 10, 1903 at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park (III)]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]

The fourth and final game in Pittsburgh saw Deacon Phillippe start his fourth game of the series for Pittsburgh. This time, however, he wouldn't fare as well as he did in his first three starts. Cy Young, pitching in his third start of the series, would face a much more favorable fate, holding the Pirates to only three runs.

===Game 8===
Tuesday, October 13, 1903 at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]

The final game of the inaugural World Series started out as an intense pitcher's duel, with no runs being scored until the fourth inning—when a [[Hobe Ferris]] single scored two runners. Deacon Phillippe started his fifth and final game of the series, while Bill Dinneen started his fourth game of the series. As he did in Game 2, Dinneen threw a complete game shutout while striking out seven, leading the Boston Americans to victory, while Phillippe, who also threw a respectable game, just couldn't pitch at Dinneen's level due to wearing out his arm in the series (as a result of playing so many games in such a short time span) and gave up three runs in the defeat.  Honus Wagner struck out to end the Series.

'''Bluetongue disease''' or '''catarrhal fever''' is a non-[[infectious disease|contagious]], non-[[zoonosis|zoonotic]], [[Vector (epidemiology)|insect-borne]], [[Virus|viral]] disease of [[ruminant]]s, mainly [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] and less frequently cattle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7008901.stm|title=Q&amp;A: Bluetongue disease|publisher=BBC | date=2008-09-17 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[goats]], [[Bovinae|buffalo]], [[deer]], [[dromedary|dromedaries]] and [[antelope]].

==Pathogen and vector==
[[Image:Bluetongue virus.gif|thumb|Bluetongue virus particle]]
Bluetongue is caused by the [[pathogen]]ic [[virus (biology)|virus]], Bluetongue virus (BTV),&lt;ref name = roy/&gt;&lt;ref name = roy2/&gt; of the genus ''[[Orbivirus]]'', is a member of the [[Reoviridae]] family. There are 25&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=http://www.iah.ac.uk/press_release/2008/2008_19.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[serotype]]s. It is transmitted by a [[midge]], ''[[Culicoides imicola]]'' and other [[Culicoides|culicoid]]s.

==Bluetongue virus==
Bluetongue virus causes serious disease in livestock (sheep, goats, cattle and deer). Partly due to this BTV has been in the forefront of molecular studies for last three decades and now represents one of the best understood viruses at the molecular and structural levels. BTV, like the other members of the family is a complex non-enveloped virus with seven structural [[protein]]s and a RNA [[genome]] consisting of 10 double-stranded (ds) RNA segments of different sizes. Data obtained from studies over a number of years have defined the key players in BTV entry, replication, assembly and exit and have increasingly found roles for host proteins at each stage. Specifically, it has been possible to determine the complex nature of the virion through 3D structure reconstructions (diameter ~ 800 Å); the atomic structure of proteins and the internal capsid (~ 700 Å, the first large highly complex structure ever solved); the definition of the virus encoded enzymes required for RNA replication; the ordered assembly of the capsid shell and the protein sequestration required for it; and the role of host proteins in virus entry and virus release. These areas are important for BTV replication but they also indicate the pathways that may be used by related viruses, which include viruses that are pathogenic to man and animals, thus providing the basis for developing strategies for intervention or prevention.

BTV is the type species of the genus ''Orbivirus'' within the family Reoviridae. The Reoviridae family is one of the largest families of viruses and includes major human pathogens (such as [[rotavirus]]) as well as other vertebrate, plant and insect pathogens. Like the other members of the family, Orbiviruses which encompass, besides BTV, the agents causing African horse sickness (AHSV) and [[epizootic hemorrhagic disease]] of deer (EHDV), have the characteristic double-stranded and segmented features of their RNA genomes. However, unlike the mammalian reoviruses, Orbiviruses comprising 14 serogroups, are vectored to a variety of vertebrates by arthropod species (for example, gnats, mosquitoes and ticks) and replicate in both hosts. BTV, the etiological agent of Bluetongue disease of animals, is transmitted by ''Culicoides'' species. In sheep BTV causes an acute disease with high morbidity and mortality. BTV also infects goats, cattle and other domestic animals as well as wild ruminants (for example,, blesbuck, white-tailed deer, elk, pronghorn antelope, and so on.). The disease was first described in the late 18th century and was believed for many decades to be confined to Africa. However, to date BTV has been isolated in many tropical, subtropical and temperate zones and 24 serotypes have been identified from different parts of the world. Due to its economic significance BTV has been the subject of extensive molecular, genetic and structural studies. As a consequence it now represents one of the best characterised viruses.&lt;ref name = roy/&gt;

Unlike the reovirus and rotavirus particles, the mature BTV particle is relatively fragile and the infectivity of BTV is lost easily in mildly acidic conditions. BTV virions (550S) are architecturally complex structures composed of 7 discrete proteins that are organised into two concentric shells, the outer and inner capsids, and a genome of 10 dsRNA segments. The outer capsid, which is composed of two major structural proteins (VP2 and VP5), is involved in cell attachment and virus penetration during the initial stages of infection. Shortly after infection, BTV is uncoated, i.e. VP2 and VP5 are removed, to yield a transcriptionally active 470S core particle which is composed of two major proteins VP7 and VP3, and the three minor proteins VP1, VP4 and VP6 in addition to the dsRNA genome. There is no evidence that any trace of the outer capsid remains associated with these cores, as has been described for reovirus. The cores may be further uncoated to form 390S subcore particles that lack VP7, also in contrast to reovirus. Subviral particles are probably akin to cores derived ''in vitro'' from virions by physical or proteolytic treatments that remove the outer capsid and causes activation of the BTV transcriptase. In addition to the seven structural proteins, three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2, NS3 (and a related NS3A) are synthesised in BTV-infected cells. Of these, NS3/NS3A is involved in the egress of the progeny virus. The two remaining non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2, are produced at high levels in the cytoplasm and are believed to be involved in virus replication, assembly and morphogenesis.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir|author=Roy P|year=2008|chapter=Molecular Dissection of Bluetongue Virus|title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|pages=305–354|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/avir ISBN 978-1-904455-22-6]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current research===
Bluetongue virus (BTV) is well characterized both genetically (the sequence was completed in 1989) and structurally.&lt;ref name = roy2/&gt; Understanding of the [[molecular biology]] of the virus and mapping the role of each protein in virus life cycle has benefited significantly through the availability of recombinant BTV proteins and sub-viral particles. In addition the structure of BTV proteins, core and [[virion]] particles have contributed greatly to understanding the mechanism of protein–protein interaction in the virus assembly pathway of BTV and other [[orbivirus]]es. Most importantly, information gained from these studies has laid sound foundation for the generation of safe BTV vaccines with the possibility of use in animals in the near future. Latterly, studies have concentrated on the fundamental mechanisms that are used by the virus to invade, replicate in and escape from susceptible host cells. Progress has been made in understanding the structure and entry of intact virus particles, the role of each enzymatic protein in the transcription complex, the critical interactions that occur between the viral non-structural proteins and viral RNA and the role of cellular proteins in non-enveloped virus egress. 

Despite these advances, some critical questions remain unanswered for the BTV life cycle and a more complete understanding of the interactions between the virus and the host cell is required for these to be addressed. For example, although progress has been made in the identification of signals for the recruitment of BTV [[RNA]] segments into the virion assembly site in the host cell [[cytoplasm]], it has not been possible yet to determine how exactly each [[genome]] segment is packaged into the progeny virus. It is also not apparent when and how these genome segments wrap around the polymerase complex once the RNA has been recruited. One of the major drawbacks of research with BTV and other members of [[Reoviridae]] has been the lack of availability of a suitable system for genetic manipulation of the virus. This has been a major obstacle in understanding the replication processes of these viruses. However, one of the recent developments in the field of BTV research has been to rescue live virus from [[transfection]] of BTV transcripts.&lt;ref name = roy2/&gt; There is no doubt that this will be soon extended to establish ''in vitro'' manipulative genetic system and will be utilized to address some of these remaining questions. 

Very little is known of the intracellular trafficking of newly generated virions although there are some indications of involvement of the [[cytoskeleton]], intermediate filaments and vimentin during BTV morphogenesis. Host–virus interactions during virus trafficking will be one of the future areas needing intense attention. Recent work has revealed unexpected and striking parallels between the entry and release pathways of BTV and pathways involved in entry and release of enveloped viruses. These parallels may be the result of an enveloped ancestor virus or because there are a limited number of cellular pathways that can be useful for the egress of large protein complexes from cells. It is notable that the NS3 glycoprotein of BTV is an integral membrane protein that is functionally involved in virus egress by bridging between the outer capsid protein VP2 and the cellular export machinery. Although no cell-free enveloped form of BTV has been isolated, budding of BTV particles from infected cells at the plasma membrane are quite apparent. The exact role of NS3 in this process and the role of host proteins (Annexin II and p11, Tsg101 and MVB) and their contribution in the release of non-enveloped viruses, such as BTV, remains to be clarified.&lt;ref name=roy2&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnav|author=Roy P|year=2008|chapter=Structure and Function of Bluetongue Virus and its Proteins|title=Segmented Double-stranded RNA Viruses: Structure and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/rnav ISBN 978-1-904455-21-9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of molecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus in Europe.gif|thumb|280px|The molecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus (BTV) in Europe since 1998: routes of introduction of different serotypes and individual virus strains.]]
Bluetongue has been observed in Australia, the USA, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe. Its occurrence is seasonal in the affected [[Mediterranean]] countries, subsiding when temperatures drop and hard frosts kill the adult midge [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]. Bluetongue has been spreading northward since October 1998, perhaps as a result of [[global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This is in contrast to the original C.imicola vector which is limited to North Africa and the Mediterranean. The relatively recent novel vector has facilitated a far more rapid spread than the simple expansion of habitats North through global warming.

Norway saw its first finding in February 2009, when cows at two farms in [[Vest-Agder]] in the south of Norway showed an immune response to bluetongue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vetinst.no/nor/Nyheter/Blaatunge-paavist-i-Norge Veterinærinstituttet informs about the outbreak in Vest-Agder], Norway National Veterinary Institute, 20 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Norway have since been declared free of the disease in 2011.

Although the disease is not a threat to humans the most vulnerable common domestic ruminants in the UK are cattle, goats and, especially, sheep.

===Infection of the fetus===
A puzzling aspect of the spread of serotype 8 BTV in northern Europe is the overwintering of the disease. Animals will recover between the end of the midge season in autumn and the beginning in spring, so it is believed that the virus somehow survives in overwintering midges. Researchers at the Institute for Animal Health (UK) has however offered an alternative hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/press_release/2008/2008_3.htm &quot;Bluetongue virus might survive the winter within fetuses&quot;], Institute for Animal Health, press release, 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Three cows that had recovered from bluetongue the previous autumn were exported from the Netherlands to [[Northern Ireland]] in January 2008. In February, these cows gave birth to calves that were found to be carriers of the disease. If BTV is capable of transplacental infection of the ruminant foetus, this would be a plausible way for it to overwinter. Midges will then spread the disease from the calves to other animals, starting a new season of infection. Based on this finding, it is advised to pay special attention to newborn animals in an effort to eradicate the disease.

It was previously believed that only special lab-raised BTV were capable of transplacental infection. Experiments on sheep in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bluetongue's winter warmer&quot;, ''New Scientist'', Vol 197, No 2647, 15 March 2008, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that such infection would result in [[Spontaneous abortion|abortion]] or weak or deformed offspring, with some offspring carrying the virus in their bloodstream. Such damage to the offspring was also seen for the calves born in Northern Ireland.

==Symptoms==
[[File:FCO-brebis.jpg|thumb||Infected sheep.]]
[[File:Bluetongue in Captive Yak.gif|thumb|A domestic [[yak]] infected with bluetongue virus. Tongue is swollen, cyanotic, and protruding from the mouth.]]
Major [[sign (medicine)|signs]] are high fever, excessive [[saliva]]tion, [[edema|swelling]] of the face and tongue and [[cyanosis]] of the tongue. Swelling of the lips and tongue gives the tongue its typical blue appearance, though this sign is confined to a minority of the animals. Nasal symptoms may be prominent, with nasal discharge and stertorous respiration. 

Some animals also develop foot lesions, beginning with coronitis, with consequent lameness. In sheep, this can lead to knee-walking. In cattle, constant changing of position of the feet gives bluetongue the nickname '''The Dancing Disease'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7019511.stm |title='Dancing' disease set for long run |publisher=[[BBC News]] |first=Matt | last=McGrath |date=Last Updated: |accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torsion of the neck ([[opisthotonos]] or [[torticollis]]) is observed in severely affected animals.

Not all animals develop symptoms, but all those that do lose condition rapidly, and the sickest die within a week. For affected animals which do not die, recovery is very slow, lasting several months.

The [[incubation period]] is 5–20 days, and all symptoms usually develop within a month. The [[mortality rate]] is normally low, but it is high in susceptible [[breeds]] of sheep. In Africa, local breeds of sheep may have no mortality, but in imported breeds it may be up to 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Animal Diseases in the Tropics'', 1976. ISBN 090102810X&lt;/ref&gt;

In cattle, goats and wild ruminants [[infection]] is usually [[asymptomatic]] despite high virus levels in blood. [[Red deer]] are an exception, and in them the disease may be as acute as in sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, R. and Swift, B.L. ''Diseases of Sheep'', Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1982. ISBN 0812108361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and prevention==
There is no efficient treatment. Prevention is effected via [[quarantine]], [[inoculation]] with live modified virus [[vaccine]] and control of the midge [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], including inspection of aircraft.

However, simple husbandry changes and practical midge control measures may help break the livestock infection cycle. Housing livestock during times of maximum midge activity (from dusk to dawn) may lead to significantly reduced biting rates. Similarly, protecting livestock shelters with fine mesh netting or coarser material impregnated with insecticide will reduce contact with the midges. The ''Culicoides'' midges that carry the virus usually breed on animal dung and moist soils, either bare or covered in short grass. Identifying breeding grounds and breaking the breeding cycle will significantly reduce the local midge population. Turning off taps, mending leaks and filling in or draining damp areas will also help dry up breeding sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gairdner, Julie. [http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2007/09/24/107000/bluetongue-blue-tongue-outbreak-in-the-uk-fwis-special-report.html &quot;Bluetongue (blue tongue) outbreak in the UK – FWi's special report&quot;], ''Farmers Weekly'', 24 September 2007. Offers practical advice for preventing Bluetongue in livestock.&lt;/ref&gt; Control by trapping midges and removing their breeding grounds may reduce vector numbers. Dung heaps or slurry pits should be covered or removed, and their perimeters (where most larvae are found) regularly scraped.&lt;ref&gt;Abel, Charles.

==Vaccine==
Outbreaks in southern Europe have been caused by serotypes 2 and 4, and vaccines are available against these serotypes ([[ATCvet]] codes: {{ATCvet|I04|AA02}} for sheep, {{ATCvet|I02|AA08}} for cattle). However, the disease found in northern Europe (including the UK) in 2006 and 2007 has been caused by serotype 8. Vaccine companies Fort Dodge Animal Health ([[Wyeth]]), Merial and Intervet were developing vaccines against serotype 8 (Fort Dodge Animal Health has serotype 4 for sheep, serotype 1 for sheep and cattle and serotype 8 for sheep and cattle) and the associated production facilities. A vaccine for this is now available in the UK, produced by Intervet. Fort Dodge Animal Health has their vaccines available for multiple European Countries (vaccination will start in 2008 in Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain and Italy).

'''Bruce Perens''' is a [[computer programmer]] and advocate in the [[open source community]]. He created the [[Open Source Definition]] and published the first formal announcement and manifesto of [[open source]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LG&quot;&gt;http://ldp.rtin.bz/LDP/LGNET/issue26/perens.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html |title=Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |publisher=Oreilly.com |date=1999-03-29 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded the [[Open Source Initiative]] with [[Eric S. Raymond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI &amp;#124; Open Source Initiative |publisher=Opensource.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Perens represented Open Source at the [[World Summit on the Information Society|United Nations World Summit on the Information Society]], at the invitation of the [[United Nations Development Program]]. He has appeared before national legislatures and is often quoted in the press, advocating for open source and the reform of national and international technology policy.

Perens is also a [[ham radio|ham]], with [[callsign]] K6BP. He is well known in the [[amateur radio]] community for his efforts towards open radio communications standards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Viewpoint ==
Perens poses Open Source as a means of marketing the [[free software]] philosophy of [[Richard Stallman]] to business people who are more concerned with profit than freedom, and states that open source and free software are only two ways of talking about the same phenomenon. This differs from Stallman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technocrat.net/d/2007/8/17/25169 |title=Review: Perens Speaks about Free Software in Copenhagen |publisher=Technocrat.net |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technocrat.net/d/2007/8/17/25149 |title=Review: Perens Speaks about Free Software in Copenhagen |publisher=Technocrat.net |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Raymond. Perens postulates an economic theory for business use of Open Source in his paper ''The Emerging Economic Paradigm of Open Source'' and his speech ''Innovation Goes Public''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perens.com/works/articles/Economic.html |title=The Emerging Economics of Open Source Software |publisher=Perens.com |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from Raymond's theory in ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'', which having been written before there was much business involvement in open source, explains open source as a consequence of programmer motivation and leisure.

== Organizations ==
Perens is a former [[Debian]] Project Leader, a founder of [[Software in the Public Interest]], founder and first project leader of the [[Linux Standard Base]] project, the initial author of [[BusyBox]], and founder of the [[UserLinux]] project. Perens also has a book series with Prentice Hall PTR called the [[Bruce Perens' Open Source Series]]. He is an avid [[amateur radio]] enthusiast ([[callsign]] K6BP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=254811 |title=ULS License - Vanity License - K6BP - PERENS, BRUCE J |publisher=Wireless2.fcc.gov |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and maintained [[technocrat.net]], which he closed in late 2008 because its revenues did not cover its costs. He is also the founder of [[No Code International]], an organization whose primary purpose was to eliminate [[morse code]] proficiency as a requirement to obtain an [[amateur radio license]]. This goal has been reached with the removal of code requirements from international law (International Telecommunications Union treaty provision S25.5), the new &quot;code-free&quot; rules introduced on 2007-02-23, and similar legal changes in almost all nations worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Perens left OSI a year after co-founding it, with reasons explained in an email titled &quot;It's Time to Talk About Free Software Again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/debian-devel-199902/msg01641.html |title=It's Time to Talk About Free Software Again |publisher=Lists.debian.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, for the 10th anniversary of the Open Source, Perens published a message to the community called &quot;State of Open Source Message: A New Decade For Open Source&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perens.com/works/articles/State8Feb2008 |title=Bruce Perens - State of Open Source Message: A New Decade For Open Source |publisher=Perens.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same event, the 10th anniversary of Open Source, the ezine RegDeveloper published an interview with Bruce Perens where he revives an updated view on the past and the future, and the dangers of the Open Source, especially the useless proliferation of OSI approved licenses and the strength of the GPL 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2008/02/11/open_source_at_ten/ | title = Perens: 'Badgeware' threat to open source's next decade | first = Gavin | last = Clarke | date = 11 February 2008 | work = Developer | publisher = The Register | accessdate = 2009-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the interview covered [[Linus Torvalds]]' refusal to adopt the GPLv3 for the Linux kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/feature/131346 |title=Linux.com |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an employee of [[SourceLabs]] from June 2005 until December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technocrat.net/d/2007/12/3/31038 |title=On My Own Again |publisher=Technocrat.net |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently CEO of [[Kiloboot]].

== Creation of the Open Source Definition ==
The Open Source Definition was first created by Perens as the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], itself part of the [[Debian Social Contract]]. Perens proposed a draft of the Debian Social Contract to the Debian developers on the debian-private mailing list early in June, 1997. Debian developers contributed discussion and changes for the rest of the month while Perens edited, and the completed document was then announced as Debian project policy. On February 3, 1998, a group of people met at VA Linux Systems (without Perens) to discuss the promotion of Free Software to business from pragmatic terms, rather than the moral terms preferred by Richard Stallman. Christine Petersen of the nanotechnology organization ''Foresight Institute'' was present because Foresight took an early interest in Free Software, and Petersen suggested the term &quot;Open Source&quot;. The next day, Eric Raymond recruited Perens to work with him on the formation of Open Source. Perens modified his Debian document into the Open Source Definition by removing Debian references and replacing them with &quot;Open Source&quot;.

The original announcement of the [[Open Source Definition]] was made on February 9, 1998 on [[Slashdot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=98/02/09/213900 |title=Free Software's New Name |publisher=Slashdot |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere; the definition was given in [[Linux Gazette]] on February 10, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;LG&quot;/&gt;

== Film ==
Perens worked at [[Pixar]] for 12 years before leaving to work full-time on Open Source issues, and before then at the [[New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab]], spending a total of 19 years in the computer graphics and feature film industry. These two decades were the genesis of the 3-dimensional feature film animation that is taken for granted today. He is credited as a studio tools engineer on [[Toy Story 2]] and [[A Bug's Life]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0673302/&lt;/ref&gt; He is featured in two documentaries on Open Source: [[Revolution OS]] and [[The Code-Breakers]]. He produced a video commercial, ''[[Impending Security Breach]]'', for Sourcelabs in 2007.

== Academia ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2009}}
Perens is finishing a three-year grant from the Competence Fund of Southern Norway. With this funding, he spent part of the summer as a visiting lecturer and researcher at [[University of Agder]] in 2006 and 2007, and does other work remotely. During this time he consulted the Norwegian Government and other entities on government policy issues related to computers and software. He previously worked remotely as Senior Scientist for Open Source with the [[Cyber Security Policy Research Institute]] of [[George Washington University]].

==UserLinux==
In 2003 Bruce Perens founded [[UserLinux]], a distribution whose stated goal was, &quot;Provide businesses with freely available, high quality Linux operating systems accompanied by certifications, service, and support options designed to encourage productivity and security while reducing overall costs.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://lwn.net/Articles/150701/
Whither UserLinux?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2007 activities ==
Perens remained active in representing open source to the world and advising several national governments and multinational corporations regarding Open Source. In 2007 some of his government advisory roles included: a meeting with the President of the [[Chamber of Deputies]] (the lower house of parliament) in Italy and testimony to the Culture Committee of the Chamber of Deputies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technocrat.net/d/2007/8/17/25151 |title=Visit to Rome |publisher=Technocrat.net |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a keynote speech at the foundation of Norway's Open Source Center, following Norway's Minister of Governmental Reform (Perens is on the advisory board of the center);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technocrat.net/d/2007/8/17/25148 |title=Norway opens Free Software Center |publisher=Technocrat.net |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; he provided input on the revision of the [[EIF|European Interoperability Framework]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perens.com/works/articles/EIF2/ |title=Bruce Perens - The Confusion of Tongues: EIF 2.0, Standards, and Interoperability |publisher=Perens.com |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was keynote speaker at a European Commission conference on ''Digital Business Ecosystems at the Centre Borschette, Brussels, on November 7.

== 2009 activities ==
In 2009, Perens acted as a [[expert witness]] on Open Source in the [[Jacobsen v Katzer]] U.S. Federal lawsuit.  His report, which was made publicly available by Jacobsen, presented the culture and impact of Open Source software development to the Federal Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perens.com/works/testimony/PerensJMRI.pdf|title=Expert Report of Bruce Perens |publisher=Northern California District Court |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bundle theory''', originated by the 18th century Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]], is the [[ontology|ontological]] theory about [[Object (philosophy)|objecthood]] in which an object consists only of a collection (''bundle'') of properties, relations or [[trope (philosophy)|tropes]].

According to bundle theory, an object consists of its properties and nothing more: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even ''conceive'' of such an object; for example, bundle theory claims that thinking of an apple compels one also to think of its color, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one other of its properties.  Thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of its properties.  In particular, there is no ''[[substance theory|substance]]'' in which the properties ''[[inherence|inhere]]''.

==Arguments for the bundle theory==
The difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition.

The inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a ''bare particular'' (a ''substance'' without properties), an implication that directly opposes [[substance theory]].  The conceptual difficulty of ''bare particulars'' was illustrated by [[John Locke]] when he described a ''substance'' by itself, apart from its properties, as &quot;something, I know not what.&quot;

Whether a ''relation'' of an object is one of its properties may complicate such an argument.  However, the argument concludes that the conceptual challenge of ''bare particulars'' leaves a bundle of properties and nothing more as the only possible conception of an object, thus justifying bundle theory.

==Objections to the bundle theory==
Objections to bundle theory concern the nature of the ''bundle of properties'', the properties' ''[[wikt:compresence|compresence]]'' relation (the ''togetherness'' relation between those constituent properties), and the impact of language on understanding reality.

===''Compresence'' objection===
Bundle theory maintains that properties are ''bundled'' together in a collection without describing how they are tied together. For example, bundle theory regards an apple as red, four inches (100&amp;nbsp;mm) wide, and juicy but lacking an underlying ''substance''. The apple is said to be a ''bundle of properties'' including redness, being four inches (100&amp;nbsp;mm) wide, and juiciness.

Critics question how bundle theory accounts for the properties' ''[[wikt:compresence|compresence]]'' (the ''togetherness'' relation between those properties) without an underlying ''substance''. Critics also question how any two given properties are determined to be properties of the same object if there is no ''substance'' in which they both ''inhere''.

Traditional bundle theory, according to Professor Dustin Moriarty, explains the ''compresence'' of properties by defining an object as a collection of properties ''bound'' together. Thus, different combinations of properties and relations produce different objects. Redness and juiciness, for example, may be found together on top of the table because they are part of a bundle of properties located on the table, one of which is the &quot;looks like an apple&quot; property.

By contrast, [[substance theory]] explains the ''compresence'' of properties by asserting that the properties are found together because it is the ''substance'' that has those properties. In substance theory, a ''substance'' is the thing in which properties ''inhere''. For example, redness and juiciness are found on top of the table because redness and juiciness ''inhere'' in an apple, making the apple red and juicy.

The ''bundle theory of substance'' explains ''compresence''. Specifically, it maintains that properties' compresence itself engenders a ''substance''. Thus, it determines ''substancehood'' empirically by the ''togetherness'' of properties rather than by a ''bare particular'' or by any other non-empirical underlying strata. The ''bundle theory of substance'' thus rejects the substance theories of [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], and more recently, [[J.P. Moreland]], Jia Hou, Joseph Bridgman, [[Quentin Smith]], and others.

===''Language-reality'' objection===
{{See also|Syllogism}}
The ''language-reality'' objection to bundle theory relates to the impact [[language]] has on understanding [[reality]]. The objection maintains that language causes confusion that supports bundle theory.

Per the objection, properties are synthetic constructions of language and thinking alone provides reality to the properties of any object. An [[apple]], it claims, does not have the properties ''[[Red]]'' or ''[[Juicy]]'', but rather observers who already believe in a concept called ''Red'' use that concept to experience an apple as red. Further, the objection maintains that ''Red'' can not be distilled from an apple because ''Red'' is an abstraction from other experiences and not an innate property an apple might contain. Per the objection, expressions such as, &quot;An apple is red and juicy,&quot; includes at least six concepts and would best be left as dead-end logical propositions. Since the objection regards the words &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Juicy&quot; as simply abstractions of previous experiences, it contends that they contain only a personal summary concept of one individual. Thus, the experience of an apple is as close to the ''Apple'' concept that one can get. The objection regards any additional analytic work of the mind as a synthesis of other experiences that is incapable of logically revealing any true essence of ''Apple''.

The ''language-reality'' objection asserts that language encourages the belief that ''synthetic exercises'' distill experiences, yet it rejects the results of such exercises by maintaining that observers actually combine experiences to create each concept of any particular property. It holds that language is a complicated belief system whose only connection to reality is an abstraction of experience. The ''language-reality'' objection may even suggest that ''reality/non-reality'' or ''objective/subjective'' distinctions themselves are merely artifacts of language and therefore are also solely abstractions of experience.{{source?|date=August 2010}}

==Bundle theory and Buddhism==
The Buddhist [[Madhyamaka]] philosopher, [[Chandrakirti]], used the aggregate nature of objects to demonstrate the lack of [[essence]] in what is known as the sevenfold reasoning. In his work, ''[[Madhyamakāvatāra|Guide to the Middle Way]]'' (Skt. Madhyamakāvatāra), he says:

{{quote|[The self] is like a cart, which is not other than its parts, not non-other, and does not possess them. It is not within its parts, and its parts are not within it. It is not the mere collection, and it is not the shape.&lt;ref&gt;Chandrakiri, ''Guide to the Middle Way'', VI.151, translation in ''Ocean of Nectar'', p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He goes on to explain what is meant by each of these seven assertions, but briefly in a subsequent commentary he explains that the conventions of the world do not exist essentially when closely analyzed, but exist only through being taken for granted, without being subject to scrutiny that searches for an essence within them.

Another view of the Buddhist theory of the self, especially in early Buddhism, is that the Buddhist theory is essentially an eliminativist theory. According to this understanding, the self can not be reduced to a bundle because there is nothing that answers to the concept of a self. Consequently, the idea of a self must be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;James Giles, ''No Self to be Found: The Search for Personal Identity'' University Press of America, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]] '''Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|ən|t|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|m|ər|ɪ|_|ə|v|_|ˈ|æ|l|əm|eɪ|n}}; 17 November 1887 – 24 March 1976), nicknamed '''&quot;Monty&quot;''', was a [[British Army]] officer. He saw action in the [[World War I|First World War]], when he was seriously wounded, and during the [[World War II|Second World War]] he commanded the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|8th Army]] from August 1942 in the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] until the final Allied victory in Tunisia. This command included the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]], a major turning point in the [[Western Desert Campaign]]. He subsequently commanded Eighth Army in Sicily and [[Italy]] before being given responsibility for planning the D-Day invasion in Normandy. He was in command of all Allied ground forces during [[Operation Overlord]] from the initial landings until after the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]]. He then continued in command of the [[21st Army Group]] for the rest of the campaign in North West Europe. As such he was the principal field commander for [[Operation Market Garden|the failed airborne attempt to bridge the Rhine]] at [[Arnhem]] and the [[Operation Plunder|Allied Rhine crossing]]. On 4 May 1945 he took the German surrender at [[Luneburg Heath]] in northern Germany. After the War he became Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Forces of Occupation]] in Germany and then [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]].

==Early life==
Montgomery was born in [[Kennington]], [[London]], in 1887, the fourth child of nine, to an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[priest]], [[The Reverend]] [[Henry Hutchinson Montgomery]], and Maud Montgomery (née Farrar). Henry Montgomery, at the time the [[Vicar]] of St Mark's, Kennington, was the second son of the noted [[British Indian Empire|Indian]] administrator, [[Robert Montgomery (administrator)|Sir Robert Montgomery]], who died a month after Bernard's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of National Biography |volume=XXXVIII |last=Hamilton (entry author) |page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard's mother Maud was the daughter of the well-known preacher [[Frederic William Farrar]], and was 18 years younger than her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 3 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Sir Robert Montgomery, Henry inherited the Montgomery ancestral estate of New Park at [[Moville]], a town on the [[Inishowen]] Peninsula of north [[County Donegal]] in the west of [[Ulster]].

However, there was still £13,000 to pay on the [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]], a fairly large amount of money in the 1880s, and Henry was at the time still only a mere parish priest. Despite selling off all of those farms that were at Ballynally, &quot;there was barely enough to keep up New Park and pay for the blasted summer holiday&quot; (i.e., at New Park).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bishop Montgomery |last=Montgomery|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a financial relief of some magnitude  that in 1889 Henry was made [[Bishop]] of [[Tasmania]], then still a colony. He considered it his duty to spend as much time as possible in the outlying country of Tasmania and was away six months at a time. While he was away his wife, still in her mid-twenties, gave her children &quot;constant&quot; beatings,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 31 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; then ignored them most of the time as she performed the public duties of the bishop's wife. Of his siblings, Sibyl would die prematurely in Tasmania, and Harold, Donald and Una would all emigrate.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 5 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of her husband,  Maud Montgomery took little active interest in the education of her young children other than to have them taught by tutors brought across from England. The loveless environment made Bernard something of a bully, as he himself later recalled &quot;I was a dreadful little boy. I don't suppose anybody would put up with my sort of behaviour these days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chalfont, p. 29 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in life Montgomery refused to allow his son David to have anything to do with his grandmother and he refused to attend her funeral in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman &amp; Smith, p. 223 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The family returned home once for the [[Lambeth Conference]] in 1897, and Bernard and his brother Harold were educated for a term at [[The King's School, Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 36 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Bishop Montgomery became secretary of the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]], and the family returned to London. Montgomery went to [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and then the [[Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst]], from which he was almost expelled for setting fire to a fellow cadet during a fight with pokers. On graduation he joined the 1st Battalion, [[The Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers|The Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] in September 1908 as a second lieutenant,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=28178| startpage=6762| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=18 September 1908| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; first seeing service in [[British Raj|India]] until 1913. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=28382| startpage=3996| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=7 June 1910| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
The [[First World War]] began in August 1914 and Montgomery moved to France with his regiment that month. He saw service during the retreat from [[Battle of Mons|Mons]], during which half his battalion was destroyed. At [[Méteren]], near the Belgian border at [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]] on 13 October 1914, during an Allied counter-offensive, he was shot through the right [[lung]] by a sniper and was injured seriously enough for his grave to be dug in preparation for his death. A [[platoon]] [[sergeant]] came to assist him but was killed. He fell on Montgomery. The German sniper fired at him until [[sunset]]. The body of the sergeant protected Montgomery and took most of the enemy fire. Montgomery was hit once more though, in the knee.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman &amp; Smith, p. 224 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for gallant leadership. The citation for this award, published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' in December 1914 reads:{{quote box|align=center|Conspicuous gallant leading on 13th October, when he turned the enemy out of their trenches with the bayonet. He was severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=28992| startpage=10188| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=1 December 1914| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After recovering in early 1915, he was appointed to be [[brigade major]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=29080| startpage=1833| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=23 February 1915| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; training [[Kitchener's Army|Kitchener's New Army]] and returned to the Western Front in early 1916 as an operations staff officer during the battles of [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|the Somme]], [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras]], and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]. During this time he came under [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]], part of General Sir [[Herbert Plumer]]'s Second Army. Through his training, rehearsal, and integration of the infantry with artillery and engineers, the troops of Plumer's Second Army were able to achieve their objectives efficiently and without unnecessary casualties.

Montgomery served at the battles of [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|the Lys]] and [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Chemin-des-Dames]] before finishing the war as General Staff Officer 1 and effectively chief of staff of the [[British 47th (2nd London) Division|47th (2nd London) Division]], with the temporary rank of [[lieutenant-colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=30884| startpage=10505| endpage=| linkeddate=3 September 1918| supp=y| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph from October 1918 shows the then unknown Lt.-Col. Montgomery standing in front of [[Winston Churchill]] (Minister of Munitions) at the victory parade at Lille.

==Between the wars==
After the First World War Montgomery commanded 17th Battalion [[Royal Fusiliers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=31585| startpage=12398| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=3 October 1919| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a battalion in the [[British Army of the Rhine]], before reverting to his substantive rank of [[captain (OF-2)|captain]] (brevet major) in November 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=31799| startpage=2406| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=27 February 1920| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote up his experiences in a series of training pamphlets and manuals. He then attended the army's [[Staff College, Camberley]], before being appointed [[Brigade Major]] in the 17th Infantry Brigade in January 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=32207| startpage=760| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=26 January 1921| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade was stationed in [[County Cork]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. A cousin of Montgomery's, Lt Col. [[Hugh Montgomery (British officer)|Hugh Montgomery]], had been assassinated by the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] in 1920 (see the [[Cairo Gang]]). IRA officer [[Tom Barry]] said that he &quot;behaved with great correctness&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Montgomery came to the conclusion that the conflict could not be won without harsh measures, and that self-government was the only feasible solution; in 1923, after the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] and during the [[Irish Civil War]], Montgomery wrote to Colonel [[Arthur Percival]] of the Essex Regiment:
{{blockquote|&quot;Personally, my whole attention was given to defeating the rebels but it never bothered me a bit how many houses were burnt. I think I regarded all civilians as 'Shinners' and I never had any dealings with any of them. My own view is that to win a war of this sort, you must be ruthless. [[Oliver Cromwell]], or the Germans, would have settled it in a very short time. Nowadays public opinion precludes such methods, the nation would never allow it, and the politicians would lose their jobs if they sanctioned it. That being so, I consider that Lloyd George was right in what he did, if we had gone on we could probably have squashed the rebellion as a temporary measure, but it would have broken out again like an ulcer the moment we removed the troops. I think the rebels would probably [have] refused battles, and hidden their arms etc. until we had gone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan. ''British Voices'', pp. 151-52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1923, Montgomery was posted to the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial]] [[British 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division|49th Division]], eschewing the usual amounts of drill for tactical training{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. He returned to the 1st Royal Warwickshires in 1925 as a company commander and captain. In January 1926 having been promoted to major in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33083| startpage=5972| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=11 September 1925| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed D.A.A.G.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} at the [[Staff College, Camberley]] in the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33128| startpage=691| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=29 January 1926| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position he held until January 1929 by which time he had been made a ([[brevet (military)|brevet]] lieutenant-colonel).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33460| startpage=617| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=25 January 1929| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, he met and married [[Elizabeth Carver]], widow of [[Oswald Carver]], Olympic rowing medalist who was killed in the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p21864.htm#i218639 the Peerage,com]&lt;/ref&gt; Their son, [[David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|David]], was born in August 1928. Elizabeth Carver was the sister of the [[World War II|Second World War]] commander [[Percy Hobart]].

In 1931 Montgomery became lieutenant-colonel&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33681| startpage=378| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=16 January 1931| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; commanding the 1st Battalion of [[The Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] and saw service in [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Egypt]], and [[India]]. He was promoted to full colonel in 1934&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34067| startpage=4340| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=6 July 1934| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an instructor at the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] [[Command and Staff College|Staff College]] in [[Quetta]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34075| startpage=4975| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=3 August 1934| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was usual, Montgomery maintained links with the Royal Warwickshires and was later to take up the honorary position of Colonel-of-the-Regiment in 1947. Montgomery stirred up the resentment of his superiors for his arrogance and dictatorial ways, and also for his disregard of convention when it obstructed military effectiveness.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} For example, he set up a battalion [[brothel]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]] during the Second World War, regularly inspected by the medical officer, for the 'horizontal refreshment' of his soldiers rather than forcing them to take chances in unregulated establishments. He was quoted as saying that his men &quot;deserved it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 104 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

On completion of his tour of duty in India, Montgomery returned to Britain in June 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34426| startpage=5181| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=13 August 1937| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he became commanding officer of the 9th Infantry Brigade with the temporary rank of [[brigadier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34426| startpage=5178| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=13 August 1937| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that year also saw tragedy for him; his wife was bitten by an insect while on holiday in [[Burnham-on-Sea]]. The bite became infected, and his wife died in his arms from [[septicaemia]] following an [[amputation]]. The loss devastated Montgomery, but he insisted on throwing himself back into his work immediately after the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman &amp; Smith, p. 227 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, he organised an amphibious combined operations landing exercise that impressed the new [[commander-in-chief]], [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]], General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Wavell]]. He was promoted to major-general in October 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34566| startpage=6814| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=1 November 1938| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took command of the [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Division]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34566| startpage=6815| endpage=| supp=| linkeddate=1 November 1938| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Palestine. There he quashed an Arab revolt before returning in July 1939 to Britain, suffering a serious illness on the way, to command the [[British 3rd Infantry Division|3rd (Iron) Infantry Division]]. On hearing of the rebel defeat in April 1939, Montgomery said, &quot;I shall be sorry to leave Palestine in many ways, as I have enjoyed the war out here&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman &amp; Smith, p. 226 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
{{See also|World War II}}
Britain declared war on [[Germany]] on 3 September 1939. The 3rd Division was deployed to Belgium as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF). Montgomery predicted a disaster similar to that in 1914, and so spent the [[Phoney War]] training his troops for tactical retreat rather than offensive operations. During this time, Montgomery faced serious trouble from his superiors for his attitude regarding the sexual health of his soldiers. However, he was defended from dismissal by his superior [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], commander of [[British II Corps|II Corps]]. Montgomery's training paid off when the Germans began their invasion of the [[Low Countries]] on 10 May 1940 and the 3rd Division advanced to the River [[Dijle]] and then withdrew to [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]] with great professionalism, returning to Britain intact with minimal casualties. During [[Operation Dynamo]]—the evacuation of 330,000 BEF and French troops to Britain—Montgomery had assumed command of the [[British II Corps|II Corps]] after Brooke had taken acting command of the whole BEF.

On his return Montgomery antagonised the [[War Office]] with trenchant criticisms of the command of the BEF&lt;ref&gt;Bierman &amp; Smith, p. 228 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was briefly relegated to divisional command. He was however made a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]. In July 1940, he was appointed acting [[lieutenant-general]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34909| startpage=4660| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=26 July 1940| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; placed in command of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]], responsible for the defence of [[Hampshire]] and [[Dorset]], and started a long-running feud&lt;ref&gt;Bierman &amp; Smith, pp. 229-30 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; with the new commander-in-chief, Southern Command, [[Claude Auchinleck]]. In April 1941, he became commander of [[British XII Corps|XII Corps]] responsible for the defence of [[Kent]]. During this period he instituted a regime of continuous training and insisted on high levels of physical fitness for both officers and other ranks. He was ruthless in sacking officers he considered would be unfit for command in action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead303&quot;&gt;Mead, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1941 Montgomery was given command of [[Aldershot Command|South-Eastern Command]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35397| startpage=7369|date=26 December 1941| supp=y| accessdate = 26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; overseeing the defence of Kent, [[Sussex]] and [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead303&quot;/&gt; He renamed his command the South-Eastern Army to promote offensive spirit. During this time he further developed and rehearsed his ideas and trained his soldiers, culminating in [[Exercise Tiger (1942)|Exercise Tiger]] in May 1942, a combined forces [[Military exercise|exercise]] involving 100,000 troops.

[[File:Montgomery watches his tanks move up.jpg|thumb|Montgomery in a [[M3 Lee|Grant]] tank in North Africa, November 1942.]]

In 1942, a new field commander was required in the Middle East, where Auchinleck was fulfilling both the role of commander-in-chief [[Middle East Command]] and commander [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]. He had stabilised the Allied position at the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], but after a visit in August 1942, the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], replaced him as C-in-C with [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Alexander]] and [[William Gott]] as commander of the Eighth Army in the [[Western Desert campaign|Western Desert]]. After Gott was killed flying back to [[Cairo]] Churchill was persuaded by Brooke, who by this time was [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] to appoint Montgomery, who had only just been nominated to replace Alexander as commander of the British ground forces for [[Operation Torch]].&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Vol. III, pp. 367-369.&lt;/ref&gt;

A story, probably apocryphal but popular at the time, is that the appointment caused Montgomery to remark that &quot;After having an easy war, things have now got much more difficult.&quot; A colleague is supposed to have told him to cheer up - at which point Montgomery is supposed to have said &quot;I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about Rommel!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill, ''The Second World War'', vol. 4: ''The Hinge of Fate'', 1986, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery's assumption of command transformed the fighting spirit and abilities of the Eighth Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Playfair370&quot;&gt;Playfair, Vol. III, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking command on 13 August 1942, he immediately became a whirlwind of activity. He ordered the creation of the [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]], which contained all armoured divisions to fight alongside his [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] which was all infantry divisions. This was in no way similar to a German Panzer Corps. One of Rommel's Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one division commander. The only common commander for Montgomery's all infantry and all armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself. Correlli Barnett commented that Montgomery's solution &quot;...was in every way opposite to Auchinleck's and in every way wrong, for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Correlli Barnett, The Desert Generals, New York: Viking Press, 1961, p.265.&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery reinforced the {{convert|30|mi|km}} long front line at El Alamein, something that would take two months to accomplish. He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions (51st Highland and 44th) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order better to coordinate combined operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Playfair370&quot;/&gt; Montgomery was determined that the Army, Navy and Air Forces should fight their battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan. He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, [[Erwin Rommel]], to attack with the heights as his objective, something that Rommel soon did. Montgomery ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. &quot;I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal&quot;, he told his officers at the first meeting he held with them in the desert. &quot;If we are attacked, then there will be no retreat. If we cannot stay here alive, then we will stay here dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moorehead118-127&quot;&gt;Moorehead, Alan, ''Montgomery'', pp. 118-27 (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery made a great effort to appear before troops as often as possible, frequently visiting various units and making himself known to the men, often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed. Although he still wore a standard British officer's cap on arrival in the desert, he briefly wore an Australian broad-brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret (with the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment next to the British General Officer's badge) for which he became notable. The black beret had been offered to him by a soldier upon climbing into a tank to get a closer look at the front lines. Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the transformation in atmosphere when they visited on 19 August, less than a week after Montgomery had taken command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moorehead118-127&quot; /&gt;

====First battles with Rommel====
Rommel attempted to turn the left flank of the Eighth Army at the [[Battle of Alam Halfa]] from 31 August 1942. The German/Italian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw urgently lest their retreat through the British minefields be cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill, The Second World War, v.4 pp.  546-48&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking the retreating forces immediately, but he felt strongly that his methodical build-up of British forces was not yet ready. A hasty counter-attack risked ruining his strategy for an offensive on his own terms in late October, planning for which had begun soon after he took command.&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Vol. III, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; He was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant-general in mid October.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35746| startpage=4481| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=13 October 1942| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of Libya was essential for airfields to support [[Malta]] and to threaten the rear of Axis forces opposing [[Operation Torch]]. Montgomery prepared meticulously for the new offensive after convincing Churchill that the time was not being wasted. (Churchill sent a telegram to Alexander on 23 September 1942 which began, &quot;We are in your hands and of course a victorious battle makes amends for much delay.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt;) He was determined not to fight until he thought there had been sufficient preparation for a decisive victory, and put into action his beliefs with the gathering of resources, detailed planning, the training of troops—especially in clearing minefields and fighting at night&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Vol IV, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;—and in the use of 252&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Vol IV, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; of the latest American-built [[Sherman tank]]s, 90 [[M7 Priest]] self-propelled howitzers, and making a personal visit to every unit involved in the offensive. By the time the offensive was ready in late October, Eighth Army had 231,000 men on its ration strength&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Vol. IV, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; including British, Australian, South African, Indian, New Zealand, Greek and Free French units.

====El Alamein====
[[File:El Alamein 1942 - British infantry.jpg|thumb|Infantry advance during the Battle of El Alamein.]]
&lt;!-- Do not confuse this photo (E 18474) with another (E 18908). --&gt;
The [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] began on 23 October 1942, and ended 12 days later with the first large-scale, decisive Allied land victory of the war. Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Vol. IV, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, soon after British armoured units and infantry broke through the German and Italian lines and were pursuing the enemy forces at speed along the coast road, a violent rainstorm burst over the region, bogging down the tanks and support trucks in the desert mud. Montgomery, standing before his officers at headquarters and close to tears, announced that he was forced to call off the pursuit. Corelli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit the breakthrough, but nevertheless the Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, Vol. IV, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; prisoners were taken including the German second in command, [[Ritter von Thoma|General von Thoma]], as well as eight other general officers.&lt;ref&gt;Moorehead, pp. 140-41&lt;/ref&gt; Rommel, having been in a hospital in Germany at the start of the battle, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after [[Georg Stumme|General Stumme]] - his replacement as German commander - died of a heart attack in the early hours of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tunisia====
Montgomery was [[Order of the Bath|knighted]] and promoted to full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KCB+Gen&quot;/&gt; The Eighth Army's subsequent advance as the Germans retreated hundreds of miles towards their bases in [[Tunisia]] used the logistical as well as the firepower advantages of the British Army while avoiding unnecessary risks. It also gave the Allies an indication that the tide of war had genuinely turned in North Africa{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Montgomery kept the initiative, applying superior strength when it suited him, forcing Rommel out of each successive defensive position. On 6 March 1943, Rommel's attack on the over-extended Eighth Army at [[Medenine]] ([[Operation Capri]]) with the largest concentration of German armour in North Africa was successfully repulsed. At the [[Mareth Line]], 20 March to 27 March, when Montgomery encountered fiercer frontal opposition than he had anticipated, he switched his major effort into an outflanking inland pincer, backed by low-flying [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighter-bomber support.

This campaign demonstrated the battle-winning ingredients of morale (sickness and absenteeism were virtually eliminated in the Eighth Army{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}), co-operation of all arms including the air forces, first-class logistical back-up and clear-cut orders. For his role in North Africa he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] by the United States government in the rank of Chief Commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;LM&quot; /&gt;

====Sicily====
The next major Allied attack was the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] (Operation Husky). Montgomery considered the initial plans for the Allied invasion, which had been agreed in principle by Eisenhower and Alexander, to be unworkable because of the dispersion of effort. He managed to have the plans recast to concentrate the Allied forces, having Patton's Seventh US Army land in the Gulf of Gela (on the left flank of Eighth Army, which landed around Syracuse in the south-east of Sicily) rather than near Palermo in the west and north of Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Inter-Allied tensions grew as the American commanders [[George S. Patton|Patton]] and [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]] (then commanding II US Corps under Patton), took umbrage at what they perceived as Montgomery's attitudes and boastfulness. They resented him, while accepting his skills as a general.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

====Italian Campaign====
During the autumn of 1943, Montgomery continued to command the Eighth Army during the [[Allied invasion of Italy|landings on the mainland of Italy itself]]. In conjunction with the Anglo-American landings at Salerno (near Naples) by [[Mark Wayne Clark|Mark Clark]]'s [[United States Fifth Army|Fifth Army]] and seaborne landings by British paratroops in the heel of Italy (including the key port of Taranto, where they disembarked without resistance directly into the port), Montgomery led the Eighth Army up the toe of Italy. Some criticism was made of the slowness of Montgomery's advance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The Eighth Army, responsible for the eastern side of the Allied front, from the central [[Apennine mountains|Apennine mountain spine]] to the [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic coast]], fought a succession of engagements alternating between opposed crossings of the rivers running across their line of advance and attacks against the cleverly constructed defensive positions the Germans had fashioned on the ridges in between. The Eighth Army crossed the Sangro river in mid-November and penetrated the German's strongest position at the [[Gustav Line]] but as the winter weather deteriorated the advance ground to a halt as transport bogged down and air support operations became impossible. Montgomery abhorred the lack of coordination, the dispersion of effort, and the strategic muddle and opportunism he perceived in the Allied effort in Italy and was glad to leave the &quot;dog's breakfast&quot; on 23 December.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Normandy===
{{See also|Invasion of Normandy}}
[[File:Simonds.jpg|left|thumb|Montgomery with officers of the [[First Canadian Army]]. From left, Major-General [[Christopher Vokes|Vokes]], General [[Harry Crerar|Crerar]], Field Marshal Montgomery, Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks|Horrocks]], Lieutenant-General [[Guy Simonds|Simonds]], Major-General Spry, and Major-General Mathews]]
Montgomery returned to Britain to take command of the [[British 21st Army Group|21st Army Group]] which consisted of all Allied ground forces that would take part in [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of [[Normandy]]. Preliminary planning for the invasion had been taking place for two years, most recently by [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|COSSAC]] staff (Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander). {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Montgomery quickly concluded that the COSSAC plan was too limited, and strongly advocated expanding the plan from a three-division to a five-division assault. As with his takeover of the Eighth Army, Montgomery travelled frequently to his units, raising morale and ensuring training was progressing. At [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] on 7 April and 15 May he presented his strategy for the invasion. He envisaged a ninety day battle, ending when all the forces reached the [[Seine]], pivoting on an Allied-held [[Caen]], with British and Canadian armies forming a shoulder and the US armies wheeling on the right.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

During the hard fought two and a half month [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] that followed, the impact of a series of unfavourable autumnal weather conditions disrupted the Normandy landing areas and seriously hampered the tactical delivery of planned transportation of personnel and supplies which were being carried across the English Channel. Consequently, Montgomery argues in his literary account that he was unable to follow his pre-battle plan precisely to the timescales planned outside of battle. It should be noted that the extension of the battle plan by one month was the cause of significant retrospective criticisms of Montgomery by some of his American peers, including the much respected Bradley and equally controversial Patton. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Montgomery's initial plan was, most likely, for an immediate breakout toward [[Caen]]. Unable to do so, as the British did not get enough forces ashore to exploit the successful landing, Montgomery's advance was checked. When it appeared unlikely that the British Second Army would break out, Montgomery's contingency was designed to attract German forces to the British sector to ease the passing of United States Army through German defences to the west, during [[Operation Cobra]]. This series of battle plans by the British, Canadian and American armies trapped and defeated the German forces in Normandy in the [[Falaise pocket]]. The campaign that Montgomery fought was essentially [[Attrition warfare|attrition]]al until the middle of July with the occupation of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] and a series of offensives in the east, which secured Caen and attracted the bulk of German armour there. An American breakout was achieved with Operation Cobra and the encirclement of German forces in the [[Falaise pocket]] at the cost of British sacrifice with the diversionary [[Operation Goodwood]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Este, p. 202 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advance to the Rhine===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-14059-0018, Berlin, Oberbefehlshaber der vier Verbündeten.jpg|thumb|The Supreme Commanders on 5 June 1945 in Berlin:
Bernard Montgomery, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Georgy Zhukov]] and [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]].]]
The increasing preponderance of American troops in the European theatre (from five out of ten divisions at [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] to 72 out of 85 in 1945) made it a political impossibility for the Ground Forces Commander to be British. After the end of the Normandy campaign, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] himself took over Ground Forces Command while continuing as Supreme Commander, with Montgomery continuing to command the 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units. Montgomery bitterly resented this change, although it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} [[Winston Churchill]] had Montgomery promoted to [[field marshal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=36680| startpage=4055| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=29 August 1944| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; by way of compensation. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Montgomery was able to persuade Eisenhower to adopt his strategy of a single thrust to the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] with [[Operation Market Garden]] in September 1944. It was uncharacteristic of Montgomery's battles: the offensive was strategically bold, but poorly planned. Montgomery either didn't receive or ignored [[Ultra (cryptography)|ULTRA]] intelligence which warned of the presence of German armoured units near the site of the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lanning&quot; /&gt; As a result, the operation failed with the destruction of the [[British 1st Airborne Division]] at the [[Battle of Arnhem]] and the loss of any hopes of invading Germany by the end of 1944.

Montgomery's preoccupation with the push to the Ruhr had also distracted him from the essential task of clearing the [[Scheldt]] during the capture of [[Antwerp]]; {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and so, after Arnhem, Montgomery's group was instructed to concentrate on [[Battle of the Scheldt|doing this]] so that the port of [[Antwerp]] could be opened.

When the surprise attack on the Ardennes took place on 16 December 1944, starting the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the front of the [[U.S. 12th Army Group]] was split, with the bulk of the [[U.S. First Army]] being on the northern shoulder of the German 'bulge'. The Army Group commander, General [[Omar Bradley]], was located south of the penetration at [[Luxembourg]] and command of the U.S. First Army became problematic. Montgomery was the nearest commander on the ground and on 20 December, Eisenhower (who was in [[Versailles]]) transferred [[Courtney Hodges]]' U.S. First Army and [[William Hood Simpson|William Simpson]]'s [[U.S. Ninth Army]] to his 21st Army Group, despite Bradley's vehement objections on national grounds.{{#tag:ref|For a full discussion see {{Cite book| title=United States Army in World War II.

Winter Counteroffensives| location=Washington DC |id=CMH Pub. 7-1}}|group=nb}} Montgomery grasped the situation quickly, visiting all divisional, corps, and army field commanders himself and instituting his '[[GHQ Liaison Regiment|Phantom]]' network of liaison officers. He grouped the [[British XXX Corps]] as a strategic reserve behind the Meuse and reorganised the US defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of [[Sankt Vith|St Vith]]. The German commander of the 5th Panzer Army, [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The operations of the American 1st Army had developed into a series of individual holding actions. Montgomery's contribution to restoring the situation was that he turned a series of isolated actions into a coherent battle fought according to a clear and definite plan. It was his refusal to engage in premature and piecemeal counter-attacks which enabled the Americans to gather their reserves and frustrate the German attempts to extend their breakthrough.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Delaforce, ''The Battle of the Bulge — Hitler's Final Gamble'' {{Page needed|date=December 2008}} (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eisenhower had then wanted Montgomery to go on the offensive on 1 January to meet Patton's army that had started advancing from the south on 19 December and in doing so, trap the Germans. However, Montgomery refused to commit infantry he considered underprepared into a snowstorm and for a strategically unimportant piece of land. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He did not launch the attack until 3 January, by which point the German forces had been able to escape. A large part of American military opinion thought that he should not have held back, though it was characteristic of him to use drawn-out preparations for his attack. After the battle the U.S. First Army was restored to the 12th Army Group; the U.S. Ninth Army remained under 21st Army Group until it crossed the Rhine. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Montgomery's 21st Army Group advanced to the Rhine with operations [[Operation Veritable|Veritable]] and [[Operation Grenade|Grenade]] in February 1945. A meticulously-planned [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossing]] occurred on 24 March. While successful it was weeks after the Americans had unexpectedly captured the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] and crossed the river. Montgomery's river crossing was followed by the [[Ruhr Pocket|encirclement]] of the German [[Army Group B]] in the [[Ruhr]]. Initially Montgomery's role was to guard the flank of the American advance. This was altered, however, to forestall any chance of a [[Red Army]] advance into Denmark, and the 21st Army Group occupied [[Hamburg]] and [[Rostock]] and sealed off the [[Denmark|Danish]] peninsula.

On 4 May 1945, on [[Lüneburg Heath]], Montgomery accepted the [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] of German forces in northern Germany, Denmark and the [[Netherlands]]. This was done plainly in a tent without any ceremony. In the same year he was awarded the [[Order of the Elephant]], the highest order in Denmark.

==Later life==

After the war Montgomery became the C-in-C of the British Forces of Occupation and the British member of the Allied Control Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead309&quot;&gt;Mead, p.309.&lt;/ref&gt; He was created 1st [[Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37407| startpage=1| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=28 December 1945| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] from 1946 until 1948, succeeding Alanbrooke, but was largely a failure as it required strategic and political skills he did not possess. He was barely on speaking terms with his fellow chiefs, sending his VCIGS to attend their meetings&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead309&quot;/&gt; and he clashed particularly with [[Arthur Tedder]], who as Deputy Supreme Commander had intrigued for Montgomery's dismissal during the Battle of Normandy, and who was by now [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]. When Montgomery's term of office expired, Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] appointed General (later Field-Marshal) [[William Slim]] as his successor; when Montgomery protested that he had told his [[protegé]] [[General Crocker]], a former corps commander from the 1944-5 campaign, that the job was to be his, Attlee is said to have given the memorable retort &quot;Untell him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery was then appointed Chairman of the [[Western European Union]]'s commanders-in-chief committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead309&quot;/&gt; Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton's ''Life of Montgomery of Alamein'' gives a good account of the bickering between Montgomery and his land forces chief, a French general, which created splits through the Union headquarters. He was thus pleased to become Eisenhower's deputy in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|European]] forces in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=39352| startpage=5221| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=9 October 1951| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an effective inspector-general and mounted good exercises, but out of his depth politically, and his exacting manner and emphasis on efficiency created ill-feeling. He continued to serve under Eisenhower's successors, [[Matthew Ridgway]] and [[Alfred Gruenther|Al Gruenther]], until his retirement, aged nearly 71, in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=41508| startpage=5954| endpage=| supp=y| linkeddate=26 September 1958| accessdate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died in 1949; Montgomery did not attend the funeral, claiming he was &quot;too busy&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He was chairman of the governing body of [[St. John's School, Leatherhead|St John's School]], [[Leatherhead]], [[Surrey]] from 1951 to 1966 and a generous supporter. Montgomery was an Honorary Member of the [[Winkle Club]], a noted charity in Hastings, East Sussex, and introduced [[Winston Churchill]] to the club in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpafilmlibrary.com/detail/sir_winston_gets_the_winkle_fishermen_of_hastings_old_town_make_sir_winston_churchill_a_member_of_winkle_club/2215a667-8af7-7d60-c557-8fe40541633d.html Sir Winston Churchill Gets The Winkle In Ceremony at Hastings.

[[File:Monty, wavvel, auk.jpg|thumb|right|Montgomery as [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] with [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Wavell]] and [[Claude Auchinleck|Auchinleck]].]]

In 1953, the Hamilton Board of Education in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Ontario, Canada, wrote to Montgomery and asked permission to name a new school in the city's east end after him. Viscount Montgomery Elementary was billed as &quot;the most modern school in North America&quot; and the largest single-storey school in Hamilton, when the sod was turned on 14 March 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/viscountmontgomery/history.asp History of Viscount Montgomery School]&lt;!--accessed 12 November 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The school officially opened on 18 April 1953, with Montgomery in attendance among almost 10,000 well-wishers. At the opening, he gave the motto &quot;Gardez Bien&quot; from his own family's [[coat of arms]].

Montgomery referred to the school as his &quot;beloved school&quot; and visited on five separate occasions, the last being in 1960. On his last visit, he said to &quot;his&quot; students:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let's make Viscount Montgomery School the best in Hamilton, the best in Ontario, the best in Canada. I don't associate myself with anything that is not good. It is up to you to see that everything about this school is good. It is up to the students to not only be their best in school but in their behaviour outside of Viscount. Education is not just something that will help you pass your exams and get you a job, it is to develop your brain to teach you to marshal facts and do things.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before retirement, Montgomery's outspoken views on some subjects, such as race, were often officially suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} After retirement these outspoken views became public and his reputation suffered. He supported [[apartheid]] and Chinese communism under [[Mao Zedong]], and spoke against the legalisation of [[homosexuality]] in the [[United Kingdom]], arguing that the ''[[Sexual Offences Act 1967]]'' was a &quot;charter for buggery&quot; and that &quot;this sort of thing may be tolerated by the French, but we're British — thank God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Columbia dictionary of quotations|author=Robert Andrews|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=419|isbn=0380709325}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several of Montgomery's biographers, including Chalfont (who found something &quot;disturbingly equivocal&quot; in &quot;his relations with boys and young men&quot; {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}) and Nigel Hamilton (2002) have suggested that he may himself have been a repressed homosexual; in the late 1940s he conducted an affectionate friendship with a 12-year-old Swiss boy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=EXUy7JfcZDwC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=Lucien+Trueb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hm5RSaojZ1&amp;sig=xncfgPYAviDJDavwBoduMmUcIhM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Et3ITN97xslxhc2IoA4&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lucien%20Trueb&amp;f=false Colin F.

[[File:BernardMontgomery Aberdare Blog crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Montgomery at [[Whitehall]], London unveiled in 1980]]

Montgomery's memoirs (1958) criticised many of his wartime comrades in harsh terms, including Eisenhower, whom he accused, among other things, of prolonging the war by a year through poor leadership—allegations which ended their friendship, not least as Eisenhower was still US President at the time. He was stripped of his honorary citizenship of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama, and was challenged to a duel by an Italian officer.&lt;ref&gt;According to La Repubblica, 2.22.1992 the challenge actually came from Vincenzo Caputo, a Sicilian Lawyer.&lt;/ref&gt; He was threatened with legal action by Field-Marshal Auchinleck for suggesting that Auchinleck had intended to retreat from the Alamein position if attacked again, and had to give a radio broadcast (20 November 1958) expressing his gratitude to Auchinleck for having stabilised the front at the First Battle of Alamein. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The 1960 edition of his memoirs contains a publisher's note (opposite page 15) drawing attention to that broadcast, and stating that in the publisher's view the reader might assume from Montgomery's text that Auchinleck had been planning to retreat and pointing out that this was in fact not the case. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Montgomery was never raised to an [[earldom]] like his wartime contemporaries [[Harold Alexander]], [[Louis Mountbatten]] and even [[Archibald Wavell]], but unlike them he had never been a Theatre Supreme Commander or held high political office. An official task he insisted on performing in his later years was bearing the [[Sword of State]] during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]. His increasing frailty, however, raised concerns about his ability to stand for long periods while carrying the heavy weapon. Ultimately, those fears were borne out when he collapsed in mid-ceremony in 1968 and did not perform this function again. A favourite pastime of the British press {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} during these years was to photograph Montgomery cashing his old age pension cheque at the local [[social security]] office. Due to his eminence, many {{Who|date=June 2009}} assumed Montgomery was wealthy and did not need the money. In fact, he had always been a man of modest means and it caused him great anguish that many believed he was taking taxpayer money he did not need. Another blow was a break-in at his home. Despite his making a televised appeal for the return of his possessions, the items were never recovered. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
