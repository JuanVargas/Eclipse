'''Andrew Jackson''' (March 15, 1767{{ndash}} June 8, 1845) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|seventh]] [[President of the United States]] (1829–1837). Based in frontier Tennessee, Jackson was a politician and army general who defeated the British at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] (1815) and the Creek Indians at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] (1814). A polarizing figure who dominated the [[Second Party System]] in the 1820s and 1830s, he destroyed the national bank and relocated most Indian tribes to the west. His enthusiastic followers created the modern [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], and the 1830-1850 period later became known as the era of [[Jacksonian democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean Wilentz|Wilentz, Sean]]. ''Andrew Jackson'' (2005), p. 8, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was nicknamed &quot;'''Old Hickory'''&quot; because of his toughness and aggressive personality that produced numerous duels, some fatal.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/jqadams/essays/biography/3 |title=John Quincy Adams: Campaigns and Elections |date=December 8, 2010 |work=American President: An Online Reference Resource |publisher=University of Virginia |first=Mary |last=Hargreaves |quote=In a masterstroke of popular politics, the Jacksonians made good use of the general's nickname, Old Hickory. He had earned the name because he was reputed to be as tough as hickory wood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a rich slave owner who appealed to the masses of Americans and fought against what he denounced as a closed undemocratic aristocracy. He expanded the [[spoils system]] during his presidency to strengthen his political base, regardless of the cost of inefficiency and bias. 

As president, he supported a small and limited federal government but strengthened the power of the presidency, which he saw as spokesman for the entire population–as opposed to Congressmen from a specific small district. He was supportive of [[state's rights]], but, during the [[Nullification Crisis]], declared that states do not have the right to nullify federal laws. Strongly against the [[national bank]], he vetoed the renewal of its charter and ensured its collapse. Whigs and moralists denounced his aggressive enforcement of the [[Indian Removal Act]], which resulted in the forced relocation of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes to [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]).
 
His legacy is now seen as mixed by historians. He is praised as a protector of popular democracy and individual liberty for American citizens, but criticized for his support for [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[Indian removal]].&lt;ref name=legacy1&gt;Finkelman, Paul (2006). &quot;Jackson, Andrew (1767–1845),&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties'', 3 vols., Routledge (CRC Press), ISBN 978-0-415-94342-0, vol. 2 (G-Q), p.

==Early life and career==
===Parents and birth===
[[File:Andrew Jackson mural.png|thumb|170px|left|Jackson's Scotch-Irish heritage celebrated by a mural on [[Belfast]]'s [[Shankill Road]]]]
Jackson was born on March 15, 1767. His parents were [[Presbyterian]] [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, who had emigrated from Ireland two years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;birthplace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson |work=Information Services Branch, State Library of North Carolina |url=http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/bio/public/jackson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrick&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson Cottage and US Rangers Centre |work=[[Northern Ireland Tourist Board]] |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=2801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's father was born in [[Carrickfergus]], [[County Antrim]], in Ireland around 1738.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gullan|first=Harold I. |title=First fathers: the men who inspired our Presidents|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Hoboken, N.J. : J|date=c2004|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YSt1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Andrew+Jackson,+Sr.%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;dq=%22Andrew+Jackson,+Sr.%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=9|isbn=0471465976 |oclc=53090968 |id= {{lccn|2003||020625}} |pages= xii, 308 p. : ill. ; 25&amp;nbsp;cm | accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house that Jackson's parents lived in, in the village of [[Boneybefore]] in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]], is now preserved as the [[Andrew Jackson Centre]] and is open to the public. 

When they emigrated to America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in Pennsylvania and made their way overland to the Scotch-Irish community in the [[Waxhaws]] region, straddling the border between [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;Booraem, Hendrik (2001) ''Young Hickory : The Making of Andrew Jackson'' p.9&lt;/ref&gt; They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764). 

Jackson's father died in an accident in February 1767, at the age of 29, three weeks before Jackson was born. Jackson was born in the [[Waxhaws]] area, but his exact birth site is unclear because he was born around the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying Jackson's father. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not officially been surveyed yet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Old&quot;/&gt;

In 1824, Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation in [[Lancaster County, South Carolina]]. But he may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the [[Tariff of 1824]], which Jackson opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he may have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Old&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |date=March 7, 2011 |first=Jeffrey|last=Collings |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/06/AR2011030603406.html?wprss=rss_print/asection |title=Old fight lingers over Old Hickory's roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary War===
[[File:Andrew-Jackson-disobeys-British-officer-1780.png|thumb|left|''Young Jackson Refusing to Clean Major Coffin's Boots'' (1876 [[lithography|lithograph]]).]] &lt;!-- official title, searching for author --&gt;
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Jackson, at age thirteen, joined a local militia as a courier.&lt;ref&gt;Remini 1:15-17&lt;/ref&gt; His eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion during the [[Battle of Stono Ferry]], on June 20, 1779. Jackson and his brother Robert were captured by the British and held as prisoners; they nearly starved to death in captivity. When Jackson refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving Jackson with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remini 1:13&quot;&gt;Remini 1:13&lt;/ref&gt; While imprisoned, the brothers contracted smallpox. Robert died a few days after their mother secured their release, on April 27, 1781. After his mother was assured Andrew would recover, she volunteered to nurse prisoners of war on board two ships in Charleston harbor, where there had been an outbreak of cholera. She died from the disease in November 1781, and was buried in an unmarked grave, leaving Jackson an orphan at age 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remini 1:13&quot;/&gt; Jackson's entire immediate family–aside from his father, who had died earlier–died from hardships during the war; Jackson blamed the British.

Jackson was the last U.S. President to have been a veteran of the American Revolution. 

===Legal and political career===
Jackson received a sporadic education in the local &quot;old-field&quot; school. In 1781, he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop.&lt;ref name=Paletta&gt;{{cite book |last=Paletta|first=Lu Ann |coauthors=Worth, Fred L |title=The World Almanac of Presidential Facts |publisher=World Almanac Books |year=1988 |isbn=0345348885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he taught school and studied law in [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. In 1787, he was admitted to the bar, and moved to [[Jonesboro, Tennessee|Jonesborough]], in what was then the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Western District]] of North Carolina. This area later became the [[Southwest Territory]] (1790), the precursor to the state of Tennessee.

Though his legal education was scanty, Jackson knew enough to be a [[country lawyer]] on the [[American frontier|frontier]]. Since he was not from a distinguished family, he had to make his career by his own merits; soon he began to prosper in the rough-and-tumble world of frontier law. Most of the actions grew out of disputed land-claims, or from [[assault (tort)|assault]] and [[battery (tort)|battery]]. In 1788, he was appointed Solicitor of the Western District and held the same position in the government of the [[Territory South of the River Ohio]] after 1791.

Jackson was a delegate to the Tennessee [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, Jackson was elected its [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]. The following year he was elected [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] as a [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]], but he resigned within a year. In 1798, he was appointed a judge of the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]], serving until 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Jackson, Andrew, (1767&amp;nbsp;– 1845), |publisher=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planter, merchant, and investor===
Besides his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as a slave owner, planter, and merchant. He built a home and the first general store in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]] in 1803. The next year he acquired [[The Hermitage (Tennessee)|the Hermitage]], a {{convert|640|acre|0|abbr=on}} plantation in [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], near [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Jackson later added {{convert|360|acre|0|abbr=on}} to the plantation, which eventually grew to {{convert|1050|acres|0|abbr=on}}. The primary crop was [[cotton]], grown by enslaved workers. Jackson started with nine slaves, held as many as 44 by 1820, and later held up to 150 slaves. Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Remini (2000), p.51 cites 1820 census; mentions later figures up to 150 without noting a source.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehermitage.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=36&amp;Itemid=49 |title=Hermitage |publisher=Thehermitage.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was a major land speculator in West Tennessee after he had negotiated the sale of the land from the [[Chickasaw Nation]] in 1818 (termed the [[Jackson Purchase (U.S. historical region)|Jackson Purchase]]) and was one of the three original investors who founded [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1819 (see [[History of Memphis, Tennessee]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=J008 Jackson Purchase] in the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
===War of 1812===
{{Main|Creek War|Battle of New Orleans}}

Jackson was appointed commander of the Tennessee militia in 1801, with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].

During the [[War of 1812]], [[Tecumseh]] incited the &quot;[[Red Stick]]&quot; [[Creek people|Creek]] Indians of northern Alabama and Georgia to attack white settlements. Four hundred settlers were killed in the [[Fort Mims Massacre]]. In the resulting [[Creek War]], Jackson commanded the American forces, which included Tennessee militia, U.S. [[Regular Army (United States)|regulars]], and [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and Southern Creek Indians.

Jackson defeated the Red Stick Creeks at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814. Eight hundred &quot;Red Sticks&quot; were killed, but Jackson spared chief [[William Weatherford]]. [[Sam Houston]] and [[David Crockett]] served under Jackson in this campaign. After the victory, Jackson imposed the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] upon both the Northern Creek enemies and the Southern Creek allies, wresting twenty million acres (81,000&amp;nbsp;km²) from all Creeks for white settlement. Jackson was appointed Major General after this action.

General Andrew Jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Highlanders]], as imagined by painter [[Edward Percy Moran]] in 1910.]]
Jackson's service in the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom was conspicuous for bravery and success. When British forces threatened [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], Jackson took command of the defenses, including militia from several western states and territories. He was a strict officer but was popular with his troops. It was said he was &quot;tough as old hickory&quot; wood on the battlefield, which gave him the nickname of &quot;Old Hickory&quot;. In the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on January 8, 1815, Jackson's 5,000 soldiers won a decisive victory over 7,500 British. At the end of the battle, the British had 2,037 casualties: 291 dead (including three senior generals), 1,262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing. The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing.&lt;ref&gt;Remini, Robert V. (1999) The battle of New Orleans, New York: Penguin Books. p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

The war, and especially this victory, made Jackson a national hero. He received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and a gold medal by resolution of February 27, 1815. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] later commented in [[Democracy in America]] that Jackson &quot;...was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans.&quot;

===First Seminole War===
{{Main|Seminole Wars}}

Jackson served in the military again during the [[Seminole Wars|First Seminole War]]. He was ordered by President [[James Monroe]] in December 1817 to lead a campaign in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] against the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing [[Spanish Florida]] from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His directions were to &quot;terminate the conflict.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Remini, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida. Before going, Jackson wrote to Monroe, &quot;Let it be signified to me through any channel... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Monroe gave Jackson orders that were purposely ambiguous, sufficient for international denials.

[[File:Bustofandrewjackson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Military governor Jackson was sworn in at [[Plaza Ferdinand VII]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]]]]

The Seminoles attacked Jackson's Tennessee volunteers. The Seminoles' attack, however, left their villages vulnerable, and Jackson burned them and the crops. He found letters that indicated that the Spanish and British were secretly assisting the Indians. Jackson believed that the United States could not be secure as long as Spain and the United Kingdom encouraged Indians to fight, and argued that his actions were undertaken in self-defense. Jackson captured [[Pensacola, Florida]], with little more than some warning shots, and deposed the Spanish governor. He captured and then tried and executed two British subjects, [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident|Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot]], who had been supplying and advising the Indians. Jackson's action also struck fear into the Seminole tribes as word spread of his ruthlessness in battle (Jackson was known as &quot;Sharp Knife&quot;).

The executions, and Jackson's invasion of territory belonging to Spain, a country with which the U.S. was not at war, created an international incident. Many in the Monroe administration called for Jackson to be [[Censure in the United States|censured]]. Jackson's actions were defended by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]], an early believer in [[Manifest Destiny]]. When the Spanish minister demanded a &quot;suitable punishment&quot; for Jackson, Adams wrote back, &quot;Spain must immediately [decide] either to place a force in Florida adequate at once to the protection of her territory ... or cede to the United States a province, of which she retains nothing but the nominal possession, but which is, in fact ... a post of annoyance to them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jefferson and His Colleagues |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/jefferson/grizzard/johnson/johnson13.html |accessdate=October 11, 2006 |last=Johnson |first=Allen |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams used Jackson's conquest, and Spain's own weakness, to get Spain to cede Florida to the United States by the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]]. Jackson was subsequently named military governor and served from March 10, 1821, to December 31, 1821.

==Election of 1824==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1824}}

The Tennessee legislature nominated Jackson for President in 1822. It also elected him U.S. Senator again.
[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson in 1824, painting by [[Thomas Sully]]]]
By 1824, the Democratic-Republican Party had become the only functioning national party. Its Presidential candidates had been chosen by an informal [[Congressional nominating caucus]], but this had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Treasury Secretary [[William H. Crawford]] for President and [[Albert Gallatin]] for Vice President. A [[Pennsylvania]]n convention nominated Jackson for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the &quot;voice of the people&quot; and was a &quot;vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rutland |first=Robert Allen |title=The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton |pages=48–49 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0826210341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallatin criticized Jackson as &quot;an honest man and the idol of the worshippers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Henry. ''The Life of Albert Gallatin'' (1879), 599.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Andrew Jackson2 1862 Issue-2c.jpg|thumb|[[US Presidents on US postage stamps#First appearances|&lt;center&gt;'''1st Jackson postage stamp&lt;/center&gt;]]'''&lt;center&gt;issue of 1863&lt;/center&gt;]]

Besides Jackson and Crawford, Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] and House Speaker [[Henry Clay]] were also candidates. Jackson received the most popular votes (but not a majority, and four states had no popular ballot). The [[United States Electoral College|Electoral votes]] were split four ways, with Jackson having a plurality. Since no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which chose Adams. Jackson supporters denounced this result as a &quot;[[corrupt bargain]]&quot; because Clay gave his state's support to Adams, and subsequently Adams appointed Clay as Secretary of State. As none of Kentucky's electors had initially voted for Adams, and Jackson had won the popular vote, it appeared that Henry Clay had violated the will of the people and substituted his own judgment in return for personal political favors. Jackson's defeat burnished his political credentials, however; many voters believed the &quot;man of the people&quot; had been robbed by the &quot;corrupt aristocrats of the East.&quot;{{clear}}

==Election of 1828==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1828}}

Jackson resigned from the Senate in October 1825, but continued his quest for the Presidency. The Tennessee legislature again nominated Jackson for President. Jackson attracted Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Martin Van Buren]], and [[Thomas Ritchie]] into his camp (Van Buren and Ritchie were previous supporters of Crawford). Van Buren, with help from his friends in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], revived the old Republican Party, gave it a new name as the Democratic Party, &quot;restored party rivalries,&quot; and forged a national organization of durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rutland |first=Robert Allen |title=The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton |pages=55–56 |year=1995 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0826210341}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jackson coalition handily defeated Adams in 1828.
[[File:Andrew Jackson statue County Courthouse KC Missouri.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Jackson as General in front of Jackson County Courthouse in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]]]

During the election, Jackson's opponents referred to him as a &quot;[[Donkey|jackass]]&quot;. Jackson liked the name and used the jackass as a symbol for a while, but it died out. However, it later became the symbol for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] popularized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/questions/week174.htm |title=Nickels, Ilona; &quot;How did Republicans pick the elephant, and Democrats the donkey, to represent their parties?&quot;; &quot;Capitol Questions&quot; feature at c-span.com; September&amp;nbsp;5, 2000 |publisher=C-span.org |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was very much a personal one. Although neither candidate personally campaigned, their political followers organized many campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press, which reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]] of bigamy. Though the accusation was true, as were most personal attacks leveled against him during the campaign, it was based on events that occurred many years prior (1791 to 1794). Jackson said he would forgive those who insulted him, but he would never forgive the ones who attacked his wife. Rachel died suddenly on December 22, 1828, before his inauguration, and was buried on Christmas Eve.{{clear}}

===Inauguration===
{{Main|Andrew Jackson 1829 presidential inauguration}}
Jackson was the first President to invite the public to attend the [[White House]] ball honoring his first inauguration. Many poor people came to the inaugural ball in their homemade clothes. The crowd became so large that Jackson's guards could not keep them out of the White House, which became so crowded with people that dishes and decorative pieces inside were eventually broken. Some people stood on good chairs in muddied boots just to get a look at the President. The crowd had become so wild that the attendants poured punch in tubs and put it on the White House lawn to lure people outside. Jackson's raucous populism earned him the nickname &quot;King Mob&quot;.

==Election of 1832==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1832}}
In the 1832 presidential election, Jackson easily won reelection as the candidate of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] against [[Henry Clay]], of the [[National Republican Party]], and [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], of the [[Anti-Masonic Party]]. Jackson jettisoned Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]] because of his support for [[Nullification Crisis|nullification]] and involvement in the [[Petticoat affair]], replacing him with longtime confidant [[Martin Van Buren]] of New York.

===Federal debt===
{{See also|Panic of 1837}}
In January 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/04/15/135423586/when-the-u-s-paid-off-the-entire-national-debt-and-why-it-didnt-last?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo1.htm |title=Historical Debt Outstanding - Annual 1791 - 1849 |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work=Public Debt Reports |publisher=Treasury Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this accomplishment was short lived. A severe [[depression (economics)|depression]] from 1837 to 1844 caused a tenfold increase in national debt within its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/dep1837.htm |title=The Depression of 1837-1844 |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |last=Watkins |first=Thayer |coauthors= |date= |work=San José State University Department of Economics |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral College===
Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President.&lt;ref name=firstaddress&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's First Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29471 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's Second Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29472 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view &quot;I have heretofore recommended amendments of the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]] giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew Jackson's Third Annual Message to Congress |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29473 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spoils system===
{{Main|Spoils system}}
When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of [[rotation in office]], declaring it &quot;a leading principle in the republican creed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;firstaddress&quot;/&gt; He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. To strengthen party loyalty, Jackson's supporters wanted to give the posts to party members. In practice, this meant replacing federal employees with friends or party loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Spoils System]], as the rotation in office system was called, did not originate with Jackson. It originated with New York governors in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (most notably [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] and [[DeWitt Clinton]]). [[Thomas Jefferson]] brought it to the [[Executive Branch]] when he replaced Federalist office-holders after becoming President. [http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h965.html The Spoils System versus the Merit System.] Retrieved on November 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effect was not as drastic as expected or portrayed. By the end of his term, Jackson dismissed less than twenty percent of the Federal employees at the start of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=637 Jacksonian Democracy: The Presidency of Andrew Jackson]. Retrieved on November 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; While Jackson did not start the &quot;spoils system,&quot; he did indirectly encourage its growth for many years to come.

===Opposition to the National Bank===
{{Main|Bank War}}
[[File:AJ~bank.JPG|thumb|Democratic cartoon shows Jackson fighting the monster Bank. &quot;The Bank,&quot; Jackson told [[Martin Van Buren]], &quot;is trying to kill me, but I will kill it!&quot;]]
The [[Second Bank of the United States]] was authorized for a twenty year period during [[James Madison]]'s tenure in 1816. As President, Jackson worked to rescind the bank's federal charter. In Jackson's veto message (written by [[George Bancroft]]), the bank needed to be abolished because:

* It concentrated the nation's financial strength in a single institution.
* It exposed the government to control by foreign interests.
* It served mainly to make the rich richer.
* It exercised too much control over members of Congress.
* It favored northeastern states over southern and western states.
* Banks are controlled by a few select families.
* Banks have a long history of instigating wars between nations, forcing them to borrow funding to pay for them.

Following Jefferson, Jackson supported an &quot;agricultural republic&quot; and felt the Bank improved the fortunes of an &quot;elite circle&quot; of commercial and industrial entrepreneurs at the expense of farmers and laborers. After a titanic struggle, Jackson succeeded in destroying the Bank by vetoing its 1832 re-charter by Congress and by withdrawing U.S. funds in 1833. (See [[Banking in the Jacksonian Era]])

[[File:1832bank1.jpg|thumb|1833 Democratic cartoon shows Jackson destroying the [[Second Bank of the United States|devil's Bank]].]]

The bank's money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that sprang up. This fed an expansion of credit and speculation. At first, as Jackson withdrew money from the Bank to invest it in other banks, land sales, canal construction, cotton production, and manufacturing boomed.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=640 |title=Digital History |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the practice of banks issuing paper banknotes that were not backed by gold or silver reserves, there was soon rapid inflation and mounting state debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/biography/jackson/section10.rhtml |title=Sparknotes |publisher=Sparknotes |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1836, Jackson issued the [[Specie Circular]], which required buyers of government lands to pay in &quot;specie&quot; (gold or silver coins). The result was a great demand for specie, which many banks did not have enough of to exchange for their notes. These banks collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalhistory&quot;/&gt; This was a direct cause of the [[Panic of 1837]], which threw the national economy into a deep [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. It took years for the economy to recover from the damage.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T. Critchlow, Paula C. Baker (2004). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=VL_6X5zWOokC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=PA349&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false America's promise: a concise history of the United States]''&quot;. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. p.210. ISBN 0742511898&lt;/ref&gt; 

The U.S. Senate censured Jackson on March 28, 1834, for his action in removing U.S. funds from the Bank of the United States. When the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged.

===Nullification crisis===
{{Main|Nullification Crisis}}
Another notable crisis during Jackson's period of office was the &quot;[[Nullification Crisis]]&quot;, or &quot;secession crisis,&quot; of 1828&amp;nbsp;– 1832, which merged issues of sectional strife with disagreements over tariffs. Critics alleged that high tariffs (the &quot;[[Tariff of Abominations]]&quot;) on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South. Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists at the expense of southern farmers.

The issue came to a head when Vice President Calhoun, in the [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, [[South Carolina]], that it had the right to &quot;nullify&quot;—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he was also a strong supporter of a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men.

Particularly notable was an incident at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. [[Robert Hayne]] began by toasting to &quot;The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.&quot; Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added &quot;Our federal Union: It must be preserved!&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding &quot;The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrew Jackson Presidential $1 Coin obverse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Jackson Presidential Dollar]]]]
The next year, Calhoun and Jackson broke apart politically from one another. Around this time, the [[Petticoat affair]] caused further resignations from Jackson's cabinet, leading to its reorganization as the &quot;[[Kitchen Cabinet]]&quot;. [[Martin Van Buren]], despite resigning as Secretary of State, played a leading role in the new unofficial cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.grolier.com/article?assetid=0400180-00 Martin Van Buren biography at Encyclopedia Americana]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1832 Democratic National Convention|first Democratic National Convention]], privately engineered by members of the Kitchen Cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parton |first=James | author-link=James Parton |title=Life of Andrew Jackson |volume=3 |pages=381–385 |year=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1428639292}}. First published in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Buren replaced Calhoun as Jackson's running mate. In December 1832, Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.

In response to South Carolina's nullification claim, Jackson vowed to send troops to [[South Carolina]] to enforce the laws. In December 1832, he issued a resounding proclamation against the &quot;nullifiers,&quot; stating that he considered &quot;the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.&quot; South Carolina, the President declared, stood on &quot;the brink of insurrection and treason,&quot; and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: &quot;The Constitution... forms a ''government'' not a league... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Syrett, 36. See also: {{cite web |title=President Jackson's Proclamation Regarding Nullification, December&amp;nbsp;10, 1832 |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/proclamations/jack01.htm |accessdate=August 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson asked Congress to pass a &quot;[[Force Bill]]&quot; explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until [[protectionism|protectionists]] led by Clay agreed to a reduced Compromise Tariff. The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and Jackson signed both. The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance. The Force Bill became moot because it was no longer needed.

===Indian removal===
{{Main|Indian removal}}
[[File:Andrew Jackson Daguerrotype-crop.jpg|thumb|Jackson in 1845]]
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Jackson's presidency was his policy regarding [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]], which involved the [[ethnic cleansing]] of several Indian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, see Schama (2008) p. 325-326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an attack on Jackson see Cave (2003). 65(6): 1330–1353. For a defense see Remini (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson was a leading advocate of a policy known as Indian removal. Jackson had been negotiating treaties and removal policies with Indian leaders for years before his election as president. Many tribes and portions of tribes had been removed to Arkansas Territory and further west of the Mississippi River without the suffering of what later became known as the [[Trail of Tears]]. Further, many white Americans advocated total extermination of the &quot;savages,&quot; particularly those who had experienced frontier wars. Jackson's support of removal policies can be best understood by examination of those prior cases he had personally negotiated, rather than those in post-presidential years. Nevertheless, Jackson is often held responsible for all that took place in the 1830s.

In his December 8, 1829, First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson stated:

{{quote|This emigration should be voluntary, for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. In return for their obedience as individuals they will without doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those possessions which they have improved by their industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29471 |title=Andrew Jackson: First Annual Message |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before his election as president, Jackson had been involved with the issue of Indian removal for over ten years. The removal of the Native Americans to the west of the [[Mississippi River]] had been a major part of his political agenda in both the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;Remini,&quot;Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Freedom, 1822–1832&quot; pp. 117, 200&lt;/ref&gt; After his election he signed the [[Indian Removal Act]] into law in 1830. The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands further west, outside of existing U.S. state borders.

While frequently frowned upon in the North, and opposed by [[Jeremiah Evarts]] and [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]], the Removal Act was popular in the [[American South|South]], where population growth and the discovery of gold on [[Cherokee]] land had increased pressure on tribal lands. The state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] became involved in a contentious jurisdictional dispute with the Cherokees, culminating in the 1832 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision (''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''), which ruled that Georgia could not impose its laws upon Cherokee tribal lands. Jackson is often quoted (regarding the decision) as having said, &quot;[[John Marshall]] has made his decision, now let him enforce it!&quot; Whether he said it is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Cave (2003); Remini (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, Jackson used the Georgia crisis to pressure Cherokee leaders to sign a removal treaty. A small faction of Cherokees led by [[John Ridge]] negotiated the [[Treaty of New Echota]] with Jackson's representatives. Ridge was not a recognized leader of the Cherokee Nation, and this document was rejected by most Cherokees as illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicaldocuments.com/IndianRemovalAct.htm |title=Historical Documents - The Indian Removal Act of 1830 |publisher=Historicaldocuments.com |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 15,000 Cherokees signed a petition in protest of the proposed removal; the list was ignored by the Supreme Court and the U.S. legislature, in part due to delays and timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren, who ordered 7,000 armed troops to remove the Cherokees. Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered until troops arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synaptic.bc.ca/ejournal/jackson.htm |title=Indian Removal |publisher=Synaptic.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This abrupt and forced removal resulted in the deaths of over 4,000 Cherokees on the &quot;[[Trail of Tears]]&quot;.

[[File:A Jackson-restored.png|left|thumb|A [[daguerreotype]] of Jackson.]]
By the 1830s, under constant pressure from settlers, each of the five southern tribes had ceded most of its lands, but sizable self-government groups lived in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. All of these (except the Seminoles) had moved far in the coexistence with whites, and they resisted suggestions that they should voluntarily remove themselves. Their nonviolent methods earned them the title the [[Five Civilized Tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS: Judgement Day. “Indian removal.” [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html PBS.org] . Retrieved January 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration. A few Cherokees escaped forced relocation, or walked back afterwards, escaping to the high [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smoky Mountains]] along the [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherokee-nc.com/index.php?page=56 |title=Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians - History |publisher=Cherokee-nc.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson's administration bought about 100&amp;nbsp;million acres (400,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of Indian land for about $68&amp;nbsp;million and 32&amp;nbsp;million acres (130,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of western land. Jackson was criticized at the time for his role in these events, and the criticism has grown over the years. U.S. historian [[Robert Vincent Remini]] characterizes the Indian Removal era as &quot;one of the unhappiest chapters in American history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Remini (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attack and assassination attempt===
[[File:JacksonAssassinationAttempt.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]]'s attempt on Jackson's life, as depicted in an 1835 etching.]]

The first attempt to do bodily harm to a President was against Jackson. Jackson ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for [[embezzlement]]. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USS ''Cygnet'' to [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of [[Mary Ball Washington]], [[George Washington]]'s mother. During a stopover near [[Alexandria, Virginia]], Randolph appeared and struck the President. He then fled the scene with several members of Jackson's party chasing him, including the well known writer [[Washington Irving]]. Jackson decided not to press charges.&lt;ref name=Paletta/&gt;

On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the [[United States Capitol]]. When Jackson was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Warren R. Davis]], [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]], an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. It has been postulated that moisture from the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmericanHeritage.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Trying to Assassinate Andrew Jackson | author=Jon Grinspan | url=http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml| accessdate=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including [[Davy Crockett|David Crockett]], restrained and disarmed Lawrence.

Richard Lawrence gave the doctors several reasons for the shooting. He had recently lost his job painting houses and somehow blamed Jackson. He claimed that with the President dead, &quot;money would be more plenty&quot; (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he &quot;could not rise until the President fell.&quot; Finally, he informed his interrogators that he was a deposed English King—specifically, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], dead since 1485—and that Jackson was merely his clerk. He was deemed insane, institutionalized, and never punished for his assassination attempt.

Afterward, due to curiosity concerning the double misfires, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. When these results were known, many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same Providence that had protected the young nation. This national pride was a large part of the Jacksonian cultural myth fueling American expansion in the 1830s.

===Judicial appointments===

===Regrets===
On the last day of the presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets, that he &quot;had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Borneman, Walter R. ''Polk: The Man Who Transformed the Presidency and America''. New York: Random House, 2008 ISBN 978-1-4000-6560-8, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
[[File:Andrew Jackson-1844-2.jpg|thumb|[[Daguerreotype]] of Andrew Jackson at age 77 or 78 (1844 or 1845)]]

Shortly after Jackson first arrived in Nashville in 1788, he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockley Donelson, the widow of [[John Donelson]]. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter, [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel Donelson Robards]]. At the time, Rachel Robards was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards, a man subject to irrational{{Dubious|date=December 2009}} fits of jealous rage. Due to Lewis Robards' temperament, the two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. However, the divorce had never been completed, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson technically [[bigamy|bigamous]] and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Remini, 17–25&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Donelson had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.

The controversy surrounding their marriage remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor. Jackson fought 13 duels, many nominally over his wife's honor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Charles Dickinson (historical figure)|Charles Dickinson]], the only man Jackson ever killed in a duel, had been goaded into angering Jackson by Jackson's political opponents. In the duel, fought over a horse-racing debt and an insult to his wife on May 30, 1806, Dickinson shot Jackson in the ribs before Jackson returned the fatal shot; Jackson allowed Dickinson to shoot first, knowing him to be an excellent shot, and as his opponent reloaded, Jackson shot, even as the bullet lodged itself in his chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could never be safely removed. Jackson had been wounded so frequently in duels that it was said he &quot;rattled like a bag of marbles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Character : Profiles in Presidential Courage|last=Wallace|first=Chris|authorlink=Chris Wallace (journalist)|publisher=Rugged Land|location=New York, NY|year=2005|isbn=1-59071-054-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times he coughed up blood, and he experienced considerable pain from his wounds for the rest of his life.

Rachel died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, two weeks after her husband's victory in the election and two months before Jackson took office as President. Jackson blamed [[John Quincy Adams]] for Rachel's death because the marital scandal was brought up in the election of 1828. He felt that this had hastened her death and never forgave Adams.

Jackson had two adopted sons, Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and Lyncoya, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Creek War. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis in 1828, at the age of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;Remini 1:194&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Samuel Donelson, [[Daniel Smith Donelson]] and [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]] were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.

[[File:Andrew Jackson Tomb.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Andrew and [[Rachel Donelson Jackson]] located at their home, [[The Hermitage (Tennessee)|The Hermitage]].]]

The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece [[Emily Donelson]] to serve as host at the White House. Emily was married to [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]], who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 would run for Vice President on the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] ticket. The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the [[Petticoat affair]], and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House host. [[Sarah Yorke Jackson]], the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became cohost of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hosting duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836. Jackson used [[Rip Raps]] as a retreat, visiting between August 19, 1829 through August 16, 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, page 109; 315&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics after retiring to [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]] in 1837. Though a slave-holder, Jackson was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states, and declined to give any support to talk of secession.

Jackson was a lean figure standing at 6 feet, 1&amp;nbsp;inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140 pounds (64&amp;nbsp;kg) on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough, caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake. After retiring to Nashville, he enjoyed eight years of retirement and died at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]] on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic tuberculosis, [[dropsy]], and [[heart failure]].

In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various other friends and family members. About a year after retiring the presidency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Andrew Jackson |first=Sean |last= Wilentz |publisher=Macmillan |year= 2005 |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson became a member of the [[Downtown Presbyterian Church, Nashville|First Presbyterian Church]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

==Jackson on U.S. Postage==
Andrew Jackson is one of the few American presidents ever to appear on US Postage more than the usual two or three times. He died in 1845, but the U.S. Post Office did not release a [[US Presidents on US postage stamps|postage stamp]] in his honor until 18 years after his death, with the [[U.S. Presidents on U.S. Postage stamps#First appearances|issue of 1863]], a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the '[[Black Jack (stamp)|Black Jack]]'. In contrast, the first [[Warren Harding]] stamp was released only one month after his death, Lincoln, one year exactly. As Jackson was a controversial figure in his day there is speculation that officials in Washington chose to wait a period of time before issuing a stamp with his portrait. In all, Jackson has appeared on thirteen different US postage stamps, more than that of most US presidents and second only to the number of times Washington, Franklin and Lincoln have appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Scotts US Stamp Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;img=&amp;mode=1&amp;pg=1&amp;tid=2027716 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States|Confederate postage stamps]] bearing Jackson's portrait, one a [[:File:Red Jack-2c.jpg|2-cent red stamp]] and the other a [[:File:Csa jackson 1862-2c.jpg|2-cent green stamp]], both issued in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;mode=1&amp;tid=2027898 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;
Jackson also appears on other [[US Presidents on US postage stamps#Andrew Jackson|U.S. Postage]] stamps of the 19th and 20th centuries. In all, Jackson appears on twelve US Postage stamps to date.

'''Andrew Johnson''' (December 29, 1808{{ndash}} July 31, 1875) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|17th]] [[President of the United States]] (1865–1869). Following the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination]] of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], Johnson presided over the [[Reconstruction era of the United States]] in the four years after the [[American Civil War]]. His tenure was controversial as his positions hostile to the Freedmen came under heavy political attack from [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]].

When Tennessee seceded in 1861, Johnson was a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] in [[East Tennessee|East]] [[Tennessee]]. A Unionist, he was the only Southern senator not to resign. He became the most prominent [[War Democrat]] from the South and supported Lincoln's military policies during the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865. In 1862, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of occupied Tennessee, where he was energetic and effective in fighting the rebellion and beginning the transition to Reconstruction. 

Johnson was nominated as the [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential candidate]] in 1864 on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] ticket. He and Lincoln were [[United States presidential election, 1864|elected in November 1864]] and inaugurated on March 4, 1865. Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon Lincoln's assassination on April 15, 1865.

As president, he took charge of Presidential Reconstruction – the first phase of Reconstruction – which lasted until the [[Radical Republicans]] gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections. His conciliatory policies towards the South, his hurry to reincorporate the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states back into the union, and his vetoes of civil rights bills embroiled him in a bitter dispute with [[Radical Republicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Legal History |last=Hall |first=Kermit |coauthors=Paul Finkelman, James W. Ely |year=2005 |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-516225-0 |pages=259–260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Radicals in the House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeached him in 1868]], charging him with violating the law (specifically the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]]), but the Senate acquitted him by a single vote.

Johnson's party status was ambiguous during his presidency. As president, he did not identify with the two main parties – though he did try for the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination in 1868. While President he attempted to build a party of loyalists under the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] label. Asked in 1868 why he did not become a Democrat, he said, &quot;It is true I am asked why don't I join the Democratic Party. Why don't they join me ... if I have administered the office of president so well?&quot; His failure to make the National Union brand an actual party made Johnson effectively an independent during his presidency, though he was supported by Democrats and later rejoined the party as a Democratic Senator from Tennessee from 1875 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/anjo/forteachers/curriculummaterials.htm National Park Service Questionnaire ]&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually counted as a Democrat when identifying presidents by their political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, Hans Louis. ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' (1997), p. 338–339.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was the first U.S. President to undergo an [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] trial; the senate fell one vote short of removing him from office. He is commonly ranked by historians as being [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|among the worst U.S. presidents]].

==Early life==

[[File:Andrew Johnsons First Home 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Johnson's boyhood home in [[North Carolina]], located at the [[Mordecai House|Mordecai Historic Park]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].]]

Andrew Johnson was born in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], to [[Jacob Johnson (father of Andrew Johnson)|Jacob Johnson]] (1778–1812) and Mary McDonough (1783–1856). Jacob died when Andrew was around three years old, leaving his family in poverty. Johnson's mother then took in work spinning and weaving to support her family, and she later remarried. She bound Andrew as an apprentice tailor.  In the 1820s, he worked as a tailor in [[Laurens, South Carolina]].  Johnson had no formal education and taught himself how to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Hans L. Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' (W. W. Norton, 1989) p, 23. &lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16 or 17, Johnson left his apprenticeship and ran away with his brother to [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], where he found work as a tailor.  His master used legal procedures to force him to return but failed, and Johnson was on his own.&lt;ref&gt;Karin L Zipf. ''Labor Of Innocents: Forced Apprenticeship in North Carolina, 1715–1919'' (2005) pp 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 18, Johnson married 16 year-old [[Eliza McCardle Johnson|Eliza McCardle]] in 1827; she was the daughter of a local shoemaker. Between 1828 and 1852, the couple had five children: Martha (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852).  Eliza taught Johnson arithmetic up to basic algebra and tutored him to improve his literacy and writing skills.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' pp 27-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Johnson participated in debates at the local academy at Greeneville, Tennessee&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse1&quot;&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/aj17.html Biography of Andrew Johnson]&amp;nbsp;– www.whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; and later organized a worker's party that elected him as alderman in 1829. He served in this position until he was elected mayor in 1833.  In 1835, he was elected to the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] where, after serving a single term, he was defeated for re-election. 

Johnson was attracted to the [[states rights]] Democratic Party of [[Andrew Jackson]]. He became a spokesman for the numerous [[Plain Folk of the Old South|yeomen farmers]] and mountaineers against the wealthier, but fewer, planter elite families that had held political control in the state and nationally.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' ch 3 &lt;/ref&gt;  In 1839, Johnson was elected to a second, non-consecutive term in the Tennessee House, and was elected to the [[Tennessee Senate]] in 1841, where he served one two-year term.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongBio&quot;&gt;{{CongBio|J000116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, he became the first Democrat to win election as the U.S. representative from [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district]]. Among his activities for the common man's interests as a member of the House of Representatives and the Senate, Johnson advocated &quot;a free farm for the poor&quot; bill that would give land to farmers.  Johnson was a U.S. representative for five terms until 1853, when he was elected [[Governor of Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' ch 6 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ascendancy==
[[File:Younger Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] photo of Johnson.]]
Johnson was elected governor of Tennessee, serving from 1853 to 1857. He was then elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate, serving from October 8, 1857&amp;nbsp;– March 4, 1862. He was chairman of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense ([[36th United States Congress|Thirty-sixth Congress]]). As a U.S. senator, he continued to push for the [[Homestead Act]]. It finally passed in 1862, after the Civil War had begun and Southerners had resigned from Congress.

As the slavery question became more critical, Johnson continued to take a middle course. He opposed the antislavery [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] because he believed the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] guaranteed the right to own slaves. He supported President Buchanan's administration. He also approved the [[Lecompton Constitution]] proposed by proslavery settlers in Kansas. At the same time, he made it clear that his devotion to the Union exceeded his devotion to right to own slaves.

Johnson's stand in favor of both the Union and the right to own slaves might have made him a logical compromise candidate for president. However, he was not nominated in 1856 because of a split within the Tennessee delegation. In 1860, the Tennessee delegation nominated Johnson for president at the Democratic National Convention, but when the convention and the party broke up, he withdrew from the race. In the election, Johnson reluctantly supported Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky, the candidate of most Southern Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' p 126 &lt;/ref&gt;

Before Tennessee voted on secession, Johnson, based in Unionist East Tennessee, toured the state speaking in opposition to the act, which he said was unconstitutional. Johnson was an aggressive stump speaker and often responded to hecklers, even those in the Senate. When Tennessee [[seceded]], Johnson was the only Senator from the seceded states to continue participation in Congress. His explanation for this decision was, &quot;Damn the negroes, I am fighting those traitorous aristocrats, their masters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' p 65 &lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of occupied Tennessee in March 1862 with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].&lt;ref&gt; Tresouse, p 153&lt;/ref&gt; During his three years in this office, he &quot;moved resolutely to eradicate all pro-Confederate influences in the state.&quot; This &quot;unwavering commitment to the Union&quot; was a significant factor in his choice as vice president by Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;Sledge pg. 1071–1072&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson vigorously suppressed the Confederates, telling his subordinates: &quot;Whenever you hear a man prating about the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], spot him as a traitor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=SSJCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA430&amp;lpg=RA3-PA430&amp;dq=%22Whenever+you+hear+a+man+prating+about+the+constitution,+spot+him+as+a+traitor.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qaAT3IyIjL&amp;sig=BUycxkmzVIjpEmfNI5s_FxcjlvE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S_evS5jJO8H-8Abe5KSABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwBA ''A Review of the Political Conflict in America'', pg. 430]&lt;/ref&gt; He later spoke out for black suffrage, arguing, &quot;The better class of them will go to work and sustain themselves, and that class ought to be allowed to vote, on the ground that a loyal [[negro]] is more worthy than a disloyal white man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patton p 126&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy seized his slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' p 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice presidency==
[[File:Republican presidential ticket 1864b.jpg|thumb|[[Currier and Ives]] print of the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] presidential and vice presidential candidates, 1864. Lithograph and watercolor.]]
As a leading [[War Democrat]] and pro-Union southerner, Johnson was an ideal candidate for the Republicans in 1864 as they enlarged their base to include War Democrats. They changed the party name to the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] to reflect this expansion. During the election, Johnson replaced [[Hannibal Hamlin]] as Lincoln's running mate. He was elected [[vice president of the United States]] and was inaugurated March 4, 1865. At the ceremony, Johnson, who had been drinking to offset the pain of [[typhoid fever]] (as he claimed later), gave a rambling speech and appeared intoxicated to many. According to Senator [[Zachariah Chandler]], he &quot;disgraced himself and the Senate by making a drunken foolish speech.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/andrew_johnson.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1865, Johnson talked harshly of hanging traitors like [[Jefferson Davis]], which endeared him to radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln was [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|shot and mortally wounded]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer, while the president was attending a play at [[Ford's Theater]]. Booth's plan was to destroy the administration by ordering conspirators to assassinate Johnson, lieutenant general of the Union army Ulysses S. Grant, and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] that night. Grant survived when he failed to attend the theater with Lincoln as planned, Seward narrowly survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, [[George Atzerodt]], failed to go through with the plan.

==Presidency 1865–1869==
[[File:Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of Johnson]]
On April 15, 1865, following Lincoln's death that morning, Johnson was sworn in as President of the United States by the newly appointed [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]]. Johnson was the first vice president to succeed to the presidency upon the [[assassination]] of a president and the third vice president to become a president upon the death of a sitting president.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianpolitics.com/usa/president/presidents-list.shtml Complete list of U.S. presidents]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln, 1865. The caption reads (Johnson to the former rail-splitter): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever!!'' (Lincoln to the former tailor): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended!'']]
Northern anger over the assassination of Lincoln and the immense human cost of the war led to demands for harsh policies. Vice President Andrew Johnson had taken a hard line and had spoken of hanging rebel Confederates. In late April 1865, he was noted telling an [[Indiana]] delegation that, &quot;Treason must be made odious ... traitors must be punished and impoverished ... their social power must be destroyed.&quot; However, when he succeeded Lincoln as president, Johnson took a much softer line, commenting, &quot;I say, as to the leaders, punishment. I also say leniency, reconciliation and amnesty to the thousands whom they have misled and deceived,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Milton 183&lt;/ref&gt; and ended up pardoning many Confederate leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, Hans L. Andrew Johnson: A Biography (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

His class-based resentment of the rich appeared in a May 1865 statement to W.H. Holden, the man he appointed governor of North Carolina: &quot;I intend to confiscate the lands of these rich men whom I have excluded from pardon by my proclamation, and divide the proceeds thereof among the families of the wool hat boys, the Confederate soldiers, whom these men forced into battle to protect their property in slaves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/holden/holden.html &quot;Memoirs of W.W. Holden: Electronic Edition&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Johnson was seemingly not harsh toward the Confederate leaders. He allowed the Southern states to hold elections in 1865. Subsequently, prominent former Confederate leaders were elected to the U.S. Congress, which, however, refused to seat them. Congress and Johnson argued in an increasingly public way about [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the way the Southern secessionist states would be readmitted to the Union. Johnson favored a quick restoration, similar to the plan of leniency that Lincoln advocated before his death.

===Break with the Republicans: 1866===
Johnson-appointed governments all passed [[Black Codes in the USA|Black Codes]] that gave the [[freedmen]] second class status. In response to the Black Codes and worrisome signs of Southern recalcitrance, the Republicans prevented the secessionist states from receiving representation in Congress in fall 1865. Congress also renewed the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedman's Bureau]], but Johnson vetoed it. Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois, leader of the moderate Republicans, took affront at the Black Codes. Trumbull proposed the first Civil Rights bill.

Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the Civil Rights bill, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. His veto message objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when eleven out of thirty-six states were unrepresented and attempted to fix, by federal law, &quot;a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union.&quot; Johnson said it was an invasion by federal authority of the rights of the states; it had no warrant in the Constitution and was contrary to all precedents. It was a &quot;stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, ''History'' 6:68&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, in a letter to Gov. Thomas C. Fletcher of Missouri, wrote, &quot;This is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse pg. 236. Online reference to the quote available at http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant/peopleevents/e_impeach.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic Party, proclaiming itself the party of white men, North and South, aligned with Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto and the Civil Rights measure became law.

The last moderate proposal was the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], also written by Trumbull. It was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but it went further. It extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It guaranteed the federal war debt and voided all Confederate war debts. Johnson unsuccessfully sought to block ratification of the amendment.

The moderates' effort to compromise with Johnson had failed and an all-out political war broke out between the Republicans (both radical and moderate) on one side, and on the other Johnson and his allies in the Democratic party in the North, and the conservative groupings in the South. The decisive battle was the [[United States House election, 1866|election of 1866]], in which the Southern states were not allowed to vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour of the north that was known as the &quot;[[Swing Around the Circle]]&quot;; the tour proved politically disastrous, with Johnson widely ridiculed and occasionally engaging in hostile arguments with his audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usa-presidents.info/speeches/cleveland-speech.html Andrew Johnson Cleveland Speech (September 3, 1866)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Republicans won by a landslide and took full control of Reconstruction.

Historian [[James Ford Rhodes]] explained Johnson's inability to engage in serious negotiations:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;But,&quot; as Sumner shrewdly said, &quot;the President himself is his own worst counsellor, as he is his own worst defender.&quot;  Johnson acted in accordance with his nature. He had intellectual force but it worked in a groove. Obstinate rather than firm it undoubtedly seemed to him that following counsel and making concessions were a display of weakness. At all events from his December message to the veto of the Civil Rights Bill he yielded not a jot to Congress. The moderate senators and representatives (who constituted a majority of the Union party) asked him for only a slight compromise; their action was really an entreaty that he would unite with them to preserve Congress and the country from the policy of the radicals. The two projects which Johnson had most at heart were the speedy admission of the Southern senators and representatives to Congress and the relegation of the question of negro suffrage to the States themselves. Himself shrinking from the imposition on these communities of the franchise for the coloured people, his unyielding disposition in regard to matters involving no vital principle did much to bring it about. His quarrel with Congress prevented the readmission into the Union on generous terms of the members of the late Confederacy....He sacrificed two important objects to petty considerations. His pride of opinion, his desire to beat, blinded him to the real welfare of the South and of the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of the United States from the compromise of 1850 to the final restoration of home rule at the South in 1877 |last=Rhodes |first=James Ford |authorlink=[[James Ford Rhodes]] |year=1904 |publisher= Macmillan Co.|page=589 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IHFAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA589&amp;dq=%22the+President+himself+is+his+own+worst+counsellor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HRSyTdqxKqjZ0QHdg8G2CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20President%20himself%20is%20his%20own%20worst%20counsellor%22&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Impeachment===
====First attempt====
[[File:Andew Johnson impeachment trial.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore R. Davis]]' illustration of Johnson's impeachment trial in the [[United States Senate]], published in ''Harper's Weekly''.]]
There were two attempts to remove President Andrew Johnson from office. The first occurred in the fall of 1867. On November 21, 1867, the House Judiciary committee produced a bill of impeachment that consisted of a vast collection of complaints against him. After a furious debate, a formal vote was held in the House of Representatives on December 5, 1867, which failed 57–108.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, 1989 pages 302–3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second attempt====
{{Main|Impeachment of Andrew Johnson}}
[[File:AJohnsonimpeach.jpg|thumb|The 1868 Impeachment Resolution]]
Johnson notified Congress that he had removed [[Edwin Stanton]] as Secretary of War and was replacing him in the interim with Adjutant-General [[Lorenzo Thomas]]. Johnson had originally wanted to replace Stanton with General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], but Grant refused to accept the position. This violated the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], a law enacted by Congress in March 1867 over Johnson's veto, specifically designed to protect Stanton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9071723/Tenure-of-Office-Act Tenure of office act&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson had vetoed the act, claiming it was unconstitutional. The act said, &quot;...every person holding any civil office, to which he has been appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate ... shall be entitled to hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly qualified,&quot; thus removing the president's previous unlimited power to remove any of his cabinet members at will. Years later in the case ''[[Myers v. United States]]'' in 1926, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that such laws were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9380467/Tenure-of-Office-Act Tenure of office act&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Concise]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate and House debated the act. Thomas attempted to move into the war office, for which Stanton had Thomas arrested. Three days after Stanton's removal, the House [[impeachment|impeached]] Johnson for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act.

On March 5, 1868, a court of impeachment to hear charges against the president was constituted in the Senate. [[William M. Evarts]] served as his counsel. Eleven articles were set out in the resolution, and the trial before the Senate lasted almost three months. Johnson's defense was based on a clause in the Tenure of Office Act stating that the then-current secretaries would hold their posts throughout the term of the president who appointed them. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, it was claimed, the applicability of the act had already run its course.
[[File:The situation.jpg|thumb|''The Situation''&lt;br /&gt;A ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' cartoon gives a humorous breakdown of &quot;the situation&quot;. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]] aims a cannon labeled &quot;Congress&quot; on the side at [[President of the United States|President]] Johnson and [[Lorenzo Thomas]] to show how Stanton was using congress to defeat the president and his unsuccessful replacement. He also holds a rammer marked &quot;Tenure of Office Bill&quot; and cannon balls on the floor are marked &quot;Justice&quot;. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and an unidentified man stand to Stanton's left.]]

There were three votes in the Senate. One came on May 16 for the 11th article of impeachment, which included many of the charges contained in the other articles, and two on May 26 for the second and third articles, after which the trial adjourned. On all three occasions, 35 senators voted &quot;guilty&quot; and 19 &quot;not guilty&quot;, thus falling short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction in impeachment trials by a single vote. A decisive role was played by seven Republican senators - [[William Pitt Fessenden]], [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]] and [[Edmund G. Ross]] of Kansas, who provided the decisive vote;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm &quot;The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence, they voted against conviction, in defiance of their party and public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html &quot;Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; President John F. Kennedy discusses this in further detail in his book, ''Profiles In Courage.''

===Christmas Day amnesty for Confederates===
One of Johnson's last significant acts was granting unconditional [[amnesty]] to all Confederates on Christmas Day, December 25, 1868, after the election of Ulysses S. Grant to succeed him, but before Grant took office in March 1869. Earlier amnesties, requiring signed oaths and excluding certain classes of people, had been issued by Lincoln and by Johnson.

====Judicial appointments====
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by Andrew Johnson}}
Johnson appointed only nine Article III federal judges during his presidency, all to [[United States district court]]s. Andrew Johnson is one of only four presidents&lt;ref&gt;The other three presidents are [[William Henry Harrison]], [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;/ref&gt; who did not appoint a judge to serve on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In April 1866 he nominated [[Henry Stanbery]] to fill the vacancy left with the death of [[John Catron]], but the Republican Congress eliminated the seat. Johnson also appointed one judge to the [[United States Court of Claims]], [[Samuel Milligan]], who served from 1868 to 1874.

===States admitted to the Union===
* [[Nebraska]] – March 1, 1867

===Foreign policy===
Johnson forced the [[France|French]] out of [[Mexico]] by sending an army to the border and issuing an ultimatum. The French withdrew in 1867, and the government they supported quickly collapsed. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from Russia on April 9, 1867 for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million. This is equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|7200000|1867}}}} in present day terms.{{inflation-fn|US}} Critics sneered at &quot;[[Seward's Folly]]&quot; and &quot;Seward's Icebox&quot; and &quot;Icebergia.&quot; Seward also negotiated to purchase the [[Danish West Indies]], but the Senate refused to approve the purchase in 1867 (it eventually happened in 1917). The Senate likewise rejected Seward's arrangement with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to arbitrate the [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]].

The U.S. experienced tense relations with Britain and its colonial government in [[Canada]] in the aftermath of the war. Lingering resentment over the perception of British sympathy toward the Confederacy resulted in Johnson initially turning a blind eye towards a series of armed incursions by Fenians ([[Irish-American]] civil war veterans) into Canada. These small-scale [[Fenian Raids]] were easily repulsed by the British. Eventually, Johnson ordered the Fenians disarmed and barred from crossing the border, but the Canadians feared an American takeover and moved toward [[Canadian Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt; Hereward Senior, ''The last invasion of Canada: the Fenian raids, 1866-1870'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Johnson's [[purchase of Alaska]] from the [[Russian Empire]] in 1867 was his most important foreign policy action. The idea and implementation is credited to Seward as Secretary of State, but Johnson approved the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Furs and fish were important but gold was not discovered in Alaska until 1880, 13 years after the purchase and oil was not discovered until 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidency==
[[File:Andrew Johnson House Greeneville year1886 153142pu.png|thumb|The Johnson home in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], 1886, today restored and known as the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]].]]
Johnson was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States Senate from Tennessee in 1868 and to the House of Representatives in 1872. However, in 1874 the Tennessee legislature did elect him to the U.S. Senate. Johnson served from March 4, 1875, until his death from a stroke near [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]], on July 31 that year. In his first speech since returning to the Senate, which was also his last, Johnson spoke about political turmoil in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot;&gt;[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Death_of_Andrew_Johnson.htm United States Senate: Death of Andrew Johnson]&lt;/ref&gt; His passion aroused a standing ovation from many of his fellow senators who had once voted to remove him from the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american-presidents.com/andrew-johnson Andrew Johnson]. American-Presidents.com. Accessed November 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the only former president to serve in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot;/&gt;

Johnson was buried just outside [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes. The burial ground was dedicated as the [[Andrew Johnson National Cemetery]] in 1906, now part of the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]].

==Historians' changing views on Andrew Johnson==

Views on Johnson changed over time, depending on historians' perception of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The widespread denunciation of Reconstruction after the [[compromise of 1877]] resulted in Johnson being portrayed in a favorable light. By the 1930s a series of favorable biographies enhanced his prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Highly favorable were Winston (1928), Stryker (1929), Milton (1930), and Claude Bowers, ''The Tragic Era'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a Beardian School (named after [[Charles Beard]] and typified by [[Howard K. Beale]]) argued that the Republican Party in the 1860s was a tool of corrupt business interests, and that Johnson stood for the people. They rated Johnson &quot;near great&quot;, but have since reevaluated and now consider Johnson &quot;a flat failure&quot;.&lt;ref name=WpostWorst/&gt; 

The [[Civil Rights movement]] of the 1960s brought a new perspective on Reconstruction, which was increasingly seen as a noble effort to build an [[Racial integration|interracial]] nation.&lt;ref name=WpostWorst/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Beginning with [[W.E.B. Du Bois]]' ''[[Black Reconstruction]]'', first published in 1935, historians noted [[African American]] efforts to establish public education and welfare institutions, gave muted praise for Republican efforts to extend suffrage and provide other social institutions, and excoriated Johnson for siding with the opposition to extending basic rights to former slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;WpostWorst&quot;/&gt; In this vein, [[Eric Foner]] denounced Johnson as a &quot;fervent [[white supremacist]]&quot; who foiled Reconstruction,&lt;ref name=WpostWorst&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101509.html | accessdate = December 15, 2008 | work=The Washington Post | title=He's The Worst Ever | first=Eric | last=Foner | date=December 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Sean Wilentz]] wrote that Johnson &quot;actively sided with former Confederates&quot; in his attempts to derail it.&lt;ref name=Wilentz&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9961300/the_worst_president_in_history/print The Worst President in History?], [[Sean Wilentz]], ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', April 21, 2006; accessed December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Johnson is today among those commonly mentioned among the worst presidents in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=US&gt;[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070216/16president.johnson.htm The 10 Worst Presidents: No. 3 Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)], [[Jay Tolson]], ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]], February 16, 2007; accessed December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Glenn W. LaFantasie, Professor of Civil War History at [[Western Kentucky University]], &quot;Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment (although he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote in May 1868), his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy, his inept dealings with his Cabinet and Congress, his drinking problem (he was probably inebriated at his inauguration), his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance. He once suggested that God saw fit to have Lincoln assassinated so that he could become president. A Northern senator averred that &quot;Andrew Johnson was the queerest character that ever occupied the White House.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Lafantasie, Glenn (February 21, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/books/history/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/02/21/worst_president_buchanan Who's the worst president of them all?], ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Through his often-suppressed writings, he helped to raise global awareness of the [[Gulag]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s forced labor camp system&amp;nbsp;– particularly in ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' and ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'', two of his best-known works. Solzhenitsyn was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1970. He was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974, but returned to Russia in 1994 after the Soviet system had collapsed. Solzhenitsyn was the father of [[Ignat Solzhenitsyn]], a conductor and pianist.

==In the Soviet Union==
===Early years===
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was born in [[Kislovodsk]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] (now in [[Stavropol Krai]], Russia). His mother, Taisiya Solzhenitsyna (''née'' Shcherbak) was [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/12049583.html |title=Александр Солженицын: человек и архипелаг &amp;#124; СЕГОДНЯ &amp;#124; Мир Кризис Світ |publisher=Segodnya.ua |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father had apparently risen from humble beginnings, as something of a self-made man. Eventually, he acquired a large estate in the [[Kuban]] region in the northern foothills of the [[Caucasus]]. During World War I, Taisiya went to Moscow to study. While there she met and married Isaakiy Solzhenitsyn, a young officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] of [[Cossack]] origins and fellow native of the Caucasus region. The family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of ''August 1914'', and in the later ''[[The Red Wheel|Red Wheel]]'' novels.

In 1918, Taisia became pregnant with Aleksandr. Shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident. Aleksandr was then raised by his widowed mother and aunt in lowly circumstances.  His earliest years coincided with the [[Russian Civil War]]. By 1930 the family property had been turned into a [[kolkhoz|collective farm]].  Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret. His educated mother (who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] faith;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, Patrick M. ''Great world writers: twentieth century'', p.1400. Marshall Cavendish, 2004, ISBN 0-7614-7478-1. Scammell, Michael, ''Solzhenitsyn, a biography'', p. 25-59. W. W.

As early as 1936, Solzhenitsyn was developing the characters and concepts for a planned epic work on the First World War and the Russian Revolution. This eventually led to the novel ''August 1914'' – some of the chapters he wrote then still survive.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at [[Rostov State University]]. At the same time he took correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History, at this time heavily ideological in scope. As he himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union until he spent time in the camps. 

On 7 April 1940, while at the university, Solzhenitsyn married a chemistry student Natalia Alekseevna Reshetovskaya.&lt;ref&gt;Terras, Victor. ''Handbook of Russian Literature'', p.436.

The following year (1973) he married his second wife, Natalia Dmitrievna Svetlova, a mathematician who had a son from a brief prior marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Bernard A.

===WWII===
During World War II Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a [[sound-ranging]] battery in the [[Red Army]],&lt;ref&gt;Scammell, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; was involved in major action at the front, and twice decorated. A series of writings published late in his life, including the early uncompleted novel ''Love the Revolution!'', chronicle his World War II experience and his growing doubts about the moral foundations of the Soviet regime.&lt;ref&gt;''Solzhenitsyn, Proterevshi glaza: sbornik'' (Moscow: Nash dom: L'Age d'Homme, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
[[File:Solzhenitsyn Gulag Photo.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Gulag photo of Solzhenitsyn.]]
In February 1945, while serving in [[East Prussia]], Solzhenitsyn was arrested for writing derogatory comments in letters to friends about the conduct of the war by [[Joseph Stalin]], whom he called [[Khozyain]]&quot; (&quot;the master&quot;), and &quot;Balabos&quot;, ([[Yiddish dialects|Yiddish]] rendering of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''baal ha-bayis'' for &quot;master of the house&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Moody 1973, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of anti-Soviet propaganda under [[Article 58]] paragraph 10 of the Soviet criminal code, and of &quot;founding a hostile organization&quot; under paragraph 11.&lt;ref&gt;Scammell 1986, p. 152-154. Björkegren 1973, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Solzhenitsyn was taken to the [[Lubyanka]] prison in Moscow, where he was beaten and interrogated. On 7 July 1945, he was sentenced in his absence by [[Special Council of the NKVD]] to an eight-year term in a [[labor camp]]. This was the normal sentence for most crimes under Article 58 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of Solzhenitsyn's sentence was served in several different work camps; the &quot;middle phase,&quot; as he later referred to it, was spent in a ''[[sharashka]]'' (i.e., a special scientific research facility run by Ministry of State Security), where he met [[Lev Kopelev]], upon whom he based the character of ''Lev Rubin'' in his book ''[[The First Circle]]'', published in a self-censored or &quot;distorted&quot; version in the West in 1968 (an English translation of the full version was eventually published by Harper Perennial in October 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solzhenitsyn |first=Aleksandr I. |url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061479014/In_the_First_Circle/index.aspx |title=retrieved Jan&amp;nbsp;06, 2010 |publisher=Harpercollins.com |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he was sent to a &quot;Special Camp&quot; for political prisoners. During his imprisonment at the camp in the town of [[Ekibastuz]] in Kazakhstan, he worked as a miner, bricklayer, and foundry foreman. His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the book ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''. One of his fellow political prisoners, [[Ion Moraru]], remembers that Solzhenitsyn spent some of his time at Ekibastuz writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanism.net/tag/sabia-dreptatii Organizatia anti-sovietica “Sabia Dreptatii”]&lt;/ref&gt; While there he had a tumor removed, although his cancer was not diagnosed at the time.

In March 1953 after the expiry of Solzhenitsyn's sentence, he was sent to internal exile for life at Kok-Terek in southern Kazakhstan, as was common for political prisoners. His undiagnosed cancer spread until, by the end of the year, he was close to death. However, in 1954, he was permitted to be treated in a hospital in [[Tashkent]], where his tumor went into remission. His experiences there became the basis of his novel ''[[Cancer Ward]]'' and also found an echo in the short story &quot;The right hand.&quot; It was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that Solzhenitsyn abandoned [[Marxism]] and developed the philosophical and religious positions of his later life; this turn has some interesting parallels to [[Dostoevsky]]'s time in Siberia and his quest for faith a hundred years earlier. Solzhenitsyn gradually turned into a philosophically-minded Christian as a result of his experience in prison and the camps.&lt;ref&gt;''GA'', part IV, Daniel J. Mahoney, &quot;Hero of a Dark Century&quot;, ''National Review'', 1 September 2008, pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Beliefs&quot; in Ericson-Klimoff, ''The Soul and Barbed Wire: An Introduction to Solzhenitsyn'', ISI Books, 2008,pp. 177–205).&lt;/ref&gt; He repented for some of his actions as a Red Army captain, and in prison compared himself to the perpetrators of the Gulag: &quot;I remember myself in my captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'&quot; His transformation is described at some length in the fourth part of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' (&quot;The Soul and Barbed Wire&quot;). The narrative poem ''The Trail'' (written without benefit of pen or paper in prison and camps between 1947 and 1952) and the 28 poems composed in prison, forced-labor camp, and exile also provide crucial material for understanding Solzhenitsyn's intellectual and spiritual odyssey during this period. These &quot;early&quot; works, largely unknown in the West, were published for the first time in Russian in 1999 and excerpted in English in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitsyn, ''Proterevshi glaza: sbornik'', Moscow: Nash dom—L'age d'Homme, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Ericson, Jr.- Daniel J. Mahoney eds., ''The Solzhenitsyn Reader:New and Essential Writings, 1947–2005'', ISI Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After liberation===
After [[Khrushchev's Secret Speech]] in 1956 Solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and exonerated. After his return to European Russia, Solzhenitsyn was, while teaching at a secondary school during the day, spending his nights secretly engaged in writing. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech he wrote, &quot;during all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared this would become known.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1970/index.html |title=Nobel Prize in Literature |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s while he was publicly known to be writing ''Cancer Ward'', he was simultaneously writing ''The Gulag Archipelago''. The KGB found out about this.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Finally, when he was 42 years old, he approached [[Alexander Tvardovsky]], a poet and the chief editor of the ''Noviy Mir'' magazine, with the manuscript of ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich''. It was published in edited form in 1962, with the explicit approval of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who defended it at the presidium of the Politburo hearing on whether to allow its publishing, and added: &quot;There's a Stalinist in each of you; there's even a Stalinist in me. We must root out this evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Benno, &quot;The Political Aspect&quot;, in Max Hayward and Edward L. Crowley, eds., ''Soviet Literature in the Sixties'' (London, 1965), 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The book became an instant hit and sold-out everywhere. During Khrushchev's tenure, ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' was studied in schools in the Soviet Union as were three more short works of Solzhenitsyn's, including his acclaimed short story ''Matryona's Home'', were published in 1963. These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990.

''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' brought the Soviet system of prison labor to the attention of the West. It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West—not only by its striking realism and candour, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the twenties on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for &quot;libelous speech&quot; about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came quietly, but perceptibly, to a close.

Solzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt, with the help of Tvardovsky, to get his novel, ''The Cancer Ward'', legally published in the Soviet Union. This had to get the approval of the [[Union of Writers]]. Though some there appreciated it, the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations (this episode is recounted and documented in ''[[The Oak and the Calf]]'').

The publishing of his work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a [[non-person]], and, by 1965, the [[KGB]] had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of ''The First Circle''. Meanwhile Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most subversive of all his writings, the monumental ''The Gulag Archipelago''. The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an &quot;officially acclaimed&quot; writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant.

After the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965–1967 the preparatory drafts of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends' homes in Estonia. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended [[Arnold Susi]], a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a [[Lubyanka]] Prison cell. After completion, Solzhenitsyn's original handwritten script was kept hidden from the KGB in Estonia by Arnold Susi's daughter Heli Susi until the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Art of the Baltics: The Struggle for Freedom of Artistic Expression Under the Soviets, 1945–1991|last=Rosenfeld|first=Alla|authorlink=|coauthors=Norton T.

In 1969 Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Union of Writers. In 1970, Solzhenitsyn was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He could not receive the prize personally in [[Stockholm]] at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow. The Swedish government refused to accept this solution, however, since such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Sweden's relations with the superpower. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been deported from the Soviet Union.

''The Gulag Archipelago'' was composed during 1958–1967. This work was a three-volume, seven part work on the Soviet prison camp system (Solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at any one time). ''The Gulag Archipelago'' has sold over thirty million copies in thirty-five languages. It was based upon Solzhenitsyn's own experience as well as the testimony of 256&lt;ref&gt;''GA'', Ekaterinburg: U-Faktoriia&lt;/ref&gt; former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn's own research into the history of the penal system. It discussed the system's origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with [[Lenin]] himself having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, [[Kengir uprising|prisoner uprisings and revolts]], and the practice of [[internal exile]]. ''The Gulag Archipelago'''s rich and varied authorial voice, its unique weaving together of personal testimony, philosophical analysis, and historical investigation, and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made ''The Gulag Archipelago'' one of the most consequential books of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Applebaum's 2007 &quot;Foreword&quot; to Harper Perennial Modern Classics editions of ''GA''&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of the book in the West put the word [[gulag]] into the Western political vocabulary and guaranteed swift retribution from the Soviet authorities.

During this period, he was sheltered by the [[cellist]] [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], who suffered considerably for his support of Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself.

==In the West==
{{ref improve section|date=February 2011}}
On 12 February 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested and on the next day he was deported from the Soviet Union to [[Frankfurt]], West Germany and stripped of his Soviet citizenship. The KGB had found the manuscript for the first part of ''The Gulag Archipelago'' and, less than a week later, [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] suffered reprisals for his support of Solzhenitsyn.

U.S. military attache [[William Odom]] managed to smuggle out a large portion of Solzhenitsyn's archive, including the author's membership card for the [[Writers' Union]] and Second World War military citations; Solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to Odom's role in his memoir &quot;Invisible Allies&quot; (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Robert Patterson |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/weodom.htm |title=William Eldridge Odom, Lieutenant General, United States Army |publisher=Arlingtoncemetery.net |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Solzhenitsyn lived in [[Heinrich Böll]]'s house in [[Cologne]]. He then moved to [[Zurich]], Switzerland before [[Stanford University]] invited him to stay in the United States to &quot;facilitate your work, and to accommodate you and your family.&quot; He stayed on the 11th floor of the [[Hoover Tower]], part of the [[Hoover Institution]], before moving to [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]], Vermont in 1976. He was given an honorary Literary Degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1978 and on Thursday, 8 June 1978 he gave his [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/solzhenitsyn/harvard1978.html Commencement Address] condemning, among other things, materialism in modern western culture.

Over the next 17 years, Solzhenitsyn worked on his cyclical history of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], ''[[The Red Wheel]]''. By 1992, four &quot;knots&quot; (parts) had been completed and he had also written several shorter works.

Despite spending two decades in the United States, Solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken English. He had, however, been reading English-language literature since his teens, encouraged by his mother{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. More importantly, he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television. Solzhenitsyn's warnings about the dangers of Communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally well received in Western conservative circles (for example, before being denied the opportunity by then-president [[Gerald Ford]], Ford administration staffers [[Richard Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] advocated on Solzhenitsyn's behalf to speak directly to the president about the Soviet threat&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rise of The Vulcans&quot; p. 64-66&lt;/ref&gt;), alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]]. At the same time, [[liberalism|liberals]] and [[secularism|secularists]] became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his [[reactionary]] preference for [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] religion. Solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant [[pop culture]] of the modern West, including television and much of popular music: &quot;...the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits&amp;nbsp;... by TV stupor and by intolerable music.&quot;

Despite his criticism of the &quot;weakness&quot; of the West, Solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of western democratic societies. In a major speech delivered to the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein on 14 September 1993, Solzhenitsyn implored the West not to &quot;lose sight of its own values, its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law—a hard-won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader'', p.  599&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of writings, speeches, and interviews after his return to his native Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self-government he had witnessed first hand in Switzerland and New England during his western exile.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Russia in Collapse&quot; in ''The Solzhenitsyn Reader'', pp. 480–481&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Cavendish Farewell&quot; in ''The Soltzhenitsyn Reader'', pp. 606–607&lt;/ref&gt; He &quot;praised 'the sensible and sure process of [[grassroots democracy]], in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own, not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]] (2005-12-19) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/19/00016/ Free Vermont], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Russia==
In 1990, his Soviet citizenship was restored, and, in 1994, he returned to Russia with his wife, Natalia, who had become a United States citizen. Their sons stayed behind in the United States (later, his oldest son Yermolai returned to Russia to work for the Moscow office of a leading management consultancy firm). From then until his death, he lived with his wife in a [[dacha]] in Troitse-Lykovo (Троице-Лыково) in west [[Moscow]] between the dachas once occupied by Soviet leaders [[Mikhail Suslov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]].

A staunch believer in traditional Russian culture, Solzhenitsyn expressed his disillusionment with post-Soviet Russia and called for a restoration of the [[Line of succession to the Russian throne|Russian monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgewaysbooks.com/columns/022Solzhenitsyn.pdf |title=The End of Art – Speech |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn published eight two-part short stories, a series of contemplative &quot;miniatures&quot; or prose poems, a literary memoir on his years in the West (''The Grain Between the Millstones'') among many other writings.

All of Solzhenitsyn's sons became U.S. citizens. One, [[Ignat Solzhenitsyn|Ignat]], has achieved acclaim as a [[pianist]] and [[conductor (music)|conductor]] in the United States.

==Death==
Solzhenitsyn died of heart failure near Moscow on 3 August 2008, at the age of 89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Is Dead at 89  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/arts/AP-Obit-Solzhenistyn.html?hp |quote=Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize-winning author whose books chronicled the horrors of the Soviet gulag system, has died of heart failure, his son said Monday.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Vladimir Putin with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn-1.jpg|thumb|right|Solzhenitsyn with [[Vladimir Putin]].]]
The most complete 30-volume edition of Solzhenitsyn's collected works is soon to be published in Russia. The presentation of its first three volumes, already in print, recently took place in Moscow. Unhappy with the economic and social malaise of the [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin era]], Solzhenitsyn expressed his admiration for President [[Vladimir Putin]]'s attempts to restore a sense of national pride in Russia. Putin signed a decree conferring on Solzhenitsyn the [[State Prize of the Russian Federation]] for his humanitarian work and personally visited the writer at his home on June 12, 2007 to present him with the award. Like his father, Yermolai Solzhenitsyn has translated some of his father's works. Stephan Solzhenitsyn lives and works in Moscow. [[Ignat Solzhenitsyn]] is the music director of [[The Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia]].

==KGB operations against Solzhenitsyn==
On 19 September 1974, [[Yuri Andropov]] approved a large-scale operation to discredit Solzhenitsyn and his family and cut his communications with [[Soviet dissidents]]. The plan was jointly approved by [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], [[Philipp Bobkov]], and Grigorenko (heads of First, Second and Fifth KGB Directorates).&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] (2000). The [[Mitrokhin Archive]]: The KGB in Europe and the West. Gardners Books. ISBN 0-14-028487-7, pages 416–419.&lt;/ref&gt; The residencies in Geneva, London, Paris, Rome and other European cities participated in the operation. Among other active measures, at least three [[StB]] agents became translators and secretaries of Solzhenitsyn (one of them translated the poem [[Prussian Nights]]), keeping KGB informed regarding all contacts by Solzhenitsyn.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;

KGB sponsored a series of hostile books about Solzhenitsyn, most notably a &quot;memoir published under the name of his first wife, Natalia Reshetovskaya, but probably mostly composed by Service&quot;, according to historian [[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]].&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt; Andropov also gave an order to create &quot;an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between PAUK &lt;ref&gt;KGB gave Solzhenitsyn a code name &quot;PAUK&quot;, which means &quot;a spider&quot; in translation&lt;/ref&gt; and the people around him&quot; by feeding him rumors that everyone in his surrounding was a KGB agent and deceiving him in all possible ways. Among other things, the writer constantly received envelopes with photographs of car accidents, brain surgery and other frightening illustrations. After the KGB harassment in Zurich, Solzhenitsyn settled in [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]], Vermont, reduced communications with others and surrounded his property with a [[barbed wire]] fence. His influence and moral authority for the West diminished as he became increasingly isolated and critical of Western individualism. KGB and [[CPSU]] experts finally concluded that he alienated American listeners by his &quot;reactionary views and intransigent criticism  of the US way of life&quot;, so no further [[active measures]] would be required.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;

==Accusations of collaboration with NKVD==
In his book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' Solzhenitsyn states that he was recruited to report to the NKVD on fellow inmates and was given a code-name Vetrov, but due to his transfer to another camp he was able to elude this duty and never produced a single report.&lt;ref name=Potemschiki&gt;Solzhenitsyn, Alexander (22 October 2003). &quot;[http://www.kp.ru/daily/23142/24172/ Потёмщики света не ищут]&quot; (in Russian). ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]''. Retrieved 17 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, after Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the [[Soviet Union]] a report signed by Vetrov surfaced. After a copy of the report was obtained by Solzhenitsyn he published it together with a refutation in the [[Los Angeles Times]] (published 24 May 1976&lt;ref name=Potemschiki/&gt;). In 1978 the same report was published by journalist [[Frank Arnau]] in a socialist [[Western Germany|Western German]] magazine [[Neue Politik]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Arnau &quot;Solzhenitzyn&amp;nbsp;— Vetrov&quot; in &quot;Neue Politik&quot; (№2, 1978. Hamburg)&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Solzhenitsyn the report is a fabrication by the [[KGB]]. He claimed that the report is dated 20 January 1952 while all Ukrainians were transferred to a separate camp on 6 January and they had no relation to the uprising in Solzhenitsyn's camp on 22 January. He also claimed that the only people who might in 1976 have access to a &quot;secret KGB archive&quot; were KGB agents themselves. Solzhenitsyn also requested Arnau to put the alleged document to a [[graphology]] test but Arnau refused.&lt;ref name=Potemschiki/&gt;

In 1990 the report was reproduced in Soviet ''Voyenno-Istoricheskiy Zhurnal'' among the memoirs of L.A. Samutin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aha.ru/~vladkov/samutin-1.html |title=Ме Янрбнпх Йслхпю |language={{ru icon}} |publisher=Aha.ru |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former [[ROA]] soldier and GULAG inmate who was an erstwhile supporter of Solzhenitsyn, but later became his critic. According to Solzhenitzyn, publication of the Samutin memoirs was canceled at the request of Samutin's widow, who stated that the memoirs were in fact dictated by the KGB.&lt;ref name=Potemschiki/&gt;

==Views on atheism, history, and politics==
About the putative failing of atheism, Solzhenitsyn declared:

{{bquote|Over a half century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of old people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: &quot;Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.&quot; Since then I have spent well-nigh 50 years working on the history of our revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: &quot;Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Ericson, Jr., &quot;Solzhenitsyn – Voice from the Gulag,&quot; Eternity, October 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;23, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During his years in the west, Solzhenitsyn was very active in the historical debate, discussing the history of Russia, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[communism]]. He tried to correct what he considered to be western misconceptions.

===On Russia and the Jews===
{{Main|Two Hundred Years Together}}
Solzhenitsyn also published a two-volume work on the history of Russian-Jewish relations (''Two Hundred Years Together'' 2001, 2002). This book stirred controversy and caused Solzhenitsyn to be widely accused of [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200609/ai_n18622003?tag=rel.res1 |title=Dimensional Spaces in Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Two Hundred Years Together &amp;#124; Canadian Slavonic Papers &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2 June 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010 | first=Zinaida | last=Gimpelevich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkovich-zametki.com/2006/Zametki/Nomer6/VOstrovsky1.htm |title=VOstrovsky1.htm |publisher=Berkovich-zametki.com |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunround.com/club/22/133_chanan.htm |title=22 |publisher=Sunround.com |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cathy Young from the May 2004 issue |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/29113.html |title=Traditional Prejudices: The anti-Semitism of Alexander Solzhenitsyn. – Reason Magazine |publisher=Reason.com |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book became a best-seller in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;''Dvesti let vmeste'', Moscow, Russkii put', 2001 and 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Solzhenitsyn begins this work with a plea for &quot;patient mutual comprehension&quot; on the part of Russians and Russian Jews. The author writes that the book was conceived in the hope of promoting &quot;mutually agreeable and fruitful pathways for the future development of Russian-Jewish relations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader'', p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;

There is sharp division on the allegation of [[anti-Semitism]]. From Solzhenitsyn's own essay &quot;Repentance and Self-Limitation in the Life of Nations&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader'', pp. 527–555&lt;/ref&gt; he calls for Russians and Jews alike to take moral responsibility for the &quot;renegades&quot; from both communities who enthusiastically supported a Marxist dictatorship after the [[October Revolution]]. At the end of chapter 15, he writes that Jews must answer for the &quot;revolutionary cutthroats&quot; in their ranks just as Russian Gentiles must repent &quot;for the [[pogrom]]s, for those merciless arsonist peasants, for...crazed revolutionary soldiers.&quot; It is not, he adds, a matter of answering &quot;before other peoples, but to oneself, to one's consciousness, and before God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader'', p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; Writing of Solzhenitsyn's novel, ''August 1914'' in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on November 13, 1985, the American historian [[Richard Pipes]] commented: &quot;Every culture has its own brand of anti-Semitism. In Solzhenitsyn's case, it's not racial. It has nothing to do with blood. He's certainly not a racist; the question is fundamentally religious and cultural. He bears some resemblance to Dostoevsky, who was a fervent Christian and patriot and a rabid anti-Semite. Solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the Russian extreme right's view of the Revolution, which is that it was the doing of the Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, D.M. ''Alexander Solzhenitsyn'' St. Martin's Press, New York, New York, United States of America, 1998 ISBN 0-312-18036-5 page 490.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to D.M.Thomas, [[Elie Wiesel]] said Solzhenitsyn is not an anti-semite. &quot;he is too intelligent, too honest, too courageous, too great a writer.&quot; He says he wishes Solzhenitsyn were more sensitive to Jewish suffering, but believes the insensitivity is unconscious. This statement however predates the publication in 2001 of &quot;200 Years Together&quot; by at least 3 years &lt;ref&gt;Thomas, page 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities between ''Two Hundred years together'' and an antisemitic essay titled &quot;Jews in the USSR and in the Future Russia&quot;, attributed to Solzhenitsyn, has led to inference that he stands behind the anti-Semitic passages. Solzhenitsyn himself claims that the essay consists of manuscripts stolen from him, and then manipulated, forty years ago.&lt;ref name=young&gt;Cathy Young: [http://www.reason.com/news/show/29113.html Traditional Prejudices. The [[anti-Semitism]] of Alexander Solzhenitsyn] ''[[Reason Magazine]]'' May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Young: [http://www.reason.com/news/show/29241.html Reply to Daniel J. Mahoney] in ''Reason Magazine'', August–September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the historian [[Semyon Reznik]], textological analyses have proven Solzhenitsyn's authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2003/0611/win/reznik.htm |title=Семён Резник: Лебедь Белая И Шесть Пудов Еврейского Жира [Win&amp;#93; |publisher=Vestnik.com |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Solzhenitsyn was interviewed by Nikolay Kazantsev, a monarchist Russo-Argentine journalist, for ''Nasha Strana'', a Russia-language newspaper based in [[Buenos Aires]]. In the interview he said: &quot;We (Russia) are walking a narrow isthmus between Communists and the World Jewry. Neither is acceptable for us... And I mean this not in the racial sense, but in the sense of the Jewry as a certain world view. The Jewry is embodied in &quot;Fevralism&quot; (i.e. democracy). Neither side is acceptable to us in the case the War breaks out.&quot; He also described the United States as a &quot;province of Israel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;«НАША СТРАНА», №2850. Buenos-Aires, 8/23/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian dissident writer [[Vladimir Voynovich]], interviewed for [[Radio Liberty]] on the first anniversary of Solzhenitsyn' death, has alleged &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Юрий Васильев |url=http://www.svobodanews.ru/content/article/1791697.html?utm_source=gazeta.ru&amp;utm_medium=links&amp;utm_campaign=GazetaRu |title=Спор с Солженицыным продолжается – Радио Свобода © 2009 RFE/RL, Inc |publisher=Svobodanews.ru |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Solzhenitshyn harbored anti-Semitic sentiments all his life, as attested by the 1964 manuscript he later developed into &quot;200 Years Together&quot;. Voynovich further alleged that Solzhenitsyn deliberately concealed this anti-Semitism, because he knew this would have prevented him from receiving the [[Nobel Prize]].

===On new Russian &quot;democracy&quot;===
In some of his later political writings, such as ''Rebuilding Russia'' (1990) and ''Russia in Collapse'' (1998), Solzhenitsyn criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new Russian 'democracy,' while opposing any nostalgia for Soviet Communism. He defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to [[Radical nationalism in Russia|radical nationalism]]), argued for the indispensability of local self-government to a free Russia, and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic Russians in the &quot;[[near abroad]]&quot; of the former Soviet Union. He also sought to protect the national character of the Russian Orthodox church and fought against the admission of Catholic priests and Protestant pastors to Russia from other countries. For a brief period, he had his own TV show, where he freely expressed his views. The show was cancelled because of low ratings, but Solzhenitsyn continued to maintain a relatively high profile in the media.

===The West===
Delivering the commencement address at [[Harvard University]] in 1978, he called the [[United States]] spiritually weak and mired in vulgar [[materialism]]. Americans, he said, speaking in Russian through a translator, suffered from a &quot;decline in courage&quot; and a &quot;lack of manliness.&quot; Few were willing to die for their ideals, he said. He condemned both the United States government and American society for its &quot;hasty&quot; capitulation in the [[Vietnam War]]. He criticized the country's music as intolerable and attacked its [[freedom of the press|unfettered press]], accusing it of violations of privacy. He said that the West erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model. While faulting Soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people, he also faulted the West for being too legalistic: &quot;A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities.&quot;&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/solzhenitsyn/harvard1978.html A World Split Apart] Harvard Class Day Exercises, 8 June 1978. Also here [http://www.nationalreview.com/document/document060603.asp] and here [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/alexandersolzhenitsynharvard.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Solzhenitsyn's death, [[Richard Pipes]], a history professor at Harvard, wrote of him: &quot;Solzhenitsyn blamed the evils of Soviet communism on the West. He rightly stressed the European origins of Marxism, but he never asked himself why Marxism in other European countries led not to the gulag but to the welfare state. He reacted with white fury to any suggestion that the roots of [[Leninism]] and [[Stalinism]] could be found in Russia's past. His knowledge of Russian history was very superficial and laced with a romantic sentimentalism. While accusing the West of imperialism, he seemed quite unaware of the extraordinary expansion of his own country into regions inhabited by non-Russians. He also denied that Imperial Russia practiced censorship or condemned political prisoners to hard labor, which, of course, was absurd.&quot;.&lt;ref name=pipes2&gt;Richard Pipes: [http://pda.moscowtimes.ru/article.php?aid=186820 Solzhenitsyn's Troubled Prophetic Mission] ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' 7 August 2008. Also in ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]'' 8 August 2008.[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?story_id=26779&amp;action_id=2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian culture===
In his 1978 Harvard address, Solzhenitsyn argued over Russian culture, that the West erred in &quot;denying its autonomous character and therefore never understood it &quot;&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;

===Communism, Russia and nationalism===
Solzhenitsyn emphasized the significantly more oppressive character of the Soviet [[totalitarian]] regime, in comparison to the [[Russian Empire]] of the [[House of Romanov]]. He asserted that Imperial Russia did not practice any real [[censorship]] in the style of the [[Glavlit|Soviet Glavlit]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/about_database/russia.html A brief history of censorship in Russia in 19th and 20th century] Beacon for Freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; that political prisoners typically were not always forced into [[labor camps]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gentes: [http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:8015/katorga.pdf Katorga: Penal Labor and Tsarist Siberia] in ''The Siberian Saga: A History of Russias Wild East,'' ed. Eva-Maria Stolberg, Frankfurt am Main 2005, Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the number of political prisoners and exiles was only one ten-thousandth of those in the Soviet Union. He noted that the Tsar's secret police, or [[Okhrana]], was only present in the three largest cities, and not at all in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. 

In a speech commenorating the [[Vendée Uprising]], Solzhenitsyn compared Lenin's [[Bolshevik]]s with [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] of the [[French Revolution]]. However, he commented that, while the French [[Reign of Terror]] ended with the execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], its Soviet equivalent raged unabated from 1917 until the [[Khrushchev thaw]] in the 1950s.

He believed that revolutionary violence comes from the teachings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], arguing [[Marxism]] is violent. His conclusion is that Marxist Governments will always be dictatorships, no matter which country they exist in.

According to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union. He believed that all ethnic cultures have been oppressed in favor of an atheistic Marxism. Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity. Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.&lt;ref&gt;For Solzhenitsyn's connections with Russian nationalism, see e.g. ''Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Russian Nationalism'' by David G. Rowley in ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 32, No. 3 (Jul. 1997), pp. 321–337&lt;/ref&gt;

Solzhenitsyn said that for every country, great power status deforms and harms the national character and that he has never wished great power status for Russia. He rejected the view that the USA and Russia are natural rivals, saying that before the [Russian] revolution, they were natural allies and that during the [[American Civil War]], Russia supported [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and the North [in contrast to Britain and France, which supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]], and then they were allies in the First World War. But beginning with Communism, Russia ceased to exist and the confrontation was not at all with Russia but with the Communist Soviet Union.

===World War II===
Solzhenitsyn criticized the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] for not opening a new front against [[Nazi Germany]] in the west earlier in World War II. This resulted in Soviet domination and oppression of the nations of [[Eastern Europe]]. Solzhenitsyn claimed the Western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the East, as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the West. While stationed in [[East Prussia]] as an artillery officer, Solzhenitsyn witnessed [[Soviet war crimes#Germany|war crimes against the civilian German population]] by Soviet &quot;liberators&quot; as the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and [[Mass rape of German women by Soviet Red Army|women were gang-raped to death]]. He wrote a poem entitled &quot;[[Prussian Nights]]&quot; about these incidents. In it, the first-person narrator seems to approve of the troops' crimes as revenge for German atrocities, expressing his desire to take part in the plunder himself. The poem describes the rape of a [[Polish]] woman whom the [[Red Army]] soldiers mistakenly thought to be a German.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''God's Playground. A History of Poland (Columbia University Press,1982. vol.II.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalinism===
{{See also|Stalinism}}
In his ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' Solzhenitsyn rejected the view that it was [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] who created the Soviet [[totalitarian state]]. He argued that it was Lenin who started the mass executions, created a [[planned economy]], founded the [[Cheka]] which would later be turned into the [[KGB]], and started the system of [[labor camps]] later known as [[Gulag]].

===Mikhail Sholokhov===
Solzhenitsyn was the most prominent of the Nobel Laureate [[Mikhail Sholokhov]]'s many detractors. He alleged that the work which made Sholokhov's international reputation, ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'' was written by [[Fyodor Kryukov]], a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] and [[Anti-communism|Anti-Bolshevik]], who died in 1920, possibly in retaliation for Sholokhov scathing opinion re ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich''.&lt;ref&gt;Izgarshev, Igor (25 May 2005). &quot;[http://noblit.ru/content/view/399/1/ Михаил Шолохов: жизнь не по лжи]&quot; (in Russian). ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]''. Retrieved 17 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Solzhenitsyn claimed that Sholokhov found the manuscript and published it under his own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://161.ru/news/62709.html |title=Студенты ЮФУ против Солженицына! – Новость дня – 161.ru |publisher=161.ru |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors first appeared in the late 1920s, but an investigation upheld Sholokhov's authorship of ''And Quiet Flows the Don'' and the allegations were denounced as malicious slander in ''Pravda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=http://winner.ru/dart/ |url=http://www.peoples.ru/art/literature/story/sholohov/history1.html |title=Михаил Александрович Шолохов / Mihail Aleksandrovich Sholohov: Михаил Шолохов: жизнь не по лжи |publisher=Peoples.ru |date=25 August 2004 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1984 monograph by [[Geir Kjetsaa]] and others demonstrated through statistical analyses that Sholokhov was indeed the likely author of ''Don''. And in 1987, several thousand pages of notes and drafts of the work were discovered and authenticated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feb-web.ru/feb/sholokh/critics/nos/nos-096-.htm |title=Ф. Кузнецов. Рукопись &quot;Тихого дона&quot; и проблема авторства (F. Kuznetsov. Rough drafts of '&amp;#39;And Quiet Flows the Don'&amp;#39; and the problem of authorship) (Russian) |publisher=Feb-web.ru |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trud.ru&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trud.ru/issue/article.php?id=200005250940801 |title=Труд: Рукописи Вправду Не Горят! |publisher=Trud.ru |date= |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second world war, Sholokhov's archive was destroyed in a bomb raid, and only the fourth volume survived. Sholokhov had his friend Vassily Kudashov, who was killed in the war, look after it. Following Kudashov's death, his widow took possession of the manuscript, but she never disclosed the fact of owning it. The manuscript was finally found by the Institute of World Literature of Russia's Academy of Sciences in 1999 with assistance from the Russian Government. An analysis of the novel has unambiguously proved Sholokhov's authorship. The writing paper dates back to the 1920s: 605 pages are in Sholokhov's own hand, and 285 are transcribed by his wife Maria and sisters.&lt;ref name=&quot;trud.ru&quot; /&gt;

===The Sino-Soviet Conflict===
In 1973, near the height of the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet conflict]], Solzhenitsyn sent a ''Letter to the Soviet Leaders'' to a limited number of upper echelon Soviet officials. This work, which was published for the general public in the Western world a year after it was sent to its intended audience, beseeched the Soviet Union's authorities to

{{bquote|Give them their ideology! Let the Chinese leaders glory in it for a while. And for that matter, let them shoulder the whole sackful of unfulfillable international obligations, let them grunt and heave and instruct humanity, and foot all the bills for their absurd economics (a million a day just to Cuba), and let them support terrorists and guerrillas in the Southern Hemisphere too if they like. The main source of the savage feuding between us will then melt away, a great many points of today's contention and conflict all over the world will also melt away, and a military clash will become a much remoter possibility and perhaps ''won't take place at all'' [author's emphasis].&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr. ''Letter to the Soviet Leaders''. Harper &amp; Row, NY. p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Vietnam war===
Once in America, Solzhenitsyn urged the United States to continue its involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/mark-steel/mark-steel-a-reactionary-called-solzhenitsyn-886115.html |title=Mark Steel: A reactionary called Solzhenitsyn – Mark Steel, Commentators – The Independent |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=14 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his commencement address at Harvard University in 1978 (''A World Split Apart''), Solzhenitsyn alleged that many in the U.S. did not understand the [[Vietnam War]]. He rhetorically asks if the American Anti-War Movement ever realized the effects their actions had on Vietnam: &quot;But members of the U.S. antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of Far Eastern nations, in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there. Do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there?&quot;&lt;ref name=harvard /&gt;

During his time in the United States, Solzhenitsyn made several controversial public statements: notably, he accused [[Pentagon Papers]] leak [[Daniel Ellsberg]] of [[treason]].

===Kosovo War===
Solzhenitsyn strongly condemned the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|bombing of Yugoslavia]] during the [[Kosovo War]], saying &quot;there is no difference whatsoever between [[NATO]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws001/solzh001.htm Solzhenitsyn compares NATO to Hitler]{{Dead link|date=September 2009}} Associated Press 3 June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holodomor===
Solzhenitsyn has stated that the ongoing Ukrainian effort to have the 1930s famine, the [[Holodomor]], recognized as an act of [[Holodomor genocide question|genocide against the Ukrainian people]] is in fact [[historical revisionism]]. According to Solzhenitsyn, the famine was caused by the [[Criticisms of Communist party rule|nature of the Communist regime]], under which all peoples suffered. As such it was not an assault by the Russian people against the Ukrainian people, and the wish to represent it as such is only recent and politically motivated.

Solzhenitsyn's views on this matter are in line with those of several historians of the period (such as [[Dmitri Volkogonov]] and [[Aleksandr Bushkov]]) as well as the official stance of the Russian Government. This view suggests that policies of [[collectivization]] and mass seizure of property that lead to the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s were a result of the political (communist) and economic (favoring rapid industrial growth over consumption) policies of the Soviet Union, and not racial hatred against the Ukrainians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russiatoday.ru/news/news/22945 Nobel winner accuses Ukrainian authorities of 'historical revisionism'] ''[[Russia Today]]'' Retrieved on 10 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1319, Aberdeen received [[Royal burgh|Royal Burgh]] status from [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} transforming the city economically. The city's two universities, the [[University of Aberdeen]], founded in 1495, and the [[Robert Gordon University]], which was awarded university status in 1992, make Aberdeen the educational centre of the north-east. The traditional industries of fishing, paper-making, shipbuilding, and textiles have been overtaken by the [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] and Aberdeen's [[port|seaport]].

In January 2011 Aberdeen was named one of five cities which could help the UK climb its way out of the recession because of its high levels of employment, abundance of skilled workers, and an increase in the average weekly earnings. Aberdeen City and Shire was dubbed in the report by officials as the &quot;one to watch&quot; with its rapid growing economy, size and oil reserves.{http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12261716}

Aberdeen has won the [[Britain in Bloom]] competition a record-breaking ten times,&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt; and hosts the [[Aberdeen International Youth Festival]], a major international event which attracts up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies.

{{Main|History of Aberdeen}}
The Aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least 8,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;prehistory&quot; /&gt; The city began as two separate [[burgh]]s: [[Old Aberdeen]] at the mouth of the river Don; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary. The earliest [[charter]] was granted by [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]] in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. In 1319, the Great Charter of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community. Granted with it was the nearby [[Forest of Stocket]], whose income formed the basis for the city's [[Common Good Fund (Aberdeen)|Common Good Fund]] which still benefits Aberdonians.&lt;ref name=&quot;keith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Keith, Alexander|year=1987|title=A Thousand Years of Aberdeen |publisher=Aberdeen University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fraser&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=W. Hamish|last=Fraser|title=Aberdeen, 1800 to 2000: A New History |year=2000 |publisher=Tuckwell Press |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], Aberdeen was under English rule, so [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] laid siege to [[Aberdeen Castle]] before destroying it in 1308 followed by the massacring of the English garrison and the retaking of Aberdeen for the townspeople. The city was burned by [[Edward III of England]] in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770. During the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of 1644-1647 the city was impartially plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the [[Battle of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Chris |last=Brown |title=The Battle of Aberdeen 1644|year=2002|publisher=Tempus Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1647 an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] killed a quarter of the population.
In the eighteenth century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary|Infirmary]] at [[Woolmanhill Hospital|Woolmanhill]] in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. The council began major road improvements at the end of the century with the main thoroughfares of [[George Street, Aberdeen|George Street]], [[King Street, Aberdeen|King Street]] and [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]] all completed at the start of the next century.
A century later, the increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the existing harbour with Victoria Dock, the South Breakwater, and the extension to the North Pier. The expensive infrastructure program had repercussions, and in 1817 the city was bankrupt. However, a recovery was made in the general prosperity which followed the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]]. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;fraser&quot; /&gt;
The city was first [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1891. Although Old Aberdeen still has a separate charter and history, it and New Aberdeen are no longer truly distinct. They are both part of the city, along with Woodside and the [[Royal Burgh]] of [[Torry]] to the south of the River Dee.

===Toponymy===
{{Main|Etymology of Aberdeen}}
Old Aberdeen is the approximate location of ''Aberdon'' the first settlement of Aberdeen; this literally means &quot;at the confluence of the Don [ie. with the sea]&quot; in relation to the local river. The modern name Aberdeen literally means between the Dee (the other local river) and Don. The [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] prefix; &quot;Aber-&quot; means &quot;the confluence of&quot; in relation to the rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charnock&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard Stephen |last=Charnock|title=Local Etymology: A Derivative Dictionary of Geographical Names|year= 1859|publisher=Houlston and Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe the name came from the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] prefix ''Aber-'' and ''da-aevi'' (variation;''Da-abhuin'', ''Da-awin'') - which means &quot;the mouth of two rivers&quot;. In Gaelic the name is ''Obar Dheathain'' (variation; ''Obairreadhain'') and in [[Latin]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] referred to it as ''Devana''. Mediaeval (or ecclesiastical) Latin has it as ''Aberdonia''.

==Governance==
{{Main|Politics of Aberdeen}}
{{See also|List of Provosts and Lord Provosts of Aberdeen}}
[[File:New acc logo.png|thumb|right|''Aberdeen City Council'''s logo with &quot;Simplified&quot; Coat of Arms.]]

Aberdeen is locally governed by Aberdeen City Council, which comprises forty-three councillors who represent the city's [[ward (politics)|wards]] and is headed by the [[List of Provosts and Lord Provosts of Aberdeen|Lord Provost]] who is currently Provost Peter Stephen.

From May 2003 until May 2007 the council was run by a [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] coalition. Following the May 2007 elections the Liberal Democrats formed a new coalition with the [[Scottish National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6654023.stm |title=Lib Dems and SNP in Aberdeen deal |work=BBC News Online |date=14 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007 the council consisted of: 15 Liberal Democrat, 13 SNP, 10 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], 4 Conservative councillors and a single independent councillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/acci/web/site/xac_Councillor.asp?s=3 |title=Aberdeen City Councillors|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a SNP by election gain from the Conservatives on 16 August 2007, the Lib Dem/SNP coalition held 28 of the 43 seats). In August 2009 a councillor resigned from the Liberal Democrats and became an independent. The Conservative Group split in August 2010 with two councillors forming the Aberdeen Conservatives. All four Conservatives remain recognised as Conservatives by the party nationally.

Aberdeen is represented in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by three [[constituencies]]: [[Aberdeen North (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen North]], [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] and [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]], of which the first two are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area while the latter also encompasses a large swathe of [[Aberdeenshire]].

In the [[Scottish Parliament]] the city is represented again by three constituencies, all of which are solely within the council area: [[Aberdeen North (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen North]], [[Aberdeen Central (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen Central]] and [[Aberdeen South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] and by a further seven MSPs elected as part of the [[North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|North East Scotland]] electoral region.

In the [[European Parliament]] the city is represented by six [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] as part of the all-inclusive Scotland constituency.

==Heraldry==
[[File:Aberdeen City from Docks.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Aberdeen City from Docks]]
{{Main|Heraldry of Aberdeen}}
Symbols of the city typically show three castles, such as in the case of the flag and coat of arms. The image has been around since the time of [[Robert the Bruce]] and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of Aberdeen; Aberdeen Castle on Castle Hill (today's [[Castlegate, Aberdeen|castlegate]]); an unknown building on Windmill Hill and a church on St. Catherine's Hill (now levelled).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html |title=Aberdeen City|accessdate=2007-05-15|author=Gazetter for Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Bon Accord&quot; is the [[motto]] of the city and is French literally for &quot;Good Agreement&quot;. Legend tells that its use dates from the fourteenth century password used by Robert the Bruce during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], when he and his men laid siege to Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308.&lt;ref name=&quot;keith&quot; /&gt;

The [[leopard]] has traditionally been associated with the city and its emblem can be seen on the city crest. The local magazine is called the &quot;Leopard&quot; and, when Union Bridge was constructed in the nineteenth century, small statues of the creature in a sitting position were cast and placed on top of the railing posts (known locally as Kelly's Cats).

The city's toast is &quot;Happy to meet, sorry to part, happy to meet again&quot;; this has been commonly misinterpreted as the translation of Bon Accord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/introducing.html|title=Aberdeen Official Guide|publisher=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Aberdeen}}
Being sited between two river mouths, the city has little natural exposure of bedrock. This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary : despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), there is only a vague understanding of what underlays the city. To the south side of the city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. And under the city itself? The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it's actually sited on an inlier of Devonian &quot;Old Red&quot; sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the [[Dalradian]] period (approximately 480-600 million years ago) with sporadic areas of [[igneous rock|igneous]] [[Diorite]] granites to be found, such as that at the [[Rubislaw quarry]] which was used to build much of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councildetails1.html |title=Details of Aberdeen City |author=Gazetter for Scotland|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the coast, Aberdeen has a long sand beach between the two rivers, the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee]] and the [[River Don, Aberdeenshire|Don]], which turns into high [[sand dunes]] north of the Don stretching as far as [[Fraserburgh]]; to the south of the Dee are steep rocky cliff faces with only minor pebble and shingle beaches in deep inlets. A number of granite outcrops along the south coast have been quarried in the past, making for spectacular scenery and good rock-climbing.

The city extends to 184.46&amp;nbsp;km² (71.22&amp;nbsp;sq mi),&lt;ref name=&quot;dbjrij&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files/05mype-cahb-t9.pdf|title=Land Area and Population Density |author=General Register for Scotland|accessdate=2007-03-12|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, [[Woodside, Aberdeen|Woodside]] and the [[Royal Burgh]] of [[Torry]] to the south of [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]]. In {{Scottish council populations|TXT=Year}} this gave the city a population density of {{Scottish council populations|DEN=00QA}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;population&quot; /&gt; The city is built on many hills, with the original beginnings of the city growing from Castle Hill, St. Catherine's Hill and Windmill Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/councils/councilfirst1.html |title=Aberdeen City |publisher=The Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Aberdeen features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''). Aberdeen is far milder than one might expect for its northern location. During the winter, especially throughout December, the length of the day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 40 minutes between sunrise and sunset at the Winter Solstice. As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. As summer begins, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 57 minutes between sunrise and sunset, with Nautical Twilight lasting the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year will be hovering around 17&amp;nbsp;°C during the day.

The last census revealed that Aberdeen is the least religious city in Scotland, with nearly 43&amp;nbsp;% of people claiming to have no religion&lt;ref name=&quot;citycensusreview&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=1726&amp;sID=332|title=2001 Census: Key Statistics - Aberdeen City |author=Aberdeen City Council|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several former churches in the city have been converted into bars and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080120092254rn_1/thescotsman.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2777998 |title=Minister thrown out of trendy nightclub that used to be his church |newspaper=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |date=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen|Kirk of St Nicholas]] was the only burgh kirk and one of Scotland's largest parish churches. Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], in this case into the East and West churches. At this time, the city also was home to houses of the [[Carmelites]] (Whitefriars) and [[Franciscans]] (Greyfriars), the latter of which surviving in modified form as the chapel of Marischal College as late as the early twentieth Century.

[[St Machar's Cathedral]] was formed twenty years after [[David I of Scotland|David I]] (1124–53) transferred the pre-Reformation [[Diocese]] from Mortlach in [[Banffshire]] to Old Aberdeen in 1137. With the exception of the episcopate of [[William Elphinstone]] (1484–1511), building progressed slowly. [[Gavin Dunbar (Bishop of Aberdeen)|Gavin Dunbar]], who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept.

[[St. Mary's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Mary's Cathedral]] is a [[Roman Catholic]] Cathedral in [[Gothic style]], erected in 1859.

[[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen|St. Andrew's Cathedral]] is the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopal]] Cathedral, constructed in 1817 as Archibald Simpson's first commission. It is notable for having consecrated the first bishop of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]].

[[The Salvation Army]] citadel dominates the east end of Union Street.

There is a Unitarian Church, established in 1833 and currently located in Skene Terrace, close to the city centre by Union Terrace.

[[Christadelphians]] have been present in Aberdeen since at least 1844. Over the years, they have rented space to meet at a number of locations: the West Room of the Music Hall (for over 120 years); the Cowdry Club; the YWCA in Bon Accord Crescent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.freeuk.net/snichp/ecclesial/aberdeen.htm Aberdeen Christadelphians]&lt;/ref&gt; Today they meet in the Inchgarth Community Centre in Garthdee.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://ukchristadelphians.org.uk/info.asp?act=ecc&amp;id=3 Aberdeen]' on ''Find your local Christadelphians''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two meetinghouses of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

There is also an [[Islam]]ic Mosque in Old Aberdeen and an Orthodox Jewish Synagogue established in 1945. There are no formal [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] or [[Hinduism|Hindu]] buildings. The [[University of Aberdeen]] has a small [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] society.

There is also a [[Quaker]] meetinghouse on Crown street, the only purpose built [[Quaker House]] in Scotland that is still in use today.

{{Main|Economy of Aberdeen|Oil Industry in Aberdeen}}
Traditionally, Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, shipbuilding and paper making. These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the [[oil industry]], which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy.

Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the eighteenth Century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and [[paper]]-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the [[Paper mills of Aberdeen|Stoneywood Paper Mill]] with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when [[Richards of Aberdeen]] closed.

Grey granite was [[quarry|quarried]] at [[Rubislaw quarry]] for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[Waterloo Bridge]] in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971.

Fishing was once the predominant industry, but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the twentieth Century. Catches have fallen due to overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels,&lt;ref name=&quot;harbour&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aberdeen-harbour.co.uk/history.html|title=Aberdeen Harbour: A History of Service |publisher=Aberdeen Harbour Board|accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so although still an important fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of [[Peterhead]] and Fraserburgh. The [[Fisheries Research Services]] are headquartered in Aberdeen, and there is a marine research lab in Torry.

Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research carried out at [[The Macaulay Institute]], which has close links to the city's two universities. The [[Rowett Research Institute]] is a world-renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen. It has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of [[life scientists]] working in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowett&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rowett.ac.uk/institute/history.html|title=History and Background|publisher=Rowett Research Institute |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencejobs.com/insider/article.action?article.id=insider126&amp;focusId=scotland|title=A Scientist's guide to Scotland|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a dynamic and fast growing electronics design and development industry. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

With the discovery of significant [[North Sea oil|oil deposit]]s in the [[North Sea]] during the late twentieth century, Aberdeen became the centre of Europe's [[petroleum]] industry. With the second largest heliport in the world and an important service ship harbour port serving [[oil platform|oil rig]]s off-shore, Aberdeen is often called the ''Oil Capital of Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talentscotland.com/view_item.aspx?item_id=912|title=Aberdeen - Introduction to the city|publisher=Scottish Enterprise|accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now a concerted effort to transform  Aberdeen's reputation as the ''Oil Capital of Europe'' into the ''Energy Capital of Europe'' as oil supplies may start to dwindle in coming years, and there is considerable interest in the development of new energy sources; and technology transfer from oil into renewable energy and other industries is under way.  The &quot;Energetica&quot; initiative led by Scottish Enterprise has been designed to accelerate this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3236703.stm |title=A burst of energy in Europe's oil capital |work=BBC News Online|date=12 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city ranks third in Scotland for shopping. The traditional shopping streets are [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]] and [[George Street, Aberdeen|George Street]], now complemented by shopping centres, notably the [[St Nicholas &amp; Bon Accord]] and the [[Trinity Shopping Centre]]. A new retail [http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/acci/web/site/CouncilNews/pr/pr_hammer_280706.asp £190 million] development, [[Union Square Aberdeen|Union Square]], reached completion in late September/early October 2009. Major [[retail park]]s away from the city centre include the Berryden Retail Park, the Kittybrewster Retail Park and the Beach Boulevard Retail Park.

In March 2004, Aberdeen was awarded [[Fairtrade City]] status by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aberdeenfairtrade.website.orange.co.uk/ |publisher=Aberdeenfairtrade.org.uk |title=Aberdeen Fairtrade |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with Dundee, it shares the distinction of being the first city in Scotland to receive this accolade.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

{{Main|Architecture in Aberdeen}}

Aberdeen's [[architecture]] is known for its principal use during the Victorian era of [[granite]], which has led to its local [[nickname]] of the ''Granite City'' or more romantically the less commonly used name the ''Silver City'', since the [[Mica]] in the stone sparkles in the sun. The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where [[sandstone]] has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry.

[[File:Granite terrace in Aberdeen.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Granite [[terraced house|terrace]] in central Aberdeen]]

Amongst the notable buildings in the city's main street, [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]], are the Town and County Bank, the [[The Music Hall (Aberdeen)|Music Hall]], the Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades (originating between 1398 and 1527), now a shopping mall; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the [[National Bank of Scotland]]. In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the new Town House, a very prominent landmark in Aberdeen, built between 1868 and 1873 to a design by Peddie and Kinnear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst6629.html  |title=Overview of Town House |publisher=Geo.ed.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Town House, top of West Tower, Aberdeen, Peddie and Kinnear, 1868-74, photo Jane Cartney 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The West Tower of the new Town House, 1868-73]]

[[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]]'s extension to [[Marischal College]] on Broad Street, opened by King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] in 1906, created the second largest granite building in the world (after the [[Escorial]], [[Madrid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst1482.html  |title=Overview of Marischal College |publisher=Geo.ed.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeen has long been famous for its 45&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt; outstanding [[park]]s and [[garden]]s, and citywide floral displays which include two million roses, eleven million daffodils and three million crocuses. The city has won the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Britain in Bloom]] 'Best City' award ten times,&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/floral.html| title=Floral Capital of Scotland|publisher=British Publishing| date=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the overall Scotland in Bloom competition twenty times&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt; and the large city category every year since 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt; At one point after winning a period of nine years straight, Aberdeen was banned from the Britain in Bloom competition to give another city a chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Maureen| last=Simpson| url=http://www.rhs.org.uk/britaininbloom/scotland/aberdeen2006.asp | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929103259/http://www.rhs.org.uk/britaininbloom/scotland/aberdeen2006.asp | archivedate=2007-09-29 | title=We're top of Brit parade| publisher=Press and Journal| date=2006-09-22}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city won the 2006 Scotland in Bloom &quot;Best City&quot; award along with the International Cities in Bloom award.

[[Duthie Park]] opened in 1899 on the north bank of the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]]. It was named after and gifted to the city by Miss Elizabeth Crombie Duthie of Ruthrieston in 1881. It has extensive gardens, a rose hill, boating pond, bandstand, and play area as well as Europe's second largest enclosed gardens the David Welch Winter Gardens. [[Hazlehead Park]], is large and forested, located on the outskirts of the city, it is popular with walkers in the forests, sports enthusiasts, naturalists and picnickers. There are football pitches, two golf courses, a pitch and putt course and a horse riding school.

Aberdeen's success in the Britain in Bloom competitions is often attributed to [[Johnston Gardens]], a small park of one hectare in the west end of the city containing many different flowers and plants which have been renowned for their beauty. The garden was in 2002, named the best garden in the [[British Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;floral&quot; /&gt;

[[Seaton Park]], formerly the grounds of a private house, is on the edge of the grounds of [[St Machar's Cathedral]]. The Cathedral Walk is maintained in a formal style with a great variety of plants providing a popular display. The park includes several other areas with contrasting styles to this.

[[Union Terrace Gardens]] opened in 1879 and is situated in the centre of the city. It covers {{convert|2.5|acre|m2}} in the centre of Aberdeen bordered on three sides by Union Street, Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct. The park forms a natural amphitheatre located in the Denburn Valley and is an oasis of peace and calm in the city centre. A recent proposal to build a three storey concrete and steel superstructure in place of the gardens, part of which will provide a commercial concourse, has proved highly controversial.

Situated next to each other, [[Victoria Park, Aberdeen|Victoria Park]] and [[Westburn Park]] cover {{convert|26|acre|m2}} between them. [[Victoria Park, Aberdeen|Victoria Park]] opened in 1871. There is a conservatory used as a seating area and a fountain made of fourteen different granites, presented to the people by the granite polishers and master builders of Aberdeen. Opposite to the north is [[Westburn Park]] opened in 1901. With large grass pitches it is widely used for field sports. There is large tennis centre with indoor and outdoor courts, a children's cycle track, play area and a grass boules lawn.

===Theatres and Concert Halls===
{{Main|Aberdeen Theatres and Concert halls}}

Aberdeen has been the host of a few theatres through history. Some of them has been converted or destroyed over the years. The most 
famous ones includes:
*[[His Majesty's Theatre]] (HMT), on Rosemount Viaduct&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated65&quot;&gt;Edi Swan: ''His Majesty's Theatre – One Hundred Years of Glorious Damnation'' ([[Black &amp; White Publishing]]) (2006) ISBN 978 184502 102 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[File:Aberdeenconcourse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Aberdeen Railway Station]]
{{Main|Transport in Aberdeen}}
[[Aberdeen Airport]] (ABZ), at Dyce in the north of the city, serves a number of domestic and international destinations including France, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Scandinavian countries. The heliport which serves the oil industry and rescue services is one of the busiest commercial heliports in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAA&quot;/&gt;

[[Aberdeen railway station]] is on the main UK rail network and has frequent direct trains to major cities such as [[Edinburgh]], Glasgow and London, including the overnight [[Caledonian Sleeper]] train. The station is currently being updated to bring it into the modern age. In 2007 additions were made and a new ticket office was built in the building.

Until 2007, a 1950s-style concrete bus station at Guild Street served out-of-the-city locations; it has since transferred to a new and well-presented bus station just 100 metres to the east off Market Street as part of the Union Square development.

There are six major roads in and out of the city. The A90 is the main arterial route into the city from the north and south, linking Aberdeen to Edinburgh, [[Dundee]], [[Brechin]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the south and [[Ellon, Aberdeenshire|Ellon]], [[Peterhead]] and Fraserburgh in the north. The A96 links to [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] and [[Inverness]] and the north west. The A93 is the main route to the west, heading towards Royal Deeside and the [[Cairngorms]]. After [[Braemar]], it turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. The A944 also heads west, through [[Westhill, Aberdeenshire|Westhill]] and on to [[Alford, Aberdeenshire|Alford]].  The A92 was the original southerly road to Aberdeen prior to the building of the A90, and is now used as a tourist route, connecting the towns of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and [[Arbroath]] and on the east coast. The A947 exits the city at Dyce and goes on to [[Newmachar]], [[Oldmeldrum]] and [[Turriff]] finally ending at [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] and [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]].

Aberdeen Harbour is important as the largest in the north of Scotland and as a ferry route to [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]. Established in 1136, it has been referred to as the oldest business in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/AberdeenOG/fact.html|title=It's a fact: 50 things you may not have known about Aberdeen|publisher=Aberdeen Official Guide|accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FirstGroup]] operates the city buses under the name [[First Aberdeen]], as the successor of Grampian Regional Transport (GRT) and Aberdeen Corporation Tramways. Aberdeen is the global headquarters of FirstGroup plc, having grown from the [[GRT Group]]. First is still based at the former Aberdeen Tramways depot on King Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstgroup.com/corporate/our_company/hq_history.php |title=www.firstgroup.com The History of 395 King Street 1862–2007 |publisher=FirstGroup |date=20 January 1989 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon to be redeveloped into a new Global Headquarters and Aberdeen bus depot.

[[Stagecoach Group]] also run buses in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, under the Stagecoach Bluebird brand. Other bus companies (e.g. [[Megabus (United Kingdom)|Megabus]]) run buses from the bus station to places north and south of the city.

Aberdeen is connected to the UK [[National Cycle Network]], and has a track to the south connecting to cities such as Dundee and Edinburgh and one to the north that forks about &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;10 miles&lt;/span&gt; from the city into two different tracks heading to Inverness and Fraserburgh respectively. Two particularly popular footpaths along old railway tracks are the [[Deeside Way]] to [[Banchory]] (which will eventually connect to Ballater) and the [[Formartine and Buchan Way]] to Ellon, both used by a mixture of cyclists, walkers and occasionally horses. Four park-and-ride sites serve the city: Stonehaven and Ellon (approx 12–17 miles out from the city centre) and Kingswells and Bridge of Don (approx 3–4 miles out).

{{Main|Education in Aberdeen}}

===Universities and colleges===
Aberdeen has two universities, the [[University of Aberdeen]] and [[Robert Gordon University|The Robert Gordon University]]. Aberdeen's student rate of 11.5% is higher than the national average of 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Education&amp;mainLevel=CouncilArea&amp;mainArea=Aberdeen+City&amp;mainText=&amp;mainTextExplicitMatch=null&amp;compLevel=CountryProfile&amp;compArea=Scotland&amp;compText=&amp;compTextExplicitMatch=null|title=Comparative Education Profile: Aberdeen City Council Area, Scotland|accessdate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Aberdeen]] began as [[King's College, Aberdeen]], which was founded in 1495 by [[William Elphinstone]] (1431–1514), [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] and Chancellor of Scotland. [[Marischal College]], a separate institution, was founded in &quot;New&quot; Aberdeen by George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal of Scotland in 1593. These institutions were amalgamated to form the present University of Aberdeen in 1860. The university is the fifth oldest in the English speaking world.&lt;ref name=&quot;university&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jennifer|last=Carter|title=Crown and Gown: Illustrated History of the University of Aberdeen, 1495-1995|year=1994|location=Aberdeen|publisher=Aberdeen University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Gordon's College]] (originally Robert Gordon's Hospital) was founded in 1729 by the merchant [[Robert Gordon (philanthropist)|Robert Gordon]], grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill. Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a [[Central Institution]] and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was gained and it became the [[Robert Gordon University]]. [[The Sunday Times]] named Robert Gordon University their Scottish University of the Year 2011 and first in Scotland for graduate-level jobs. It said: &quot;With a graduate unemployment rate that is lower than the most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Times, 12 September 2010 (subscription only)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeen is also home to two artistic schools: [[Gray's School of Art]], founded in 1886, which is one of the oldest established colleges of art in the UK, and is now incorporated into Robert Gordon University; and [[The Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and The Built Environment]], which is situated on the Garthdee Campus of the Robert Gordon University, next to Gray's School of Art.

[[Aberdeen College]] has several campuses in the city and offers a wide variety of part-time and full-time courses leading to several different qualifications in science. It is the largest further education institution in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/release.php?id=62 Leading Scottish figures to be honoured by the University of Aberdeen], [[University of Aberdeen]] Media Release, 19 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Agricultural College]] is based just outside Aberdeen, on the Craibstone Estate.  This is situated beside the roundabout for Aberdeen Airport on the A96.  The college provides three services - Learning, Research and Consultancy.  The college features many land based courses such as Agriculture, Countryside Management, Sustainable Environmental Management and Rural Business Management.  There are a variety of courses from diplomas through to masters degrees.

===Schools===
There are currently 12 secondary schools and 54 primary schools which are run by the city council. The most notable are [[Aberdeen Grammar School]] (founded in 1257), [[Harlaw Academy]], [[Cults Academy]],  and [[Oldmachar Academy]] which were all rated in the top 50 Scottish secondary schools league tables published by ''[[The Times]]'' in 2005.  Harlaw Academy was taken down from the list after a short time but is still a popular school.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For|the book by Robert Rankin|The Antipope}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2010}}
An '''antipope''' ({{lang-la|antipapa}}) is a person who opposes a legitimately elected or sitting [[Pope]] and makes a significantly accepted competing claim to be the Pope,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of Rome, endeavours to secure the papal throne, and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt&quot; ([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28501/antipope Encyclopaedia Britannica: ''Antipope'']&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Diocese of Rome|Bishop of Rome]] and leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  At times between the 3rd and mid-15th century, antipopes were typically those supported by a fairly significant faction of religious [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and secular [[king]]s and kingdoms. Persons who claim to be the pope but have few followers, such as the modern [[sedevacantism|sedevacantist antipope]]s, are not generally classified as antipopes, and therefore are ignored for [[regnal number]]ing.

In the list of popes given in the [[Holy See]]'s annual directory, ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', the following note is attached to the name of [[Pope Leo VIII]] (963–965):&lt;blockquote&gt;At this point, as again in the mid-eleventh century, we come across [[Papal conclave|elections]] in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of [[theology]] and [[canon law]] make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of [[Saint Peter]]. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes.&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2008 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008 ISBN 978-88-209-8201-4), p.&amp;nbsp;12*&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
[[Hippolytus of Rome|Saint Hippolytus]] (d.&amp;nbsp;235) is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope, as he protested against [[Pope Callixtus I]] and headed a separate group within the Church in Rome. Hippolytus was later reconciled to Callixtus's second successor, [[Pope Pontian]], when both were condemned to the mines on the island of Sardinia. He has been [[canonized]] by the Church. Whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of Hippolytus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01091997_p-70_en.html|title= The catacombs the destination of the great jubilee|publisher=[[Vatican City]]|accessdate=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether Hippolytus actually declared himself to be the Bishop of Rome, remains unclear, especially since no such claim has been cited in the writings attributed to him.

[[Eusebius of Caesarea]] quotes&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', V, 28&lt;/ref&gt; from an unnamed earlier writer the story of a Natalius who accepted the bishopric of a heretical group at Rome, but who soon repented and tearfully begged [[Pope Zephyrinus]] (Pope from 199 to 217) to receive him into communion.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century/Dictionary/Z/Zephyrinus|Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature: Zephyrinus]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm|title=Monarchians – Dynamists, or Adoptionists|publisher=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Natalius claimed to be Bishop of Rome rather than only of a small group in the city, he could be considered an antipope earlier than Hippolytus and indeed the first antipope.

[[Antipope Novatian|Novatian]] (d. 258), another [[Christianity in the 3rd century|third-century]] figure, certainly claimed the See of Rome in opposition to [[Pope Cornelius]], and if Natalius and Hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them, Novatian could then be said to be the first antipope.

The period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the 11th and 12th centuries. The emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes. The popes, likewise, sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants ([[antiking]]s) in Germany to overcome a particular emperor.

The Great [[Western Schism]]—which began in 1378, when the French cardinals, claiming that the election of [[Pope Urban VI]] was invalid, elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope—led to two, and eventually three, rival lines of claimants to the papacy: the Roman line, the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon line]] (Clement VII took up residence in [[Avignon]], France), and the [[Council of Pisa|Pisan]] line. The last-mentioned line was named after the town of Pisa, Italy, where the council that elected [[Pope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as a third claimant was held. To end the schism, in May 1415, the [[Council of Constance]] deposed [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] of the Pisan line, whose claim to legitimacy was based on a council's choice. [[Pope Gregory XII]] of the Roman line resigned in July 1415. In 1417, the Council also formally deposed [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] of the Avignon line, but he refused to resign. Afterwards, [[Pope Martin V]] was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to Benedict XIII. The scandal of the Great Schism created anti-papal sentiment, and fed into the [[Protestant Reformation]] at the turn of the 16th century.

The list of popes and antipopes in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' does not include Natalius (perhaps because of the uncertainty of the evidence), nor [[Antipope Clement VIII]]. It may be that the following of the latter was considered insufficiently significant, like that of &quot;Benedict XIV&quot;, who is mentioned along with him in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article on Pope Martin V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09725a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope Martin V&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As for [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester III]], sometimes listed as an antipope, the Holy See's ''Annuario Pontificio'' classifies him as a pope, not an antipope. In line with its above-quoted remark on the obscurities about the canon law of the time and the historical facts, especially in the mid-11th century (see the second paragraph of this article), it makes no judgement regarding the legitimacy of his takeover of the position of pope in 1045. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' places him in its ''List of Popes'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: List of Popes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though with the annotation: &quot;Considered by some to be an antipope&quot;. Until first years of 20th century, he was classified as an antipope, so [[Robert Hugh Benson]], in [[Lord of the World]], calls the Last Pope &quot;Sylvester III&quot;, not &quot;Sylvester IV&quot;. Benson calls Sylvester's predecessor &quot;John XXIV&quot; and not &quot;John XXIII&quot; because, in 1907, Pisan Antipopes Alexander V and John XXIII were considered true popes.

=== Quasi-cardinal-nephews ===

== Modern claimants to papacy ==
{{details|Conclavism}}

As well as antipopes, in the historical sense of the term, there have been and are people who, with a very limited following, ranging from very few to some hundred, claim to be Pope.

They thus do not fit the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'''s definition of &quot;antipope&quot;: &quot;one who opposes the legitimately elected Bishop of Rome, endeavours to secure the papal throne, and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-9007880/antipope Encyclopaedia Britannica, s.v. ''antipope'']&lt;/ref&gt; Except by their followers, whose number is minuscule, they are not regarded as serious claimants.

They are usually religious leaders of breakaway Roman Catholic groups that reject the commonly recognized popes ([[sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] groups). For this reason they are often called &quot;sedevacantist antipopes&quot;. Claiming to have elected a pope in a &quot;conclave&quot; of perhaps half a dozen laypeople, as in the case of [[David Bawden]], they hold that, because of their action, the See of Rome is no longer vacant, and that they are no longer sedevacantists ([[conclavism]]).

A significant number of them have taken the name Peter II, owing to [[Pope Peter II|its special significance]].

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] regards them as excommunicated [[schism (religion)|schism]]atics, and in some cases as [[Heresy|heretics]].

=== Collinites ===
{{details|Apostles of Infinite Love}}
* [[Michel Collin (antipope)|Michel Collin or Colin]] (Pope Clement XV), self-proclaimed (1950–1974) in France, founder of Order of the Mother of God (a name later changed to Apostles of Infinite Love)
* [[Jean-Gaston Tremblay]], Gregory XVII (1968–?), in [[Canada]]

=== Palmarian Catholic Church ===
{{details|Palmarian Catholic Church}}
* [[Clemente Domínguez y Gómez]] (Pope Gregory XVII), mystically self-proclaimed (1978–2005) in Spain
* [[Manuel Corral|Manuel Alonso Corral]] ([[Antipope Peter II|Pope Peter II]]), succeeded Gregory XVII  in 2005

The Palmarian Catholic Church regards [[Pope Paul VI]], whom they revere as a martyr, and his predecessors as true popes, but hold, on the grounds of claimed apparitions, that the Pope of Rome is excommunicated and that the position of the [[Holy See]] has, since 1978, been transferred to the See of [[El Palmar de Troya]].

=== Other examples ===
The following organised their elections by allegedly faithful Catholics, none of whom was a recognized [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. The smallest such [[papal conclave|conclave]] was attended by only three electors; the largest is claimed to have comprised more than sixty-one electors. Examples are:
* [[Mirko Fabris]] (Pope Krav I), (since 1978), elected in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]
* [[David Bawden]] (Pope Michael I), (since 1990) elected in [[Kansas]], [[United States|United States of America]]
* [[Lucian Pulvermacher]] (Pope Pius XIII) (1998–2009), elected in [[Montana]], [[United States|United States of America]] (see [[True Catholic Church]])
* [[Raphael Titus Otieno]] (since 2004), third of the [[Legio Maria]] popes (since 1962) of western [[Kenya]]
* [[Joaquín Llorens]] (Pope Alexander IX), (since 2005), elected in [[Elx]], Spain (see [http://iglemerci.jimdo.com/])
* '''Pope Leo XIV (2006)'''. On 24 March 2006 a group of 34 [[episcopi vagantes]] elected the Argentine Oscar Michaelli as ''Pope Leo XIV''. On his death on 14 February 2007, he was succeeded by Juan Bautista Bonetti, who took the name of '''Pope Innocent XIV''', but resigned on 29 May 2007. Alexander IX was chosen in his place. (see [http://icaremanente.blogspot.com])

== Fiction ==
Antipopes have appeared as fictional characters.  These may be either in [[historical fiction]], as fictional portraits of well-known historical antipopes or in the guise of imaginary antipopes.
* [[Jean Raspail]]'s novels of  — ''&quot;L'Anneau du pêcheur&quot;'' (The Fisherman's Ring) — and [[Gérard Bavoux]] — ''&quot;Le Porteur de lumière&quot;'' (The Light-bringer) feature two antipopes.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Raspail, &quot;L'Anneau du pêcheur,&quot; Paris: Albin Michel, 1994. 403 p. ISBN 2-226-07590-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Bavoux, &quot;Le Porteur de lumière,&quot; Paris: Pygmalion, 1996. 329 p. ISBN 2-85704-488-7&lt;/ref&gt; From two rather different perspectives these recount the fictional history of a parallel hierarchy, by which in secret French [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] nominated the true [[Pope]]. As it is told, the antipope Benedict XV', Pierre Tifane, was recognized as pope in Avignon from 1437 to 1470. His successor, the antipope Benedict XVI (not to be confused with the validly-elected 21st century [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), Jean Langlade, reigned there from 1470 to 1499. These books build on claims that Jean Carrier, the second [[antipope Benedict XIV]], nominated cardinals who were to continue this antipapal line, in the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]].
* [[Robert Rankin]]'s first part of his [[comic fantasy]] [[The Brentford Trilogy]] is called ''The Antipope'' and features the resurrected [[Pope Alexander VI]], the last [[Borgia]] pope.
* [[Walter M. Miller]]'s novel ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'' makes repeated reference to an &quot;Antipope Vissarion&quot;, leader of the Vissarionist Schism of ca. 3000 AD. Several popes in the sequel, the post-apocalyptical novel ''[[Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman]]'', are called antipopes during or after their papacies.
* The fictional synth-pop artist [[Zladko Vladcik]] claims to be &quot;The Anti-Pope&quot; in one of his songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYo5SHzIz5s &quot;Zladko &quot;Zlad!&quot; Vladcik's music video, &quot;I am the Antipope&quot;&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dan Simmons]]'s novels ''[[Endymion (Hyperion Cantos)|Endymion]]'' and ''[[Rise of Endymion]]'' feature a Father Paul Duré who is the routinely murdered antipope Teilhard I.
* [[S.M. Stirling]]'s  novel ''[[Dies the Fire]]'' and its sequels feature an antipope named Leo, who is set up by one of the surviving communities of Western Oregon after &quot;the Change&quot;.  After communications with Europe are reestablished, and the death of this antipope and his secular sponsor, his followers are reconciled with the Church.
* [[Ralph McInerny]]'s novel ''The Red Hat'' features a schism between liberals and conservatives following the election of a conservative African Pope; the liberal faction, taking as pretext the exclusion from a previous conclave of a number of cardinals who had been named but not formally appointed before the Pope's death, elect an Italian cardinal who calls himself &quot;Pius XIII&quot;.
* &quot;[[Fantastic Easter Special]]&quot;, an episode of the television series ''[[South Park]]'', depicts [[William A. Donohue]] of the [[American Catholic League]] as a megalomaniac extremist that takes over the Roman Catholic Church with an army of ninjas. While Pope [[Benedict XVI]] initially cooperates with Donohue, the Pope changes his mind after [[Jesus (South Park)|Jesus]] resurrects to deal with the situation. When Donohue sees that the Pope is willing to follow Jesus over himself, he has both Jesus and Benedict arrested and declares himself &quot;Pope Bill Donohue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people = Trey Parker, Matt Stone |date = 4 April 2007 |title = South Park |url = http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/103208 |medium = television series |accessdate = 11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aquaculture''', also known as '''aquafarming''', is the farming of aquatic organisms such as [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, [[mollusc]]s and [[aquatic plant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;providence1&quot;&gt;[http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/aquaculture/EnvironmentalImpact.html Environmental Impact of Aquaculture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aquaculture’s growth continuing: improved management techniques can reduce environmental effects of the practice.(UPDATE).” Resource: Engineering &amp; Technology for a Sustainable World 16.5 (2009): 20-22.

Web. 1 October 2009. &lt;http://find.galegroup.com/‌gtx/‌start.do?prodId=EAIM.&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions, and can be contrasted with [[commercial fishing]], which is the harvesting of [[wild fish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AmericanHeritageDef&quot;&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/aquaculture American Heritage Definition of Aquaculture]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariculture]] refers to aquaculture practised in marine environments.

The output, as reported, from aquaculture would supply one half of the fish and shellfish that is directly consumed by humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090907162320.htm Half Of Fish Consumed Globally Is Now Raised On Farms, Study Finds] ''Science Daily'', September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are issues about the reliability of the reported figures.&lt;ref name=overreporting /&gt; Further, in current aquaculture practice, products from several pounds of wild fish are used to produce one pound of a [[piscivorous]] fish like [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alliance&quot; /&gt;

Particular kinds of aquaculture include [[fish farming]], [[shrimp farm]]ing, [[oyster farming]], [[algaculture]] (such as [[seaweed farming]]), and the cultivation of [[ornamental fish]]. Particular methods include [[aquaponics]], which integrates fish farming and plant farming.

==History==

The indigenous [[Gunditjmara]] people in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] may have raised eels as early as 6000&amp;nbsp;BC. There is evidence that they developed about {{convert|100|km2|sqmi}} of volcanic [[floodplain]]s in the vicinity of [[Lake Condah]] into a complex of channels and [[dam]]s, that they used woven [[Fishing trap|traps]] to capture [[eel]]s, and that capturing and smoking eels supported them year round.&lt;ref&gt;

Early aquaculturists fed their brood using [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] and [[silkworm]] feces, and ate them. A fortunate [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] of [[Common carp|carp]] led to the emergence of [[goldfish]] during the [[Tang Dynasty]].

[[Japan]]ese cultivated [[seaweed]] by providing [[bamboo]] poles and, later, nets and [[oyster]] shells to serve as anchoring surfaces for [[spores]].

Improvements in transportation during the 19th century made fish easily available and inexpensive, even in inland areas, making aquaculture less popular.

[[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] constructed oceanic [[fish pond]]s (see [[Hawaiian aquaculture]]). A remarkable example is a fish pond dating from at least 1,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, at Alekoko. Legend says that it was constructed by the mythical [[Menehune]] dwarf people.

In 1859 Stephen Ainsworth of [[West Bloomfield, New York]], began experiments with [[brook trout]]. By 1864 Seth Green had established a commercial fish hatching operation at Caledonia Springs, near [[Rochester, New York]]. By 1866, with the involvement of Dr. W. W. Fletcher of [[Concord, Massachusetts]], artificial fish hatcheries were under way in both [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;

==21st century practice==
About 430 (97%) of the [[species]] cultured as of 2007 were domesticated during the 20th century, of which an estimated 106 came in the decade to 2007. Given the long-term importance of agriculture, it is interesting to note that to date only 0.08% of known land plant species and 0.0002% of known land animal species have been domesticated, compared with 0.17% of known marine plant species and 0.13% of known marine animal species. Domestication typically involves about a decade of scientific research.&lt;ref name=DuarteMarbaHolmer&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;316/5823/382&lt;/ref&gt; Domesticating aquatic species involve fewer risks to humans than land animals, which took a large toll in human lives. Most major human diseases originated in domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{

Aquaculture is an especially important economic activity in China.

In 2005, China accounted for 70% of world production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/fish.html Wired 12.05: The Bluewater Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A31159-2005Jan23 | work=The Washington Post | title=Fish Farming's Bounty Isn't Without Barbs | first=Juliet | last=Eilperin | date=2005-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaculture is also currently one of the fastest growing areas of food production in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;providence1&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!--This is obsolete. See intro. Today, about half of the fish and shrimp consumed are harvested from aqua-farms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1841778_1841782_1841792,00.html Heroes of the Environment 2008: Jurgenne Primavera] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' special report. September 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;Approximately 90% of all U.S. shrimp consumption is farmed and imported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5600e/y5600e00.HTM The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA) 2004] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years [[salmon]] aquaculture has become a major export in southern [[Chile]], especially in [[Puerto Montt]], Chile's fastest-growing city.

==Over reporting==
China overwhelmingly dominates the world in reported aquaculture output.&lt;ref name=ChinaStats&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.allcountries.org/china_statistics/13_22_output_of_aquatic_products.html |title=Output of Aquatic Products |work=China Statistics |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They report a total output which is double that of the rest of the world put together. However, there are issues with the accuracy of China's returns.

In 2001, the fisheries scientists Reg Watson and [[Daniel Pauly]] expressed concerns in a letter to ''Nature'', that China was over reporting its catch from wild fisheries in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=overreporting&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Watson, Reg and Pauly, Daniel | year = 2001 | title = [http://www.mindfully.org/Water/Fish-Catch-Distortions.htm ''Systematic distortions in world Fisheries catch trends''] Letter to | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 414 | issue = | page = 534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Helen (2001) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6863/full/414477b.html ''China caught out as model shows net fall in fish''] Nature 414, 477. doi 10.1038/35107216&lt;/ref&gt; They said that made it appear that the global catch since 1988 was increasing annually by 300,000 tonnes, whereas it was really shrinking annually by 350,000 tonnes. Watson and Pauly suggested this may be related to China policies where state entities that monitor the economy are also tasked with increasing output. Also, until recently, the promotion of Chinese officials was based on production increases from their own areas.&lt;ref&gt;Heilprin, John (2001) [http://www.seaaroundus.org/OtherWebsites/2001/CaliforniaFish_29Nov01.pdf Chinese Misreporting Masks Dramatic Decline In Ocean Fish Catches] ''Associated Press'', 29 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reville, William (2002) [http://www.seaaroundus.org/newspapers/2002/IrishTimes_14Mar02.pdf Something fishy about the figures] ''The Irish Times'', 14 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

China disputes this claim. The official [[Xinhua News Agency]] quoted Yang Jian, director general of the Agriculture Ministry's Bureau of Fisheries, as saying that China's figures were &quot;basically correct&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaaroundus.org/OtherWebsites/2001/WorldCatch_17Dec01.pdf China disputes claim it over reports fish catch] ''Associate Press'', 17 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[FAO]] accepts there are issues with the reliability of China's statistical returns, and currently treats data from China, including the aquaculture data, apart from the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]] (2006) [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0699e/a0699e.pdf The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOPHIA)], Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/FIELD/006/Y3354M/Y3354M00.HTM Fishery statistics: Reliability and policy implications] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
===Mariculture===
{{Main|Mariculture}}
[[Mariculture]] is the term used for the cultivation of marine organisms in [[seawater]], usually in sheltered coastal waters. In particular, the farming of marine fish is an example of mariculture, and so also is the farming of marine crustaceans (such as [[shrimp]]s), molluscs (such as [[oysters]]) and seaweed.

===Integrated===
{{Main|Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture}}
[[Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture]] (IMTA) is a practice in which the by-products (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, [[food]]) for another. Fed aquaculture (for example, [[fish]], [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive (for example, [[seaweed]]) and organic extractive (for example, [[shellfish]]) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopin et al. 2001&quot;&gt;Chopin T, Buschmann AH, Halling C, Troell M, Kautsky N, Neori A, Kraemer GP, Zertuche-Gonzalez JA, Yarish C and Neefus C. 2001. Integrating seaweeds into marine aquaculture systems: a key toward sustainability. Journal of Phycology 37: 975-986.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Multi-Trophic&quot; refers to the incorporation of [[species]] from different [[trophic level|trophic]] or [[nutritional]] levels in the same system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopin 2006&quot;&gt;Chopin T. 2006. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. What it is, and why you should care... and don’t confuse it with polyculture. Northern Aquaculture, Vol. 12, No. 4, July/August 2006, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one potential distinction from the age-old practice of aquatic [[polyculture]], which could simply be the co-culture of different fish species from the same trophic level. In this case, these organisms may all share the same biological and chemical processes, with few [[synergy|synergistic]] benefits, which could potentially lead to significant shifts in the [[ecosystem]]. Some traditional polyculture systems may, in fact, incorporate a greater diversity of species, occupying several [[Ecological niche|niches]], as extensive cultures (low intensity, low management) within the same pond. The &quot;Integrated&quot; in IMTA refers to the more intensive cultivation of the different species in proximity of each other, connected by nutrient and energy transfer through water.

Ideally, the biological and chemical processes in an IMTA system should balance. This is achieved through the appropriate selection and proportions of different species providing different ecosystem functions. The co-cultured species are typically more than just [[biofilters]]; they are harvestable crops of commercial value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopin 2006&quot;/&gt; A working IMTA system can result in greater total production based on mutual benefits to the co-cultured species and improved [[ecosystem health]], even if the production of individual species is lower than in a [[monoculture]] over a short term period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neori et al. 2004&quot;&gt;Neori A, Chopin T, Troell M, Buschmann AH, Kraemer GP, Halling C, Shpigel M and Yarish C. 2004. Integrated aquaculture: rationale, evolution and state of the art emphasizing seaweed biofiltration in modern mariculture. Aquaculture 231: 361-391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term &quot;Integrated Aquaculture&quot; is used to describe the integration of monocultures through water transfer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neori et al. 2004&quot;/&gt; For all intents and purposes however, the terms &quot;IMTA&quot; and &quot;integrated aquaculture&quot; differ only in their degree of descriptiveness. [[Aquaponics]], fractionated aquaculture, IAAS (integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems), IPUAS (integrated peri-urban-aquaculture systems), and IFAS (integrated fisheries-aquaculture systems) are other variations of the IMTA concept.

==Species groups==
===Fish===
{{Main|Fish farming}}
The farming of fish is the most common form of aquaculture. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks, ponds, or ocean enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational [[fishing]] or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish [[hatchery]]. Fish species raised by fish farms include [[salmon]], [[bigeye tuna]], [[carp]], [[tilapia]], [[catfish]] and [[cod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the Mediterranean, young [[bluefin tuna]] are netted at sea and towed slowly towards the shore. They are then interned in offshore pens where they are further grown for the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055[0301:DWSTBF]2.0.CO;2 | author = Volpe, J. | year = 2005 | title = Dollars without sense: The bait for big-money tuna ranching around the world | url = | journal = [[BioScience]] | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 301–302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, researchers in [[Australia]] managed for the first time to coax tuna ([[Southern bluefin tuna|Southern bluefin]]) to breed in landlocked tanks.

Commercial [[shrimp]] farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply thereafter.

[[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 07:10, 17 October 2005 (UTC) --&gt; [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]]. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in [[Asia]], in particular in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Thailand]]. The other 25% is produced mainly in [[Latin America]], where [[Brazil]] is the largest producer. Thailand is the largest exporter.

Shrimp farming has changed from its traditional, small-scale form in [[Southeast Asia]] into a global industry. Technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area, and [[broodstock]] is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are [[penaeid]]s (i.e., shrimp of the [[family (biology)|family]] ''[[Penaeidae]]''), and just two species of shrimp, the [[Whiteleg shrimp|Pacific white shrimp]] and the [[giant tiger prawn]], account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to [[disease]], which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing [[ecology|ecological]] problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations. In 1999, governments, industry representatives, and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] practices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The global annual production of freshwater prawns (excluding [[crayfish]] and [[crab]]s) in 2003 was about 280,000 [[tonne]]s of which China produced 180,000 tonnes followed by India and Thailand with 35,000 tonnes each.

===Molluscs===
[[File:Abalone-farm1web.jpg|thumb|right|Abalone farm]]
{{See also|Oyster farming}}
[[Abalone]] farming began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fishtech.com/abaloneinfo.html| title=Abalone Farming Information| accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s, this industry has become increasingly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,49847,00.html| title=Abalone Farming on a Boat| accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-fishing and [[poaching]] have reduced wild populations to the extent that farmed abalone now supplies most abalone meat.

===Echinoderms===
Commercially harvested [[echinoderm]]s include [[sea cucumber]]s and [[sea urchin]]s. In China, [[sea cucumber]]s are farmed in artificial ponds as large as {{convert|1000|acre}}.&lt;ref name=NF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalfisherman.com/2008.asp?ItemID=1800&amp;pcid=373&amp;cid=375&amp;archive=yes |author=Ess, Charlie |title=Wild product’s versatility could push price beyond $2 for Alaska dive fleet |publisher=National Fisherman |accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algae===

{{See also|Algaculture|Seaweed farming}}

[[Microalgae]], also referred to as [[phytoplankton]], [[microphytes]], or [[planktonic algae]] constitute the majority of cultivated [[algae]].

[[Macroalgae]], commonly known as [[seaweed]], also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and specific requirements, they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild.

==Issues==
{{See also|Aquaculture of salmon#Issues|l1=Issues with salmon aquaculture}}
Aquaculture can be more environmentally damaging than exploiting [[wild fisheries of the world|wild fisheries]] on a local area basis but has considerably less impact on the global environment on a per kg of production basis.&lt;ref&gt;
Diamond, Jared. Collapse: How societies choose to fail or succeed. Viking Press, 2005. pgs. 479-485&lt;/ref&gt; Local concerns include waste handling, side-effects of [[antibiotic]]s, competition between farmed and wild animals, and using other fish to feed more marketable [[carnivorous]] fish. However, research and commercial feed improvements during the 1990s &amp; 2000s have lessened many of these.&lt;ref&gt;
Costa-Pierce, B.A., Author/Editor. 2002. Ecological Aquaculture. Blackwell Science, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish waste is organic and composed of nutrients necessary in all components of aquatic food webs. In-ocean aquaculture often produces much higher {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} than normal fish waste concentrations. The waste collects on the ocean bottom, damaging or eliminating bottom-dwelling life. Waste can also decrease [[dissolved oxygen]] levels in the [[water column]], putting further pressure on wild animals{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

===Fish oils===
The nutritional value of farm-raised [[tilapia]] may be compromised due to the amount of [[maize|corn]] included in the feed. Corn contains short chain [[omega-6]] [[fatty acid]]s that contribute to the buildup of these materials in the fish. &quot;Ratios of long-chain omega-6 to long-chain omega-3, AA to EPA respectively, in tilapia averaged about 11:1, compared to much less than 1:1 (indicating more EPA than AA) in both salmon and trout.&quot; The US produced 1.5 million [[ton]]s of tilapia in 2005, with 2.5 million projected by 2010 {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Widespread publicity encouraging fish consumption has led to increases in tilapia consumption by those with lower incomes who are trying to eat a balanced diet. The lower amounts of omega-3 and the higher ratios of omega-6 compounds in farmed tilapia raise questions of the health benefits of consuming this fish.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center]] (2008, July 10). [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080708092228.htm ''Popular Fish, Tilapia, Contains Potentially Dangerous Fatty Acid Combination'']. ScienceDaily. Retrieved July 11, 2008, from [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080708092228.htm www.sciencedaily.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate diets for salmon and other carnivorous fish can be formulated from protein sources such as [[soy]], although soy-based diets may also change in the balance between [[omega-6]] and [[omega-3]] fatty acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Espe et al. 2006&quot;&gt;
Espe, M., A. Lemme, A. Petei, and A. El-Mowafi. 2006. Can Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'') grow on diets devoid of fish meal? Aquaculture 255:255-262&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts on wild fish===
Salmon farming currently leads to a high demand for wild [[forage fish]]. Fish do not actually produce omega-3 fatty acids, but instead accumulate them from either consuming [[microalgae]] that produce these fatty acids, as is the case with forage fish like [[herring]] and [[sardines]], or, as is the case with fatty predatory fish, like salmon, by eating prey fish that have accumulated [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s from microalgae. To satisfy this requirement, more than 50 percent of the world [[fish oil]] production is fed to farmed salmon.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture 2008: [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0250e/i0250e03.pdf Highlights of Special Studies] Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, as carnivores, salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, protein which is often supplied to them in the form of forage fish. Consequently, farmed salmon consume more [[wild fish]] than they generate as a final product. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them. As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when seventy five percent of the worlds monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their [[maximum sustainable yield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alliance&quot;&gt;[[Seafood Choices Alliance]] (2005) [http://www.seafoodchoices.com/resources/afishianado_pdfs/Salmon_Spring05.pdf It's all about salmon]&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming then impacts the survivability of the wild predator fish who rely on them for food.

Fish can escape from coastal pens, where they can interbreed with their wild counterparts, diluting wild genetic stocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Oceans/Aquaculture/Salmon/ David Suzuki Foundation: Open-net-cage fish farming]&lt;/ref&gt; Escaped fish can become [[invasive species|invasive]], out competing native species.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Aquaculture of salmon|Salmon farms]] are typically sited in pristine coastal ecosystems which they then pollute. A farm with 200,000 salmon discharges more fecal waste than a city of 60,000 people. This waste is discharged directly into the surrounding aquatic environment, untreated, often containing antibiotics and [[pesticide]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alliance&quot;/&gt; There is also an accumulation of [[heavy metals]] on the [[benthos]] (seafloor) near the salmon farms, particularly [[copper]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO coho&quot;&gt;

Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using [[polyculture]] techniques, and properly sited facilities (for example, offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects.

Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) recycle water by circulating it through filters to remove fish waste and food and then recirculating it back into the tanks.  This saves water and the waste gathered can be used in [[compost]] or, in some cases, could even be treated and used on land. While RAS was developed with freshwater fish in mind, scientist associated with the [[Agricultural Research Service]] have found a way to rear saltwater fish using RAS in low-salinity waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service
|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although saltwater fish are raised in off-shore cages or caught with nets in water that typically has a salinity of 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt), scientists were able to produce healthy pompano, a saltwater fish, in tanks with a salinity of only 5 ppt. Commercializing low-salinity RAS are predicted to have positive environmental and economical effects. Unwanted nutrients from the fish food would not be added to the ocean and the risk of transmitting diseases between wild and farm-raised fish would greatly be reduced. The price of expensive saltwater fish, such as the pompano and combia used in the experiments, would be reduced. However, before any of this can be done researchers must study every aspect of the fish’s lifecycle, including the amount of ammonia and nitrate the fish will tolerate in the water, what to feed the fish during each stage of its lifecycle, the [[stocking rate]] that will produce the healthiest fish, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!&quot;/&gt;

In [[algorithmic information theory]] (a subfield of [[computer science]]), the '''Kolmogorov complexity''' of an object, such as a piece of text, is a measure of the [[computation]]al resources needed to specify the object. It is named after Soviet Russian mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].

Kolmogorov complexity is also known as '''descriptive complexity''', '''Kolmogorov–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] complexity''', '''stochastic complexity''', '''algorithmic entropy''', or '''program-size complexity'''.

For example, consider the following two [[string (computer science)|strings]] of length 64, each containing only lowercase letters, digits, and spaces:

&lt;pre&gt;abababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab
4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7uraqujxdppa0q7nieieqe9noc4cvafzf&lt;/pre&gt;

The first string has a short English-language description, namely &quot;ab 32 times&quot;, which consists of 11 characters. The second one has no obvious simple description (using the same character set) other than writing down the string itself, which has 64 characters.

Simply storing the 24-bit color of each pixel in this image would require 1.62 million bits; but a small computer program can reproduce these 1.62 million bits using the definition of the Mandelbrot set. Thus, the Kolmogorov complexity of the raw file encoding this bitmap is much less than 1.62 million.]]

More formally, the [[complexity]] of a string is the length of the string's shortest description in some fixed [[Turing complete|universal]] [[description language]].  The sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below. It can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself.  Strings whose  Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size are not considered to be complex.
The notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and  [[halting problem|Turing's halting problem]].

==Definition==
To define Kolmogorov complexity, we must first specify a description language for strings.  Such a description language can be based on any programming language, such as  [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], or [[Java Virtual Machine]] bytecode.  If '''P''' is a program which outputs a string ''x'', then '''P''' is a description of ''x''. The length of the description is just the length of '''P''' as a character string.  In determining the length  of '''P''', the lengths of any subroutines used in '''P''' must be accounted for.  The length of any integer constant ''n'' which occurs in the program '''P''' is  the number of bits required to represent ''n'', that is (roughly) log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''.

We could alternatively choose an encoding for [[Turing machine]]s, where an ''encoding'' is a function  which associates to each Turing Machine  '''M''' a bitstring &lt;'''M'''&gt;.  If '''M''' is a Turing Machine which on input ''w'' outputs string ''x'', then the concatenated string &lt;'''M'''&gt; ''w'' is a description of ''x''. For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature. The [[binary lambda calculus]] may provide the simplest definition of complexity yet. In this article we will use an informal approach.

Any string ''s'' has at least one description, namely the program

  '''function''' GenerateFixedString()
     '''return''' ''s''

If a description of ''s'', ''d''(''s''), is of minimal length—i.e. it uses the fewest number of characters—it is called a '''minimal description''' of ''s''.  Then the length of ''d''(''s'')—i.e. the number of characters in the description—is the '''Kolmogorov complexity''' of ''s'', written ''K''(''s'').  Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;K(s) = |d(s)|. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

We now consider how the choice of description language affects the value of ''K'' and show that the effect of changing the description language is bounded.

'''Theorem'''. If ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the complexity functions relative to description languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then there is a constant ''c'' (which depends only  on the languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) such that
: &lt;math&gt;\forall s\  |K_1(s) - K_2(s)| \leq c.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''. By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant ''c'' such that for all bitstrings ''s'',
: &lt;math&gt; K_1(s) \leq K_2(s) + c. &lt;/math&gt;

Now, suppose there is a program in the language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which acts as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

   '''function''' InterpretLanguage('''string''' ''p'')

where ''p'' is a program in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The interpreter is characterized by the following property:

: Running InterpretLanguage on input ''p'' returns the result of running ''p''.

Thus if '''P''' is a program in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  which is a minimal description of ''s'', then InterpretLanguage('''P''') returns the string ''s''. The length of this description of ''s'' is the sum of
# The length of the program InterpretLanguage, which we can take to be the constant ''c''.
# The length of '''P''' which by definition is ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'').

This proves the desired upper bound.

==History and context==
[[Algorithmic information theory]] is the area of computer science that studies Kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings (or other [[data structure]]s).

The concept and theory of Kolmogorov Complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by [[Ray Solomonoff]] who published it in 1960, describing it in &quot;A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Ray Solomonoff | last=Solomonoff |first= Ray | url=http://world.std.com/~rjs/rayfeb60.pdf |format=PDF | title=A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference | journal= Report V-131 |publisher= Zator Co. |location= Cambridge, Ma. | date= February 4, 1960 }} [http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf revision], Nov., 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his invention of [[algorithmic probability]]. He gave a more complete description in his 1964 publications, &quot;A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference,&quot; Part 1 and Part 2 in ''Information and Control''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(64)90223-2 | last=Solomonoff |first= Ray | title=A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference Part I | journal = Information and Control | url=http://world.std.com/~rjs/1964pt1.pdf |volume=7 |issue= 1 |pages= 1&amp;ndash;22 | month= March | year=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(64)90131-7 | last=Solomonoff |first= Ray | title=A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference Part II | journal = Information and Control | url=http://world.std.com/~rjs/1964pt2.pdf |volume=7 |issue= 2 |pages= 224&amp;ndash;254 | month=June | year=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrey Kolmogorov]] later [[multiple discovery|independently published]] this theorem in ''Problems Inform. Transmission'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume= 1| issue=1 |year=1965 | pages= 1–7 | title =Three Approaches to the Quantitative Definition of Information  | url=http://www.ece.umd.edu/~abarg/ppi/contents/1-65-abstracts.html#1-65.2 | journal = Problems Inform. Transmission | first=A.N. | last=Kolmogoro }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Chaitin]] also presents this theorem in ''J. ACM''; Chaitin's paper was submitted October 1966, revised in December 1968 and cites both Solomonoff's and Kolmogorov's papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaitin | first1 = Gregory J. | title = On the Simplicity and Speed of Programs for Computing Infinite Sets of Natural Numbers| url=http://reference.kfupm.edu.sa/content/o/n/on_the_simplicity_and_speed_of_programs__94483.pdf | format=PDF | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 16 | pages = 407 | year = 1969 | doi = 10.1145/321526.321530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem says that among algorithms that decode strings from their descriptions (codes) there exists an optimal one. This algorithm, for all strings, allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms, but not on the strings themselves. Solomonoff used this algorithm, and the code lengths it allows, to define a string's `universal probability' on which inductive inference of a string's subsequent digits can be based. Kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings: complexity, randomness, and information.

When Kolmogorov became aware of Solomonoff's work, he acknowledged Solomonoff's priority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kolmogorov | first1=A. | title=Logical basis for information theory and probability theory | journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume=14|issue=5 | pages=662–664 | year=1968 | doi =10.1109/TIT.1968.1054210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was concerned with randomness of a sequence while Algorithmic Probability became associated with Solomonoff, who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal a priori probability distribution.

There are several other variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information. The most widely used one is based on [[self-delimiting program]]s and is mainly due to [[Leonid Levin]] (1974).

An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (Burgin 1982).

Some consider that naming the concept &quot;Kolmogorov complexity&quot; is an example of the [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Basic results==
In the following discussion let  ''K''(''s'') be the complexity of the string ''s''.

It is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself: the program GenerateFixedString above that outputs ''s'' is a fixed amount larger than ''s''.

'''Theorem'''. There is a constant ''c'' such that
:&lt;math&gt; \forall s \ K(s) \leq |s| + c. \quad  &lt;/math&gt;

===Incomputability of Kolmogorov complexity===
The first result is that there is no way to effectively compute ''K''.

'''Theorem'''.  ''K'' is not a [[computable function]].

In other words, there is no program which takes a string ''s'' as input and produces the integer  ''K''(''s'') as output.  We show this by contradiction by making a program that creates a string that should only be able to be created by a longer program. Suppose there is a program

   '''function''' KolmogorovComplexity('''string''' ''s'')

that takes as input a string ''s'' and returns ''K''(''s''). Now consider the program

   '''function''' GenerateComplexString('''int''' ''n'')
      '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' infinity:
         '''for each''' string s '''of''' length exactly i
            '''if''' KolmogorovComplexity(''s'') &gt;= ''n''
               '''return''' ''s''
               '''quit'''

This program calls KolmogorovComplexity as a subroutine.  This program tries every string, starting with the shortest, until it finds a string with complexity at least ''n'', then returns that string. Therefore, given any positive integer ''n'', it produces a string with Kolmogorov complexity at least as great as ''n''. The program itself has a fixed length ''U''. The input to the program GenerateComplexString is an integer ''n''; here, the size of ''n'' is measured by the number of bits required to represent ''n'' which is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''). Now consider the following program:

   '''function''' GenerateParadoxicalString()
       '''return''' GenerateComplexString(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)

This program calls GenerateComplexString as a subroutine and also has a free parameter
''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This program outputs a string ''s'' whose complexity is at least ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  By an auspicious choice of the parameter ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; we will arrive at a contradiction.  To choose this value, note ''s'' is described by the  program GenerateParadoxicalString whose length is at most

:&lt;math&gt; U + \log_2(n_0) + C  \quad &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the &quot;overhead&quot; added by the program GenerateParadoxicalString. Since ''n'' grows faster than log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), there exists a value  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt; U + \log_2(n_0) + C &lt; n_0. \quad &lt;/math&gt;
But this contradicts the definition of ''s'' having a complexity at least ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.   That is, by the definition of ''K''(''s''), the string ''s'' returned by GenerateParadoxicalString is only supposed to be able to be generated by a program of length ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or longer, but GenerateParadoxicalString is shorter than ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus the  program named &quot;KolmogorovComplexity&quot; cannot actually computably find the complexity of arbitrary strings.

This is proof by contradiction where the contradiction is similar to the [[Berry paradox]]: &quot;Let ''n'' be the smallest positive integer that cannot be defined in fewer than twenty English words.&quot;  It is also possible to show the uncomputability of K by reduction from the uncomputability of the [[halting problem]] H, since K and H are [[turing degree|Turing-equivalent]].[http://www.daimi.au.dk/~bromille/DC05/Kolmogorov.pdf]

In the programming languages community there is a corollary known as the [[full employment theorem]], stating there is no perfect size-optimizing compiler.

===Chain rule for Kolmogorov complexity===

{{Main| Chain rule for Kolmogorov complexity}}

The chain rule for Kolmogorov complexity states that

:&lt;math&gt; K(X,Y) = K(X) + K(Y|X) + O(\log(K(X,Y))).\quad&lt;/math&gt;

It states that the shortest program that reproduces ''X'' and ''Y'' is [[Big-O notation|no more]] than a logarithmic term larger than a program to reproduce ''X'' and a program to reproduce ''Y'' given ''X''. Using this statement one can define [[Mutual information#Absolute mutual information|an analogue of mutual information for Kolmogorov complexity]].

==Compression==
It is straightforward to compute upper bounds for &lt;math&gt;K(s)&lt;/math&gt;: simply [[data compression|compress]] the string &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; with some method, implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language, concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string, and measure the resulting string's length.

A string ''s'' is compressible by a number ''c'' if it has a description whose length does not exceed  &lt;math&gt;|s|-c&lt;/math&gt;.  This is equivalent to saying &lt;math&gt;K(s) \le |s|-c&lt;/math&gt;.  Otherwise ''s'' is incompressible by ''c''. A string incompressible by 1 is said to be simply ''incompressible''; by the [[pigeonhole principle]], [[incompressible string]]s must exist, since there are &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; bit strings of length ''n'' but only 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 shorter strings, that is strings of length less than ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;As there is {{nobr|1=''N''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''L''&lt;/sup&gt;}} strings of length ''L'', the number of strings of lengths {{nowrap|1=''L''=0..(n−1)}} is {{nobr|''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{nobr|2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is a finite [[geometric series]] with sum {{nobr|2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} = {{nobr|1 = 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; × (1 − 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) / (1 − 2) = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same reason, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed: &lt;math&gt;K(s)&lt;/math&gt; is not much smaller than &lt;math&gt;|s|&lt;/math&gt;, the length of ''s'' in bits.  To make this precise, fix a value of ''n''.  There are &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; bitstrings of length ''n''. The [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform]] [[probability]] distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight &lt;math&gt;2^{-n}&lt;/math&gt; to each string of length ''n''.

'''Theorem'''. With the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length ''n'', the probability that a string is incompressible by ''c'' is at least &lt;math&gt;1-2^{-c+1}+2^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;.

To prove the theorem, note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding &lt;math&gt;n-c&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[geometric series]]:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-c} = 2^{n-c+1}-1.\ &lt;/math&gt;

There remain at least

:&lt;math&gt; 2^n-2^{n-c+1}+1\ &lt;/math&gt;

many bitstrings of length ''n'' that are incompressible by ''c''.  To determine the probability divide by &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Chaitin's incompleteness theorem==
We know that, in the set of all possible strings, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly &quot;compressed&quot; way. However, it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proved,  if the string's complexity is above a certain threshold. The precise formalization is as follows. First fix a particular [[axiomatic system]] '''S''' for the [[natural number]]s.  The axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that to certain assertions  '''A''' about complexity of strings one can associate a formula '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; in '''S'''.  This association must have the following property: if '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; is  provable from the axioms of '''S''', then the corresponding assertion '''A''' is true. This &quot;formalization&quot;  can be achieved either by an artificial encoding such as a [[Gödel numbering]] or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of '''S'''.

'''Theorem'''. There exists a constant ''L'' (which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language) such that there does not exist a string ''s'' for which the statement
: &lt;math&gt; K(s) \geq  L \quad &lt;/math&gt;
(as formalized in '''S''') can be proven within the axiomatic system '''S'''.

Note that by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings, the vast majority of those statements must be true.

The proof of this result is modeled on a self-referential construction used in [[Berry's paradox]]. The proof is by contradiction. If the theorem were false, then

:'''Assumption (X)''': For any integer ''n'' there exists a string ''s'' for which there is a proof in '''S''' of the formula &quot;''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''&quot; (which we assume can be formalized in '''S''').

We can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in '''S''' by some procedure

   '''function''' NthProof('''int''' ''n'')
which takes as input ''n'' and outputs some proof. This function
enumerates all proofs. Some of these are proofs for formulas we do not
care about here (examples of proofs which will be listed by the procedure NthProof are the various known proofs of the [[law of quadratic reciprocity]], those of [[Fermat's little theorem]] or the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] all translated into the formal language of '''S'''). Some of these are complexity formulas of the form ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n'' where ''s'' and ''n'' are constants in the language of '''S'''. There is a program

   '''function''' NthProofProvesComplexityFormula('''int''' ''n'')

which determines whether the ''n''th proof actually proves
a complexity formula ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L''. The strings ''s'' and
the integer ''L'' in turn are computable by programs:

   '''function''' StringNthProof('''int''' ''n'')

   '''function''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof('''int''' ''n'')

Consider the following program

   '''function''' GenerateProvablyComplexString('''int''' ''n'')
      '''for''' i = 1 to infinity:
         '''if'''  NthProofProvesComplexityFormula(i) '''and''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof(i) ≥ ''n''
            '''return''' StringNthProof(''i'')
            '''quit'''

Given an ''n'', this program tries every proof until it finds a string
and a proof in the [[formal system]] '''S''' of the formula ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L'' for some ''L''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''. The program
terminates by our '''Assumption (X)'''. Now this program has a length ''U''.
There is an integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''C'' is the overhead cost of

    '''function''' GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString()
       '''return''' GenerateProvablyComplexString(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)
       '''quit'''

The program GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString outputs a string ''s'' for which there exists an ''L'' such that ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L'' can be formally proved in '''S''' with ''L''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular  ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;
''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is true. However, ''s'' is also described by a program of length
''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C''  so its complexity is less than ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This contradiction proves '''Assumption (X)''' cannot hold.

Similar ideas are used to prove the properties of [[Chaitin's constant]].

==Minimum message length==
The [[minimum message length]] principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|C.S. Wallace]] and D.M. Boulton in 1968.  MML is [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] (it incorporates prior beliefs) and
information-theoretic.  It has the desirable properties of statistical
invariance (the inference transforms with a re-parametrisation, such as from
polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates), statistical consistency (even
for very hard problems, MML will converge to any underlying model) and efficiency (the MML model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible).  C.S. Wallace and D.L. Dowe (1999) showed a formal connection between MML and algorithmic information theory (or Kolmogorov complexity).

==Kolmogorov randomness==
:{{See also|algorithmically random sequence}}
''Kolmogorov randomness'' (also called ''algorithmic randomness'') defines a [[string (computer science)|string]] (usually of [[bit]]s) as being [[randomness|random]] if and only if it is shorter than any [[computer program]] that can produce that string. This definition of randomness is critically dependent on the definition of Kolmogorov complexity. To make this definition complete, a computer has to be specified, usually a [[Turing machine]]. According to the above definition of randomness, a random string is also an &quot;incompressible&quot; string, in the sense that it is impossible to give a representation of the string using a program whose length is shorter than the length of the string itself. However, according to this definition, most strings shorter than a certain length end up to be (Chaitin-Kolmogorovically) random because the best one can do with very small strings is to write a program that simply prints these strings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''Hymn to Proserpine'''&quot; is a [[poetry|poem]] by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], published in 1866. The poem is addressed to the [[goddess]] [[Proserpina]], the Roman equivalent of [[Persephone]].

The [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] at the beginning of the poem is the phrase ''Vicisti, Galilaee'', [[Latin]] for &quot;You have conquered, O Galilean&quot;, the apocryphal [[Wikiquote:Last words|dying words]] of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]].  He had tried to reverse the official endorsement of [[Christianity]] by the [[Roman Empire]].  The poem is cast in the form of a [[lament]] by a person professing the [[paganism]] of [[classical antiquity]] and lamenting its passing, and expresses regret at the rise of [[Christianity]]. Lines 35 and 36 express this best:

:''Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath;''
:''We have drunken of things [[Lethe]]an, and fed on the fullness of death.''

The line &quot;Time and the Gods are at strife&quot; inspired the title of [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''Time and the Gods''.

The poem is quoted by Sue Bridehead in [[Thomas Hardy]]'s 1895 novel, ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'' and also by Edward Ashburnham in [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Triumph of Time''' is a poem by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], published in [[1866]]. It is in adapted [[ottava rima]] and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly [[alliteration]]. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The (male) speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of ''[[Hamlet]]'', craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.

'''''The Triumph of Time''''' is also the US title of [[James Blish]]'s novel ''A Clash of Cymbals''.

'''Alfred the Great''' ({{lang-ang|Ælfrēd'', ''Ælfrǣd}}, &quot;elf counsel&quot;; 849 – 26 October 899) was King of [[Wessex]] from 871 to 899. 

Alfred is noted for his defence of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of southern England against the [[Vikings]], becoming the only [[English people|English]] monarch still to be accorded the [[epithet]] &quot;the Great&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cnut the Great]], who ruled England from 1016 to 1035, was [[Danish people|Danish]].&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred was the first [[List of monarchs of Wessex|King of the West Saxons]] to style himself &quot;King of the Anglo-Saxons&quot;. Details of his life are described in a work by the [[10th century in England|10th century]] [[Welsh people|Welsh]] scholar and bishop [[Asser]]. Alfred was a learned man who encouraged education and improved his kingdom's [[law|legal]] system and [[military]] structure. He is regarded as a [[saint]] by some [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], but has never been officially canonized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1262 St. Alfred the Great, Catholic Online], [http://en.allexperts.com/q/British-History-3243/Alfred-Great.htm British History, Alfred the Great]; Some [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians believe that Alfred should be recognised as a saint. See [http://www.orthodoxengland.org.uk/athlifea.htm Case for] and [http://sarisburium.blogspot.com/2008/11/king-alfred-of-england-orthodox-saint.html Case against]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglican Communion]] venerates him as a [[Saints in Anglicanism|Christian hero]], with a [[feast day]] of 26 October,{{sfn|Gross|1990|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2010}}}} and he may often be found depicted in [[stained glass]] in [[Church of England parish church]]es.

==Childhood==
[[File:Prince Alfred on his first boar-hunt.gif|thumb|left|Prince Alfred on his first boar-hunt.]]
[[File:Queen Osburga reads for her son, Alfred.gif|thumb|right|Queen [[Osburga]] reads for her son Alfred, who would become Alfred the Great.]]
{{See|House of Wessex family tree}}
Alfred was born in the village of Wanating, now [[Wantage]], [[Oxfordshire]]. He was the youngest son of King [[Æthelwulf of Wessex]], by his first wife, [[Osburga]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred was the youngest of either four (Weir, Alison, ''Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy'' (1989), p.5) or five brothers, [http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheAnglo-Saxonkings/AlfredtheGreat.aspx] the primary record conflicting regarding whether [[Æthelstan of Wessex]] was a brother or uncle.&lt;/ref&gt; In 868 Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of [[Æthelred Mucil]].&lt;ref&gt;Asser [http://omacl.org/KingAlfred/ The Life of King Alfred] at the Online Medieval and Classical Library&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of five years, Alfred is said to have been sent to Rome where, according to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'',&lt;ref name=aschron&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/657/657.txt The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle] Freely licensed version at Gutenberg Project. Note: This electronic edition is a collation of material from nine diverse extant versions of the Chronicle. It contains primarily the translation of Rev. James Ingram, as published in the Everyman edition.&lt;/ref&gt; he was confirmed by [[Pope Leo IV]] who &quot;anointed him as king&quot;. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] writers interpreted this as an anticipatory [[coronation]] in preparation for his ultimate succession to the throne of Wessex. However, his succession could not have been foreseen at the time, as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a &quot;[[consul]]&quot;; a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion.{{sfn|Wormald|2004}} It may also be based on Alfred's later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of [[Charles the Bald]], [[King of the Franks]], around 854&amp;ndash;855. On their return from Rome in 856, Æthelwulf was deposed by his son [[Æthelbald]]. With civil war looming, the [[magnate]]s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. Æthelbald would retain the western shires (i.e., traditional Wessex), and Æthelwulf would rule in the east. King Æthelwulf died in 858; meanwhile Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Bishop Asser tells the story of how as a child Alfred won a prize of a volume of poetry in English, offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it. This story may be true,{{says who|date=October 2010}} or it may be a myth intended to illustrate the young Alfred's love of learning.{{Or|date=October 2010}}  Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from [[Crohn's disease]]. Statues of Alfred in Winchester and Wantage portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong, and though not lacking in courage, he was more noted for his intellect than a warlike character.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, Bernard (2009), &quot;Historical Note&quot; (p. 385 and following), in &quot;The Burning Land&quot; (Harper)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Æthelred==
[[File:King Alfred (The Great).jpg|thumb|left|19th century depiction of Alfred the Great]]
During the short reigns of the older two of his three elder brothers, [[Æthelbald of Wessex]] and [[Æthelbert of Wessex]], Alfred is not mentioned. However, his public life began with the accession of his third brother, [[Æthelred of Wessex]], in 866. It is during this period that Bishop Asser applied to him the unique title of &quot;secundarius&quot;, which may indicate a position akin to that of the [[Celt]]ic [[Tanistry|''tanist'']], a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. It is possible that this arrangement was sanctioned by Alfred's father, or by the [[Witenagemot|Witan]], to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle. The arrangement of crowning a successor as royal prince and military commander is well known among other [[Germanic monarchy|Germanic]] [[Germanic tribes|tribes]], such as the [[Swedish people|Swedes]] and [[Franks]], to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related.

In 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the invading [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] out of the adjoining [[Kingdom of Mercia]].&lt;ref name=aschron/&gt; For nearly two years, Wessex was spared attacks because Alfred paid the [[Vikings]] to leave him alone. However, at the end of 870, the Danes arrived in his homeland. The year which followed has been called &quot;Alfred's year of battles&quot;. Nine engagements were fought with varying outcomes, though the place and date of two of these battles have not been recorded. In Berkshire, a successful skirmish at the [[Battle of Englefield]] on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Reading (871)|siege and Battle of Reading]] on 5 January 871; then, four days later, Alfred won a brilliant victory at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on the [[North Wessex Downs AONB|Berkshire Downs]], possibly near [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] or [[Aldworth]]. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of this latter battle. However, later that month, on 22 January, the English were defeated at the [[Battle of Basing]] and, on the 22 March at the [[Battle of Merton]] (perhaps Marden in [[Wiltshire]] or Martin in [[Dorset]]), in which Æthelred was killed. The two unidentified battles may have occurred in between.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}}

==King at war==
===Early struggles, defeat and flight===
[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 057 - Alfred Plans the Capture of the Danish Fleet.jpg|thumb|right|Alfred the Great plots the capture of the Danish fleet.]]
In April 871, King Æthelred died, and Alfred succeeded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, despite the fact that Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold. This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at ''Swinbeorg''. The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf in his will had left jointly to his sons. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the ongoing Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's succession probably went uncontested. Tensions between Alfred and his nephews, however, would arise later in his reign.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

While he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the English in his absence at an unnamed spot, and then again in his presence at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]] in May.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}} The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. He was forced, instead, to ‘make peace’ with them. The sources do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the 'pagans' agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise; and, indeed, the Viking army did withdraw from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=140–141}} [[Hoard]]s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at [[Croydon]], [[Gravesend]], and [[Waterloo Bridge]]; these finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years, the Danes occupied other parts of England.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, N.P. and J.A. Graham-Campbell, &quot;Reflections on the Viking-age silver hoard from Croydon, [[Surrey]]&quot;, in ''Anglo-Saxon Monetary History: Essays in Memory of Michael Dolley'' (1986), pp. 91–110.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 876 under their new leader, [[Guthrum]], the Danes slipped past the English army and attacked and occupied [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]]. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}} Accordingly, he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a &quot;holy ring&quot; associated with the worship of Thor.&lt;ref name=aschron/&gt; The Danes, however, broke their word and, after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] in [[Devon]]. There, Alfred blockaded them, and with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. They withdrew to Mercia, but, in January 878, made a sudden attack on [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]], a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas, &quot;and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at [[Athelney]] in the marshes of [[Somerset]], and from that fort kept fighting against the foe&quot;.&lt;ref name=aschron/&gt; From his fort at [[Athelney]], an island in the marshes near [[North Petherton]], Alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement, rallying the local [[militia]]s from [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911}}

[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 050 - Alfred in the Neatherd's Cottage.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great is scolded by his subject, a neatherd's wife, for not turning the breads but readily eating them when they are baked in her cottage.]]

A popular legend, originating from 12th century chronicles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheAnglo-Saxonkings/AlfredtheGreat.aspx History of the Monarchy - The Anglo-Saxon kings - Alfred 'The Great']&lt;/ref&gt; tells how when he first fled to the [[Somerset Levels]], Alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom, Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn.

870 was the low-water mark in the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings, Wessex alone was still resisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicles|author=Anne Savage|page=101|isbn=0333488814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 ]]
In the seventh week after Easter [4–10 May 878], around [[Whitsuntide]], Alfred rode to ‘[[Egbert's Stone]]’ east of [[Selwood, Somerset|Selwood]], where he was met by &quot;all the people of Somerset and of Wiltshire and of that part of [[Hampshire]] which is on this side of the sea [that is, west of Southampton Water], and they rejoiced to see him&quot;.&lt;ref name=aschron/&gt; Alfred’s emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the [[fyrd]]s of three [[shire]]s. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of [[ealdormen]], royal [[High-reeve|reeve]]s and king’s [[thegn]]s (who were charged with levying and leading these forces), but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer Alfred’s summons to war. Alfred’s actions also suggest a finely honed system of scouts and messengers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing [[Battle of Ethandun]], which may have been fought near [[Westbury, Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911}} He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at Chippenham and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to Christianity; and three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at [[Aller]], near [[Athelney]], with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}} The &quot;unbinding of the chrism&quot; took place with great ceremony eight days later at the royal estate at Wedmore in Somerset, after which Guthrum fulfilled his promise to leave Wessex. There is no contemporary evidence that Alfred and Guthrum agreed upon a formal treaty at this time; the so-called [[Treaty of Wedmore]] is an invention of modern historians. The [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], preserved in Old English in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (Manuscript 383), and in a Latin compilation known as ''[[Quadripartitus]]'', was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia]] was deposed.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=163}}  That treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred’s and Guthrum’s kingdoms was to run up the [[River Thames]], to the [[River Lea]]; follow the Lea to its source (near Luton); from there extend in a straight line to [[Bedford]]; and from Bedford follow the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]] to [[Watling Street]].  In other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf’s kingdom, consisting of western Mercia; and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged kingdom of [[East Anglia]] (henceforward known as the [[Danelaw]]).  By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints — at least for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, M.A.S. Blackburn, &quot;The London mint in the reign of Alfred&quot;, in ''Kings, currency, and alliances : history and coinage of southern England in the ninth century'', ed. M.A.S. Blackburn and D.N. Dumville (1998), pp. 105–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The disposition of [[Essex]], held by West Saxon kings since the days of [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], is unclear from the treaty, though, given Alfred’s political and military superiority, it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson.

===The Quiet Years, Restoration of London===
[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|Plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the restoration of the Roman walled city by Alfred]]
With the signing of the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]], an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum’s people began settling East Anglia, Guthrum was neutralized as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;David Pratt, The Political thought of Alfred the great (Cambridge: Cambridge University Pess,2007), 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  In conjunction with this agreement an army of Danish left the island and sailed to [[Ghent]]. Alfred however was still forced to contend with a number of Danish threats. A year later in 881 Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships “On the high seas”.&lt;ref&gt;Asser, Life of King Alfred, Trans. Simon Keyes &amp; Michael Lapidge (New York: Penguin books, 1983),86.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred’s forces.&lt;ref&gt;“Saxon Chronicle” in memorials of King Alfred, ed. J.A. Giles, 6-128 (New York: Burt Franklin, 1969),76.&lt;/ref&gt;   Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period as they had for decades.

In the year 883, though there is some debate over the year, King Alfred because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome received a number of gifts from the [[Pope Marinus I|Pope Marinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Asser, “Life of King Alfred” in memorials of King Alfred, ed. J.A. Giles, 6-128 (New York: Burt Franklin, 1969), 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the [[true cross]], a true treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser because of Pope Marinus’ friendship with King Alfred the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Asser, Life of King Alfred, Trans. Simon Keyes &amp; Michael Lapidge (New York: Penguin Books, 1983), 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large scale conflicts for some time.  Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid taking place in [[Kent]], an allied country in Southeast England during the year 885, quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser’s account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of Rochester,&lt;ref&gt;Asser, Life of King Alfred, Trans. Simon Keyes &amp; Michael Lapidge  (New York: Penguin Books, 1983), 86.&lt;/ref&gt; where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city.  In response to incursion Alfred led an [[Anglo-Saxon]] force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asser 1983&quot;&gt;Asser, Life of King Alfred, Trans. Simon Keyes &amp; Michael Lapidge  (New York: Penguin Books, 1983), 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the failed Danish raid in Kent Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asser 1983&quot;/&gt; After travelling up the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]], the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asser 1983&quot;/&gt;  The Anglo-Saxon Fleet emerged victorious and as Huntingdon accounts,“laden with spoils.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Huntingdon, “Histories” in Memorials of King Alfred, ed. J.A. Giles, 6-128 (New York: Burt Franklin, 1969), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  The victorious fleet was then caught unaware when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet was able to defeat Alfred's fleet which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Woodruff, The Life And Times of Alfred the Great ( London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1974), 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later in 886 Alfred reoccupied the city of [[London]] and set out to make it habitable again.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Keynes “ Alfred and the Mercians,”  in Kings, Currency, and Alliance: History and Coinage of Southern England in the ninth century, ed. Mark A.S. Blackburn &amp; David N. Dumville,1-46 (Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1998), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in law [[Æthelred]], [[ealdorman]] of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the later half of the 880’s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan, added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls, and some believe the construction of matching fortifications on the South bank of the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Keynes “ Alfred and the Mercians,”  in Kings, Currency, and Alliance: History and Coinage of Southern England in the ninth century, ed. Mark A.S. Blackburn &amp; David N. Dumville,1-46 (Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1998),23.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the time period almost all chroniclers agree the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;David Pratt, The Political thought of Alfred the great (Cambridge: Cambridge University press,2007), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not, however, the point in which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact he would never adopt the title for himself. In truth the power which Alfred wielded over the English peoples at this time seemed to stem largely from the military might of the West Saxons, Alfred’s political connections having the ruler of Mercia as his son-in-law, and Alfred’s keen administration talents.

Between the restoration of [[London]] and the resumption of large scale Danish attacks in the early 890’s Alfred’s reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880’s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, Æthelswith, who died en route to Rome in 888.&lt;ref&gt;Asser, “Life of King Alfred”  in Memorials of King Alfred, ed. J.A. Giles, 6-128 (New York: Burt Franklin, 1969),114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Æthelred also passed away. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptized name, Alfred’s former enemy and king of East Anglia died and was buried in [[Hadleigh, Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Woodruff, The Life And Times of Alfred the great ( London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1974), 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Guthrum’s passing marked a change in the political sphere Alfred dealt with. Guthrum’s death created a power vacuum which would stir up other power–hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred’s life were coming to a close, and war was on the horizon.

===Further Viking attacks repelled===
After another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body at [[Appledore, Kent]], and the lesser, under [[Hastein]], at [[Milton, Kent|Milton]], also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them, indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces. While he was in talks with Hastein, the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck northwestwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's oldest son, [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], and were defeated in a general engagement at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]]. They took refuge on an island in the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire Colne]], where they were blockaded and were ultimately forced to submit. The force fell back on Essex and, after suffering another defeat at [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]], coalesced with Hastein's force at [[Shoeburyness|Shoebury]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911}}

Alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at [[Thorney]] when he heard that the [[Northumbria]]n and [[East Anglia]]n Danes were besieging [[Exeter]] and an unnamed stronghold on the [[North Devon]] shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the [[Siege]] of [[Exeter]]. The fate of the other place is not recorded. Meanwhile, the force under Hastein set out to march up the [[Thames Valley]], possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. But they were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of [[Mercia]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Somerset]], and forced to head off to the northwest, being finally overtaken and blockaded at [[Buttington]]. Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the [[River Wye]], others with Buttington near [[Welshpool]]. An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated. Those who escaped retreated to [[Shoebury]]. Then, after collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] walls of [[Chester, England|Chester]]. The English did not attempt a winter [[blockade]], but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the neighbourhood. Early in 894 (or 895), want of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to [[Essex]]. At the end of this year and early in 895 (or 896), the Danes drew their ships up the [[River Thames]] and [[River Lea]] and fortified themselves twenty miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) north of London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed but, later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at [[Quatford|Cwatbridge]] near [[Bridgnorth]]. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to [[Northumbria]], some to [[East Anglia]]. Those who had no connections in England withdrew back to the continent.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}}

==Military reorganisation==

[[File:Alfred the great silver offering penny 871 899.jpg|thumb|Alfred the Great silver offering [[penny]], 871-899. Legend: AELFRED REX SAXONUM &quot;Ælfred King of the Saxons&quot;.]]

===Reconstituted fyrd===
The near-disaster of the winter of 878, even more than the victory in the spring, left its mark on the king and shaped his subsequent policies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Over the last two decades of his reign, Alfred undertook a radical reorganisation of the military institutions of his kingdom, strengthened the West Saxon economy through a policy of monetary reform and urban planning and strove to win divine favour by resurrecting the literary glories of earlier generations of [[Anglo-Saxons]]. Alfred pursued these ambitious programmes to fulfil, as he saw it, his responsibility as king.  This justified the heavy demands he made upon his subjects' labour and finances.  It even excused the expropriation of strategically located [[Church lands]].  Recreating the [[fyrd]] into a standing army, ringing [[Wessex]] with some thirty garrisoned fortified towns, and constructing new and larger ships for the royal fleet were costly endeavours that provoked resistance from noble and peasant alike. But they paid off. When the [[Vikings]] returned in force in 892 they found a kingdom defended by a standing, mobile field army and a network of garrisoned fortresses that commanded its navigable rivers and [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads]].{{sfn|Plummer|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Many of Alfred's civil and military endeavors are documented in Charles Plummer's ''The Life and Times of Alfred the Great,'' especially in Lecture IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred analysed the defects of the military system that he had inherited and implemented changes to remedy them. Alfred's military reorganisation of Wessex consisted of three elements: the building of thirty fortified and garrisoned towns ([[burh]]s) along the rivers and Roman roads of Wessex; the creation of a mobile (horsed) field force, consisting of his nobles and their warrior retainers, which was divided into two contingents, one of which was always in the field; and the enhancement of Wessex's seapower through the addition of larger ships to the existing royal fleet.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}}  Each element of the system was meant to remedy defects in the West Saxon military establishment exposed by the Viking invasions. If under the existing system he could not assemble forces quickly enough to intercept mobile Viking raiders, the obvious answer was to have a standing field force.  If this entailed transforming the [[West Saxon]] fyrd from a sporadic levy of king's men and their retinues into a mounted standing army, so be it.  If his kingdom lacked strongpoints to impede the progress of an enemy army, he would build them.  If the enemy struck from the sea, he would counter them with his own naval power. Characteristically, all of Alfred's innovations were firmly rooted in traditional West Saxon practice, drawing as they did upon the three so-called ‘common burdens' of bridge work, fortress repair and service on the king's campaigns that all holders of [[Bookland (law)|bookland]] and royal [[Bookland (law)|loanland]] owed the Crown.  Where Alfred revealed his genius was in designing the field force and burhs to be parts of a coherent military system.  Neither Alfred's reformed fyrd nor his burhs alone would have afforded a sufficient defence against the Vikings; together, however, they robbed the Vikings of their major strategic advantages: surprise and mobility.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=From the last citation down to the end of the paragraph is an analysis of why Alfred made the changes he did, without cited expert it is OR}}

===Burghal system; defence in depth===
Alfred, in effect, had created what modern strategists call a [[defence-in-depth]] system, and one that worked.{{sfn|Abels|1988|pp=58–78}} Alfred's burhs, or [[boroughs]], were not grand affairs like the massive stone late Roman shore forts that still dot the southern coast of England (e.g. [[Pevensey]] and [[Rutupiæ|Richborough 'Castle']]). Rather, the borough defences consisted mainly of massive earthworks, large earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches. The earthen walls probably were surmounted with wooden [[palisades]], which by the tenth century were giving way to stone walls. (The Alfredian defences are well preserved at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], a town on the southern coast of England.) The size of the boroughs varied greatly, from tiny fortifications such as Pilton to large towns like [[Winchester]]. Many of the boroughs were, in fact, twin towns built on either side of a river and connected by a fortified bridge—much like [[Charles the Bald]]'s fortifications a generation before. Such a double-borough would block passage on the river; the Vikings would have to row under a garrisoned bridge, risking being pelted with stones, spears, or shot with arrows, in order to go upstream. Alfred's thirty boroughs were distributed widely throughout the West Saxon kingdom and situated in such a manner that no part of the kingdom was more than twenty miles, a day's march, from a fortified centre. They were also sited near fortified royal villas, to permit the king better control over his strongholds. What has not been recognised sufficiently is how these boroughs dominated the kingdom's lines of communication, the navigable rivers, Roman roads, and major trackways. Alfred seems to have had &quot;highways&quot; (''hereweges'' – &quot;army roads&quot;) linking the boroughs to one another. An extensive beacon system to warn of approaching Viking fleets and armies was probably also instituted at this time. In short, the thirty boroughs formed an integrated system of fortification.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=For everything from the last citation}}

The presence of well-garrisoned boroughs along the major travel routes of Wessex presented an obstacle for Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. They also served as places of refuge for the populations of the surrounding countryside. But these fortresses were not mere static points of defence. They were designed to operate in conjunction with Alfred's mobile standing army. The army and the boroughs together deprived the Vikings of their major strategic advantages: surprise and mobility. It was dangerous for the Vikings to leave a borough intact astride their lines of communication, but it was equally dangerous to attempt to take one. Lacking siege equipment or a developed doctrine of [[siegecraft]], the Vikings could not take these fortresses by storm. Rather, they reduced to the expedient of starving them into submission, which gave the king time to come to their relief with his mobile field army, or for the garrisons of neighbouring boroughs to come to the aid of the besieged town. In a number of instances, the hunter became the hunted, as borough garrison and field force joined together to pursue the would-be raiders. In fact, the only recorded success Viking forces had against boroughs in the ninth century occurred in 892, when a Viking stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in [[Kent]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=For the whole paragraph}}

Alfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. As Alfred’s biographer Asser makes clear, many nobles were reluctant to comply with what must have seemed to them outrageous and unheard of demands—even if they were for ‘the common needs of the kingdom’, as Asser reminded them. The cost of building the burhs was great in itself, but this paled before the cost of upkeep for these fortresses and the maintenance of their standing garrisons. A remarkable early tenth-century document, known as the [[Burghal Hidage]], provides a formula for determining how many men were needed to garrison a borough, based on one man for every 5.5 yards (5 meters) of wall. This provided a theoretical total of 27,071 soldiers, which is unlikely to have ever been achieved in practice.  Even if we assume that the mobile forces of Alfred were small, perhaps 3,000 or so horsemen, the manpower costs of his military establishment were considerable.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=For the whole paragraph}}

===Administration and taxation===
To obtain the needed garrison troops and workers to build and maintain the burhs' defences, Alfred regularised and vastly expanded the existing (and, one might add, quite recent) obligation of landowners to provide ‘fortress work’ on the basis of the hidage assessed upon their lands.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=199–207}} The allotments of the Burghal Hidage represent the creation of administrative districts for the support of the burhs.  The landowners attached to Wallingford, for example, were responsible for producing and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining 9,900 feet (3&amp;nbsp;km) of wall.  Each of the larger burhs became the centre of a territorial district of considerable size, carved out of the neighbouring countryside in order to support the town. In one sense, Alfred conceived nothing truly new here. The [[shire]]s of Wessex went back at least to the reign of [[King Ine]], who probably also imposed a hidage assessment upon each for food rents and other services owed the Crown. But, it is equally clear that Alfred did not allow the past to bind him.  With the advice of his [[witan]], he freely reorganised and modified what he had inherited.  The result was nothing short of an administrative revolution, a reorganisation of the West Saxon shire system to accommodate Alfred’s military needs. Even if one rejects the thesis crediting the &quot;Burghal Hidage&quot; to Alfred, what is undeniable is that, in the parts of [[Mercia]] acquired by Alfred from the Vikings, the shire system seems now to have been introduced for the first time. This is probably what prompted the legend that Alfred was the inventor of shires, [[Hundred (division)|hundreds]] and [[Tithing (country subdivision)|tithings]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=For everything from the last citation}}

===English navy===
Alfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896,&lt;ref name=aschron/&gt;&lt;ref name=p111&gt;{{cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicles|author=Anne Savage|pages=111|isbn=0333488814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships, that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]].  Wessex possessed a royal fleet before this. [[Æthelstan of Wessex|King Athelstan]] of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851, capturing nine ships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicles|author=Anne Savage|pages=86–88|isbn=0333488814}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicles|author=Anne Savage|page=97|isbn=0333488814}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, clearly, the author of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' and probably Alfred himself regarded 897 as marking an important development in the naval power of Wessex.  The chronicler flattered his royal patron by boasting that Alfred's ships were not only larger, but swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships. (It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of [[Hellenistic-era warships|Greek and Roman warships]], with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.) Alfred had seapower in mind: if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from ravaging.  Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception, however in practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a 'naval' battle could occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|pp=305–307}} Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in {{Cite book|last=Gifford |first=Edwin |last2=Gifford |first2=Joyce|chapter=Alfred's new longships|editor-first=Timothy |editor-last=Reuter |title=Alfred the Great (Studies in early medieval Britain)|year=2003|pages=281–89|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but troop carriers. A naval battle entailed a ship's coming alongside an enemy vessel, at which point the crew would lash the two ships together and board the enemy. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In the one recorded naval engagement in the year 896,&lt;ref name=aschron/&gt;&lt;ref name=p111/&gt; Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships in the mouth of an unidentified river along the south of England.
The Danes had beached half their ships, and gone inland,&lt;ref name=p111/&gt; either to rest their rowers or to forage for food. Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape to the sea. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines.&lt;ref name=p111/&gt; Only one made it, Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.&lt;ref name=p111/&gt; Lashing the Viking boats to their own, the English crew boarded the enemy's vessels and proceeded to kill everyone on board. The one ship that escaped managed to do so only because all of Alfred's heavy ships became mired when the tide went out. What ensued was a land battle between the crews of the grounded ships. The Danes, heavily outnumbered, would have been wiped out if the tide had not risen. When that occurred, the Danes rushed back to their boats, which being lighter, with shallower drafts, were freed before Alfred's ships. Helplessly, the English watched as the Vikings rowed past them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=For everything from the last citation}} But the pirates had suffered so many casualties (120 Danes dead against 62 Frisians and English&lt;ref name=p111/&gt;), that they had difficulties putting out to sea.&lt;ref name=p111/&gt; All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast.&lt;ref name=p111/&gt; The shipwrecked sailors were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.&lt;ref name=p111/&gt;

==Legal reform==
{{Main|Doom book}}
In the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long ''[[Doom book|domboc]]'' or [[law code]], consisting of his &quot;own&quot; laws followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King [[Ine of Wessex]]. Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction, Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many '[[synod]]-books' and &quot;ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed--those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Alfred'', Int. 49.9, trans. Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred singled out in particular the laws that he &quot;found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or [[Offa]], king of the Mercians, or King [[Æthelbert of Kent]], who first among the English people received baptism.&quot; It is difficult to know exactly what Alfred meant by this. He appended rather than integrated the laws of Ine into his code, and although he included, as had Æthelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts, the two injury tariffs are not aligned. And, Offa is not known to have issued a law code, leading historian [[Patrick Wormald]] to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates.{{sfn|Wormald|1999|pp=280–1}}

About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction, which includes translations into English of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]], a few chapters from the [[Book of Exodus]], and the so-called 'Apostolic Letter' from [[Acts of the Apostles]] (15:23-29). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt (2007: 215)&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the continuity between God's gift of Law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it links the holy past to the historical present and represents Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=248}} This is the reason that Alfred divided his code into precisely 120 chapters: 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law.{{sfn|Wormald|1999|p=417}} The link between the Mosaic Law and Alfred's code is the 'Apostolic Letter,' which explained that Christ &quot;had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness&quot; (Intro, 49.1). The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes, since Christian synods &quot;established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation, which they then fixed.&quot;&lt;ref name=keynes&gt;''Alfred'', Intro, 49.7, trans. Keynes and Lapidge, p. 164-5&lt;/ref&gt; The only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money is treachery to a lord, &quot;since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=keynes/&gt; Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment from &quot;Love your neighbour as yourself&quot; (Matt. 22:39-40) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship, which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abels|1998|p=250}} cites ''Alfred's Pastoral Care'', ch. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

When one turns from the ''domboc'''s introduction to the laws themselves, it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact, several of Alfred's laws contradict the laws of Ine that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual, but as an ideological manifesto of kingship, &quot;designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction.&quot;{{sfn|Wormald|1999|p=427}} In practical terms, the most important law in the code may well be the very first: &quot;We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge,&quot; which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.&lt;ref&gt;''Alfred'', 2, in Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves, and &quot;would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm, to see whether they were just or unjust.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Asser, chap. 106, in Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', 109&lt;/ref&gt; A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber, while washing his hands.&lt;ref&gt;The charter is Sawyer 1445, and is printed in ''English Historical Documents'', vol. 1, ed. Dorothy Whitelock, 2nd edn (1979), pp. 544–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Asser represents Alfred as a Solomonic judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments.  Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code, he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate, so that they could apply themselves &quot;to the pursuit of wisdom.&quot; The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.&lt;ref&gt;Asser, chap. 106, in Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', 109-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain how seriously this should be taken; Asser was more concerned to represent Alfred as a wise ruler than to report actual royal policy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=This is an expert opinion it needs a source}}

==Foreign relations==
Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers, but little definite information is available.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}} His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. He certainly corresponded with [[Elias III of Jerusalem|Elias III]], the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]],{{sfn|Plummer|1911}} and possibly sent a mission to India in honour of [[Thomas the Apostle#Thomas and India|Saint Thomas the Apostle]], whose tomb was believed to lie in that country.{{sfn|Medlycott|1905|p=80}} Contact was also made with the [[Caliph]] in [[Baghdad]].{{sfn|Reinhold|1857|p=146}} Embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the [[Pope]] were fairly frequent.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|p=14}} Around 890, [[Wulfstan of Haithabu]] undertook a journey from [[Haithabu]] on [[Jutland]] along the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Prussia]]n trading town of [[Truso]]. Alfred ensured he reported to him details of his trip.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Alfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of [[Great Britain|Britain]] are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the [[South Wales|southern Welsh]] princes, owing to the pressure on them from [[North Wales]] and [[Mercia]], commended themselves to Alfred. Later in the reign the [[North Wales|North Welsh]] followed their example, and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of the three pilgrim &quot;Scots&quot; (i.e. Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint [[Modwenna]], though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}}

==Religion and culture==

In the 880s, at the same time that he was &quot;cajoling and threatening&quot; his nobles to build and man the [[burh]]s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of [[Charlemagne]] almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}} It entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the [[episcopacy]]; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed &quot;most necessary for all men to know&quot;;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=[[WP:PROVIT]]}} the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house; and the issuance of a law code that presented the West Saxons as a new people of Israel and their king as a just and divinely inspired law-giver.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Very little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries, and though Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century,&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, Barbara, ''Wessex in the Early Middle Ages''(1995), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; and enticed foreign monks to England, monasticism did not revive significantly during his reign.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Alfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He was equally comfortable distributing his translation of [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'' to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests, and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal [[thegn]]s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Robin, &quot;Monastic lands and England's defence in the Viking Age&quot;, ''English Historical Review'' 100 (1985): 247-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish raids had also a devastating impact on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's ''Pastoral Care'' that &quot;learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English, or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated for dramatic effect the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth. That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige, but Alfred's account should not be entirely discounted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=Expert opinion needs a source}} Manuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Dumville, David, ''Wessex and England from Alfred to Edgar: Six Essays on Political, Cultural, and Ecclesiastical Revival'' (1992), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. And a solemn diploma from [[Christ Church, Canterbury]] dated 873 is so poorly constructed and written that historian Nicholas Brooks posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no Latin. &quot;It is clear,&quot; Brooks concludes, &quot;that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Nicholas, ''The Early History of the Church of Canterbury: Christ Church from 597 to 1066'' (1984), pp. 172–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the example of [[Charlemagne]], Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and &quot;a good many of lesser birth&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=[[WP:PROVIT]]}} There they studied books in both English and Latin and &quot;devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent .... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Asser, chap. 75, in Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 99–1. Cf. ''Codicology of the court school of Charlemagne: Gospel book production, illumination, and emphasised script (European university studies. Series 28, History of art)''&lt;/ref&gt; He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. [[Grimbald]] and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, Æthelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St. David's in south-western Wales.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Alfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed &quot;to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=prefgreg&gt;Preface to Alfred's translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', in ''Keynes and Lapidge'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm, Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin. The problem, however, was that there were few &quot;books of wisdom&quot; written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed &quot;most necessary for all men to know.&quot;&lt;ref name=prefgreg/&gt; It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme, but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks.

Apart from the lost ''Handboc'' or ''Encheiridion,'' which seems to have been a [[commonplace book]] kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the ''Dialogues'' of Gregory the Great, a book greatly popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by [[Werferth]], [[Bishop of Worcester]], with the king merely furnishing a preface.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}} Remarkably, Alfred, undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars, translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', [[Boethius]]'s ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', [[St. Augustine]]'s ''Soliloquies'', and the first fifty psalms of the [[Psalter]]. One might add to this list Alfred's translation, in his law code, of excerpts from the [[Vulgate]] Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'s ''Histories against the Pagans'' and [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences.&lt;ref&gt;Bately, Janet, &quot;King Alfred and the Old English Translation of Orosius&quot;, ''Anglia'' 88 (1970): 433-60; idem, &quot;'Those books that are most necessary for all men to know'. The Classics and late ninth-century England: a reappraisal&quot;, in ''The Classics in the Middle Ages'', ed. Aldo S. Bernardo and Saul Levin (1990), pp. 45–78,&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. [[Simon Keynes]] and [[Michael Lapidge]] suggest this also for Bald's ''Leechbook'' and the anonymous ''Old English Martyrology''.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes and Lapide, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 33–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred's first translation was of Pope Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care,'' which he prefaced with an introduction explaining why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this one from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating &quot;sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense,&quot; Alfred's translation actually keeps very close to his original, although through his choice of language he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant his translation to be used and circulated it to all his bishops.{{sfn|Plummer|1911}}

Boethius' ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike his translation of the ''Pastoral Care'', Alfred here deals very freely with his original and though the late Dr. G. Schepss&lt;ref&gt;Dr. G. Schepss, &quot;Zu König Alfreds Boethius&quot; in ''Archiv für das Studium der neueren Sprachen'', xciv (1895), pp. 149–160&lt;/ref&gt; showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to Alfred himself, but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is solely Alfred's and highly characteristic of his style. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: &quot;My will was to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works.&quot; The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Bodleian Library MS Bodley 180&lt;/ref&gt; the writing is prose, in the other&lt;ref&gt;British Library Cotton MS Otho A. vi&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S., &quot;[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/iconic.htm Alfred the Great's Burnt ''Boethius'']&quot;.  In Bornstein, George and Theresa Tinkle, eds., ''The Iconic Page in Manuscript, Print, and Digital Culture'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and the authorship of the verse has been much disputed; but likely it also is by Alfred. In fact, he writes in the prelude that he first created a prose work and then used it as the basis for his poem ''[[Metres of Boethius]]'', his crowning literary achievement. He spent a great deal of time working on these books, which he tells us he gradually wrote through the many stressful times of his reign to refresh his mind. Of the authenticity of the work as a whole there has never been any doubt.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The last of Alfred's works is one to which he gave the name ''Blostman'', i.e., &quot;Blooms&quot; or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the ''Soliloquies'' of St [[Augustine of Hippo]], the remainder is drawn from various sources, and contains much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. &quot;Therefore he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=[[WP:PROVEIT]]}}

Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]],'' where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. ''[[The Proverbs of Alfred]]'', a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=For the whole paragraph}}

The [[Alfred jewel]], discovered in [[Somerset]] in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its [[Old English]] inscription &quot;AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN&quot; (''Alfred ordered me to be made''). The jewel is about 2½ inches (6.1&amp;nbsp;cm) long, made of filigreed gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set a cloisonné enamel plaque, with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt (2007: 189-91)&lt;/ref&gt; It was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown, it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the ''æstels''&amp;mdash;pointers for reading&amp;mdash;that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the ''Pastoral Care''. Each ''æstel'' was worth the princely sum of 50 [[mancus]]es, which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=For the whole paragraph}}

Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=219–257}} As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's ''Pastoral Care'', kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 124–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: &quot;Study Wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sedgefield, W.J., ''King Alfred's Version of the Consolations of Boethius. Done into Modern English'' (1900), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or 'propaganda'. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the Carolingian renaissance. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience, but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010|reason=From the last citation}}

==Family==
In 868, Alfred married [[Ealhswith]], daughter of [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]] (who is also known as Aethelred Mucil), who was from the [[Gainsborough, England|Gainsborough]] region of [[Lincolnshire]]. She appears to have been the maternal granddaughter of a [[King of Mercia]]. They had five or six children together, including [[Edward the Elder]], who succeeded his father as king, [[Æthelflæd]], who would become [[Queen dowager|Queen]] of [[Mercia]] in her own right, and [[Ælfthryth, Countess of Flanders|Ælfthryth]] who married [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders|Baldwin II]] the [[Count of Flanders]]. His mother was [[Osburga]] daughter of Oslac of the [[Isle of Wight]], Chief [[Butler]] of England. [[Asser]], in his ''Vita Ælfredi'' asserts that this shows his lineage from the [[Jutes]] of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as [[Bede]] tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under [[Cædwalla of Wessex|Cædwalla]]. In 2008 the skeleton of Queen [[Eadgyth]], granddaughter of Alfred the Great was found in [[Magdeburg Cathedral]] in Germany.  It was confirmed in 2010 that these remains belong to her — one of the earliest members of the English royal family.&lt;ref&gt;

When the New Minster moved to [[Hyde Abbey|Hyde]], a little north of the city, in 1110, the monks transferred to [[Hyde Abbey]] along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children.

A number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour. These include:

*The [[University of Winchester]] was named 'King Alfred's College, Winchester' between 1928 and 2004, whereupon it was re-named &quot;University College Winchester&quot;.
*[[Alfred University]] and [[Alfred State College]] located in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, NY]], are both named after the king.
*In honour of Alfred, the [[University of Liverpool]] created a [[King Alfred Chair of English Literature]].
*[[King Alfred's Community and Sports College]], a secondary school in Wantage, Oxfordshire, the birthplace of Alfred.
*King's Lodge School, in [[Chippenham, Wiltshire]] is so named because King Alfred's hunting lodge is reputed to have stood on or near the site of the school.
*The King Alfred School &amp; Specialist Sports Academy, Burnham Road, Highbridge is so named due to its rough proximity to Brent Knoll (a Beacon site) and Athelney.
*The King Alfred School in Barnet, North London, UK.
*King Alfred's Middle School, [[Shaftesbury]], [[Dorset]] [Now defunct after reorganisation]
*[[King's College, Taunton]], Somerset. (The king in question is King Alfred).

The Royal Navy has named one ship and two [[shore establishment]]s [[HMS King Alfred]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:LeoXI-algardi-vatican.jpg|thumb|240px|''Tomb of [[Pope Leo XI|Leo XI]]'' (detail), 1640-44]]

'''Alessandro Algardi''' (31 July 1598 &amp;ndash; 10 June 1654) was an [[Italy|Italian]] high-[[Baroque]] sculptor active almost exclusively in [[Rome]], where for the latter decades of his life, he was the major rival of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].

==Early years==
Algardi was born in [[Bologna]], where at a young age, he was apprenticed in the studio of [[Agostino Carracci]]. However, his aptitude for [[sculpture]] led him to work for [[Giulio Cesare Conventi]] (1577—1640), an artist of modest talents. By the age of twenty, [[Duke of Mantua|Ferdinando I, Duke of Mantua]], began commissioning works from him, and he was also employed by local jewelers for figurative designs. After a short residence in [[Venice]], he went to Rome in 1625 with an introduction from the Duke of Mantua to the [[Pope Gregory XV|late pope's]] nephew, Cardinal [[Ludovico Ludovisi]], who employed him for a time in the restoration of ancient statues.&lt;ref&gt;These restored statues still form the core of the ''Bonacorsi-Ludovisi collection'' in [[Palazzo Altemps]]. Sculpture restoration was a common employment for even the most prominent sculptors of his day, including Bernini and [[Ercole Ferrata]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomb of Pope Leo XI==
Propelled by the [[Borghese]] and [[Barberini]] patronage, Gian Lorenzo Bernini and his studio garnered most of the major Roman sculptural commissions. For nearly a decade, Algardi struggled for recognition. In Rome he was aided by friends that included [[Pietro da Cortona]] and his fellow Bolognese, [[Domenichino]]. His early Roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait busts,&lt;ref&gt;His marble bust of Laudivio Zacchia, 1627, is in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin  [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image17.html (illustrated)]&lt;/ref&gt; while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes. 

[[Image:Algardi Leo XI.jpg|left|thumb|''[[List of papal tombs|Tomb of Leo XI]]'' ]]
Algardi's first major commission came about in 1634, when Cardinal Ubaldini (Medici) contracted for a funeral monument for his great-uncle, [[Pope Leo XI]], the third of the [[Medici]] popes, who had reigned for less than a month in 1605. The monument was started in 1640, and mostly completed by 1644. The arrangement mirrors the one designed by Bernini for the Tomb of [[Urban VIII]] (1628-47), with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing, while at his feet, two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus. However, in Bernini's tomb, the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below, wherein the figures of ''Charity'' and ''Justice'' are either distracted by ''putti'' or lost in contemplation, while skeletal ''Death'' actively writes the epitaph. Algardi's tomb is much less dynamic. The allegorical figures of ''Magnanimity'' and ''Liberality'' have an impassive, ethereal dignity. Some have identified the helmeted figure of ''Magnanimity'' with that of [[Athena]] and iconic images of ''Wisdom''.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet F. Senie, &quot;The Tomb of Leo XI by Alessandro Algardi&quot;, ''The Art Bulletin'' (1978); p 90-95.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liberality'' resembles [[Francois Duquesnoy|Duquesnoy's]] famous ''Santa Susanna'', but rendered more elegant. The tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of Urban VIII's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher p 121-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1635-38, [[Pietro Boncompagni]] commissioned from Algardi a colossal statue of [[Philip Neri]] with kneeling angels for [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]], completed in 1640.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Boucher, ''Earth and Fire: Italian Terracotta Sculpture from Donatello to Canova'' (Yale University Press) 2001:47.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after this, Algardi produced an interactive sculptural group representing the beheading of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] with two figures: a kneeling, resigned saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword-blow, for the church of San Paolo, Bologna. These works established his reputation. Like Bernini's characteristic works, they often express the Baroque aesthetic of depicting dramatic attitudes and emotional expressions, yet Algardi's sculpture has a restraining sobriety in contrast to those of his rival.

==Papal favour under Innocent X and Spanish commissions==
[[Image:Inocêncio X de alessandro algardi.jpg|thumb|right|''Pope Innocent X'', Capitoline Museums.]]

With the death of the Barberini [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1644 and the accession of the [[Pamphilj]] [[Pope Innocent X]], the Barberini family and their favorite artist, Bernini, fell into disrepute. Algardi, on the other hand, was embraced by the new pope&lt;ref&gt;Algardi's official 1645 portrait statue of Innocent X is preserved in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] on the [[Campidoglio]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the pope's nephew, [[Camillo Pamphilj]].&lt;ref&gt;His portrait bust of Camillo Pamphili, 1647, is at The [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Algardi%20Alessandro/imagepages/image2.html illustration].&lt;/ref&gt; Algardi's portraits were highly prized, and their formal severity contrasts with Bernini's more vivacious expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museicapitolini.org/scripts/scheda.asp?lingua=en&amp;id=MC1199  Compare the prior images with Bernini's Urban VIII]&lt;/ref&gt; A large hieratic bronze of Innocent X by Algardi is now to be found in the [[Musei Capitolini|Capitoline Museums]].

Algardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities. Although he was in charge of the project for the papal villa, the Villa Pamphili, now [[Villa Doria Pamphili]], outside the Porta San Pancrazio in Rome, he may have had professional guidance on the design of the casino from the architect/engineer [[Girolamo Rainaldi]] and help with supervising its construction from his assistant [[Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi]].&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Jennifer. ''Alessandro Algardi'', Vol. 1, Yale, 1985,p. 94-6,&lt;/ref&gt; The casino was a showcase for the Pamphili collection of sculpture, ancient and contemporary, on which Algardi was well able to advise. In the villa grounds, Algardi and his studio executed sculpture-encrusted fountains and other garden features, where some of his free-standing sculpture and bas-reliefs remain.

In 1650 Algardi met [[Diego Velázquez]], who obtained commissions for his work from [[Spain]]. As a consequence there are four chimney-pieces by Algardi in the [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]], and in the gardens, the figures on the fountain of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] are also by him. The Augustinian monastery at [[Salamanca]] contains the tomb of the Count and Countess de Monterey, another work by Algardi.

[[Image:Expulsão de átila.jpg|thumb|left|''Fuga d'Attila'', St. Peter's Basilica.]]

==The ''Fuga d'Attila'' relief==

Algardi's large dramatic marble high-relief panel of Pope Leo and Attila &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/a/algardi/2/meeting.html ''Pope Leo and Atilla'' relief]&lt;/ref&gt;(1646&amp;ndash;53) for [[St Peter's Basilica]] was widely admired in his day, and reinvigorated the use of such marble reliefs. There had been large marble reliefs used previously in Roman churches,&lt;ref&gt;For example, Gian Lorenzo's father, [[Pietro Bernini]]'s crowded ''Assumption of the Virgin'' for [[Santa Maria Maggiore]](1606)&lt;/ref&gt; but for most patrons, sculpted marble altarpieces were far too costly. In this relief, the two principal figures, the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened [[Attila]], surge forward from the center into three dimensions. Only they two see the descending angelic warriors rallying to the pope's defense, while all others in the background reliefs,  persist  in performing their respective earthly duties. 

The subject was apt for a papal state seeking clout, since it depicts the historical legend when the greatest of the popes Leo, with supernatural aid, deterred the Huns from looting Rome. From a [[baroque]] standpoint it is a moment of divine intervention in the affairs of man. No doubt part of his patron's message would be that all viewers would be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies.
 
[[Image:Herakles Hydra Musei Capitolini MC236.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hellenistic]] [[Lysippus|Lysippean]] torso, restored by Algardi as ''Hercules and the Hydra'' (Capitoline Museums).]]
Algardi died in Rome within a year of completing his famous relief, which was admired by contemporaries. 

In his later years Algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune. Algardi's classicizing manner was carried on by pupils (including [[Ercole Ferrata]] and [[Domenico Guidi]]). [[Antonio Raggi]] initially trained with him. The latter two completed his design for an altarpiece of the ''Vision of Saint Nicholas'' ([[San Nicola da Tolentino, Rome]]) using two separate marble pieces linked together in one event and place, yet successfully separating the divine and earthly spheres. Other lesser known assistants from his studio include [[Francesco Barrata]], [[Girolamo Lucenti]], and [[Giuseppe Peroni]].

==Critical assessment and legacy==
  
Algardi was also known for his portraiture which shows an obsessive attention to details of psychologically revealing [[physiognomy]] in a sober but immediate [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]], and minute attention to costume and draperies, such as in the busts of Laudivio Zacchia, Camillo Pamphilj, and of Muzio Frangipane and his two sons Lello and Roberto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romeartlover.it/Algardi.html|Busts of Algardi's children]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In temperament, his style was more akin to the classicized and restrained baroque of [[François Duquesnoy|Duquesnoy]] than to the emotive works of other baroque artists. From an artistic point of view, he was most successful in portrait-statues and groups of children, where he was obliged to follow nature most closely. His terracotta models, some of them finished works of art, were prized by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;An outstanding series of terracotta models is at the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alger of Liège''' (1055–1131), known also as Alger of Cluny and Algerus Magister, was a learned [[clergyman]] from [[Liège (city)|Liège]] who lived in the first half of the 12th century.

He was first [[deacon]] of [[St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|church of St Bartholomew]] in his native [[Liège (city)|Liège]] and was then appointed (c. 1100) to [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège|St. Lambert's Cathedral]]. He declined offers from German bishops and finally retired to the monastery of [[Cluny]], where he died at a high age, leaving behind a solid reputation for piety and intelligence.

His ''History of the Church of Liège'', and many of his other works, are lost. The most important of those still extant are:
#''De Misericordia et Justitia'' (On Mercy and Justice), a collection of biblical extracts and sayings of Church Fathers with commentary (an important work for the history of church law and discipline), which is to be found in the ''Anecdota'' of [[Edmond Martène|Martène]], vol. v.
#''De Sacramentis Corporis et Sanguinis Domini''; a treatise, in three books, against the [[Berengar of Tours|Berengar]]ian heresy, highly commended by [[Peter of Cluny]] and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]].
#''De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio''; given in Bernard Pez's ''Anecdota'', vol. iv.
#''De Sacrificio Missae''; given in the ''Collectio Scriptor. Vet.'' of [[Angelo Mai]], vol. ix. p.&amp;nbsp;371.

'''Algiers''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|l|ˈ|dʒ|ɪər|z}} {{respell|al|JEERZ|'}}; {{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;الجزائر&lt;/big&gt;}} ''al-Jazā’ir'', [[Algerian Arabic]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]]: ''Dzayer دزاير'' {{IPA-ar|dzæˈjer|}}; {{lang-fr|Alger}}, {{IPA-fr|alʒe|pron}}) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of [[Algeria]]. According to the 1998 census, the population of the city proper was 1,519,570 and that of the urban agglomeration was 2,135,630.&lt;ref name=citypop/&gt; In 2009, the population was about 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population at about 5,000,000 as of 2011.&lt;ref name=wup/&gt;

Called ''El-Bahdja'' (البهجة) or alternatively ''Alger la Blanche'' (&quot;Algiers the White&quot;) for the glistening white of its buildings as seen rising up from the sea, Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The city name is derived (via [[French language|French]] ''Alger'' and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Alguère''&lt;ref name=leschi&gt;''Origins of Algiers'' by Louis Leschi, speech delivered June 16, 1941 published in ''El Djezair Sheets'', July 1941 [http://alger-roi.fr/Alger/alger_son_histoire/textes/3_origines_alger_1941_feuillets.htm History of Algeria] {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) from the Arabic word الجزائر ''al-jazā’ir'', which translates as ''the islands'', referring to the four islands which lay off the city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525. ''Al-jazā’ir'' is itself a truncated form of the city's older name جزائر بني مازغان ''jazā’ir banī mazghannā'', &quot;the islands of (the tribe) Bani Mazghanna&quot;, used by early medieval geographers such as [[al-Idrisi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]].

The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the [[dey]]s, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the [[casbah]] or citadel, {{convert|400|ft|0}} above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.

==History==
A [[Phoenicia]]n commercial outpost called ''Ikosim'' which later developed into a small [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town called ''[[Icosium]]'' existed on what is now the marine quarter of the city. The ''rue de la Marine'' follows the lines of what used to be a Roman street. Roman cemeteries existed near ''[[Bab-el-Oued]]'' and ''[[Bab Azoun]]''. The city was given [[Latin]] rights by [[Vespasian]]. The [[bishop]]s of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century.

[[File:Old algiers 16th century.jpg|thumb|left|Old Algiers in the 16th century, with the Spanish-built Peñón of Algiers in the forefront.]]
The present-day city was founded in 944 by [[Bologhine ibn Ziri]], the founder of the [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Zirid]]–[[Sanhaja]] dynasty, which was overthrown by [[Roger II of Sicily]] in 1148, although the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers before the final fall of the dynasty. The city was occupied by the [[Almohades]] in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the Abd-el-Wadid sultans of [[Tlemcen]]. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under [[amir]]s of its own due to [[Oran]] being the chief seaport and center of power of the Abd-el-Wahid.

As early as 1302 the islet of Peñón in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by Spaniards. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and [[Spain]]. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the [[Moors]] from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Peñon and imposed a levy intended to suppress [[corsair]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman rule===
In 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers [[Oruc]] and [[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Hayreddin]] Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Oruc came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the [[Capture of Algiers (1516)]]. Hayreddin, succeeding Oruc after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the [[Fall of Tlemcen (1517)]], was the founder of the ''[[pashaluk]]'', which subsequently became the ''[[bey]]lik'', of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with [[Capture of Algiers (1529)]], and then formally invited the Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Algiers from this time became the chief seat of the [[Barbary pirates]]. In October 1541 in the [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]], the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their [[Pasha]], Hassan.

Formally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 17th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |title=Tyrkjaránið - Heimaslóð |language={{is icon}} |publisher=Heimaslod.is |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] fought two wars (the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.

The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], [[Jew]]ish, [[Moors|Moorish]] and [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.&lt;ref&gt;Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), assisted by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.

===French rule===

The history of Algiers from 1815 to 1962 is bound to the largest history of [[Algeria]] and its relationship to [[France]]. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul—whom the [[dey]] had hit with a [[fly-whisk]] when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants—a French army under [[Louis-Auguste-Victor, Count de Ghaisnes de Bourmont|General de Bourmont]] attacked the city in the [[invasion of Algiers in 1830|1830 invasion of Algiers]]. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of [[French Algeria]]. 

Many Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of the Arab peoples]''&quot;. Harvard University Press. p.323. ISBN 0-674-01017-5&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, the architect [[Le Corbusier]] drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as &quot;nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot&quot;. He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which &quot;the 'civilised' live like rats in holes&quot; whereas &quot;the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.

During [[World War II]], Algiers was the last city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during [[Operation Torch]].
[[File:Algiers CNE-v1-p58-J.jpg|thumb|left|City and harbour of Algiers, circa 1921]]

In 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which up hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 500,000 to 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]) at the hands of the [[French Army]] and the Algerian [[Front de Libération Nationale]], Algeria finally gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire ''[[pied-noir]]'' population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population—and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding [[Geography of Algeria|Mitidja]] plain.

Algiers was the host city for both the 1978 and 2007 [[All-Africa Games]]. The city was also designated the [[Arab Capital of Culture]] for 2007.

===Algerian War===
[[File:Algiers Coat of Arms.svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms]] of French Algiers]]
Algiers also played a pivotal role in the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962), particularly during the Battle of Algiers when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of then French Minister of Justice [[François Mitterrand]] (who authorized any means &quot;to eliminate the insurrectionists&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between Algerian forces who, on the one hand, resorted to attacking the French community and pro-French Algerians, and the French Army who, on the other, carried out a bloody repression including the quasi-systematic use of torture on protesters of the colonial order. Two such victims were the nationalist leader, [[Larbi Ben M'Hidi]], and a young professor of mathematics, [[Maurice Audin]], both of whom have since been honored by the municipality with principal arteries of the city named after them. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in France, as well as the return of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to power.

===Independence===
Algeria achieved independence on July 5, 1962. Run by the military that had liberated it, Algiers became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the [[Cold War]]. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single party system and the creation of a ''real'' [[democracy]] baptized the “Spring of Algiers”. The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the reign of the single party and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.

===Crisis of the 1990s===
The city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1992. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army cancelled the election process, setting off a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.

On December 11, 2007, two car [[11 December 2007 Algiers bombings|bombs exploded in Algiers]]. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll is at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Les autorités accusent al-Qaïda|publisher=RFI|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/096/article_60149.asp|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Toll in Algiers bombings rises to 31|agency=Associated Press|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071212/ap_on_re_af/algeria_explosion|accessdate=2007-12-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214021257/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071212/ap_on_re_af/algeria_explosion &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al Qaeda blamed for Algeria bombs|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/12/11/algeria.blast/index.html|accessdate=2007-12-11 | date=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
===Districts of Algiers===
[[File:NOTRE DAME D'AFRIQUE.ALGER.jpg|thumb|[[Notre Dame d'Afrique]]]]

* The ''' [[Casbah]] ''' (of '' Al Qasbah '', “the Citadel”), Ier District of Algiers: called '' Al-Djazaïr Al Mahroussa '' (“Well Kept Algiers”), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El Kébir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by [[almoravides|almoravide]] [[Youssef Ibn Tachfin]] and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Raïs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of Jénina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque; and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.

* ''' [[Bab El Oued]] ''': Literally ''the River's Gate'', the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond &quot;the gate of the river&quot;. It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with “the three clocks” and for its “market Triplet”, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Alger.jpg|thumb|left|Bab El Wadi]] --&gt;
* ''' Edge of sea ''': from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and [[Charles Frédéric Chassériau]] designed new buildings apart from the Kasbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, casino ... to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is the boulevard today [[Che Guevara]] (ex-boulevard of [[Republic]]).

* ''' [[Kouba]] ''' ([[will daira]] of [[Hussein-dey]]): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Of village, Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers knew after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.

* [[El Harrach]], a suburb of Algiers, is located about 10&amp;nbsp;km to the east of the city.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Place-emir-abdelkader.jpg|thumb|left|Place emir abdelkader]] --&gt;
* The communes of [[Hydra (Algiers) will|Hydra]], [[Ben Aknoun]], [[El-Biar]] and [[Bouzareah]] form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the heights of Algiers. These communes, sometimes famous knacks, shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.

* The street ''' Didouche Mourade ''' is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the ''' Grande Post office ''' to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the ''' place Audin ''', ''' the Faculty of Algiers ''', ''' The Crowned Heart ''' and ''' the park of Galland '''. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.

===Climate===
Algiers has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with warm summers and mild winters. Its proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior deserts. The climate of Algiers, like that of other Mediterranean cities, features wet &quot;winters&quot; and dry summers. Algiers on average receives roughly 430&amp;nbsp;mm (17 in.) of precipitation per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April.

==Local architecture==
[[File:Alger front de mer.jpg|thumb|Algiers waterfront]]

There are many public buildings of interest, including the whole [[Kasbah]] quarter, Martyrs Square (''Sahat ech-Chouhada'' ساحة الشهداء), the government offices (formerly the [[United Kingdom|British]] consulate), the &quot;Grand&quot;, &quot;New&quot;, and Ketchaoua [[Mosque]]s, the [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral of [[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], the [[Bardo National Museum|Bardo Museum]] (a former Turkish mansion), the old ''Bibliothèque Nationale d'Alger''—a [[Turkey|Turkish]] palace built in 1799–1800—and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the [[British Library]].

The main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into [[barracks]], and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a [[minaret]] and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.

The [[Great Mosque of Algiers|Great Mosque]] (''Jamaa-el-Kebir'' الجامع الكبير) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (''[[minbar]]'' منبر) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of [[Tlemcen]], in 1324. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by [[Moors|Moorish]] arches.

The New Mosque (''Jamaa-el-Jedid'' الجامع الجديد), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a [[Greek cross]], surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is {{convert|90|ft|0}} high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.

The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the ''rue d'Isly'' near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun باب عزون. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in [[Ireland]], sacked [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]]. &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Cité Maison Carré - El Harrach.jpg|thumb|left|Maison Carr]] --&gt;

[[File:Mosquée Ketchaoua.jpg|thumb|left|The Ketchaoua Mosque]]
The Ketchaoua mosque (''Djamaa Ketchaoua'' جامع كتشاوة), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a [[portico]] supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of [[Moorish Empire|Moorish]] [[plaster]] work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of [[San Geronimo]]. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles.

Algiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The [[Bardo National Museum|Bardo Museum]] in [[Tunisia]] holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.

The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial—the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of {{convert|235|acres|0|abbr=on}} (95&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]]). An opening in the south [[jetty]] affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Hitlon-alger.jpg|thumb|Algiers Hilton Hotel]] --&gt;
The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by [[Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa]] (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]]. The lighthouse which occupies the site of [[Fort Penon]] was built in 1544.

Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a [[Defensive wall|rampart]], [[parapet]] and [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]], with two terminal forts, [[Bab Azoun]] باب عزون to the south and [[Bab-el-Oued]] باب الواد to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of [[Bouzareah]] بوزريعة (at an elevation of {{convert|1300|ft|0}} above the sea) took their place.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Bananiers-mohammadia.jpg|thumb|Mohammedia]] --&gt;
[[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], a church built (1858–1872) in a mixture of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the [[Bouzareah]] hills, 2&amp;nbsp;miles (3.2&amp;nbsp;km) to the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the [[archangel Michael]], belonging to the confraternity of [[Naples|Neapolitan]] fishermen.

[[File:Algeri04.jpg|thumb|upright|Cosmopolitan Algiers]]
[[Villa Abd-el-Tif]], former residence of the [[dey]], was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the [[Abd-el-Tif prize]], among whom [[Maurice Boitel]], for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.

The city has the highest cost of living of any city in [[North Africa]], as well as the 50th highest worldwide, as of March 2007, having gained one position compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercerhr.com/costofliving |title=MERCER Human Resources Consulting - Moscow tops Mercer's cost of living list; London is close behind |publisher=Mercerhr.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Ben Ali El Abbar, president of the Council d administration of the emirate group EMAAR, presented five &quot;megaprojects&quot; to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, during a ceremony which took place Saturday, July 15 with the Palate of the People of Algiers. The projects will transform the city of Algiers and its surroundings by equipping them with a retail area, and restoration and leisure facilities.

The first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station &quot;Aga&quot; located in the downtown area. Ultramodern, the station, intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.

The second project will relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the {{convert|44|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea. The project of the bay of Algiers will also comprise six small islands, of which four of round form, connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes.

The third project will relate to restructuring an area of Algiers, qualified by the originators of the project of &quot;city of wellness&quot;. El Abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be &quot;agréable for all those which will want to combine tourism and wellbeing or tourism and relaxation&quot;. The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care, centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments. The university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students. The university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences.

Another project relates to technological implantation of a campus in Sidi Abdellah, {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east from Algiers. This {{convert|90|ha|acre|0|}} site will include shopping centres, residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels. Two other residential zones, including 1.800 apartments and 40 high standard villas, will be built on the surrounding hills.

The fifth project is that of the tourist complex Colonel Abbès, which will be located {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west from Algiers.

==Overview==
===Biography===
[[File:Alhazen, the Persian.gif|alt=Head of a bearded man with bushy eyebrows, wearing a turban.|thumb|Alhazen, the great Islamic polymath.]]
Alhazen was born in [[Basra]], in the [[History of Iraq|Iraq]] province of the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid Empire]] .&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{Harv|Lorch|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He probably died in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], Basra was a &quot;key beginning of learning&quot;,&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Harv|Whitaker|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was educated there and in [[Baghdad]], the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and the focus of the &quot;high point of Islamic civilization&quot;.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; During his time in [[Buyid|Buyid Iran]], he worked as a [[civil servant]] and read many [[Islamic theology|theological]] and [[Islamic science|scientific]] books.&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{Harv|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=greatislamic&gt;Sajjadi, Sadegh, &quot;Alhazen&quot;, ''Great Islamic Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, Article No. 1917;&lt;/ref&gt;

One account of his career has him called to Egypt by [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], ruler of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], to regulate the [[flooding of the Nile]], a task requiring an early attempt at building a [[dam]] at the present site of the [[Aswan Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2002b}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his [[field work]] made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme,&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbin149&quot;/&gt; and fearing the caliph's anger, he [[feigned madness]]. He was kept under [[house arrest]] from 1011 until al-Hakim's death in 1021.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=1917 the Great Islamic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he wrote his influential ''[[Book of Optics]]''.  After his house arrest ended, he wrote scores of other treatises on [[Islamic physics|physics]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]]. He later traveled to [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. During this period, he had ample time for his scientific pursuits, which included optics, mathematics, physics, [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], and the development of scientific methods; he left several outstanding books on these subjects.

Some biographers have claimed that Alhazen fled to Syria, ventured into Baghdad later in his life, or was in Basra when he pretended to be insane.  In any case, he was in Egypt by 1038.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; During his time in Cairo, he became associated with [[Al-Azhar University]], as well the city's &quot;House of Wisdom&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Van Sertima|1992|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as ''Dar al-`Ilm'' ([[House of Knowledge]]), which was a library &quot;first in importance&quot; to Baghdad's [[House of Wisdom]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; 

Among his students were ''Sorkhab'' (''Sohrab''), a [[Persian people|Persian]] student who was one of the greatest people of [[Iran]]'s [[Semnan]] and was his student for over 3 years, and ''Abu al-Wafa Mubashir ibn Fatek,'' an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] scientist who learned mathematics from Alhazan.&lt;ref name=greatislamic /&gt;

Alhazen made significant improvements in optics, physical science, and the scientific method. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment. His influence on [[physical science]]s in general, and on optics in particular, has been held in high esteem and, in fact, ushered in a new era in optical research, both in theory and practice.&lt;ref name=Deek/&gt;

His research in [[catoptrics]] (the study of optical systems using mirrors) centred on spherical and [[Parabola|parabolic]] mirrors and [[spherical aberration]]. He made the observation that the ratio between the [[angle of incidence]] and [[refraction]] does not remain constant, and investigated the [[Magnification|magnifying]] power of a [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. His work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as &quot;Alhazen's problem&quot;.&lt;ref name=Deek/&gt;
Meanwhile in the Islamic world, Alhazen's work influenced [[Averroes]]' writings on optics,&lt;ref name=Topdemir-77&gt;
{{Harv|Topdemir|2007a|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his ''Optics'' by Persian scientist [[Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]] (d. ca. 1320) in the latter's ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref name=Bizri-2005/&gt; The correct explanations of the rainbow phenomenon given by al-Fārisī and [[Theodoric of Freiberg]] in the 14th century depended on Alhazen's ''Book of Optics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Topdemir|2007a|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Alhazen and al-Fārisī was also further advanced in the [[Ottoman Empire]] by polymath [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] in his ''Book of the Light of the Pupil of Vision and the Light of the Truth of the Sights'' (1574).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Topdemir|1999}} (cf. {{Harv|Topdemir|2008}})&lt;/ref&gt;
He wrote as many as 200 books, although only 55 have survived, and many of those have not yet been translated from Arabic. Even some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on [[cosmology]] were translated into Latin, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and other languages.

==''Book of Optics''==
{{Main|Book of Optics}}

Alhazen's most famous work is his seven volume [[Physics in medieval Islam|Arabic treatise]] on [[optics]], ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''Book of Optics''), written from 1011 to 1021.

''Optics'' was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Crombie|1971|p=147, n. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was printed by [[Friedrich Risner]] in 1572, with the title ''Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~mcneil/cit/citlcalhazen1.htm|title=Alhazen (965–1040): Library of Congress Citations|publisher=Malaspina Great Books|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risner is also the author of the name variant &quot;Alhazen&quot;; before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen, which is the correct transcription of the Arabic name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Smith|2001|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work enjoyed a great reputation during the [[Middle Ages]]. Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] in [[Paris]] in 1834 by E. A. Sedillot. Other manuscripts are preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] and in the library of [[Leiden]].

===Theory of Vision===
Two major theories on vision prevailed in [[classical antiquity]]. The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Alhazen argued that the process of vision occurs neither by rays emitted from the eye, nor through physical forms entering it. He reasoned that a ray could not proceed from the eyes and reach the distant stars the instant after we open our eyes. He also appealed to common observations such as the eye being dazzled or even injured if we look at a very bright light. He instead developed a highly successful theory which explained the process of vision as rays of light proceeding to the eye from each point on an object, which he proved through the use of [[experiment]]ation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lindberg|1976|pp=60–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unification of [[geometrical optics]] with [[Aristotelian physics|philosophical physics]] forms the basis of modern [[physical optics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Toomer|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen proved that rays of light travel in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].&lt;ref name=Deek/&gt; He was also the first to reduce reflected and refracted light rays into vertical and horizontal components, which was a fundamental development in geometric optics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Heeffer|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a causal model for the refraction of light that could have been extended to yield a result similar to [[Snell's law]] of sines, however Alhazen did not develop his model sufficiently to attain that result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sabra|1981|pp=96–7}} (cf. {{Harv|Mihas|2005|p=5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen also gave the first clear description&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;{{Harv|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005}}: {{quote|&quot;The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and correct analysis&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{Harv|Wade|Finger|2001}}: {{quote|&quot;The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[camera obscura]] and [[pinhole camera]]. While Aristotle, [[Theon of Alexandria]], [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) and [[Chinese philosopher]] [[Mozi]] had earlier described the effects of a single light passing through a pinhole, none of them suggested that what is being projected onto the screen is an image of everything on the other side of the [[aperture]]. Alhazen was the first to demonstrate this with his lamp experiment where several different light sources are arranged across a large area. He was thus the first to successfully project an entire image from outdoors onto a screen indoors with the camera obscura.

In addition to physical optics, ''The Book of Optics'' also gave rise to the field of &quot;physiological optics&quot;.&lt;ref name=Russell-689&gt;Gul A. Russell, &quot;Emergence of Physiological Optics&quot;, p. 689, in {{Harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen discussed the topics of [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|ophthalmology]], [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], which included commentaries on [[Galen]]ic works. He described the process of sight,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Saad|Azaizeh|Said|2005|p=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. He also described what became known as [[Hering's law of equal innervation]], vertical [[horopter]]s, and [[binocular disparity]],&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{Harv|Howard|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved on the theories of [[binocular vision]], [[motion perception]] and horopters previously discussed by Aristotle, Euclid and Ptolemy.&lt;ref name=Wade-1998&gt;{{Harv|Wade|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Howard-Wade-1996&gt;{{Harv|Howard|Wade|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most original anatomical contribution was his description of the functional anatomy of the eye as an optical system,&lt;ref&gt;Gul A. Russell, &quot;Emergence of Physiological Optics&quot;, p. 691, in {{Harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; or optical instrument. His experiments with the camera obscura provided sufficient [[empirical]] grounds for him to develop his theory of corresponding point projection of light from the surface of an object to form an image on a screen. It was his comparison between the eye and the camera obscura which brought about his synthesis of anatomy and optics, which forms the basis of physiological optics. As he conceptualized the essential principles of pinhole projection from his experiments with the pinhole camera, he considered image inversion to also occur in the eye,&lt;ref name=Russell-689/&gt; and viewed the [[pupil]] as being similar to an aperture.&lt;ref&gt;Gul A. Russell, &quot;Emergence of Physiological Optics&quot;, p. 695–8, in {{Harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the process of image formation, he incorrectly agreed with [[Avicenna]] that the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] was the receptive organ of sight, but correctly hinted at the [[retina]] being involved in the process.&lt;ref name=Wade-1998/&gt;

===Scientific method===

[[File:Hevelius Selenographia frontispiece.png|alt=Frontispiece of book showing two persons in robes, one holding a geometrical diagram, the other holding a telescope.|thumb|[[Hevelius|Hevelius's]] ''[[Selenographia]]'', showing Alhasen [sic] representing reason, and Galileo representing the senses.]]

Neuroscientist Rosanna Gorini notes that &quot;according to the majority of the historians al-Haytham was the pioneer of the modern [[scientific method]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Gorini&gt;{{Harv|Gorini|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, Alhazen developed rigorous experimental methods of controlled [[Test method|scientific testing]] to verify theoretical hypotheses and substantiate [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] [[conjecture]]s.  Other historians of science place his experiments in the tradition of [[Ptolemy]] and see in such interpretations a &quot;tendency to 'modernize' Alhazen ... [which] serves to wrench him slightly out of proper historical focus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = A. Mark | year = 1992 | title = Review of A. I. Sabra, ''The Optics of Ibn al-Haytham.

An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (''i'tibar'') and [[Scientific control|controlled testing]] in his scientific inquiries.  Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics ('''ilm tabi'i'') with mathematics (''ta'alim''; geometry in particular) in terms of devising the rudiments of what may be designated as a [[Hypothetico-deductive model|hypothetico-deductive procedure]] in scientific research. This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''The Optics''; ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectivae'') and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and [[dioptrics]] (the study of the refraction of light).  His legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his ''Optics'' by [[Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]] (d. ca. 1320) in the latter's ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref name=Bizri-2005&gt;{{Harv|El-Bizri|2005a}} &lt;br&gt; {{Harv|El-Bizri|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Occam's razor]] is also present in the ''Book of Optics''. For example, after demonstrating that light is generated by luminous objects and emitted or reflected into the eyes, he states that therefore &quot;the [[Emission theory (vision)|extramission]] of [visual] rays is superfluous and useless.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Smith|2001|pp=372 &amp; 408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alhazen's problem===
His work on [[catoptrics]] in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by [[Ptolemy]] in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Surface normal|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a cue ball at a given point must be aimed in order to carom off the edge of the table and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, &quot;Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.&quot; This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Weisstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led Alhazen to derive the earliest formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s; by using an early [[mathematical proof|proof]] by [[mathematical induction]], he developed a method that can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers. He applied his result of sums on integral powers to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]] through [[Integral|integration]]. He was thus able to find the [[integral]]s for [[polynomial]]s up to the [[Quadratic polynomial|fourth degree]].&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{Harv|Katz|1995|pp=165–9 &amp; 173–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof, though many after him attempted to find an algebraic solution to the problem,&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Harv|Smith|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was finally found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician [[Peter M. Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Highfield|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other contributions===
The ''Book of Optics'' describes several early experimental observations that Alhazen made in [[mechanics]] and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s, and concluded that &quot;it was only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces which was forceful enough to enable them to penetrate whereas the [[Oblique angle|oblique]] ones were deflected. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw would break the slate and pass through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance would not.&quot; This result explained how intense direct light hurts the eye: &quot;Applying mechanical analogies to the effect of light rays on the eye, Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray since there could only be one such ray from each point on the surface of the object which could penetrate the eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gul A. Russell, &quot;Emergence of Physiological Optics&quot;, p. 695, in {{Citation |last1=Morelon  |first1=Régis |last2=Rashed |first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]] |volume=2 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0415124107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 15–16 of the ''Book of Optics'' covered [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]]. Alhazen was the first to discover that the [[celestial spheres]] do not consist of [[solid]] matter. He also discovered that the heavens are less dense than the air. These views were later repeated by [[Witelo]] and had a significant influence on the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] and [[Tychonic system]]s of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rosen|1985|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered be the &quot;founder of [[experimental psychology]]&quot;, for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and [[optical illusion]]s.&lt;ref name=Khaleefa&gt;{{Harv|Khaleefa|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Book of Optics]]'', Alhazen was the first scientist to argue that vision occurs in the brain, rather than the eyes. He pointed out that personal experience has an effect on what people see and how they see, and that vision and perception are subjective.&lt;ref name=Steffens&gt;Bradley Steffens (2006). ''Ibn al-Haytham: First Scientist'', Chapter 5. Morgan Reynolds Publishing. ISBN 1599350246.&lt;/ref&gt; Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the &quot;founder of [[psychophysics]]&quot;, a subdiscipline and precursor to modern psychology.&lt;ref name=Khaleefa/&gt; Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.&lt;ref name=AaenStockdale&gt;{{Harv|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He came up with a theory to explain the [[Moon illusion]], which played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe. It was an attempt to the solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does while higher up in the sky, a debate that is unresolved to this day. Arguing against Ptolemy's refraction theory, he redefined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. With the Moon however, there are no intervening objects. Therefore, since the size of an object depends on its observed distance, which is in this case inaccurate, the Moon appears larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with Ptolemy's theory being rejected in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hershenson|1989| pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that Alhazen's views on [[pain]] and sensation may have been influenced by [[Buddhist philosophy]]. He writes that every sensation is a form of '[[suffering]]' and that what people call pain is only an exaggerated [[perception]]; that there is no [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] difference but only a [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] difference between pain and ordinary sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Plott |first=C. |year=2000 |title=Global History of Philosophy: The Period of Scholasticism |isbn=8120805518 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |page=462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works on physics==
===Optical treatises===
Besides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on [[optics]]. His ''Risala fi l-Daw’'' (''Treatise on Light'') is a supplement to his ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''Book of Optics''). The text contained further investigations on the properties of [[luminance]] and its [[radiance|radiant]] dispersion through various [[Transparency (optics)|transparent and translucent]] media. He also carried out further examinations into anatomy of the [[Human eye|eye]] and [[Optical illusion|illusions]] in [[visual perception]]. He built the first [[camera obscura]] and [[pinhole camera]],&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{Harv|Wade|Finger|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and investigated the [[meteorology]] of the [[rainbow]] and the [[density]] of the atmosphere. Various celestial phenomena (including the [[eclipse]], twilight, and [[moonlight]]) were also examined by him. He also made investigations into [[refraction]], [[catoptrics]], [[dioptrics]], [[sphere|spherical]] mirrors, and [[Magnifying glass|magnifying lenses]].&lt;ref name=Bizri/&gt;

In his treatise, ''Mizan al-Hikmah'' (''Balance of Wisdom''), Alhazen discussed the density of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and related it to [[altitude]]. He also studied [[atmospheric refraction]]. He discovered that the [[twilight]] only ceases or begins when the Sun is 19° below the horizon and attempted to measure the height of the atmosphere on that basis.&lt;ref name=Deek&gt;{{Harv|Dr. Al Deek|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrophysics===
In [[astrophysics]] and the [[celestial mechanics]] field of [[Islamic physics|physics]], Alhazen, in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', discovered that the [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] &quot;were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Duhem|1969|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's ''Mizan al-Hikmah'' (''Balance of Wisdom'') covered [[statics]], astrophysics, and celestial mechanics. He discussed the theory of [[Gravitation|attraction]] between [[mass]]es, and it seems that he was also aware of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of [[acceleration]] due to gravity [[Action at a distance (physics)|at a distance]].&lt;ref name=Bizri&gt;{{Harv|El-Bizri|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Maqala fi'l-qarastun'' is a treatise on [[Center of mass|centres of gravity]]. Little is known about the work, except for what is known through the later works of [[al-Khazini]] in the 12th century. In this treatise, Alhazen formulated the theory that the [[Weight|heaviness]] of bodies varies with their distance from the centre of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Professor Abattouy|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another treatise, ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon''), which he wrote some time before his famous ''[[Book of Optics]]'', was the first successful attempt at combining mathematical astronomy with [[physics]], and the earliest attempt at applying the [[Scientific method|experimental method]] to astronomy and astrophysics. He disproved the universally held opinion that the [[Moon]] reflects [[sunlight]] like a [[mirror]] and correctly concluded that it &quot;emits light from those portions of its surface which the [[sun]]'s light strikes.&quot; To prove that &quot;light is emitted from every point of the Moon's illuminated surface&quot;, he built an &quot;ingenious [[experiment]]al device.&quot;&lt;ref name=Toomer-463-4/&gt; According to Matthias Schramm, Alhazen had &lt;blockquote&gt;formulated a clear conception of the relationship between an ideal mathematical model and the complex of observable phenomena; in particular, he was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [[moonlight]] through two small [[apertures]] onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up.&lt;ref name=Toomer-463-4&gt;{{Harv|Toomer|1964|pp=463–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mechanics===
In the [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] and [[kinematics]] fields of [[mechanics]], Alhazen's ''Risala fi’l-makan'' (''Treatise on Place'') discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body. He maintained that a body moves perpetually unless an external force stops it or changes its direction of motion.&lt;ref name=Bizri/&gt; Alhazen's concept of [[inertia]] was not verified by experimentation, however. [[Galileo Galilei]] repeated Alhazen's principle, centuries later, but introduced the concept of [[friction]]al force and provided experimental results. 

In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a [[Vacuum|void]], and he thus used [[geometry]] to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.&lt;ref name=Bizri-2007/&gt;

==Astronomical works==
===''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy''===
In his ''Al-Shukūk ‛alā Batlamyūs'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized many of [[Ptolemy]]'s works, including the ''[[Almagest]]'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works. He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and wrote a scathing critique of the physical reality of Ptolemy's astronomical system, noting the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Langerman|1990|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sabra|1978b|p=121, n. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus|title=Nicolaus Copernicus|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=2005-04-18|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alhazen further criticized Ptolemy's model on other [[empirical]], [[observation]]al and [[experiment]]al grounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sabra|1998|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Ptolemy's use of [[conjectural]] undemonstrated theories in order to &quot;save appearances&quot; of certain [[phenomena]], which Alhazen did not approve of due to his insistence on [[scientific demonstration]]. Unlike some later astronomers who criticized the Ptolemaic model on the grounds of being incompatible with [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian natural philosophy]], Alhazen was mainly concerned with empirical observation and the internal contradictions in Ptolemy's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Pines|1986|pp=438–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', Alhazen commented on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge:

{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;}}

He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge:

{{quote|Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;}}

===''On the Configuration of the World''===
In his ''On the Configuration of the World'', despite his criticisms directed towards Ptolemy, Alhazen continued to accept the physical reality of the [[geocentric model]] of the universe,&lt;ref&gt;Some writers, however, argue that Alhazen's critique constituted a form of [[Heliocentrism|heliocentricity]] (see {{Harv|Qadir|1989|pp=5–6 &amp; 10}}).&lt;/ref&gt; presenting a detailed description of the physical structure of the [[celestial spheres]] in his ''On the Configuration of the World'':
{{quote|The earth as a whole is a round sphere whose center is the center of the world. It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Langerman|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While he attempted to discover the physical reality behind Ptolemy's mathematical model, he developed the concept of a single orb (''falak'') for each component of Ptolemy's planetary motions. This work was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Langerman|1990|pp=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets''===
Alhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'', written in 1038, was a book on astronomy. The surviving manuscript of this work has only recently been discovered, with much of it still missing, hence the work has not yet been published in modern times. Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'' and ''The Resolution of Doubts'', Alhazen described the first non-Ptolemaic model in ''The Model of the Motions''. His reform was not concerned with [[cosmology]], as he developed a systematic study of [[Celestial mechanics|celestial]] [[kinematics]] that was completely [[geometry|geometric]]. This in turn led to innovative developments in [[infinitesimal]] geometry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harv|Rashed|2007&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His reformed [[empirical]] model was the first to reject the [[equant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2007|p=20 &amp; 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deferent|eccentrics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=33–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; separate [[natural philosophy]] from astronomy, free celestial kinematics from cosmology, and reduce physical entities to geometric entities. The model also propounded the [[Earth's rotation]] about its axis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=20 &amp; 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the centres of motion were geometric points without any physical significance, like [[Johannes Kepler]]'s model centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=51–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the text, Alhazen also describes an early version of [[Occam's razor]], where he employs only minimal hypotheses regarding the properties that characterize astronomical motions, as he attempts to eliminate from his planetary model the cosmological hypotheses that cannot be observed from the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=35–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other astronomical works===
Alhazen distinguished [[Islamic astrology|astrology]] from astronomy, and he refuted the study of [[astrology]], due to the methods used by astrologers being [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]], and also due to the views of astrologers conflicting with that of orthodox [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Saliba|1994|pp=60 &amp; 67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen also wrote a treatise entitled ''On the Milky Way'',&lt;ref name=Topdemir/&gt; in which he solved problems regarding the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] and [[parallax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harv|Rashed|2007&quot;/&gt; In antiquity, [[Aristotle]] believed the Milky Way to be caused by &quot;the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close together&quot; and that the &quot;ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the [[Sublunary sphere|region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Montada|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen refuted this and &quot;determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it was very remote from the [[earth]] and did not belong to the atmosphere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bouali|Zghal|Lakhdar|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if the Milky Way was located around the [[Earth's atmosphere]], &quot;one must find a difference in position relative to the fixed stars.&quot; He described two methods to determine the Milky Way's parallax: &quot;either when one observes the Milky Way on two different occasions from the same spot of the earth; or when one looks at it simultaneously from two distant places from the surface of the earth.&quot; He made the first attempt at observing and measuring the Milky Way's parallax, and determined that since the Milky Way had no parallax, then it does not belong to the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mohamed|2000|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, Muhammad Wali ibn Muhammad Ja'far, in his ''Shigarf-nama'', claimed that Alhazen wrote a treatise ''Maratib al-sama'' in which he conceived of a planetary model similar to the [[Tychonic system]] where the planets orbit the Sun which in turn orbits the Earth. However, the &quot;verification of this claim seems to be impossible&quot;, since the treatise is not listed among the known [[bibliography]] of Alhazen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Arjomand|1997|pp=5–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical works==
In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]]. He systemized [[conic section]]s and [[number theory]], carried out some early work on [[analytic geometry]], and worked on &quot;the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]].&quot; This in turn had an influence on the development of [[René Descartes]]'s [[geometric analysis]] and [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[calculus]].&lt;ref name=Faruqi/&gt;

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]], Alhazen developed [[analytical geometry]] and established a link between [[algebra]] and geometry.&lt;ref name=Faruqi/&gt; He discovered a formula for adding the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rottman|2000}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen made the first attempt at proving the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] [[parallel postulate]], the fifth [[Axiom|postulate]] in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], using a [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Eder|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he introduced the concept of [[Hyperbolic motion|motion]] and [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]] into geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Katz|1998|p=269}}: {{quote|In effect, this method characterized parallel lines as lines always equidisant from one another and also introduced the concept of motion into geometry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the [[Lambert quadrilateral]], which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the &quot;Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral&quot;,&lt;ref name=Rozenfeld&gt;{{Harv|Rozenfeld|1988|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attempted proof also shows similarities to [[Playfair's axiom]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; His theorems on [[quadrilateral]]s, including the Lambert quadrilateral, were the first theorems on [[elliptical geometry]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]]. These theorems, along with his alternative postulates, such as Playfair's axiom, can be seen as marking the beginning of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. His work had a considerable influence on its development among the later Persian geometers [[Omar Khayyám]] and [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī]], and the European geometers [[Witelo]], [[Gersonides]], [[Alfonso]], [[John Wallis]], [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]]&lt;ref name=Rozenfeld-Youschkevitch&gt;{{Harv|Rozenfeld|Youschkevitch|1996|p=470}}: {{quote|Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam and al-Tusi, had made the most considerable contribution to this branch of geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only in the nineteenth century. In essence their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between tthis postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines&amp;nbsp;— made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the thirteenth century, while revising Alhazen's ''Book of Optics'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') - was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the fourteenth century by the Jewish scholar Gersonides, who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn Alhazen's demonstration. Above, we have demonstrated that ''Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid'' had stimulated borth J. Wallis's and G. Saccheri's studies of the theory of parallel lines.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Clavius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rozenfeld|Youschkevitch|1996|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of [[squaring the circle]] using the area of [[Lune (mathematics)|lune]]s (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; He also tackled other problems in elementary (Euclidean) and advanced ([[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonian]] and [[Archimedes|Archimedean]]) geometry, some of which he was the first to solve.&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;

===Number theory===
His contributions to [[number theory]] includes his work on [[perfect number]]s. In his ''Analysis and Synthesis'', Alhazen was the first to realize that every even perfect number is of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) where 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is [[Prime number|prime]], but he was not able to prove this result successfully ([[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] later proved it in the 18th century).&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

Alhazen solved problems involving [[congruence relation|congruences]] using what is now called [[Wilson's theorem]]. In his ''Opuscula'', Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

==Other works==
===''Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals''===
In [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]] and [[musicology]], Alhazen's ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'' was the earliest treatise dealing with the effects of [[Zoomusicology|music on animals]]. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or retarded with the use of [[Arabic music|music]], and shows other examples of how music can affect [[Ethology|animal behaviour]] and [[animal psychology]], experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the Western world continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Alhazen's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.&lt;ref name=Plott&gt;{{Harv|Plott|2000|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
In [[Inventions in the Islamic world|engineering]], one account of his career as a [[civil engineer]] has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid [[Caliph]], [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], to regulate the [[flooding]] of the [[Nile]] River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [[inundation]] of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [[dam]], at the site of the modern-day [[Aswan Dam]]. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon [[feigned madness]] so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Al-Khazini]], Alhazen also wrote a treatise providing a description on the [[construction]] of a [[water clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hassan|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
In [[early Islamic philosophy]], Alhazen's ''Risala fi’l-makan'' (''Treatise on Place'') presents a critique of [[Aristotle]]'s concept of place ([[topos]]). Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' stated that the place of something is the two-dimensional boundary of the containing body that is at rest and is in contact with what it contains. Alhazen disagreed and demonstrated that place (al-makan) is the imagined three-dimensional [[Vacuum|void]] between the inner surfaces of the containing body. He showed that place was akin to [[space]], foreshadowing [[René Descartes]]'s concept of place in the ''Extensio'' in the 17th century. Following on from his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen's ''Qawl fi al-Makan'' (''Discourse on Place'') was a treatise which presents [[geometry|geometric]] demonstrations for his geometrization of place, in opposition to Aristotle's philosophical concept of place, which Alhazen rejected on mathematical grounds. [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in ''Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan'' (''A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham’s place'') for its geometrization of place.&lt;ref name=Bizri-2007&gt;{{Harv|El-Bizri|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen also discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. His [[experiment]]al proof of the intromission model of vision led to changes in the way the [[visual perception]] of space was understood, contrary to the previous [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]]. In &quot;tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the
intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Smith|2005|pp=219–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theology===
Alhazen was a devout [[Muslim]], though it is uncertain which branch of [[Islam]] he followed. He may have been either a follower of the orthodox [[Ash'ari]] school of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic theology]] according to [[Ziauddin Sardar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sardar|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lawrence Bettany&lt;ref name=Bettany-251/&gt; (and opposed to the views of the [[Mu'tazili]] school),&lt;ref name=Bettany-251&gt;{{Harv|Bettany|1995|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; a follower of the Mu'tazili school of Islamic theology according to Peter Edward Hodgson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hodgson|2006|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a follower of [[Shia Islam]] possibly according to [[A. I. Sabra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sabra|1978a|p=54}} {{Request quotation|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology, in which he discussed [[prophet]]hood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a treatise entitled ''Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation'', in which he discussed finding the [[Qibla]], where [[Salah]] prayers are directed towards, mathematically.&lt;ref name=Topdemir/&gt;

He wrote in his ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'':

{{quote|Truth is sought for its own sake ... Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. For the truths are plunged in obscurity. ... God, however, has not preserved the scientist from error and has not safeguarded science from shortcomings and faults. If this had been the case, scientists would not have disagreed upon any point of science...&lt;ref&gt;S. Pines (1962), ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''', Ithaca, as referenced in {{Citation|first=Shmuel (ed.)|last=Sambursky |year=1974|title= Physical Thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists|publisher=Pica Press| isbn =0-87663-712-8|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;}}

In ''The Winding Motion'', Alhazen further wrote:

{{quote|From the statements made by the noble [[Shaykh]], it is clear that he believes in Ptolemy's words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation (''taqlid''); that is how experts in the prophetic tradition have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them. But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alhazen described his theology:

{{quote|I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the [[Wiktionary:effulgence|effulgence]] and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alhazen was a pioneer in many areas of science, making significant contributions in varying disciplines. His optical writings influenced many Western intellectuals such as [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]], [[Witelo]], [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lindberg|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pioneering work on [[number theory]], [[analytic geometry]], and the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], also had an influence on [[René Descartes]]'s [[geometric analysis]] and [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[calculus]].&lt;ref name=Faruqi&gt;{{Harv|Faruqi|2006|pp=395–6}}:
{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965–1041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'. [...] Al-Haytham’s contributions to geometry and number theory went well beyond the Archimedean tradition. Al-Haytham also worked on analytical geometry and the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry. Subsequently, this work led in pure mathematics to the harmonious fusion of algebra and geometry that was epitomised by Descartes in geometric analysis and by Newton in the calculus. Al-Haytham was a scientist who made major contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics and astronomy during the latter half of the tenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to medieval biographers, Alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.&lt;ref name=Rashed&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2002a|p=773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all his surviving works have yet been studied, but some of the ones that have are given below.&lt;ref name=Topdemir&gt;{{Harv|Topdemir|2007b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Alessandro Allori - Portrait of Grand Duchess Bianca Capello de Medici.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Grand Duchess Bianca Capello de Medici'', by Allori, [[Dallas Museum of Art]]]]

'''Alessandro di Cristofano di Lorenzo del Bronzino Allori''' (3 May 1535 – 22 September 1607) was an [[Italy|Italian]] portrait [[Painting|painter]] of the late [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] [[Florence|Florentine]] school.

Born in Florence, in 1540, after the death of his father, he was brought up and trained in art by a close friend, often referred to as his 'uncle', the mannerist painter [[Agnolo Bronzino]], whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures. In some ways, Allori is the last of the line of prominent Florentine painters, of generally undiluted Tuscan artistic heritage: [[Andrea del Sarto]] worked with [[Fra Bartolomeo]] (as well as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]), [[Pontormo]] briefly worked under Andrea, and trained [[Bronzino]], who trained Allori. Subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of [[Baroque]] styles pre-eminent in other parts of Italy. 

Freedburg derides Allori as derivative, claiming  he illustrates &quot;the ideal of Maniera by which art (and style) are generated out of pre-existing art.&quot; The polish of figures has an unnatural marble-like form as if he aimed for cold statuary. It can be said of late phase mannerist painting in Florence, that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like [[Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo]], was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting. While by 1600 the [[Baroque]] elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures, Florence was painting two-dimensional statues. Furthermore, in general, with the exception of the ''Contra Maniera'' ([[Counter-Mannerism]]) artists, it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion.

Among his collaborators was [[Giovanni Maria Butteri]] and his main pupil was [[Giovanni Bizzelli]]. Cristoforo del Altissimo,  [[Cesare Dandini]], [[Aurelio Lomi]], John Mosnier, [[Giovanni Battista Vanni]], and Monanni also were his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes J.R. page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Allori was one of the artists, working under [[Vasari]], included in the decoration of the [[Studiolo of Francesco I]].

He is the father of [[Cristofano Allori]] (1577–1621).

In 2006 the BBC foreign correspondent [[Charles Wheeler (journalist)|Sir Charles Wheeler]] returned an original Alessandro Allori painting to the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. He had been given it in Germany in 1952, but only recently realized its origin and that it must have been looted in the wake of [[World War II]]. The work is possibly a portrait of Eleonora (Dianora) di Toledo de' Medici, niece of [[Eleonora di Toledo]], and measures 12&amp;nbsp;cm x 16&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=&quot;charleswheeler&quot;&gt;{{

{{History of Morocco}}
The '''Almoravids''' ([[Berber languages|Berber]]: '''Imṛabḍen''', [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Al-Murābiṭūn'') were a Berber-Muslim [[dynasty]] of [[North Africa]], who lived between the current [[Senegal]] and south of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;Extract from [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/A912241/ALMORAVIDES.htm Encyclopedia Universalis on Almoravids]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Buresi, « Vie et mort des empires berbères », ''in'' L'Histoire, november 2008, n°336, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

It is affiliated to the [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes of [[Sanhaja]] and [[Lamtuna]]. From the 11th century  to the 12th century, their empire was extended over present-day [[Morocco]], [[Mauritania]], southern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], western present-day [[Algeria]] and a part of what is now [[Mali]]. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched 3,000 kilometres north to south. Almoravids built the city of [[Marrakesh]] and made it their capital city which became then one of the most influential centers of power in Africa and the Mediterranean region.

==Origins==
In his book ''The Muslim Conquest and Settlement of North Africa and Spain'', the author Abd al-Wahid Dhannūn Taha, based on several sources including bibliographic of [[Ibn Khaldun]], provides, on pages 26 and 29 of his book, information on the geographical distribution of Sanhaja tribes. He does the same for the different tribes and tribal Berber branch of the [[Maghreb]] and information on the different tribes or ethnic groups (Arabs, Berbers and sub-Saharan African) who participated in the Muslim conquest of Visigothic Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=ʻAbd al-Wāḥid Dhannūn Ṭāhā|title=The Muslim conquest and settlement of North Africa and Spain|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-00474-8}} ({{google books|TgcOAAAAQAAJ|online}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology of  ''[[Murabit|murābiṭ]]'' is not clear. Some have suggested that the word might be derived from the Arabic ''[[ribat|ribaṭ]]'', meaning fortress.

When the Almoravids began their political rise, the Kingdom of Fez (Morocco's first name) of the [[Idrisid]] dynasty  was split into a series of small emirates located mainly north of the country, and headed by relatives of the royal family.

According to French historian Bernard Lugan and others, the lure of wealth from trade in the South (Sahara) and marketed to the North (the West) attracted various tribes to crossroads city such as [[Marrakech]], which become the capital of various dynasties, especially those from the South (Almoravids, [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], Saadian). [[Kevin Shillington]] proposes that the Almoravid movement had origins in efforts of the Sanhaja of the [[Awdaghust]] area, especially the Lamtuna tribe, to defeat the influence of the [[Ghana Empire]] in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;shilling88&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=History of Africa|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=175 5th Avenue, New York, NY, USA|isbn=9780333599570|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almoravid unity also protected other tribes from the domination of the [[Zenata people|Zenata]] tribes to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;shilling89&quot;&gt;Shillington 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful of the tribes of the [[Sahara]] near the [[Sénégal River]] was the [[Lamtuna]], whose culture of origin was 'Wadi Noun' (Nul Lemta). They later came together as the upper Leger river culture, which founded the city of [[Aoudaghost]]. They converted to [[Islam]] in the ninth century. 

About the year 1040 (or a little earlier) one of their chiefs, [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], made the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Makkah]]. On his way home, he attended the teachers of the mosque at university of Al-Qayrawan, today's [[Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]]; the first Arab-Muslim city in [[North Africa]], who soon learnt from him that his people knew little of the religion they were supposed to profess, and that though his will was good, his own ignorance was great.  By the good offices of the theologians of [[Al Qayrawan]], one of whom was from [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], Yahya was provided with a missionary, [[Ibn Yasin|Abdallah ibn Yasin]], a zealous partisan of the [[Maliki]]s, one of the four [[Four Schools of Madhhab|Madhhab]], Sunni schools of Islam.

His preaching was before long rejected by the Lamtunas;&lt;ref name=&quot;shilling88&quot; /&gt; so on the advice of Yahya, who accompanied him, he retired to [[Sahara]]n regions from which his influence spread. His creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[Sunnah|Orthodox tradition]].

Abdallah ibn Yasin imposed a penitential scourging on all converts as a purification, and enforced a regular system of discipline for every breach of the law, including the chiefs themselves. Under such directions, the Almoravids were brought into excellent order. Their first military leader, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, gave them a good military organization.  Their main force was infantry, armed with [[Spear|javelin]]s in the front ranks and [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]s behind, which formed into a [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]]; it was supported by [[camel]]men and [[horse]]men on the [[Flanking maneuver|flank]]s.

==Conquests==
===Northern Africa===
[[Image:Almoravid-empire-en.svg|thumb|left|300px|The Almoravid dynasty at its greatest extent]]
From the year 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert. After winning over the [[Sanhaja]] Berber tribe, they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route, seizing [[Sijilmasa]] at the northern and [[Aoudaghost]] at the southern end by 1055.&lt;ref name=&quot;shilling89&quot; /&gt; Yahya ibn Ibrahim was killed in a battle in 1057,&lt;ref name=&quot;shilling90&quot;&gt;Shillington 90&lt;/ref&gt; but Abd-Allah ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount, named his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar]] as chief.  Under him, the Almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert, and subjected the tribes of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. They then came in contact with the [[Berghouata]], a branch of the [[Masmuda]] of central Morocco, who followed a &quot;heresy&quot; founded by [[Salih ibn Tarif]], three centuries earlier. The Berghouata made a fierce resistance, and it was in battle with them that Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed in 1059. They were, however, completely conquered by [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar]], who took the defeated chief's widow, [[Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat|Zainab]], as a wife.

[[File:Almoravids Sevilla Spain 1116.jpg|thumb|Coin of the Almoravids, [[Sevilla]], [[Spain]], 1116. [[British Museum]].]]
In 1061, [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar]] made a division of the power he had established, handing over the more-settled parts to his cousin [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], as [[viceroy]], resigning to him also his favourite wife Zainab.  For himself, he reserved the task of suppressing the revolts which had broken out in the desert, but when he returned to resume control, he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded. He returned to the Sahara, where, in 1087, having been wounded with a poisoned arrow, he died.

Yusuf ibn Tashfin had in the meantime brought what is now known as Morocco, [[Western Sahara]] and [[Mauretania]] into complete subjection. In 1062 he founded the city of [[Marrakech]]. In 1080, he conquered the kingdom of [[Tlemcen]] (in modern-day [[Algeria]]) and founded the present city of that name, his rule extending as far east as [[Oran]].

===Ghana Empire===
There has been a belief by some that the Almoravids conquered the [[Ghana Empire]] sometime around 1075 AD. According to Arab tradition, the ensuing war pushed Ghana over the edge, ending the kingdom's position as a commercial and military power by 1100, as it collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies, some of which later assimilated into the Almoravids while others founded the [[Mali Empire]]. However, the Almoravid religious influence was gradual and not heavily involved in military strife, as Almoravids increased in power by marrying among the nation's nobility. Scholars such as Dierk Lange attribute the decline of ancient Ghana to numerous unrelated factors, only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by Almalvorid influence and Islamic pressures, but devoid of any military conversion and conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Dierk (1996). &quot;The Almoravid expansion and the downfall of Ghana&quot;, ''Der Islam'' 73, pp. 122-159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Iberia===
In 1086 [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] was invited by the ''[[taifa]]'' Muslim princes of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Al-Andalus]]) to defend them against [[Alfonso VI of León|Alfonso VI]], King of [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. In that year, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] crossed the straits to [[Algeciras]], inflicted a severe defeat on the Christians at the [[Battle of az-Zallaqah]] (Battle of Sagrajas). He was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in [[Africa]], which he had to settle in person.

When he returned to Iberia in 1090, it was avowedly for the purpose of deposing the Muslim princes, and annexing their states. He had in his favour the mass of the inhabitants, who had been worn out by the oppressive taxation imposed by their spend-thrift rulers. Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east, (most notably, [[al-Ghazali]] in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[al-Tartushi]] in Egypt, who was himself an Iberian by birth, from [[Tortosa]]), detested the native Muslim princes for their religious indifference, and gave Yusuf a ''[[fatwa]]'' -- or legal opinion—to the effect that he had good moral and religious right, to dethrone the rulers, whom he saw as heterodox and who did not scruple to seek help from the Christians, whose habits he claimed they had adopted. By 1094, he had removed them all, except for the one at [[Zaragoza]]; and though he regained little from the Christians except [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], he re-united the Muslim power, and gave a check to the reconquest of the country by the Christians.

After friendly correspondence with the caliph at [[Baghdad]], whom he acknowledged as ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' (&quot;Commander of the Faithful&quot;), Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1097 assumed the title of ''Amir al Muslimin'' (&quot;Commander of the Muslims&quot;). He died in 1106, when he was reputed to have reached the age of 100.

The Almoravid power was at its height at Yusuf's death, and the Moorish empire then included all North-West Africa as far as [[Algiers]], and all of Iberia south of the [[Tagus]], with the east coast as far as the mouth of the [[Ebro]], and included the [[Balearic Islands]].

==Decline==
Three years afterwards, under Yusuf's son and successor, [[Ali ibn Yusuf]], [[Sintra]] and [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] were added, and Iberia was again invaded in 1119 and 1121, but the tide had turned, the French having assisted the Aragonese to recover [[Zaragoza]].  In 1138, Ali ibn Yusuf was defeated by [[Alfonso VII of León]], and in the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), by [[Afonso I of Portugal]], who thereby won his crown. [[Lisbon]] was recovered by the Portuguese in 1147.

Ali ibn Yusuf was a pious non-entity, who fasted and prayed while his empire fell to pieces {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} under the combined action of his Christian foes in Iberia and the agitation of [[Almohads]] (the Muwahhids) in Morocco. After Ali ibn Yusuf's death in 1143, his son Tashfin ibn Ali lost ground rapidly before the Almohads, and in 1146 he was killed by a fall from a precipice while attempting to escape after a defeat near [[Oran]].

His two successors were [[Ibrahim ibn Tashfin]] and [[Is'haq ibn Ali]], but their reigns were short. The conquest of the city of [[Marrakech]] by the Almohads in 1147 marked the fall of the dynasty, though fragments of the Almoravids (the [[Banu Ghaniya]]), continued to struggle in the Balearic Islands, and finally in [[Tunisia]].

Interestingly, family names such as ''[[Morabito]]'', ''Murabito'' and ''Mirabito'' are common in western [[Sicily]], the [[Aeolian Islands]] and southern [[Calabria]] in [[Italy]]. These names may have appeared in this region as early as the eleventh century, when [[Robert Guiscard]] and the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] conquered the Muslim [[emirate of Sicily]]. In addition to southern Italy, there are also sizable populations of ''Mourabit'' (also spelled  ''[[Morabit]]'', ''[[Murabit]]'' or ''Morabet'') in modern-day [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Mauritania]].

'''''Aloe''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|l|ə|ʊ}}; also ''Aloë'') is a [[genus]] containing about four hundred [[species]] of [[flowering plant|flowering]] [[succulent plant|succulent]] [[plant]]s.  The most common and well known of these is ''[[Aloe vera]]'', or &quot;true aloe&quot;.

The genus is native to [[Africa]], and is common in [[South Africa]]'s [[Cape Province]], the mountains of tropical Africa, and neighboring areas such as [[Madagascar]], the [[Arabian peninsula]], and the islands of Africa.

The [[APG III system]] (2009) places the genus in the family family [[Xanthorrhoeaceae]], subfamily [[Asphodeloideae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Stevens |first=P.F. |year=2001 onwards |title=Angiosperm Phylogeny Website: Asparagales: Asphodeloideae |url=http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/asparagalesweb.htm#Asphodelaceae }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past it has also been assigned to families [[Aloaceae]] and [[Liliaceae]] or lily family. Members of the closely allied genera ''[[Gasteria]]'', ''[[Haworthia]]'' and ''[[Kniphofia]]'', which have a similar mode of growth, are also popularly known as aloes. Note that the plant sometimes called American aloe (''[[Agave americana]]'') belongs to [[Agavaceae]], a different family.

Most ''Aloe'' species have a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] of large, thick, fleshy [[Leaf|leaves]]. The leaves are often lance-shaped with a sharp apex and a spiny margin. ''Aloe'' [[flower]]s are tubular, frequently yellow, orange, pink or red, and are borne, densely clustered and pendant, at the apex of simple or branched, leafless stems.

Many species of ''Aloe'' appear to be stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level;  other varieties may have a branched or unbranched [[plant stem|stem]] from which the fleshy leaves spring. They vary in color from grey to bright-green and are sometimes striped or [[mottle]]d. Some ''Aloes'' native to South Africa are [[wiktionary:arborescent|arborescent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superstock.com/stock-photography/Aloe/Tree Images of aloe trees.]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2007}}
''Aloe'' species are frequently cultivated as ornamental plants both in gardens and in pots. Many ''Aloe'' species are highly decorative and are valued by collectors of succulents.  [[Aloe vera]] is used both internally and externally on humans, and is claimed to have some medicinal effects, which have been supported by scientific and medical research. The gel in the leaves can be made into a smooth type of cream that can heal burns such as sunburn. They can also be made into types of special soaps.




===Historical uses===

Historical use of various ''Aloe'' species by [[human]]s is well documented.  Documentation of the clinical effectiveness is available, although relatively limited.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, T (ed) Aloes: The genus ''Aloe''. CRC Press. ISBN 978-0-415-30672-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 299 species of ''Aloe'', only a few were used traditionally as a [[herbal medicine]], [[aloe vera]] again being the most commonly used version of aloe in herbal medicine.  Also included are ''Aloe perryi'' (found in northeastern [[Africa]]) and ''Aloe ferox'' (found in [[South Africa]]). The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used ''aloe vera'' to treat [[wound]]s. In the [[Middle Ages]], the yellowish liquid found inside the [[leaf|leaves]] was favored as a [[purgative]].{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} Processed aloe that contains [[aloin]] is generally used as a laxative, whereas processed [[aloe vera juice]] does not usually contain significant aloin.

Some species, particularly ''[[Aloe vera]]'' are used in [[alternative medicine]] and in the home [[first aid]]s.

Today, aloe vera is used both internally and externally on humans.  The gel found in the leaves is used for soothing minor burns, [[wound]]s, and various skin conditions like [[eczema]] and [[ringworm]]. The extracted [[aloe vera juice]] aloe vera plant is used internally to treat a variety of digestive conditions.  The use of this herbal medicine was popularized in the 1950s in many Western [[Country|countries]]. The gel's effect is nearly immediate; it also applies a layer over [[wound]]s that is said to reduce the chance of any [[infection]].

There have been relatively few studies about possible benefits of ''Aloe'' gel taken internally.

==Aloin in OTC laxative products==
[[File:Split Aloe.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Succulent plant]]s, such as this Aloe, store water in their enlarged fleshy leaves, stems, or roots, as shown in this split aloe leaf. This allows them to survive in arid environments.]] On May 9, 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule banning the use of [[aloin]], the yellow sap of the aloe plant for use as a laxative ingredient in [[over-the-counter drug]] products.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12001972&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=Status of certain additional over-the-counter drug category II and III active ingredients.

===Chemical properties ===  	
	
According to W. A. Shenstone, two classes of [[aloin]]s are to be recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield [[picric acid|picric]] and [[oxalic acid]]s with [[nitric acid]], and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid; and (2) [[barbaloin]]s, which yield aloetic acid (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), chrysammic acid (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group hi may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbados ''Aloe'', and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from Socotrine and Zanzibar ''Aloe'', reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) forms bright yellow scales.

''Aloe'' species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which its odour is due.{{citation needed|date=April 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alyattes''', king of [[Lydia]] (619–560 BC), considered to be the founder of the [[Lydian empire]], was the son of [[Sadyattes]], of the house of the [[Mermnadae]].

For several years he continued the war against [[Miletus]] begun by his father, but was obliged to turn his attention towards the [[Medes]] and [[Babylonians]]. On May 28, 585 BC, during the [[Battle of Halys (585 BC)|Battle of Halys]] fought  against [[Cyaxares]], king of Media, a [[solar eclipse]] took place (see also [[Thales]]); hostilities were suspended, peace concluded, and the [[Kızılırmak (river)|Halys]] fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms.

Alyattes drove the [[Cimmeria]]ns (see [[Scythia]]) from [[Asia Minor]], subdued the [[Carians]], and took several [[Ionia]]n cities (including [[İzmir|Smyrna]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]).  (Smyrna was sacked and destroyed with its inhabitants forced to move into the countryside.)

He standardised the weight of coins (1 Stater = 168 grains of wheat). The coins were produced using an anvil die technique and stamped with the Lion's head, the symbol of the Mermnadae.

He was succeeded by his son [[Croesus]]. His daughter [[Aryenis of Lydia]] was [[Queen consort]] of [[Astyages]], King of Media.

His tomb still exists on the plateau between Lake Gygaea and the river Hermus to the north of [[Sardis]]&amp;mdash;a large mound of earth with a substructure of huge stones.  It was excavated by [[Spiegelthal]] in 1854, who found that it covered a large vault of finely cut marble blocks approached by a flat-roofed passage of the same stone from the south.  The [[sarcophagus]] and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb.  All that was left were some broken alabaster vases, pottery and charcoal. On the summit of the mound were large [[phallus|phalli]] of stone.

==Naming disagreement==

It is considered that the name &quot;Alyattes II&quot; is likely to be incorrect. Its usage here is based on the online [http://lexicorient.com/e.o Encyclopaedia of the Orient]. Though this online work provides no references, its usage of &quot;Alyattes II&quot; is likely based on [[John Lemprière]]'s 1788 ''Classical Dictionary'' ([[Lemprière's Bibliotheca Classica|''Biblioteca Classica'']]), its full name being ''Classical Dictionary of Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors Writ Large, With Chronological Table''. This work, however, also doesn't cite its sources, but its sources were likely to be ancient epigraphs (or later works whose usage was based on ancient epigraphs) which are lists of kings on clay tablets and other media.

Epigraphic lists, however, are known by historians today to be generally unreliable as historical documents. For one thing, they sometimes combine kings from different regions. [http://www.metrum.org/gyges Livio C. Stecchini] contended, for instance, that Gyges was the first Lydian king and those before him, including the earlier Alyattes, were kings of nearby Maionia, a Phrygian dependency. What's more, epigraphic lists are often legendary rather than annalistic, including, for instance, the mythic hero Herakles as a city's founder or people's progenitor, as they do for the Lydians, so another possibility is that &quot;Alyattes I&quot; was a legendary rather than a historical figure.

The ancient historians Herodotos and Strabo both refer to Croeusus' father as Alyattes and make no mention of an earlier King Alyattes of Lydia in their writings on Lydia. The same is true of modern historians, archeologists, and numismatists who have focused on Lydia, including George M.A. Hanfmann, John Griffiths Pedley, Robert W. Wallace, Koray Konuk, and Andrew Ramage. Likewise, other newer references such as ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'' and ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' don't use &quot;Alyattes II&quot; and make no mention of an earlier Lydian king named Alyattes.

While the phrase '''age of consent''' typically does not appear in legal [[statute]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;waites&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Waites| first=Matthew| title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| year=2005| isbn=1-4039-2173-3| oclc=238887395 58604878}}&lt;/ref&gt; when used in relation to [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], the age of consent is the minimum age at which a person is considered to be legally competent of consenting to sexual acts. The [[European Union]] calls it the '''legal age for sexual activities'''. It should not be confused with the [[age of majority]], [[defense of infancy|age of criminal responsibility]], the [[marriageable age]], the age at which one can purchase and consume alcoholic beverages, or drive a car, or other purposes.

The age of consent varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;waites&quot; /&gt; The relevant age may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a [[position of trust]]. Some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a relatively low-level [[misdemeanor]] such as ''corruption of a minor'', to ''[[statutory rape]]'' (which is considered equivalent to rape, both in severity and sentencing). Many jurisdictions regard any sexual activity by an adult involving a child as [[child sexual abuse]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

There are many [[grey area (concept)|grey areas]] in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of highly charged debates.&lt;ref name=&quot;waites&quot; /&gt;

==History and social attitudes==
Traditionally{{where}} the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide, or a tribal custom. In most cases this coincided with signs of puberty, [[menstruation]] for a woman and pubic hair for a man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html | title=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded age-of-consent law dates back 800 years: In 1275, in England, as part of the rape law, a statute, Westminster 1, made it a misdemeanor to &quot;ravish&quot; a &quot;maiden within age,&quot; whether with or without her consent. The phrase &quot;within age&quot; was interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was twelve years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230 |title=Children and Youth in History &amp;#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], the influential founder of [[Canon law]] in [[medieval]] Europe, accepted age of puberty for marriage to be between twelve and fourteen but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if the children were older than seven. There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage. It should be noted that Judges honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than seven, in spite of what Gratian had said; there are recorded marriages of two and three year olds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent&quot;/&gt;

The American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide. For example, Mary Hathaway (Virginia, 1689) was only nine when she was married to William Williams. Sir Edward Coke (England, 17th century) made it clear that &quot;the marriage of girls under twelve was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a dower from her husband's estate was nine even though her husband be only four years old.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent&quot;/&gt;

Reliable data for when people used to marry is very difficult to find. In England for example,  the only reliable data on age at marriage in the early modern period comes from records which involved only those who left property after their death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seemed that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Additionally, 20th and 21st centuries' historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept data regarding young ages of marriage, and would instead explain the data away as a misreading by a later copier of the records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent&quot;/&gt;

A small group of Italian and German states which introduced an age of consent in the 16th century also set it at twelve years. Towards the end of the 18th century, other European nations also began to enact age of consent laws. The French Napoleonic Code established an age of consent of eleven years in 1791, which was raised to thirteen years in 1863. Nations such as Portugal, Spain, Denmark and the Swiss cantons, initially  set the age of consent at ten–twelve years and then raised it to between thirteen and sixteen years in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia&quot;/&gt;

In the United States, by the 1880s, most states set the age of consent at ten or twelve, and in one state, Delaware, the age of consent was only seven. A New York Times article states that it was still aged seven in Delaware in 1895. &lt;ref&gt;The New York Times. October 15, 1895 - http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B01EEDC113AE533A25756C1A9669D94649ED7CF&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22age+of+consent%22+delaware&amp;st=p&lt;/ref&gt; Women reformers and advocates of social purity initiated a campaign in 1885 to petition legislators to raise the legal age of consent to at least sixteen, with ultimate goal to raise the age to eighteen; the campaign was  successful: by 1920, almost all states had raised the age of consent to sixteen or eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230?section=primarysources&amp;source=24 |title=Children and Youth in History &amp;#124; Age of Consent Laws |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/teacher/aoc.htm |title=Campaign to Raise the Legal Age of Consent, 1885-1914, Lesson Plan |publisher=Womhist.alexanderstreet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social (and the resulting legal) attitudes toward the appropriate age of consent have drifted upwards in modern times. For example, while ages from ten to thirteen were typically acceptable in [[western world|western countries]] during the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;waites&quot; /&gt; the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century were marked by changing attitudes towards sexuality, childhood and adolescence, resulting in raising the ages of consent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Robertson, University of Sydney, Australia&quot;/&gt;

==Law==
[[File:Age of Consent.png|thumb|Age of consent in different countries]]
Sexual relations with a person under the age of consent can be a [[criminal offence]] with punishments ranging from [[community service]] to the [[death penalty]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Many different terms exist for the charges laid and include ''[[child sexual abuse]]'', ''[[statutory rape]]'', ''illegal [[carnal knowledge]]'', and ''[[corruption of a minor]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;waites&quot; /&gt;

The enforcement practices of age-of-consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture (see above). Often, enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law, with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially-unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals, or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor (e.g., a teacher, minister, or doctor). The [[Gender#Sex|sex]] of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individual's guilt and therefore enforcement.&lt;ref name=&quot;waites&quot; /&gt;

===&quot;Age&quot;===
The concept of what actually makes up an age of consent differs between jurisdictions. Common examples include:
* '''Fixed age of consent'''— in most jurisdictions the age of consent is actually a specified fixed age, such as in the [[UK]] where it is 16.&lt;ref name=SOA2003/&gt;
* '''Onset of [[puberty]] as the age of consent'''— in some jurisdictions there is no fixed age of consent. Instead, sex is allowed with people who are sexually mature. In females it usually means passing [[menarche]]. Such jurisdictions include [[Ages of consent in Asia#Yemen|Yemen]], but only in marriage, the states of [[Nayarit]] and [[Querétaro]] in ([[Ages of consent in North America#Mexico|Mexico]]) and [[Ages of consent in South America#Bolivia|Bolivia]].
* '''Marriageable age'''— not all countries have an age of consent, but a number of those jurisdictions (including [[Kuwait]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuwait&quot;/&gt;) make all [[sexual intercourse]] outside of marriage illegal.

===Defences and exceptions===
The age of consent is a legal barrier to the minor ability to consent and therefore obtaining consent is not in general a defence to having sexual relations with a person under the prescribed age. Common examples:
* '''Reasonably believing that the victim is over the age of consent'''—in some jurisdictions, (such as [[England and Wales]]&lt;ref name=SOA2003&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf |format=PDF|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 (See Sections 9 to 12) |publisher=Published by the Government of the United Kingdom, (Office of Public Sector Information)}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it is a defence if the accused can show that he or she reasonably believed the victim was over the age of consent. However, where such a defence is provided, it normally applies only when the victim is close to the age of consent or the accused can show [[due diligence]] in determining the age of the victim (e.g., a 15-year-old who used a fake identification document to enter a bar for persons 18 and older).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Larry W. Myers | title=Reasonable Mistake of Age: A Needed Defence to Statutory Rape| journal= Michigan Law Review| volume= 64| issue=1|year=1965|pages=105–136. – [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0026–2234%28196511%2964%3A1%3C105%3ARMOAAN%3E2.0.CO%3B2–D] | doi=10.2307/1287118|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|jstor=1287118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Marriage'''— in jurisdictions, including [[Brunei]]&lt;ref name=Brunei_01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/CsaBrunei.pdf |title=Legislation of Interpol member states on sexual offences against children - Brunei |publisher=Interpol |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]],&lt;ref name=India_01 &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/IndianPenalCode/S375.htm |title=Indian Penal Code}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is an exception to age of consent laws if the accused can show that he or she is legally married to the other person.
* '''Close-in-age'''—while most legislation dealing with age of consent sets a single age under which sexual relations are illegal, some jurisdictions (such as [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/01/crime-bill.html|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=2008-05-01|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;), have adopted close-in-age exemptions. In Canada the age of consent is 16, but there are two close-in-age exemptions: teenagers who are 14 or 15 may have sex with a partner who is less than five years older,  and children aged 12 and 13 may have sex with a partner who is less than two years older.  In the United States, these exceptions are colloquially known as [[Romeo and Juliet laws|&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; laws]].

These different defences can change dramatically from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, even between neighboring states of the same union with the same age of consent.

===Discrepancies and inconsistencies===
The age of consent is not always constant even within the same jurisdiction, in many countries there are a number of discrepancies. Common examples include:
* '''Homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies'''&amp;nbsp;– some jurisdictions, such as [[The Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], [[Chile]], [[Greece]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Suriname]], have a higher age of consent for [[homosexuality|homosexual]] intercourse. However, such disparities are increasingly being challenged. In [[Canada]], and the [[Australia]]n state of [[Queensland]], the age of consent for [[anal sex]] is officially higher at 18, compared with 16 for vaginal and oral sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;can&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.159.html |title=159. ANAL INTERCOURSE |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aust&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s208.html |title=CRIMINAL CODE 1899 - SECT 208 208 Unlawful sodomy |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] provinces in Canada, this difference is declared unconstitutional by courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060622/age_consent_060622/20060623/ |title=Mixed reviews to Tories' sexual consent bill - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egale.ca/index.asp?item=468 |title=Egale Canada &gt; The State of the Play |publisher=Egale.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gender age discrepancies'''&amp;nbsp;– in some jurisdictions (such as [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Indonesia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaIndonesia.asp |title=Sexual Offences Laws - Indonesia |publisher=Interpol |accessdate=2009-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), there are different ages of consent for heterosexual sexual activity based on the gender of each person. In countries where there is a gender different for heterosexual activity usually females are lower than male, for example in Indonesia males have to be of 19 years old and females 16 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indonesia&quot; /&gt; There are also a number of jurisdictions which have this gender different generated due to the laws governing marriage (such as [[Kuwait]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuwait&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/2f5665ae20b956cb8025675a0033cafb?Opendocument |title=Summary record of the 488th meeting : Kuwait |publisher=Committee on the Rights of the Child |accessdate=2009-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Palestinian National Authority|Israel]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Palestine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/palestine.htm |title=Palestinian Territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip - Marriage Age |publisher=Emory Law |accessdate=2009-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;); in these jurisdictions it is illegal to have [[sexual intercourse]] outside of marriage so the de facto age of consent is the marriageable age. In Kuwait this means that girls have to be at least 15 years old and boys 17 years old.
* '''Position of authority/trust'''&amp;nbsp;– in some parts of the world (such as England and Wales&lt;ref name=SOA2003_a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf |format=PDF|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 (See Sections 16 to 24) |publisher=Published by the Government of the United Kingdom, (Office of Public Sector Information)}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in cases where a person is in a position of trust over a child or young person the age of consent is set higher. Examples include a teacher and student.

===Extraterritoriality===
Increasingly the age of consent laws of a state are applied not only to acts committed on its own territory, but also acts committed by its nationals or inhabitants on foreign territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;waites&quot; /&gt; Such provisions have been frequently adopted to help reduce the incidence of [[child sex tourism]].{{or|date=December 2010}}

===Statutory rape===
{{Main|Statutory rape}}&lt;!-- Please note that this section is a summary of another article and should reflect that article's current state. Do not add any extra information here, rather edit the alternate article and then summarize that article here. --&gt;
Where a jurisdiction's age of consent laws for sexual activity treat those convicted of those laws with the same severity as they do with [[rape]], the law is often referred to as '''statutory rape'''. The different titles of age of consent laws include ''statutory rape, rape of a child, corruption of a minor, carnal knowledge of a minor'' and others. However, in the [[vernacular]] many of these terms are interchangeable and little differentiation is made.

===Marriage===

The age at which a person can be legally married can also differ from the age of consent. In jurisdictions where the marriageable age is lower than the age of consent, those laws override the age of consent laws, at least as they apply to the spouse. Further still, some jurisdictions prohibit any sex outside of marriage, which can take place at any age, as in the case of [[Yemen]].

===Pornography===

Variations also exist in some countries between the age of consent and the age at which an individual can appear in [[pornography|pornographic]] images and films. In many jurisdictions, the minimum age for legal participation and even viewing of such productions is 18. Films and images showing individuals under the age of 18 (or who appear to be under in some jurisdictions{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}) in applicable jurisdictions can be classified as child pornography, even though the legal age of consent in those same jurisdictions is lower than 17.

===Prostitution===
{{Main|Prostitution of children}}&lt;!-- Please note that this section is a summary of another article and should reflect that article's current state. Do not add any extra information here, rather edit the alternate article and then summarize that article here. --&gt;
While the legality of adult [[prostitution]] varies among different parts of the world, the prostitution of [[minor (law)|minors]] is illegal in all countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Furthermore, some countries (for example, Canada{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}) enforce worldwide jurisdiction over any involvement in child prostitution by their nationals.

==Initiatives to change the age of consent==
{{Main|Age of consent reform}}

{{Law unref section|date=January 2009}}
Age of consent reform refers to the efforts of some individuals or groups, for different reasons and with varying arguments, to raise, lower, abolish or otherwise alter age of consent laws. These efforts advocate five main positions:
* An introduction of close-in-age exceptions.
* A change in the way age of consent laws are examined in court.
* An increase in the ages of consent, more severe penalties for violation of these laws or both.
* A decrease in the ages of consent, less severe penalties for violation of these laws or both.
* To abolish the age of consent laws altogether or as a temporary practical expedient.

==Ages of consent in various countries==
Specific jurisdictions' laws relating to age of consent can be found, organized by region, on the following pages:

*[[Ages of consent in Africa|Africa]]
*[[Ages of consent in Asia|Asia]]
*[[Ages of consent in Oceania|Oceania]]
*[[Ages of consent in Europe|Europe]]
*[[Ages of consent in North America|North America]]
*[[Ages of consent in South America|South America]]

There are no specific age of consent laws in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. In the unlikely event of a minor engaging in sexual activity, under the [[Antarctic Treaty]], scientists and support staff stationed there may be subject to the laws of the country of which they are nationals. Other visitors to the continent may need to follow the laws of the country in which their expedition is organized, or the country from which it departs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AusAnt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=78 |title=What is the treaty? |accessdate=2006-07-18 |date=2006-03-23 |publisher=Australian Antarctic Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alypius of Antioch''' was a [[geographer]] and a [[vicarius]] of [[Roman Britain]], probably in the late 350s AD. He replaced [[Flavius Martinus]] after that vicarius' suicide. His rule is recorded is [[Ammianus]] XXIII 1, 3.

He came from [[Antioch]] and served under [[Constantius II]] and was probably appointed to ensure that nobody with western associations was serving in Britain during a time of mistrust, rebellion and suppression symbolised by the brutal acts of the imperial notary [[Paulus Catena]]. He may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named [[Carausius II]].

Alypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] as part of Julian's systematic attempt to reverse the [[Christianization]] of the [[Roman Empire]] by restoring [[Paganism|pagan]] and, in this case, [[Judaism|Jewish]] practices. Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to [[Rome]], the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists.

'''Amalasuntha''' (also known as '''Amalasuentha''', '''Amalaswintha''', '''Amalasuintha''', '''Amalswinthe''' or '''Amalasontha''') (ca. 495 &amp;ndash; 30 April 534/535) was a queen of the [[Ostrogoths]] from 526 to 534.

She was married in 515 to [[Eutharic]] (b. ca 480 - 522), an Ostrogoth noble of the old [[Amali|Amal]] line, who had previously been living in [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]], son of Widerich (b. ca 450), grandson of Berismund (b. ca 410), and great-grandson of [[Thorismund]] (d. aft. 400), [[King of the Ostrogoths]] ca 400.

Her husband died, apparently in the early years of her marriage, leaving her with two children, [[Athalaric]] and [[Matasuntha]] (ca 517 - aft. 550), wife ca 550 of [[Germanus (cousin of Justinian I)|Germanus]].  On the death of her father in 526, her son succeeded him, but she held the power as [[regent]] for her son.  Deeply imbued with the old Roman culture, she gave to that son's education a more refined and literary turn than suited the ideas of her Gothic subjects.  Conscious of her unpopularity she banished, and afterwards put to death, three Gothic nobles whom she suspected of intriguing against her rule, and at the same time opened negotiations with the emperor [[Justinian I]] with the view of removing herself and the Gothic treasure to [[Constantinople]]. Her son's death in 534 made little change in the posture of affairs.

Now queen, Amalasuntha made her cousin [[Theodahad]] partner of her throne (not, as sometimes stated, her husband, for his wife was still living), with the intent of strengthening her position.  The choice was unfortunate, for Theodahad fostered the disaffection of the Goths, and either by his orders or with his permission, Amalasuntha was imprisoned in the island of Martana in the Tuscan lake of Bolsena, where on 30 April in the spring of 534/535 she was murdered in her bath.

The letters of [[Cassiodorus]], chief minister and literary adviser of Amalasuntha, and the histories of [[Procopius]] and [[Jordanes]], give us our chief information as to the character of Amalasuntha.

The life of Amalasunta was made the subject of a [[tragedy]], the first play written by the young [[Goldoni]] and presented at [[Milan]] in (1733).

[[File:Amalric of Bena.jpg|thumb|228px|]]
'''Amalric of Bena''' ({{fr icon}} '''Amaury de Bène''' or '''Amaury de Chartres'''; {{la icon}} '''Almaricus, Amalricus, Amauricus'''; died c. 1204-1207) was a [[France|French]] [[theology|theologian]], after whom the [[Amalricians]] are named.

==Biography==
He was born in the latter part of the 12th century at Bennes, a village between [[Ollé]] and [[Chauffours]] in the [[diocese of Chartres]].

He taught philosophy and theology at the [[University of Paris]] and enjoyed a great reputation as a subtle [[dialectic]]ian; his lectures developing the [[philosophy of Aristotle]] attracted a large circle of hearers.  In 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university, and, on a personal appeal to [[Pope Innocent III]], the sentence was ratified, Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors.

His death was caused, it is said, by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected.
In 1209 ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris, and Amalric's own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds.  The doctrines of his followers, known as the [[Amalrician]]s, were formally condemned by the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215.

==Propositions==
Amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|Eriugena]], whose principles he developed in a one-sided and strongly [[pantheist]]ic form.

Three propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him:

#that God is all (''omnia sunt deus'') and thus all things are one because whatever is, is God (''omnia unum, quia quidquid est, est Deus'');
#that every Christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of Christ, and that this belief is necessary for salvation;
#that he who remains in love of God can commit no sin.

Because of the first proposition, God himself is thought as invisible and only recognizable in his creation.

These three propositions were further developed by his followers, who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation, the first in the Biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], marking the ''epoch of the Father''; the second in [[Jesus Christ]], who began the ''epoch of the Son''; and the third in Amalric and his disciples, who inaugurated the ''era of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]].''

Amalricians taught:

Hell is ignorance, therefore Hell is within all men, &quot;like a bad tooth in a mouth&quot;;

God is identical with all that is, even evil belongs to God and proves God's omnipotence;

A man who knows that God works through everything cannot sin, because every human act is then the act of God;

A man who recognizes the truth that God works through everything is already in Heaven and this is the only resurrection.  There is no other life; man's fulfilment is in this life alone.

Due to persecutions, this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder. Not long after the burning of ten of their members (1210), the sect itself lost its importance, while some of the surviving Amalricians became [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pinselpark.org/geschichte/einzel/p0375_mittelalter/r_haeresie.html (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hosea Ballou]], then [[Pierre Batiffol]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Apocatastasis|Apocatastasis]]&quot;. ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; (1911) and [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc01.html?term=Apocatastasis Apocatastasis]&quot;. ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. I''.&lt;/ref&gt; (1914) Amalric was a believer that all people would eventually be saved and this was one of the counts upon which he was declared a heretic by [[Pope Innocent III]].

'''Afonso I''' or '''Dom Afonso Henriques''' &lt;ref&gt;Or also ''Affonso'' (Archaic [[Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin]] version), sometimes rendered in English as ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse'', depending on the Spanish or French influence.&lt;/ref&gt; (''c.'' 1109, [[Guimarães]] or [[Viseu]] – 6 December 1185, [[Coimbra]]), more commonly known as '''Afonso Henriques''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu ẽˈʁikɨʃ}}), nicknamed &quot;the Conqueror&quot; ({{lang-pt|o Conquistador}}), &quot;the Founder&quot; ({{lang|pt|''o Fundador''}}) or &quot;the Great&quot; ({{lang|pt|''o Grande''}}) by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and  ''El-Bortukali'' (&quot;the Portuguese&quot;) and ''Ibn-Arrik'' (&quot;son of Henry&quot;, &quot;Henriques&quot;) by the [[Moors]] whom he fought, was the first [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]]. He achieved the independence of the southern part of the Kingdom of Galicia—County of Portugal—from the [[León|Kingdom of León]], in 1139, doubling its area with the ''[[Reconquista]]'', an objective that he pursued until his death, in 1185, after forty-six years of wars against the Moors.

==Life==
Afonso I was the son of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry of Burgundy, regent of Portugal]], and [[Teresa, Countess of Portugal|Queen Teresa, Countess of Portugal]], the natural daughter of King [[Alfonso VI of León]], heir by his grandmother of the first County of Portugal, which she received as a personal dowry. Afonso took the title of King of the Portuguese on 25 July 1139, immediately after the [[Battle of Ourique]], acclaimed by his army, and died on 6 December 1185 in [[Coimbra]].

At the end of the 11th century, the [[Iberian Peninsula]] political agenda was mostly concerned with the ''[[Reconquista]]'', the driving out of the Muslim successor-states to the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Caliphate of Córdoba]] after its collapse. With European military aristocracies focused on the [[Crusades]], Alfonso VI called for the help of the French nobility to deal with the [[Moors]]. In exchange, he was to give the hands of two of his daughters in wedlock to the leaders of the expedition and bestow royal privileges to the others. Thus, the royal heiress [[Urraca of León]] wedded [[Raymond of Burgundy]], younger son of [[William I, Count of Burgundy]], and her half-sister, princess Teresa, wedded another French crusader, [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]], younger brother of [[Hugh I, Duke of Burgundy]]. Henry was made regent of Portugal during the minority of his childish wife, a burdensome county south of [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], where Moorish incursions and attacks were to be expected. Afterward succeeded by his wife Teresa in the same independent politic as rulers of Portugal, Henry had withstood the ordeal and initiated in Rome a politic of freeing their personal [[fief]] from [[suzerainty]] to the Leonese monarchy. In fact, the Visigoth Law established at the time that fiefs were personal property, and that crowns and kingdoms were to be shared in equal parts by all the children, which explains Teresa's claims to the Galician County of Portugal her father inherited from her grandmother among several other kingdoms and crowns, after he defeated his two kingdom-sharing dead brothers, the King of Galicia and Portugal, and the King of Castile.

[[Image:AfonsoHenriques-Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Tomb of Afonso Henriques in the [[Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]].]]
From this marriage several children were born, but only one son, '''Afonso Henriques''' (meaning &quot;Afonso son of Henry&quot;) survived. Infante Afonso, born in 1109, took the title of Prince after taking the throne of his mother, supported by the generality of the Portuguese nobility who disliked the alliance between Galicia and Portugal Queen Teresa had come to, marrying a second time the most powerful Galician count. In 1120, the young prince took the side of the [[archbishop of Braga]], a political foe of Teresa, and both were exiled by her orders.  In 1122 Afonso became fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century. He made himself a [[knight]] on his own account in the [[Cathedral of Zamora]], raised an army, and proceeded to take control of his lands. Near [[Guimarães]], at the [[Battle of São Mamede]] (1128) he overcame the troops under his mother's second husband and ally Count [[Fernando Peres de Trava]] of [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], exiling her forever to a [[monastery]] in Galicia. Thus the possibility of re-incorporating Portugal (up to then Southern Galicia) into a Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia as before was eliminated and Afonso became sole ruler ('''Duke of Portugal''') after demands for independence from the county's church and nobles. He also vanquished [[Alfonso VII of León]], came to the rescue of his mother, whose nephew he was, and thus freed the kingdom from political dependence on the crown of his cousin of León. On 6 April 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaimed himself '''Prince of Portugal'''.

Afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], and straight after was unanimously proclaimed '''King of the Portuguese''' by his soldiers, establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the Peninsula. The so called first assembly of the estates-general convened at [[Lamego]] (wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga, to confirm his independence) is a 17th century embellishment of Portuguese history.

Independence from Alfonso VII of León's suzerainty, however, was not a thing he just could achieve military. The County of Portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a Kingdom and, most importantly, by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope]]. Afonso wed [[Maud of Savoy]], daughter of [[Amadeus III, Count of Savoy]], and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope. He succeeded to relinquish suzerainty to his cousin Alfonso VII of León, becoming instead a subject of the papacy, as the kingdoms of Sicily and Aragón had done before him. In 1179 the bull ''[[Manifestis Probatum]]'' accepted the new King as vassal to the Pope exclusively.

In Portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. He is notably the builder of [[Alcobaça Monastery]], to which he called the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]] of his uncle [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. In 1143, he wrote to [[Pope Innocent II]] to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian Peninsula. Bypassing any king of León, Afonso declared himself the direct [[wikt:liege|liegeman]] of the Papacy. Thus, Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] (see [[Conquest of Santarém]]) and [[Lisbon]] in 1147 (see [[Siege of Lisbon]]). He also conquered an important part of the land south of the [[Tagus]] River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.

Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of León (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]] was engaged to [[Dulce of Aragon|Dulce]], sister of the [[Kings of Aragon|Count of Barcelona]], and princess of Aragon. Finally, in 1143, the [[Treaty of Zamora]] established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of León that Portugal was a sovereign kingdom.

In 1169 the now old Dom Afonso was disabled in an engagement near [[Badajoz]] by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of León, his son-in-law. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia (north of the Minho) in the previous years.

In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated. In the [[papal bull]] '' [[Manifestis Probatum]]'', [[Pope Alexander III]] acknowledged Afonso as King and Portugal as an independent crown with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a kingdom.

In 1184, in spite of his great age, he still had sufficient energy to relieve his son Dom Sancho, who was besieged in [[Siege of Santarém (1184)|Santarém]] by the Moors. Afonso died shortly after, on 6 December 1185.

The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the mythical founder of their nation. There are stories that it would take 10 men to carry his sword, and that Afonso would want to engage other monarchs in personal combat, but no one would dare accept his challenge.

==Scientific research==
In July 2006, the tomb of the king (which is located in the [[Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]]) was to be opened for scientific purposes by researchers from the [[University of Coimbra]] (Portugal), and the [[University of Granada]] (Spain). The opening of the tomb provoked considerable concern among some sectors of Portuguese society and [[IPPAR]] – ''Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico'' (Portuguese State Agency for Architectural Patrimony). The government halted the opening, requesting more protocols from the scientific team because of the importance of the king in the nation's formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dossiers.publico.pt/shownews.asp?id=1263265&amp;idCanal=1806 ''IPPAR: direcção nacional diz que não foi consultada sobre abertura do túmulo de D. Afonso Henriques''], [[Público]], 6 July 2006, accessed December 2006 '''(in Portuguese)'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Portuguese Culture Ministry suspends opening of Afonso I's tomb]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afonso II''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu}}; English ''Alphonzo''), or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin]] version), nicknamed &quot;the Fat&quot; ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''o Gordo''), third [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]], was born in [[Coimbra]] on 23 April 1185 and died on 25 March 1223 in the same city. He was the second but eldest surviving son of [[Sancho I of Portugal]] by his wife, [[Dulce of Aragon|Dulce]], Infanta of [[Aragon]]. Afonso succeeded his father in 1212.

As a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. Hitherto, his father Sancho I and his grandfather [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]], were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Castile]] or against the [[Moors|Moorish]] lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to insure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like [[Alcácer do Sal]] in 1217, were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen. This does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin.

Since military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the state's administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with [[private property]], civil justice, and [[Mint (coin)|minting]]. Afonso also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and began amicable commercial relations with most of them.

Other reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by Rome, his grandfather, Afonso I, had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the Church. These eventually created a state within the state. With Portugal's position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and Portugal. After being [[excommunicated]] for his audacities by [[Pope Honorius III]], Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in 1223 before making any serious attempts to do so.

'''Afonso III''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu}}; rare English alternatives: ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse''), or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin]]),  the ''Bolognian'' ([[Portuguese language|Port.]] ''o Bolonhês''), the fifth [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] (5 May 1210 in [[Coimbra]] – 16 February 1279 in [[Alcobaça (Portugal)|Alcobaça]], [[Coimbra]] or [[Lisbon]]) and the first to use the title ''King of Portugal and [[the Algarve]]'', from 1249. He was the second son of King [[Afonso II of Portugal]] and his wife, [[Urraca, princess of Castile]]; he succeeded his brother, King [[Sancho II of Portugal]], who was removed from the throne on 4 January 1248.

As the second son of King [[Afonso II of Portugal]], Afonso was not expected to inherit the throne, which was destined to go to his elder brother Sancho. He lived mostly in France, where he married Matilda, the heiress of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], in 1238, thereby becoming [[Count of Boulogne]]. In 1246, conflicts between his brother, the king, and the church became unbearable. [[Pope Innocent IV]] then ordered Sancho II to be removed from the throne and be replaced by the Count of Boulogne. Afonso, of course, did not refuse the papal order and marched to Portugal. Since Sancho was not a popular king, the order was not hard to enforce; he was exiled to [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and Afonso III became king in 1248 after his brother's death. To ascend the throne, he abdicated from the county of Boulogne and later (1253) divorced Matilda.

Determined not to commit the same mistakes as his brother, Afonso III paid special attention to what the middle class, composed of merchants and small land owners, had to say. In 1254, in the city of [[Leiria]], he held the first session of the ''[[Cortes Generales|Cortes]]'', a general assembly comprising the nobility, the middle class and representatives of all [[municipalities]]. He also made laws intended to restrain the upper classes from abusing the least favoured part of the population. Remembered as a notable administrator, Afonso III founded several towns, granted the title of city to many others and reorganized public administration.

Afonso showed extraordinary vision for the time. Progressive measures taken during his kingship include: representatives of the commons, besides the nobility and clergy, were involved in governance; the end of preventive arrests such that henceforward all arrests had to be first presented to a judge to determine the detention measure; and fiscal innovation, such as negotiating extraordinary taxes with the mercantile classes and direct taxation of the Church, rather than debasement of the coinage. This led to his excommunication by the holy see and possibly precipitated his death, and his son Dom Dinis's premature rise to the throne at only 18 years old.

Secure on the throne, Afonso III then proceeded to make war with the [[Muslim]] communities that still thrived in the south. In his reign the [[Algarve]] became part of the kingdom, following the capture of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]—Portugal thus becoming the first Iberian kingdom to complete its ''[[Reconquista]]''.

Following his success against the Moors, Afonso III had to deal with a political situation arising from the borders with Castile. The neighbouring kingdom considered that the newly acquired lands of the Algarve should be Castilian, not Portuguese, which led to a series of wars between the two kingdoms. Finally, in 1267, a treaty was signed in [[Badajoz]], determining that the southern border between Castile and Portugal should be the River [[Guadiana]], as it is today.

'''Afonso IV'''&lt;ref&gt;English: ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse'', or ''Affonso'' (Archaic Portuguese), ''Alfonso'' or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin]]).&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu}}; 8 February 1291 – 28 May 1357), called '''the Brave''' ({{lang-pt|o Bravo}}), was the seventh [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal and the Algarve]] from 1325 until his death. He was the only legitimate son of King [[Denis of Portugal]] by his wife [[Elizabeth of Aragon]].

Afonso, born in [[Lisbon]], was the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne. However, he was not, according to several sources, Dinis' favourite son; his half-brother, the illegitimate [[Afonso Sanches]], enjoyed full royal favour. From early in life, the notorious rivalry led to several outbreaks of [[civil war]]. On  7 January 1325, Afonso's father died and he became king, taking full revenge on his brother. His rival was sentenced to [[exile]] in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], and stripped of all the lands and [[fiefdom]]s donated by their father. Afonso Sanches, however, did not sit still. From Castile, he orchestrated a series of attempts to usurp the crown for himself. After a few failed attempts at invasion, both brothers signed a peace treaty, arranged by Afonso's mother Queen Elizabeth.

In 1309, Afonso IV married Infanta [[Beatrice of Castile (1293–1359)|Beatrice of Castile]], daughter of King [[Sancho IV of Castile]] by his wife [[Maria de Molina]]. The first-born of this union, Infanta [[Maria of Portugal]], married King [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] in 1328, at the same time that Afonso IV's heir, [[Peter I of Portugal]], was promised to another Castilian infanta, [[Constance of Penafiel]]. These arrangements were imperiled by the ill will of Alfonso XI of Castile, who was, at the time, publicly mistreating his wife. Afonso IV was not happy to see his daughter abused, and started a war against Castile. Peace arrived four years later, with the intervention of Infanta Maria herself. A peace treaty was signed in [[Seville]] in 1339 and, in the next year, Portuguese troops played an important role in the victory of the [[Battle of Rio Salado]] over the Marinid [[Moors]] in October 1340.

The last part of Afonso IV's reign is marked not by open warfare against Castile, but by political intrigue. Civil war between King [[Pedro of Castile]] and his half-brother [[Henry of Trastamara]] led to the exile of many Castilian [[nobility|nobles]] to Portugal. These immigrants immediately created a faction among the Portuguese court, aiming at privileges and power that, somehow, could compensate what they lost at home. The faction grew in power, especially after [[Inês de Castro]], daughter of an important nobleman and maid of the [[Constance of Penafiel|Crown Princess Constance]], became the lover of her lady's husband: [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter]], the heir of Portugal. Afonso IV was displeased with his son's choice of lovers, and hoped that the relationship would be a futile one. Unfortunately for internal politics, it was not. Peter was openly in love with Ines, recognized all the children she bore, and, worst of all, favoured the Castilians that surrounded her. Moreover, after his wife's death in 1349, Peter refused the idea of marrying anyone other than Ines herself.

The situation became worse as the years passed and the aging Afonso lost control over his court. Peter's only male heir, future king [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Fernando of Portugal]], was a sickly child, while the illegitimate children sired with Ines thrived. Worried about his legitimate grandson's life, and the growing power of Castile within Portugal's borders, Afonso ordered the murder of [[Inês de Castro]] in 1355. He expected his son to give in, but the heir was not able to forgive him for the act. Enraged at the barbaric act, Peter put himself at the head of an army and devastated the country between the [[Douro]] and the [[Minho River|Minho]] rivers before he was reconciled to his father in early 1357. Afonso died almost immediately after, in Lisbon in May

As king, Afonso IV is remembered as a soldier and a valiant general, hence the nickname ''the Brave''. But perhaps his most important contribution was the importance he gave to the Portuguese [[navy]]. Afonso IV granted public funding to raise a proper [[trade|commercial]] fleet and ordered the first maritime explorations.

&quot;La Reine morte&quot;, a French drama was inspired by the conflict between King Afonso and Pedro and Ines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1257570/ IMDB datasheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afonso V''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu}}, originally ''Affonso'') (15 January 1432 &amp;ndash; 28 August 1481), called '''the African''' ({{Lang-pt|o Africano}}), was the twelfth [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarves]]. His sobriquet refers to his conquests in [[Northern Africa]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Sintra]], the eldest son of King [[Edward of Portugal]] by his wife, Infanta [[Leonor of Aragon (1402-1445)|Eleanor of Aragon]]. Afonso V was only six years old when he succeeded his father in 1438.

During his minority, Afonso V was placed under the regency of his mother, according to a late will of his father. As both a foreigner and a woman, the queen was not a popular choice for regent. Opposition rose and the queen's only ally was [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso, Count of Barcelos]], the illegitimate half brother of King Edward and count of Barcelos. In the following year, the ''Cortes'' (assembly of the kingdom) decided to replace the queen with [[Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], the young king's oldest uncle. His main policies were concerned with avoiding the development of great noble houses, kingdoms inside the kingdom, and concentrating power in the person of the king. The country prospered under his rule, but not peacefully, as his laws interfered with the ambition of powerful nobles. The count of Barcelos, a personal enemy of the Duke of Coimbra (despite being half-brothers) eventually became the king's favourite uncle and began a constant struggle for power. In 1442, the king made Afonso the first [[Duke of Braganza]]. With this title and its lands, he became the most powerful man in Portugal and one of the richest men in Europe. To secure his position as regent, in 1445 Peter had Afonso marry his daughter, [[Isabella of Coimbra]].

But in  9 June 1448, when the king came of age, Peter had to surrender his power to Afonso V.  The years of conspiracy by the Duke of Braganza finally came to a head. On 15 September of the same year, Afonso V nullified all the laws and edicts approved under the regency. The situation became unstable and, in the following year, being led by what he afterwards discovered to be false representations, Afonso declared Peter a rebel and defeated his army in the [[Battle of Alfarrobeira]], in which his uncle (and father-in-law) Peter was killed. After this battle and the loss of one of Portugal's most remarkable infantes, the Duke of Braganza became the ''de facto'' ruler of the country.

==Invasion of Morocco==
{{see|Morocco-Portugal relations}}
Afonso V then turned his attentions to the North of Africa. In [[John I of Portugal|his grandfather's]] reign, [[Ceuta]] had been conquered from the king of [[Morocco]], now the new king wanted to expand the conquests. The king's army conquered [[Alcácer Ceguer]] (1458), [[Tangiers]] (won and lost several times between 1460 and 1464) and [[Conquest of Arzila|Arzila]] (1471). This achievements granted the king the nickname of ''the African''. The king also supported the exploration of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] led by prince [[Henry the Navigator]] but, after Henry's death in 1460 he did nothing to pursue this course of action. Administratively, Afonso V was an absent king, since he did not pursue development of laws or commerce, preferring to stand with the legacy of his father and grandfather.

[[File:FraMauroMap.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Fra Mauro map]] was made under a commission by Afonso V in 1457. Finished on April 24, 1459, it was sent to Portugal with a letter to [[Prince Henry the Navigator]], Afonso's uncle, encouraging further funding of exploration trips. [[Andrea Bianco]] copy at the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] (Venice).]]

In 1452, [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[papal bull]] [[Dum Diversas]], granting Afonso V the right to reduce any &quot;Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers&quot; to hereditary slavery. This approval of slavery was reaffirmed and extended in the [[Romanus Pontifex]] bull of 1455 (also by Nicholas V). These papal bulls came to serve as a justification for the subsequent era of slave trade and European colonialism.

When the campaigns in Africa were over, Afonso V found new grounds for battle in the Iberian Peninsula. In neighbouring [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], a huge scandal with political and dynastic implications had arisen. King [[Henry IV of Castile]] died without a male heir. From his two marriages, only a daughter, [[Joan, princess of Castile]], had been born. But her paternity was questioned, as rumour said the king was impotent and the queen, [[Joan of Portugal]], had a notorious affair with a nobleman called [[Beltrán de La Cueva]]. The birth of princess Joan in 1462, openly called ''the Beltraneja'', caused the separation of her parents. She was never considered legitimate and, when the king was dying, no one took her as a serious contender for the crown. Her half-aunt, the future Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], was due to inherit the crown, but Afonso V was keen to interfere with the succession in Castile. In 1475 he [[Pedigree collapse|married his niece]] Joan, the Beltraneja, whom he considered the legitimate heir to the crown. Since her adulteress mother was his own sister, Afonso V had not only ambition, but the family honour to protect. He proclaimed himself King of Castile and [[Kingdom of León|León]] and prepared to defend his wife's rights. In the following year he was defeated at the [[Battle of Toro]] by King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand V of Castile]], the husband of Isabella I of Castile.  He went to [[France]] to obtain the assistance of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], but finding himself deceived by the French monarch, he returned to Portugal in 1477 in very low spirits. Disillusioned and depressed, he fell into a deep melancholy and abdicated in favour of his son, [[John II of Portugal|John II]]. After this, he retired to a monastery in Sintra where he died in 1481. His death was mourned in the country, by the people who loved the king {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, and by the nobles who were starting to fear his successor.

==Marriages and descendants==
Afonso married first to his cousin [[Isabella of Coimbra]] in 1447. Isabella died in 1455 and Afonso married again (although not recognized by the Papacy) in 1475, this time to [[Joan, princess of Castile|Joan of Castile]] (known as &quot;la Beltraneja&quot;), daughter of [[Henry IV of Castile]] and [[Joan of Portugal]]. This marriage was an attempt to inherit the throne of Castile as Joan was the sole daughter of Henry IV. However this didn't happen as Afonso lost a short war with Castile.

'''Afonso VI''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu}}; English ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse''), or ''Affonso'' (Old Portuguese), (21 August 1643 &amp;ndash; 12 September 1683) was the twenty-second (or twenty-third according to some historians) [[Kings of Portugal|king of Portugal and the Algarve]]s, the second of the [[House of Braganza]], known as &quot;the Victorious&quot; ({{lang|pt|o Vitorioso}}).

At the age of three, Afonso suffered an illness that left him paralyzed on the left side of his body, as well as leaving him mentally unstable. His father created him 10th [[Duke of Braganza]].

After the 1653 death of his eldest brother [[Teodósio, Prince of Brazil]], Afonso became the [[heir-apparent]] to the throne of the kingdom. He received also the crown-princely title 2nd [[Prince of Brazil]].

He succeeded his father ([[João IV]]) in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother, [[Luisa of Medina-Sidonia]], was named regent in his father's will. His mental instability and paralysis, plus his disinterest in government, left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662.  Afonso oversaw military victories over the Spanish at [[Battle of Ameixial|Ameixial]] (8 June 1663) and [[Battle of Montes Claros|Montes Claros]] (17 June 1665), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of sovereignty of Portugal's new ruling dynasty, the [[House of Braganza]], on 13 February 1668 in the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]]. Colonial affairs saw the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] conquest of [[Jaffna]]patam, Portugal's last colony in [[Sri Lanka]] (1658) and the cession of [[Bombay]] and [[Tangier]] to England (23 June 1661) as dowry for Afonso's sister, [[Catherine of Braganza]] who had married King [[Charles II of England]]. English mediation in 1661 saw the Netherlands acknowledge Portuguese rule of [[Brazil]] in return for uncontested control of Sri Lanka.

In 1662, the [[Count of Castelo Melhor]] saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent.

He was married to [[Marie Françoise of Nemours]], the daughter of the [[Duke of Savoy]], in 1666, but this marriage would not last long. Marie Françoise, or Maria Francisca in Portuguese, filed for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso's brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja, (future [[Peter II of Portugal|Peter II]]). That same year, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force the king to relinquish control of the government and he became Prince Regent in 1668. Afonso was exiled to the island of [[Terceira]] in the [[Azores]] for seven years, returning to mainland Portugal shortly before he died at [[Sintra]] in 1683.

His trial{{Clarify|pre-text=which trial?|date=August 2010}} is the base for [[João Mário Grilo]]'s 1990 film, ''The King's Trial'' (''O Processo do Rei'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Alfonsobig.jpg|thumb|Alfonso II in the twelfth-century ''[[Libro de los Testamentos]]''.]]

'''Alfonso II''' (759–842), called '''the Chaste''', was the [[king of Asturias]] from 791 to his death, the son of [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela I]] and the [[Basque people|Basque]] Munia.

He was born in [[Oviedo]] in 759 or 760. He was put under the guardianship of his aunt [[Adosinda]] after his father's death, but one tradition relates his being put in the monastery of [[Samos Island|Samos]]. He was the governor of the palace during the reign of Adosinda's husband [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]]. On Silo's death, he was elected king by Adosinda's allies, but the magnates raised his uncle [[Mauregatus of Asturias|Mauregatus]] to the throne instead. Alfonso fled to [[Álava]] to live with his maternal relatives.

Mauregatus was succeeded by [[Bermudo I of Asturias|Bermudo]], Alfonso's cousin, who abdicated after his defeat at Burbia. Alfonso was subsequently elected king on 14 September 791. The events of his reign are in reality almost unknown. Poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage of his sister Ximena to Sancho, count of Saldana, and the feats of their son [[Bernardo del Carpio]]. Bernardo is the hero of a ''[[cantar de gesta]]'' (''chanson de geste'') written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.

What is known is that he maintained contact with the court of [[Charlemagne]]. He sent delegations to [[Aachen]] in 796, 797, and 798, but we do not know the purposes. They may have dealt with the security of his kingdom from the ongoing attacks of the Ibn Mugait brothers. On the other hand, they may have been related to the [[adoptionist]] controversy which had brought Bermudo's kingdom into Charlemagne's view.

Militarily, Alfonso did much to secure his own realm against the [[Moors]]. He took [[Lisbon]] in 798. He defeated the Moslems at [[Narón]] and [[Anceo]] (825) and, thanks to these victories, began the repopulation of parts of [[Galicia (Iberia)|Galicia]], [[León (province)|León]], and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]].

Alfonso also moved the capital from [[Pravia]], where Silo had located it, to [[Oviedo]], the city of his father's founding and his birth. There he constructed churches and a palace. He built [[San Tirso]], where he is buried, and [[Santullano]], on the outskirts. The ''Crónica Sebastianense'' records his death in 842, saying:

:''tras haber llevado por 52 años casta, sobria, inmaculada, piadosa y gloriosamente el gobierno del reino''

:[after having held for 52 years chastely, soberly, immaculately, piously, and gloriously the government of the realm]

Tradition relates that in 814, the body of [[Saint James the Greater]] was discovered in [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]] and that Alfonso was the first pilgrim to that famous medieval (and modern) shrine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amara Sinha''' (c. [[375|AD 375]]) was a [[Sanskrit]] [[grammar]]ian and [[poet]], of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been &quot;one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of [[Vikramaditya]],&quot; and according to the evidence of [[Hsuan Tsang]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0PgtAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA781&amp;lpg=PA781&amp;dq=%22Amara+Sinha%22+Hsuan+Tsang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KDYrCHY9GD&amp;sig=zWmHUCUhVrVy8_7t-Sm0PFAbGQM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tkrFTJPgD4zSngedqrGCCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Encyclopædia britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; this is the [[Chandragupta Vikramaditya]] ([[Chandragupta II]]) that flourished about AD 375.

Amara seems to have been a [[Buddhist]]; and an early tradition asserts that his works, with one exception, were destroyed during the persecution carried on by the orthodox [[Brahmin]]s in the 5th century {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. The exception is the celebrated ''[[Amara-Kosha]]'' (''Treasury of Amara''), a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called ''Trikanda'' or the &quot;Tripartite&quot;. It is also known as &quot;Namalinganushasana&quot;.

It contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.  The first chapter of the ''Kosha'' was printed at [[Rome]] in Tamil character in 1798.  An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|HT Colebrooke]], appeared at [[Serampore]] in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at [[Calcutta]] in 1831.  A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps as published at Paris in 1839. [[Benjamin L. Rice|Louie Rice]] compiled the [[Kannada]] version of it and its available 4th edition was printed in 1927 which contains three khandas and 25 sargas.&lt;ref&gt;Amarakosha by Louie Rice edited by N.Balasubhramanyam&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfonso XII''' (born ''Alfonso Francisco de Asís Fernando Pío Juan María de la Concepción Gregorio Pelayo'') ([[Madrid]], 28 November 1857 &amp;ndash; [[El Pardo]], 25 November 1885) was king of [[Spain]], reigning from 1874 to 1885, after a ''[[coup d'état]]'' restored the monarchy and ended the ephemeral [[First Spanish Republic]].

Alfonso was the son of [[Isabella II of Spain]], and allegedly, [[Francis, Duke of Cádiz|Francisco de Asís de Borbón]], her King Consort. His true biological paternity is uncertain but speculation that Enrique Puig y Moltó, a captain of the guard or an American dental student was his biological father. His legal paternity is not uncertain though: his mother was married to her (presumed [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]) cousin Francisco de Asís de Borbón, the King Consort of Spain, at the time of Alfonso's conception and birth and presented Alfonso at his baptism which signified the fact that Alfonso was his son.

==In exile==
When Queen Isabella and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the [[Revolution of 1868]], Alfonso accompanied them to [[Paris]]. From there, he was sent to the [[Theresianum]] at [[Vienna]] to continue his studies. On 25 June 1870, he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to that of the exiled queen. He assumed the title of Alfonso XII, for although no King of united Spain had borne the name &quot;Alfonso XI&quot;, the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of [[Kingdom of Asturias]], [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], also named [[Alfonso]].

Shortly afterwards, Alfonso proceeded to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in order to continue his military studies. While there, he issued, on 1 December 1874, in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy. At the end of that year, when [[Marshal Serrano]] left [[Madrid]] to take command of the northern army in the [[Carlist War]], Brigadier [[Arsenio Martínez Campos|Martínez Campos]], who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to [[Sagunto]], rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him, and entered [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] in the king's name. Thereupon the president of the council resigned, and his power was transferred to the king's plenipotentiary and adviser, [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo|Antonio Cánovas]].

==Return from exile==
Within a few days after Canovas del Castillo took power, the new king, proclaimed on 29 December 1874, arrived at Madrid, passing through [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and was acclaimed everywhere (1875). In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the [[Carlists]], in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos]] and the Duke's abandonment of the struggle.

On 23 January 1878 at the Basilica of [[Atocha]] in [[Madrid]], Alfonso married his cousin, Princess [[Mercedes of Orléans|Maria de las Mercedes]], daughter of [[Antoine, Duke of Montpensier]], but she died within six months of the marriage. Towards the end of the same year, a young workman of [[Tarragona]], [[Juan Oliva Moncasi]], fired at the king in Madrid.

==Second marriage and rule==
[[Image:Alfonso XII with his second wife.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Alfonso XII and his second wife [[Maria Christina of Austria]], 1885.]]
On 29 November 1879 at the Basilica of Atocha in [[Madrid]], Alfonso married a much more distant relative, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], daughter of [[Karl Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria]] and of his wife [[Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria|Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria]]. During the honeymoon, a pastry cook named Otero fired at the young sovereign and his wife as they were driving in Madrid.

The children of this marriage were:
* [[Mercedes, Princess of Asturias|María de las Mercedes]], Princess of Asturias, (11 September 1880 &amp;ndash; 17 October 1904), married on 14 February 1901 to [[Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], and titular heiress from the death of her father until the posthumous birth of her brother
* [[Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain|María Teresa]], (12 November 1882 &amp;ndash; 23 September 1912), married to [[Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria]] on 12 January 1906
* [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] (17 May 1886 &amp;ndash; 28 February 1941). Born posthumously, this son was king from the moment of his birth and thus never held any other Spanish titles from the Crown, such as Infante or [[Prince of Asturias]]. He married [[Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], called &quot;Ena&quot;, a carrier of [[haemophilia]], and two of their sons died young from the disease. The third was a deaf-mute as a result of a childhood illness. The fourth was [[Juan de Borbón, Count of Barcelona|the father of]] [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|the current King of Spain]].

In 1881, the King refused to sanction a law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of 18 months. Upon the consequent resignation of Canovas del Castillo, he summoned [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]], the Liberal leader, to form a new cabinet.

==Death and impact==
[[File:Monument to Alfonso XII of Spain, Madrid - general view 2.JPG|thumb|left|Monument to Alfonso XII in [[Buen Retiro Park]], [[Madrid]] (architect [[José Grases Riera]])]]
In November 1885, Alfonso died, just short of his 28th birthday, of [[tuberculosis]].

Coming to the throne at such an early age, Alfonso had served no apprenticeship in the art of ruling, but he possessed great natural tact and a sound judgment ripened by the trials of exile. Benevolent and sympathetic in disposition, he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting districts ravaged by [[cholera]] or devastated by [[earthquake]] in 1885. His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party. During his short reign, peace was established both at home and abroad, finances were well regulated, and the various administrative services were placed on a basis that afterwards enabled Spain to pass through the disastrous [[Spanish-American War|war with the]] [[United States]] without the threat of a revolution.

He was the 996th [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in Spain, the 104th [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]] in 1861 and the 775th Knight of the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1881.

==Illegitimate issue==
He had two sons by Elena Sánz y Martínez de Arrizala ([[Castellón de la Plana]], 15 December 1849 - Paris, 24 December 1898), who also had another son by an unknown father other than the King named Jorje Sánz y Martínez de Arrizala:
* Alfonso Sánz y Martínez de Arrizala ([[Madrid]], 28 January 1880 - 1970), married in 1922 to María de Guadalupe Lymantur y Mariscal (- [[Marbella]], 1977), daughter of Julio Limantour y Marquet ([[Mexico City]], 17 June 1863 - Mexico City, 11 October 1909) and wife Elena Mariscal y ..., paternal granddaughter of [[French people|French]] Joseph Yves Limantour ([[Pleomour]], 1812 - Mexico City, 1885) and wife Adèle Marquet ([[Bordeaux]] - ?), and maternal granddaughter of [[Ignacio Mariscal]] y ... ([[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], [[Oaxaca]], 5 July 1829 - Mexico City, 17 April 1910) and wife ..., and had issue:
** Elena Sánz y Limantour (1922–1979), married in 1949 to Robert Borgs, and had issue:
*** ''Bruce Borgs (b. 1953)''
*** ''Warren Borgs (b. 1957)''
** María Luisa Sánz y Limantour (1925 -), married in 1944 to Alberto Wittig y Cooke, son of Alberto Wittig and wife Cecilia Cooke, and had issue:
*** ''Leslie Wittig y Sánz(b. Santiago-Chile), unmarried and without issue''
*** ''Jaime Wittig y Sánz (b. [[Lisbon]]), unmarried and without issue''
*** ''Priscilla Wittig y Sánz (b. Paris, 1945), married to Gonzalo García y Rawson (b. Valparaiso-Chile), and had issue: ''

'''Alfonso XIII''' (''Alfonso León Fernando María Jaime Isidro Pascual Antonio de Borbón y Austria-Lorena''; anglicised: Alphonse Leon Ferdinand Mary James Isidor Pascal Anthony of Bourbon and Austria-Lorraine) ([[Madrid]], 17 May 1886 &amp;ndash; [[Rome]], 28 February 1941), [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]], posthumous son of [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], was proclaimed King at his birth. He reigned from 1886-1931. His mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria|Queen Maria Christina]], was appointed [[regent]] during his minority. In 1902, on attaining his 16th year, the King assumed control of the state.

==Reign==

[[File:Alfonso XIII sculpted by José Navas-Parejo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bust of Alfonso XIII]]
Alfonso's reign began well. The French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' described the young King as &quot;the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Happiest Living Monarch,&quot; ''New York Times.'' 14 August 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he came of age in 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06E2D9103BE733A2575AC2A9659C946397D6CF&amp;scp=101&amp;sq=Alfonso+XIII&amp;st=p &quot;Alfonso's Reign Begins on 17 May; He Will Take the Oath on That Day -- Festivities to Last a Week,&quot;] ''New York Times,'' 29 March 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his reign, [[Spain]] lost its last colonies in the Americas ([[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]]) and the [[Philippines]]; fought and, after several setbacks, won [[Rif War (1920)|a war]] in [[Morocco]]; witnessed the start of the [[Spanish Generation of 1927]], and endured the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], which ultimately cost him the throne.

During the [[World War I|First World War]], because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion, Spain remained neutral. The King ran an office for captives from the [[Palacio Real|Palacio de Oriente]], which leveraged the Spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of prisoners-of-war, receiving and answering letters from Europe.  However, he became gravely ill during the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and, since Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, his illness and subsequent recovery were covered worldwide, giving the false impression (in the absence of real news from anywhere else) that Spain was the most-affected area.  This ultimately led to the pandemic getting the nickname &quot;the Spanish Flu.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;Barry 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Alfonso was a promoter of tourism in Spain. The problems with the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxury [[Hotel Palace]] in Madrid. He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges ([[Parador]]) in historic buildings of Spain. His fondness for the sport of [[Association football|football]] led to the patronage of several &quot;Royal&quot; (&quot;Real&quot; in Spanish) football clubs such as [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Real Betis]], and [[Real Unión]].

When the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed on 14 April 1931, he fled and left Spain, but did not abdicate the throne. He settled eventually in [[Rome]] where he lived in the [[Grand Hotel (Rome)|Grand Hotel]].

Once the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, Alfonso made it clear he favoured the military uprising against the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] government, but General [[Francisco Franco]] in September 1936 declared that the Nationalists would never accept Alfonso as King (the supporters of the rival [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender made up an important part of the Franco Army). First, he went into exile in [[France]].{{Clarify|wasn't he settled in Rome - something's missing here|date=August 2010}} Nevertheless, he sent his son, [[Juan de Borbon, Count of Barcelona]], to enter Spain in 1936 and participate in the uprising. However, near the French border, General [[Emilio Mola|Mola]] had him arrested and expelled from the country.

On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII abdicated his rights to the Spanish throne in favour of his third (of four), but second-surviving, son [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Juan]], father of the current King, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]]. He died in Rome a month-and-a-half later.

The Spanish Government ordered three days of national mourning.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mourning in Spain&quot;, ''The Times'' (3 March 1941): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  His funeral was held in Rome in the Church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli]].  He was buried in the Church of [[Santa Maria in Monserrato]], the Spanish national church in Rome, immediately below the tombs of [[Pope Calixtus III]] and [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30916FB3859167B93C0A91788D85F458485F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Italians+to+Mourn+Death+of+Alfonso&amp;st=p &quot;Italians to Mourn Death of Alfonso,&quot;] ''The New York Times.'' 2 March 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1980 his remains were transferred to [[El Escorial]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;21 Guns for Dead King's Homecoming&quot;, ''The Times'' (21 January 1980): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==

{{Main|Descendants of Alfonso XIII of Spain}}
[[File:Retrato del Rey Alfonso XIII.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1929 portrait of King Alfonso XIII]]On 31 May 1906, at the [[San Jeronimo el Real|Royal Monastery of San Geronimo]] in [[Madrid]], Alfonso married [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born [[Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] (1887–1969), a niece of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII of Great Britain]], and a granddaughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of Great Britain]]. A [[Serene Highness]] by birth, Ena, as she was known, was raised to [[Royal Highness]] status a month before her wedding to prevent the union from being viewed as unequal.

As Alfonso XIII and Ena were returning from the wedding, they narrowly escaped an assassination attempted by the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Mateu Morral]]; instead, the bomb explosion killed or injured many bystanders and members of the Royal procession.

Alfonso and Ena had seven children:
* [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907-1938)|Infante ''Alfonso'' Pio Cristino Eduardo Francisco Guillermo Carlos Enrique Fernando Antonio Venancio of Spain]], [[Prince of Asturias]] (1907–1938), a [[hemophiliac]], he renounced his rights to the throne in 1933 to marry a commoner, [[Edelmira Ignacia Adriana Sampedro-Robato]], and became Count of [[Covadonga]]. He later remarried to [[Marta Ester Rocafort-Altazarra]], but had no issue by either of them.
* [[Infante Jaime of Spain, Duke of Segovia|Infante ''Jaime'' Luitpold Isabelino Enrique Alberto Alfonso Victor Acacio Pedro Maria of Spain]] (1908–1975), a [[deaf-mute]] as the result of a childhood operation, he renounced his rights to the throne in 1933 and became Duke of [[Segovia]], and later Duke of Madrid, and who, as a [[legitimist]] [[pretender]] to the French throne from 1941 to 1975, was known as the Duke of [[Anjou]].
* [[Infanta Beatriz of Spain|Infanta ''Beatríz'' Isabela Federica Alfonsa Eugenia Cristina Maria Teresa Bienvenida Ladisláa of Spain]] (1909–2002), who married [[Don Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince di Civitella-Cesi]].
* Infante Fernando, [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] (1910)
* [[Infanta Maria Cristina of Spain|Infanta ''Maria Cristina'' Teresa Alejandra Guadalupe Maria de la Concepción Vittoria Eugenia of Spain]] (1911–1996), who married Enrico Eugenio Marone-Cinzano, 1st Conte Marone-Cinzano.
* Infante [[Juan de Borbón, Count of Barcelona|Juan Carlos Teresa Silvestre Alfonso of Spain]] (1913–1993), named heir to the throne and Count of Barcelona, whose son is the current King, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]].
* [[Infante Gonzalo of Spain|Infante Gonzalo Manuel Maria Bernardo Narciso Alfonso Mauricio of Spain]] (1914–1934), a hemophiliac, like his elder brother Alfonso. He died due to bleeding from injuries suffered in a car crash.

==Illegitimate issue==

* 315th [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]] in 1900
* 815th [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1902
* [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], 1930:  Emperor Showa's second brother, [[Prince Takamatsu]], traveled to Madrid to confer the Great Collar of the Chrysanthemum on King Alfonso.  This honor was intended, in part, to commemorate the diplomatic and trading history which existed long before other Western nations were officially aware of Japan's existence.  [[Prince Takamatsu]] traveled with his wife, [[Princess Takamatsu]], to Spain.  Her symbolic role in this unique mission to the Spanish Court was intended to emphasize the international links which were forged by her 16th-century ancestor, [[Ieyasu Tokugawa]].  In the years before the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], that innovative [[daimyo]] from Western Japan had been actively involved in negotiating trade and diplomatic treaties with Spain and with the colonies of New Spain (Mexico) and the Philippines; and it was anticipated that the mere presence of the Princess could serve to underscore the range of possibilities which could be inferred from that little-known history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B1EFE3D5C117A93C1A9178AD95F448385F9&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=order+of+the+chrysanthemum+&amp;st=p &quot;Japan to Decorate King Alfonso Today; Emperor's Brother Nears Madrid With Collar of the Chrysanthemum for Spanish King,&quot;] ''New York Times,'' 3 November 1930; ''see also'' Nutail, Zelia.

In 1431 he was deputed by [[John II of Castile|John II, king of Castile]], to attend the council of [[Basel]], in which he made himself conspicuous by his learning.  He was the author of several works, the principal of which is entitled ''Rerum Hispanorum Romanorum imperatorum, summorum pontificum, nec non regum Francorum anacephaleosis''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Estatua de Alfonso I de Aragón.jpg|thumb|Statue of Alfonso, dressed as a battler, in the Parque Primo de Rivera in [[Zaragoza]], the city he recovered from the Moors and made his capital.]]

'''Alfonso I''' (1073/1074&lt;ref&gt;According to the fourteenth-century ''[[Crónica de San Juan de la Peña]]'' he died in his sixty-first year (Lourie 1975:639 note).&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 8 September 1134), called '''the Battler''' or '''the Warrior''' ({{lang-es|el Batallador}}), was the [[Kings of Aragon|king of Aragon]] and [[Kings of Navarre|Navarre]] from 1104 until his death in 1134. He was the second son of King [[Sancho I of Aragon|Sancho Ramírez]] and successor of his brother [[Peter I of Aragon|Peter I]]. With his marriage to [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]], queen regnant of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|León]], in 1109, he began to use, with some justification, the grandiose title [[Imperator totius Hispaniae|Emperor of Spain]], formerly employed by his father-in-law, [[Alfonso VI of León|Alfonso VI]]. Alfonso the Battler earned his sobriquet in the [[Reconquista]]. He won his greatest military successes in the middle [[Ebro]], where he expelled the Moors from [[Zaragoza]] in 1118 and took [[Egea, Spain|Egea]], [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], [[Calatayud]], [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]], [[Tarazona]], [[Daroca]], and [[Monreal del Campo]]. He died in September 1134 after an unsuccessful battle with the [[Moors]] at the [[Battle of Fraga]].

==Early life==
His earliest years were passed in the [[Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa|monastery of Siresa]], learning to read and write and to practice the military arts until the tuition of Lope Garcés the Pilgrim, who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of [[Pedrola]] when Alfonso came to the throne.

During his brother's reign, he participated in the taking of Huesca (the [[Battle of Alcoraz]], 1096), which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital.  He also joined [[El Cid]]'s expeditions in [[Valencia (taifa)|Valencia]].  His father gave him the lordships of [[Biel, Zaragoza|Biel]], [[Luna, Zaragoza|Luna]], [[Ardenes]], and [[Bailo]].

A series of deaths put Alfonso directly in line for the throne.  His brother's children, Isabella and Peter (who married María Rodríguez, daughter of [[El Cid]]), died in 1103 and 1104 respectively.

==Matrimonial conflicts==
A passionate fighting-man (he fought twenty-nine battles against Christian or Moor), he was married  (when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor) in 1109 to the ambitious Queen [[Urraca of León]], widow of [[Raymond of Burgundy]], a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role.  The marriage had been arranged by her father [[Alfonso VI of León]] in 1106 to unite the two chief Christian states against the [[Almoravides]], and to supply them with a capable military leader.  But Urraca was tenacious of her right as [[queen regnant]] and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father. Husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war. Alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion. Being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the [[Battle of Candespina]] and the [[Battle of Viadangos]], but his only trustworthy supporters were his Aragonese, who were not numerous enough to keep [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|León]] subjugated. The marriage of Alfonso and Urraca was declared null by the Pope, as they were second cousins, in 1110, but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with Urraca until 1114. During his marriage, he had called himself &quot;King and Emperor of Castile, Toledo, Aragón, Pamplona, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza&quot; in recognition of his rights as Urraca's husband; of his inheritance of the lands of his father, including the kingdom of his great-uncle [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza|Gonzalo]]; and his prerogative to conquer [[Andalusia]] from the Moor.  He inserted the title of ''imperator'' on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule.

Alfonso's late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women. Ibn al-Athir (1166–1234) describes Alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover, who responded when asked why he did not take his pleasure from one of the captives of Muslim chiefs, responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not women.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lourie 1975:639 note. No bastards are recorded, though they would have cut prominent figures under the circumstances. No inference of homosexuality need be drawn: the chastity that supports fitness for the hunt or for battle is a cultural ''[[topos]]'' as old as the myth of [[Actaeon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church relations==
The king quarrelled with the church, and particularly the [[Cistercian]]s, almost as violently as with his wife.  As he beat her,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} so he drove [[Bernard de Sedirac|Archbishop Bernard]] into exile and expelled the monks of [[Sahagún, Spain|Sahagún]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. He was finally compelled to give way in Castile and Leon to his stepson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile]], son of Urraca and her first husband.  The intervention of [[Pope Calixtus II]] brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake.

In 1122 in Belchite, he founded a confraternity of knights to fight against the Almoravids.  It was the start of the military orders in Aragon.  Years later, he organised a branch of the ''Militia Christi'' of the [[Holy Land]] at [[Monreal del Campo]].

==''Reconquista''==

Alfonso spent his first four years in near-constant war with the Moor.  In 1105, he conquered Ejea and Tauste and refortified Castellar and Juslibol.  In 1106, he defeated [[Ahmad II al-Musta'in]] of Zaragoza at Valtierra.  In 1107, he took Tamarite de Litera and Esteban de la Litera.  Then followed a period dominated by his relations with Castile and León through his wife, Urraca.  He resumed his Reconquista in 1117 by conquering [[Fitero]], [[Corella]], [[Cintruénigo]], [[Murchante]], [[Monteagudo]], and [[Cascante]].

In 1118, the Council of Toulouse declared a [[crusade]] to assist in the reconquest of [[Zaragoza]].  Many Frenchmen consequently joined Alfonso at [[Ayerbe]].  They took Almudévar, Gurrea de Gállego, and Zuera, besieging Zaragoza itself by the end of May. The city fell on 18 December, and the forces of Alfonso occupied the Azuda, the government tower.  The great palace of the city was given to the monks of Bernard.  Promptly, the city was made Alfonso's capital.  Two years later, in 1120, he defeated a Muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the [[Battle of Cutanda]]. He promulgated the ''fuero'' of ''tortum per tortum'', facilitating taking the law into one's own hands, which among others reassumed the Muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs.

In 1119, he retook Cervera, Tudejen, Castellón, Tarazona, Ágreda, Magallón, Borja, Alagón, Novillas, Mallén, Rueda, Épila and repopulated the region of [[Soria]].  He began the siege of [[Calatayud]], but left to defeat the army at Cutanda trying to retake Zaragoza.  When Calatayud fell, he took Bubierca, Alhama de Aragón, Ariza, and Daroca (1120).  In 1123, he besieged and took [[Lleida]], which was in the hands of the [[count of Barcelona]].  From the winter of 1124 to September 1125, he was on a risky expedition to Peña Cadiella deep in Andalusia.

In the great raid of 1125, he carried away a large part of the subject Christians from Granada, and in the south-west of France, he had claims as usurper-king of Navarre.  From 1125 to 1126, he was on campaign against [[Granada]], where he was trying to install a Christian prince, and [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]], where got only as far as Motril.  In 1127, he reconquered Longares, but simultaneously lost all his Castilian possessions to [[alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]].  He confirmed a treaty with Castile the next year (1128) with the [[Peace of Támara]], which fixed the boundaries of the two realms.

He conquered Molina de Aragón and repopulated [[Monzón]] in 1129, before besieging [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], which had fallen again upon the Cid's death.

He went north of the Pyrenees in October 1130 to protect the [[Val d'Aran]].  Early in 1131, he besieged [[Bayonne]].  It is said he ruled &quot;from Belorado to Pallars and from Bayonne to Monreal.&quot;

At the [[Siege of Bayonne]] in October 1131, three years before his death, he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in Palestine and politically largely independent on the pope, the [[Knights Templars]], the [[Hospitallers]], and the Knights of the [[Holy Sepulchre]], whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out. The will has greatly puzzled historians, who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of Alphonso's character, one that effectively undid his life's work. Elena Lourie (1975) suggested instead that it was Alphonso's attempt to neutralize the papacy's interest in a disputed succession— Aragon had been a fief of the Papacy since 1068— and to fend off Urraca's son from her first marriage, Alphonso VII of Castile, for the Papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Innocent II]] indeed did write Alfonso VII to just this effect, 10 June 1135 or 36 (Lourie 1995:645).&lt;/ref&gt; Generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in Castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on Alphonso VII's ambitions to break it— and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there is not a single cleric. In the event it was a will that his nobles refused to carry out— instead bringing his brother Ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers— an eventuality that Lourie suggests was Alphonso's hidden intent.

His final campaigns were against Mequinenza (1133) and Fraga (1134), where [[García Ramírez of Navarre|García Ramírez]], the future king of Navarre, and a mere 500 other knights fought with him.  It fell on 17 July. He was dead by September. Alfonso was a fierce, violent man, a soldier and nothing else, whose piety was wholly militant. He had a great role in the Spanish reconquest. His tomb is in the [[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo|monastery of San Pedro]] in [[Huesca]].

His testament was not honored: Aragon took his aged brother abbot-bishop Ramiro out of a monastery and made him king, marrying him without papal dispensation to Agnes, sister of the [[Duke of Aquitaine]]; the Navarrese lords, perhaps irked at the personal union of Aragon and Navarre signalled their independence by putting [[García Ramírez of Navarre|García Ramírez]], Lord of [[Monzón]], descendant of an illegitimate son of [[García Sánchez III of Navarre|García Sánchez III]], to the throne in [[Pamplona]]. &quot;The result of the crisis  produced by the result of Alfonso I's will was a major reorientation of the peninsula's kingdoms: the separation of Aragon and Navarre, the union of Aragon and Catalonia and— a moot point but stressed particularly by some Castilian historians— the affirmation of 'Castilian hegemony' in Spain&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lourie 1975:636.&lt;/ref&gt; by the rendering of homage for [[Zaragoza]] by Alfonso's eventual heir, Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona.

===Pseudo-Alfonso the Battler===
Sometime during the reign of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], the Battler's grandnephew, a man came forward claiming to be Alfonso the Battler. The only contemporary references to this event are two letters of Alfonso II addressed to [[Louis VII of France]]; they were carried to Louis by [[Berengar (Bishop of Lérida)|Berengar]], the [[Bishop of Lérida|Bishop of Lleida]], but are not dated.&lt;ref&gt;They were first published in the ''Recueil des Historiens des Gaules et de la France (Correspondance de Louis VII)'', XV (Paris: 1878), 2nd ed., n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. 223–4, pp. 71–2, and utitised extensively by Marcelin Defourneaux, &quot;Louis VII et le souverains espagnols. L'enigme du «pseudo-Alphonse»&quot;, in ''Estudios dedicados a Menéndez Pidal'', VI (Madrid: 1956), 647–61. They were published again by Ubieto Arteta (1958), appendices I and II, pp. 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the second of these, the pretender was then living in Louis's domains, meaning the [[Principality of Catalonia]], which was ruled by Alfonso under Louis's suzerainty. This pretender was an old man (appropriately, since the Battler had died some decades earlier) and Alfonso II expressed confidence that Louis would arrest him at the earliest possible moment and bring him to justice. The first letter supplies sufficient information to date it approximately, since the Bishop sojourned at the court of Louis on his way to Rome. It is known from other sources that Berengar attended the [[Third Lateran Council]] in March 1179. The letters were probably written towards the end of 1178 or in January 1179 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;Ubieto Arteta (1958), 35, cites the evidence for Aragon's early support for Alexander III against the [[Antipope Victor IV]]. The earliest possible date at which Berengar could have been travelling to Rome to meet Alexander is after 23 November 1165, when the latter finally took up residence in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an annalist source for the years 1089–1196, the pretender was received with honour and pomp in Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca, which the Battler had conquered, but after it was found out that he was false he was executed before the city of Barcelona in 1181.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio C. Floriano, &quot;Fragmentos de unos viejos anales (1089–1196). Transcripción y análisis paleográfico. Crítica histórica&quot;, ''Boletín de la Academia de la Historia'', CXIV (1929), 153–4, cited in Ubieto Arteta (1958), 36:&lt;blockquote&gt;Vino un ferrero e dixo: «yo so don Alfonso, el que presó a Çaragoça e Cadatayut e Daroqua»; e recebido es en aquellos lugares con grant honra e con grant ponpa. E dice muchas cosas que semeiavam verdat de lo passado quel havia fecho. E era tenido por senyer e por don Alfonso. E despues fue conoscido que non era aquel, e enforcáronlo muy desonradament devant la ciudad de Barcelona.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historian [[Antonio Ubieto Arteta]], has hypothesised that the Aragonese lords of the tenencies of Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca—Pedro de Luesia, Loferrench de Luna, Pedro de Castillazuelo (lord of Calatayud), Pedro Cornel (lord of Murillo de Gállego), and the majordomo Jimeno de Artusilla, all of whom disappear between 1177 and 1181 in the documentation of their tenencies—perhaps support, at least inititally, the pretender.&lt;ref&gt;Ubieto Arteta (1958), note 24, who also connects the appearance of the pretender with the economic disasters that befell Aragon in 1174.&lt;/ref&gt; These lords also appear in the later legend of the [[Bell of Huesca]], which has no historical basis, as the victims Ramiro II (1136). Since, historically, they were not active in the 1130s, it is possible that the historically-based legend of the pseudo-Alfonso had some influence on the genesis of the Bell of Huesca.

The earliest chronicle source for the imposture is [[Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada]], writing in the middle of the thirteenth century, who records that there were several legends then current about the death of Alfonso the Battler: some believed he perished in the battle of Fraga, some that his body had never been recovered, others that he was buried in the monastery of [[Montearagón]], and still others that he had fled from Fraga in shame after his defeat and became a pilgrim as an act of penance. Some years later, Rodrigo writes, though he does not give a year, an impostor arose and was received by many as the Battler, though Alfonso II had him arrested and hanged. This is the earliest reference to the impostor's end.&lt;ref&gt;The account in ''[[De rebus Hispaniae]]'' (Madrid: 1793), II, 150–51, quoted in Ubieto Arteta (1958), note 1:&lt;blockquote&gt;[Alfonsus] nam victus occiditur et si occisus inventus fuerit dubitatur. Ab aliquibus enim dicitur corpus eius in montis Aragonis monasterio tumulatum a mauris tamen ante redemptum. Ab aliis dicitur vivus a proelio evasisse et confusionem proelii nequiens tolerare peregrinum se exhibuit huic mundo effigie et habitu immutatus. Et annis aliquot interpositis, quispiam se ostendit qui se eumdem publice fatebatur et multorum Castellae et Aragoniae id ipsum testimonio affirmabant qui cum eo in utroque regno fuerant familiariter conversati et ad memoriam reducebant secreta plurima que ipse olim cum eis habita recolebat et antiquorum assertio ipsum esse firmiter asserebat. Demum tamen quia cum ex regno plurimi sectabantur et de die in diem eorum numerus augebatur. Aldefonsus rex Aragoniae fecit eum suspendio interire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was amplified in later years. According to the fourteenth-century  ''[[Crónica de los Estados Peninsulares]]'', the Battler went on a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], where he lived for many years.&lt;ref&gt;The account in the ''Crónica de los Estados Peninsulares: texto del siglo XIV'', ed. Antonio Ubieto Arteta (Granada: 1955), 128, quoted in Ubieto Arteta (1958), note 2:&lt;blockquote&gt;Otros dicen que de vergüenza que era vencido sent passo la mar a Jerusalem, pero nunca lo trobaron ni muerto ni vivo. Otros dicen que a tiempo vino en Aragon e fablo con algunos que sopieran de sus poridades. Otros que alli se perdio e non fue conoscido..&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Crónica de San Juan de la Peña]]'' also recounts the incident, but it depends entirely on Rodrigo and the ''Estados Peninsulares''. It is not until the seventeenth-century historian [[Jerónimo Zurita]] penned his ''Anales de la Corona de Aragón'' that new details were added to the legend.&lt;ref&gt;Zurita's account is found in his second book, twenty-second chapter, and is completely recapitulated by Ubieto Arteta (1958), 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Zurita's dates the impostor's appearance to the death of [[Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona]], who had been exercising power in Aragon, and the succession of the child Alfonso II in 1162. The death of the impostor, by hanging, must have occurred in 1163.

'''''Amaryllis''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|m|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|l|ə|s}})&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607&lt;/ref&gt; is also known as the '''belladonna lily''', the '''naked lady''', or an '''amarillo'''. The genus has two species and the more famous of the two, ''Amaryllis belladonna'', is a native of [[South Africa]], particularly the rocky southwest region near the Cape. It should not be confused with  ''[[Hippeastrum]],'' a flowering [[bulb]] commonly sold in the winter months for its ability to [[flower|bloom]] indoors.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Amaryllis belladonna flowers.jpg|thumb|left|''Amaryllis belladonna'' flowers]]
Amaryllis is a [[bulb]]ous plant, with each bulb being 5–10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. It has several strap-shaped, green [[leaf|leaves]], 30–50&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm broad, arranged in two rows. The leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. The plant is not frost-tolerant, nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production. 

From the dry ground in late summer (August in zone 7) each bulb produces one or two leafless stems 30–60&amp;nbsp;cm tall, each of which bears a cluster of 2 to 12 funnel-shaped [[flower]]s at their tops. Each flower is 6–10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter with six [[tepal]]s (three outer sepals, three inner petals, with similar appearance to each other). The usual color is white with crimson veins, but pink or purple also occur naturally. The common name &quot;naked lady&quot; stems from the plant's pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegoodwebguide.co.uk/index.php?art_id=558&lt;/ref&gt;

The species was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century. They reproduce slowly either by bulb division or seeds and have gradually naturalized from plantings in urban and suburban areas throughout the lower elevations and coastal areas in much of the West Coast  of the USA since these environments mimic their native South African habitat.

Many bulbs sold as Amaryllis and described as 'ready to bloom for the holidays' actually belong to the allied genus [[Hippeastrum]], despite being labeled as 'Amaryllis' by sellers and [[nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]]. Adding to the name confusion, some bulbs of other species with a similar growth and flowering pattern are also sometimes called this plant's common name &quot;naked ladies&quot;. Some of those species have their own more widely used and accepted common names, such as the Resurrection Lily (''[[Lycoris squamigera]]'').

There is an ''Amaryllis belladonna'' × ''[[Crinum moorei]]'' cross, called ''[[× Amarcrinum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacificbulbsociety.org/pbswiki/index.php/XAmarcrinum&lt;/ref&gt; which has named cultivars.

==Name==
The botanic name ''Amaryllis'' is taken from a shepherdess in [[Virgil]]'s pastoral &quot;[[Eclogues]]&quot;, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀμαρύσσω ([[Latin]] ''amarysso'') meaning &quot;to sparkle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=amaryllis&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a [[given name]] for girls. 

The plant is also sometimes known as the &quot;[[Jersey]] Lily&quot;.

==International Bulb Society==
The [[Herbert Medal]] is offered annually by the [[International Bulb Society]] and is considered the highest honor that a person can receive for noteworthy achievements in advancing the knowledge of bulbous plants. In 1951 this award was given to [[Mulford B. Foster]] for his outstanding work with amaryllis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bulbsociety.org/ABOUT_IBS/Awards/HERBERT_MEDAL/index.html The Herbert Medal]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Alfonso III of Aragon.jpg|thumb|Alfonso III of Aragon]]
'''Alfonso III''' (1265, [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] &amp;ndash; 18 June 1291), called '''the Liberal''' (''el Liberal'') or '''the Free''' (also &quot;the Frank,&quot; from ''el Franc''), was the [[King of Aragon]] and [[Count of Barcelona]] (as '''Alfons II''') from 1285. He conquered the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] between his succession and 1287.

He was a son of [[Peter III of Aragon]] and his [[Queen consort]] [[Constantia of Sicily]], daughter and heiress of [[Manfred of Sicily]]. His maternal grandmother Beatrice of Savoy was a daughter of [[Amadeus IV of Savoy]] and Anne of Burgundy.

Soon after assuming the throne, he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the [[Balearic Islands]] into the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] - which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather, [[James I of Aragon]]. Thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle, [[James II of Majorca]], and conquered both Majorca  (1285) and Ibiza (1286), effectively reassuming suzerainty over the [[Kingdom of Majorca]]. He followed this with the conquest of [[Minorca]] - until then, an autonomous [[Muslim]] state ([[Manûrqa]]) under the Kingdom of Majorca - on 17 January 1287, the anniversary of which now serves as Minorca's national holiday.

He initially sought to maintain the Aragonese control over Sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to island of his brother, [[James II of Aragon]]. However, he later pressed his brother to retract the claims and instead supported claim from the [[Papal States]].

His reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the Aragonese nobles, which eventually culminated in the articles of the [[Union of Aragon]] - the so called &quot;Magna Carta of Aragon&quot;, which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles. His inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in Aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility, who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne, and brought the Kingdom of Aragon close to anarchy.

During his lifetime a dynastic marriage with Princess [[Eleanor of England (1269-1298)|Eleanor of England]] &lt;ref&gt;http://edwardthesecond.blogspot.com/2008/05/sisters-of-edward-ii-1-eleanor.html&lt;/ref&gt;
, daughter of King [[Edward I of England]], was arranged. However Alfonso died before meeting his bride. He died at the age of 27 in 1291, and was buried in Franciscan convent at Barcelona; since 1852 his remains are buried in Barcelona Cathedral.

[[Dante Alighieri]], in [[the Divine Comedy]], recounts that he saw Alfonso's spirit seated outside the gates of [[Purgatory]] with the other monarchs whom Dante blamed for the chaotic political state of [[Europe]] during the 13th century.

[[Image:Alifonso IV d'Aragón.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Alfonso IV of Aragon]]
'''Alfonso IV''', called '''the Kind''' (also ''the Gentle'' or ''the Nice'', {{lang-ca|Alfons el Benigne}}) (1299, [[Naples]] &amp;ndash; 24 January 1336) was the [[King of Aragon]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Callaghan,  Joseph F.,''A History of Medieval Spain'', (Cornell University Press, 1975), 408.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Count of Barcelona]]&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Iberia: an encyclopedia'', Ed. E. Michael Gerli, Samuel G. Armistead, (Routledge, 2003), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; (as Alfonso III) from 1327 to his death. He was the second son of [[James II of Aragon|James II]] and [[Blanche of Anjou]]. His reign saw the incorporation of the [[County of Urgell]], [[Duchy of Athens]], and [[Duchy of Neopatria]] into the [[Crown of Aragon]].

During the reign of his father, he was the procurator general of the Crown. He married [[Teresa d'Entença y Cabrera]], heiress of [[Urgell]], in 1314 in the Cathedral of [[Lerida]]. He is reputed to have been so liberal in the expenses during the wedding, that the local counsels imposed restrictions on how much he could spend. In 1323&amp;ndash;1324, he undertook the conquest of [[Sardinia]]. He became heir after his older brother James renounced his rights to become a monk. In 1329, he began a long war with the [[Republic of Genoa]]. The city of [[Sassari]] surrenderd in 1323, but rebelled three more times and was contested by Genoa.

After being widowed in 1327, Alfonso married in February 1329 [[Eleanor of Castile (1307-1359)|Eleanor of Castile]] (1308–1359), who was betrothed to his brother James, who had refused to consummate the marriage. She was the sister of [[Alfonso XI of Castile]]. Because of some favoritism he showed towards his second wife, the last years of his life, he had to contend with the son of his first marriage, the future [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]].

==Children==
By [[Teresa d'Entença]]:
* Alfonso (1315–1317)
* [[Constance of Aragon, Queen of Majorca|Constance]] (1318–1346), married in 1336 to [[James III of Majorca]].
* [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]] (1319–1346), successor.
* [[James I of Urgell|James I, Count of Urgell]] (1321–1347), also inherited Entença and Antillon.
* Elizabeth (1323–1327).
* Fadrique (1325-died young).
* Sancho (1327), lived only a few days.

By [[Eleanor of Castile (1307-1359)|Eleanor of Castile]]:
* [[Ferdinand, Prince of Aragon|Ferdinand]] (1329–1363), Marquis of Tortosa and Lord of Albarracín and Fraga.
* John (1331–1358), Lord of Elche, Biel and Bolsa, married in 1355 to [[Isabel Núñez de Lara]] and was killed by order of his cousin [[Pedro of Castile]].

'''Amasis II''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄμασις}}) or '''Ahmose II''' was a [[pharaoh]] (570 B.C.E. – 526 B.C.E.) of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt]], the successor of [[Apries]] at [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. He was the last great ruler of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] before the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] conquest.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Lloyd | first = Alan Brian  | contribution = Amasis | year = 1996  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | isbn = 0-19-521693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Most of our information about him is derived from [[Herodotus]] (2.161ff) and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence. According to the Greek historian, he was of common origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = Charles Peter Mason | title = Amasis (II) | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 136–137 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0145.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revolt which broke out among native Egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne. These troops, returning home from a disastrous military expedition to [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]] in Libya, suspected that they had been betrayed in order that [[Apries]], the reigning king, might rule more absolutely by means of his Greek [[mercenaries]]; many Egyptians fully sympathized with them. General Amasis, sent to meet them and quell the revolt, was proclaimed king by the rebels instead, and Apries, who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries, was defeated. Apries was either taken prisoner in the ensuing conflict at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] before being eventually strangled and buried in his ancestral tomb at Sais, or fled to the Babylonians and was killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in 567 B.C.E. with the aid of a Babylonian army. An inscription confirms the struggle between the native Egyptian and the foreign soldiery, and proves that Apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of Amasis (c.567 B.C.E.).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Amasis then married Chedebnitjerbone II, one of the daughters of his predecessor [[Apries]], in order to legitimise his kingship.

Some information is known about the family origins of Amasis: his mother was a certain Tashereniset as a bust statue of this lady, which is today located in the British Museum, shows.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Dodson &amp; Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004. pp.245 &amp; 247&lt;/ref&gt; A stone block from Mehallet el-Kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother—Tashereniset's mother—was a certain Tjenmutetj.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson &amp; Hilton, pp.245 &amp; 247&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus, Amasis, was asked by [[Cambyses II]] or [[Cyrus the Great]] for an Egyptian [[ophthalmologist]] on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for his forced exile, the physician would grow very close with Cambyses  and would suggest that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage.&lt;ref name=Hero/&gt; 

Amasis worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king refused to give up his offspring; Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire so he concucted a trickery in which he forced the daughter of the ex-pharaoh [[Apries]], whom Herodotus expilicity confirms to have been killed by Amasis, to go to Persia instead of his own offspring.&lt;ref name=Hero&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Herodotus Volume I,Book II|author=Herodotus|pages=246–250|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1uQaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Herodotus+Amasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a0o0Tb-HMdDegQfu64niCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Amasis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sir&gt;{{cite book|title=Manners and customs of the ancient Egyptians: including their private life, government, laws, art, manufactures, religions, and early history; derived from a comparison of the paintings, sculptures, and monuments still existng, with the accounts of ancient authors.

This daughter of Apries, was none other than [[Nitetis]], who was as per Herodotus's account, &quot;tall and beautiful.&quot; Nitetis naturally, betrayed Amasis and upon being greeted by the Persian king explained Amasis's trickery and her true origins. This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis would die before Cambyses reached him, but his heir and son Psamtik III would be defeated by the Persians.&lt;ref name=Hero/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;

Herodotus also describes that just like his predecessor, Amasis II relied on Greek mercenaries and council men. One such figure was [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]], who would later on leave Amasis, for reasons Herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis would send one of his [[eunuch]]s to capture Phanes, but the eunuch is bested by the wise council man and Phanes flees to Persia, meeting up with Cambyses providing advice in his invasion of Egypt. Egypt would finally be lost to Persians during the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|battle of Pelusium]].&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;

==Egypt's wealth==
Although Amasis thus appears first as champion of the disparaged native, he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]], and brought Egypt into closer touch with it than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration, Egypt reached a new level of wealth; Amasis adorned the temples of [[Lower Egypt]] especially with splendid [[monolith]]ic [[shrine]]s and other monuments (his activity here is proved by existing remains). Amasis assigned the commercial colony of [[Naucratis]] on the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]] to the Greeks, and when the [[temple of Delphi]] was burnt, he contributed 1,000 [[talent (weight)|talents]] to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named [[Ladice (Cyrenaean Princess)|Ladice]] daughter of King [[Battus III of Cyrene|Battus III]] and made alliances with [[Polycrates]] of Samos and [[Croesus]] of Lydia.

Under Amasis or Ahmose II, Egypt's agricultural based economy reached its zenith. Herodotus who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis II's death writes that:
{{quote|It is said that it was during the reign of Ahmose II that Egypt attained its highest level of prosperity both in respect of what the river gave the land and in respect of what the land yielded to men and that the number of inhabited cities at that time reached in total 20,000&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, (II, 177, 1)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the [[First Cataract]], but to this he added [[Cyprus]], and his influence was great in Cyrene. In his fourth year (c.567 B.C.E.), Amasis was able to defeat an invasion of Egypt by the Babylonians under [[Nebuchadrezzar II]]; henceforth, the Babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against Amasis.&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd, 'The Late Period' in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt (ed. Ian Shaw), Oxford Univ. Press 2002 paperback, pp.381-82&lt;/ref&gt; However, Amasis was later faced with a more formidable enemy with the rise of Persia under [[Cyrus II of Persia|Cyrus]] who ascended to the throne in 559 B.C.E.; his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending Persian onslaught against Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd.(2002)p.382&quot;&gt;Lloyd. (2002) p.382&lt;/ref&gt; With great strategic skill, Cyrus had destroyed Lydia in 546 B.C.E. and finally defeated the Babylonians in 538 B.C.E. which left Amasis with no major Near Eastern allies to counter Persia's increasing military might.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd.(2002)p.382&quot;/&gt; Amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the Greek states to counter the future Persian invasion into Egypt but was fortunate to have died in 526 B.C.E. shortly before the Persians attacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd.(2002)p.382&quot;/&gt; The final assault instead fell upon his son [[Psamtik III]], whom the Persians defeated in 525 B.C.E. after a reign of only six months.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'': Micropædia, Vol.9 15th edition, 2003. p.756&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomb and desecration==
Amasis II died in 526 BC. He was buried at the royal necropolis of Sais, and while his tomb was never discovered, Herodotus describes it for us:

{{quote|[It is] a great cloistered building of stone, decorated with pillars carved in the imitation of palm-trees, and other costly ornaments. Within the cloister is a chamber with double doors, and behind the doors stands the sepulchre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/amasis.htm Amasis]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herodotus also relates the desecration of Ahmose II/Amasis' mummy when the Persian king Cambyses conquered Egypt and thus ended the 26th Saite dynasty:
{{quote|[N]o sooner did [... Cambyses] enter the palace of Amasis that he gave orders for his [Amasis's] body to be taken from the tomb where it lay. This done, he proceeded to have it treated with every possible indignity, such as beating it with whips, sticking it with goads, and plucking its hairs. [... A]s the body had been embalmed and would not fall to pieces under the blows, Cambyses had it burned.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The Histories, Book III, Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;}}
