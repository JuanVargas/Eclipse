 Act. Justice Samuel Chase of the Supreme Court presided at Callender's trial. Callender's counsel attempted to argue the unconstitutionality of the Sedition law, but Chase refused to permit the jury to determine the constitutionality of a federal statute. Callender was convicted, and Chase fined him $200 and sentenced him to nine months in jail. Jefferson pardoned Callender when he became President, as he did the others convicted under the Sedition Act, and also gave him fifty dollars towards his fine, the last in a series of payments he made to support the journalist. Callender however, enraged by what he perceived as a slight by the new President, wrote a series of attacks on Jefferson similar to those earlier launched against Adams, and which included the assertion that Jefferson had fathered children by a slave woman.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John C.

===A member of Congress===
[[Matthew Lyon]], born in Ireland, was a Democratic-Republican congressman from Vermont. He was indicted under the Sedition Act for an essay he had written in the ''Vermont Journal'' accusing the administration of &quot;ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice&quot;. While awaiting trial, Lyon commenced publication of ''Lyon's Republican Magazine'', subtitled &quot;The Scourge of Aristocracy&quot;. Supreme Court justice Paterson presiding at trial, denied Lyon's defense of unconstitutionality of the statute, fined Lyon $1,000 and sentenced him to four months in prison.  While in prison, Lyon continued to write, and also won re-election. After his release, he returned to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Foner, Eric|title=Give Me Liberty!|pages=282–283|year=2008|publisher=W.W.

===Private individuals===
Luther Baldwin, a private citizen, was indicted for a comment he made during a visit by President Adams to Newark, New Jersey. The President was greeted by a crowd and by a committee that saluted him by firing a cannon. A bystander said, &quot;There goes the President and they are firing at his ass.&quot; Baldwin replied that he did not care &quot;if they fired through his ass.&quot; He was convicted in the federal court for speaking &quot;seditious words tending to defame the President and Government of the United States&quot; and fined $100.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Smith, J.|title=Freedom's Fetters|pages=270–274|year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John C.

In November 1798, [[David Brown (Massachusetts)|David Brown]] led a group in Dedham, Massachusetts in setting up a [[liberty pole]] with the words, &quot;No Stamp Act, No Sedition Act, No Alien Bills, No Land Tax, downfall to the Tyrants of America; peace and retirement to the President; Long Live the Vice President&quot;.&lt;ref name = Perilous&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=S7ScI3Ia25sC&amp;pg=PA64 | page = 64 | title = Perilous times: free speech in wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the war on terrorism | first = Geoffrey R. | last = Stone | publisher = W.

===Political nature of the prosecutions===

The Republican prediction that the Sedition Act would be used as a tool to assure the primacy of the Federalists was confirmed by the fact that no Federalist editor was indicted for equally rough language towards Republicans. John C. Miller writes that &quot;the Sedition Act was not construed to mean that the Federalists were to cease maligning and whipping Jefferson&quot;, who was, among numerous other assertions, called a 'vain author, false prophet, and thorough-bred Frenchman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John C. ''Crisis in Freedom: The Alien and Sedition Acts'' (New York: Little Brown and Company 1951) p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences of the Alien Act===

While government authorities prepared lists of aliens for deportation, many aliens fled the country during the debate over the Alien and Sedition Acts, and Adams never signed a deportation order.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John C. ''Crisis in Freedom: The Alien and Sedition Acts'' (New York: Little Brown and Company 1951) p. 187-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The Republicans used the Alien and Sedition Acts as one of their principal issues in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 election]], in which Federalists at all levels, were turned out of power. Thomas Jefferson, upon assuming the Presidency, pardoned all of those still serving sentences under the Sedition Act.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John C. Crisis in Freedom: The Alien and Sedition Acts (New York: Little Brown and Company 1951) p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1832, the House [[Judiciary Committee]] denounced the Sedition Act as unconstitutional, permitting the refund of fines which had been paid under it.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, Frank L., ''Jefferson and the Press'' (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press 1943), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alien Enemies Act remained in force and was used as a basis for the [[Japanese American internment|internment of Japanese citizens]] during World War II. 

While the Sedition Act was never reviewed by the Supreme Court, subsequent mentions in Supreme Court opinions have assumed that it was unconstitutional. In the seminal free speech case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', the Court declared, &quot;Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history.&quot; 376 U.S. 254, 276 (1964). In a [[concurring opinion]] in ''Watts v. United States'', which involved an alleged threat against President [[Lyndon Johnson]], [[William O. Douglas]] noted, &quot;The Alien and Sedition Laws constituted one of our sorriest chapters; and I had thought we had done with them forever ... Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old, old device, outlawed by our Constitution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=394&amp;invol=705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antinomy''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] αντι-, for or instead of, plus νομος, law) literally means the mutual incompatibility, real or apparent, of two laws. It is a term used in [[logic]] and [[epistemology]].

The term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of reason proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena).  Empirical reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.

For Kant there are four antinomies connected with
#the limitation of the universe in respect of [[space]] and [[time]],
#the theory that the whole consists of indivisible atoms (whereas, in fact, none such exist),
#the problem of [[free will]] in relation to universal causality
#the existence of a necessary being
about each of which a thesis contradicts an antithesis. For example: in the First Antinomy, Kant proves the thesis that time must have a beginning by showing that if time had no beginning, then an infinity would have elapsed up until the present moment. This is a manifest contradiction because infinity cannot, by definition, be completed by &quot;successive synthesis&quot; -- yet just such a finalizing synthesis would be required by the view that time is infinite; so the thesis is proven. Then he proves the antithesis, that time has no beginning, by showing that if time had a beginning, then there must have been &quot;empty time&quot; out of which time arose. This is incoherent (for Kant) for the following reason. Since, necessarily, no time elapses in this pretemporal void, then there could be no alteration, and therefore nothing (including time) would ever come to be: so the antithesis is proven. Reason makes equal claim to each proof, since they are both correct, so the question of the limits of time must be regarded as meaningless.

This was part of Kant's critical program of determining limits to [[science]] and philosophical inquiry. These contradictions are inherent in reason when it is applied to the world as it is in itself, independently of our perceptions of it (this has to do with the distinction between [[phenomena]] and [[noumena]]). Kant's goal in his critical philosophy was to identify what claims we are and are not justified in making, and the antinomies are a particularly illustrative example of his larger project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''ascending chain condition (ACC)''' and '''descending chain condition (DCC)''' are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly, [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in certain [[commutative ring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hazewinkel, Gubareni &amp; Kirichenko (2004), p.6, Prop. 1.1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraleigh &amp; Katz (1967), p. 366, Lemma 7.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 142 and 147&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of [[David Hilbert]], [[Emmy Noether]], and [[Emil Artin]].
The conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any [[partially ordered set]]. This point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to Gabriel and Rentschler.

== Definition ==
A [[partially ordered set]] (poset) ''P'' is said to satisfy the '''ascending chain condition''' (ACC) if every ascending chain of elements eventually terminates.  Equivalently, given any sequence of elements of ''P''
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 \,\leq\, a_2 \,\leq\, a_3 \,\leq\, \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;
there exists a positive [[integer]] ''n'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} = \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, ''P'' is said to satisfy the '''descending chain condition''' (DCC) if every descending chain of elements eventually terminates, or equivalently if any descending sequence
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \,\leq\, a_3 \,\leq\, a_2 \,\leq\, a_1&lt;/math&gt;
of elements of ''P'' eventually stabilizes (that is, there is no [[infinite descending chain]]).

=== Comments ===
*A subtly different and stronger condition than &quot;containing no infinite ascending/descending chains&quot; is &quot;contains no arbitrarily long ascending/descending chains (optionally, 'based at a given element')&quot;. For instance, the disjoint union of the posets {0}, {0,1}, {0,1,2}, etc., satisfies both the ACC and the DCC, but has arbitrarily long chains. If one further identifies the 0 in all of these sets, then every chain is finite, but there are arbitrarily long chains based at 0.

*The descending chain condition on ''P'' is equivalent to ''P'' being [[well-founded]]: every nonempty subset of ''P'' has a minimal element (also called the '''minimal condition''').

*Similarly, the ascending chain condition is equivalent to ''P'' being converse well-founded: every nonempty subset of ''P'' has a maximal element (the '''maximal condition''').

*Every finite poset satisfies both ACC and DCC.

* A [[total order|totally ordered set]] that satisfies the descending chain condition is called a [[well-order|well-ordered set]].

Following graduation, he established several experimental schools and, at the age of 23, became [[Israel]]’s youngest school principal.&lt;ref name=tanya/&gt;

In 1965, he founded the [[Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications]] and began his monumental work on the Talmud, including translation to Hebrew, English, Russian, and various other languages. The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud include translation from the original [[Aramaic]] and a comprehensive commentary. Rabbi Steinsaltz completed his Hebrew edition of the entire Babylonian Talmud in November 2010, at which time [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] became the publisher of all of his works, including the Talmud. While not without criticism (e.g. by [[Jacob Neusner|Neusner]], 1998), the Steinsaltz edition is widely used throughout Israel, the United States and the world. Over 2 million volumes of the Steinsaltz Talmud have been distributed to date. The out of print [[Random House]] publication of ''[[The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition]]'' is widely regarded as the most accurate and least redacted of any English language edition and is sought after on that basis by scholars and collectors. Controversial Talmud passages previously obscured, omitted entirely or confined to footnotes in English translations like the [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] Talmud, receive full exposition in the Steinsaltz Talmud. [[Random House]] halted publication of the Steinsaltz Talmud after less than one-third of the English translation had been published. 

The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud have opened up the world of Talmud study to thousands of people outside the walls of the traditional yeshiva, including women, who traditionally were not taught Talmud. Regarding the access that his work provides, Rabbi Steinsaltz says:

:“I never thought that spreading ignorance has any advantage, except for those who are in a position of power and want to deprive others of their rights and spread ignorance in order to keep them underlings.”

Rabbi Steinsaltz's classic work of [[Kabbalah]], ''The Thirteen Petalled Rose'', was first published in 1980 and now appears in eight languages. In all, Rabbi Steinsaltz has authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects including Talmud, [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[sociology]], historical [[biography]], and [[philosophy]]. Many of these works have been translated into English by his close personal friend, now deceased, Yehuda Hanegbi. All are published by Koren Publishers Jerusalem.

Continuing his work as a teacher and spiritual mentor, Rabbi Steinsaltz established a network of schools and educational institutions in Israel and the former Soviet Union. He has served as scholar in residence at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His honorary degrees include doctorates from [[Yeshiva University]], [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Bar Ilan University]], [[Brandeis University]], and [[Florida International University]]. Rabbi Steinsaltz is also [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshivat Hesder]] [[Tekoa]], and functions as [[Nasi]] in [[Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin|an attempt to revive]] the [[Sanhedrin]].

Being a follower of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], he went to help Jews in the [[Soviet Union]] assisting Chabad's [[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]] network. Deeply involved in the future of the Jews in the former Soviet Union, Steinsaltz serves as the region's [[Duchovny Ravin]], a historic Russian title which indicates that he is the spiritual mentor of Russian Jewry. In this capacity, Steinsaltz travelled to Russia and the Republics once each month from his home in Jerusalem. During his time in the former Soviet Union he founded the [[Jewish University]], both in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. The Jewish University is the first degree-granting institution of Jewish studies ever established in the former [[Soviet Union]].

He has conducted interfaith work with several Cardinals in the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardinalrating.com/cardinal_97__article_1201.htm Cardinals Meet For a Dialogue With Top Rabbis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Steinsaltz and his wife live in Jerusalem, and have three children and eleven grandchildren. His son, Rabbi Menachem Even-Israel, is the Director of Educational Programs at the Steinsaltz Center in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem.

==As a speaker==
Steinsaltz is a popular [[University]] and [[radio]] commentator. He has been invited to speak at the [[Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies]] at [[Yale University]] in 1979. In Jerusalem, he gives evening seminars, which according to Newsweek usually last till 2 in the morning, and have attracted prominent politicians as the former [[Prime Minister]] [[Levi Eshkol]] and former [[Finance Minister]] [[Pinhas Sapir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steinsaltz.org/dynamic/InTheNews_details.asp?id=14|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|author=[[Kenneth L.

'''Alfred Edward Housman''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|aʊ|s|m|ən}}; 26 March 1859 – 30 April 1936), usually known as '''A E Housman''', was an English [[classics|classical scholar]] and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]''. Lyrical and almost [[epigram]]matic in form, the poems were mostly written before 1900.  Their wistful evocation of doomed youth in the English countryside, in spare language and distinctive imagery, appealed strongly to late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]]  taste, and to many early twentieth century English composers (beginning with [[Arthur Somervell]]) both before and after the [[First World War]]. Through its song-setting the poetry became closely associated with that era, and with [[Shropshire]] itself. 

Housman was counted one of the foremost classicists of his age, and has been ranked as one of the greatest scholars of all time.&lt;ref&gt;'a man who turned out to be not only the great English classical scholar of his time but also one of the few real and great scholars anywhere at any time'. Charles Oscar Brink, ''English Classical Scholarship: Historical reflections on Bentley, Porson and Housman,''  James Clarke &amp; Co, Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], New York, 1986 p.149&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref Name=&quot;PF&quot;/&gt; He established his reputation publishing as a [[private scholar]] and, on the strength and quality of his work, was appointed Professor of Latin at [[University College London]] and later, at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. His editions of [[Juvenal]], [[Manilius]] and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] are still considered authoritative.

==Life==
The eldest of seven children, Housman was born at Valley House in Fockbury, a hamlet on the outskirts of [[Bromsgrove]] in [[Worcestershire]], and was baptised at Christ Church, in Catshill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bromsgroveparish.org.uk/christ-church.html Christ Church Catshill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;&gt;[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/631 Profile at Poets.org]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died on his twelfth birthday, and his father, a country solicitor, later remarried, to an elder cousin, Lucy, in 1873. Housman's brother [[Laurence Housman]] and sister [[Clemence Housman]] also became writers.

Housman was educated first at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], then [[Bromsgrove School]], where he acquired a strong academic grounding and won prizes for his poetry.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt;  In 1877, he won an open scholarship to [[St John's College, Oxford]], where he studied [[classics]].&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; Although by nature rather withdrawn, Housman formed strong friendships with two roommates, Moses Jackson and [[Alfred W. Pollard|A. W. Pollard]]. Jackson became the great love of Housman's life, though the latter's feelings were not reciprocated, as Jackson was [[heterosexual]].&lt;ref&gt;Summers (1995) p371&lt;/ref&gt; Housman obtained a first in classical Moderations in 1879, but his immersion in textual analysis, particularly with [[Propertius]], led him to neglect ancient history and philosophy, which formed part of the [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] curriculum, and thus he failed to obtain a degree.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; Though some explain Housman's unexpected failure in his final exams as a result of Jackson's rejection,&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham (2000) p.981.&lt;/ref&gt; most biographers adduce a variety of reasons, indifference to philosophy, overconfidence in his praeternatural gifts, a contempt for inexact learning, and enjoyment of idling away his time with Jackson, conjoined with news of his father's desperate illness as the more immediate and germane causes.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Page, Macmillan, London (1983) ''A E Housman: A Critical Biography'' pp.43-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Perceval Graves, ''A E Housman: The Scholar-Poet'' Charles Scribners, New York (1979) pp.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Oscar Brink, ''English Classical Scholarship'' pp.152&lt;/ref&gt; The failure left him with a deep sense of humiliation, and a determination to vindicate his genius.

After Oxford, Jackson got a job as a [[patent examiner|clerk]] in the [[Patent Office]] in London and arranged a job there for Housman as well.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; They shared a flat with Jackson's brother Adalbert until 1885 when Housman moved to lodgings of his own. Moses Jackson moved to India in 1887. When Jackson returned briefly to England in 1889 to marry, Housman not only was not invited to the wedding but knew nothing about it until the couple had left the country. Adalbert Jackson died in 1892. Housman continued pursuing classical studies independently and published scholarly articles on such authors as [[Horace]], [[Propertius]], [[Ovid]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]].&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; He gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered the professorship of Latin at [[University College London]], which he accepted.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; Many years later, the ''UCL Academic Staff Common Room'' was dedicated to his memory as the ''Housman Room''.

The pleasures Housman enjoyed included [[gastronomy]], flying in aeroplanes, and frequent visits to [[France]], where he read &quot;books which were banned in Britain as pornographic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Graves (1979) p155.&lt;/ref&gt; A fellow don described him as being &quot;descended from a long line of maiden aunts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Critchley (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Housman Grave.JPG|thumb|250px|Housman's grave at St. Laurence's Church in Ludlow. The cherry tree, on the right, was planted in his memory (see A Shropshire Lad, II).]]

Although Housman's early work and his sphere of responsibilities as professor included both [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], he began to focus his energy on Latin poetry. When asked later why he had stopped writing about Greek poetry, he responded, &quot;I found that I could not attain to excellence in both.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gow (Cambridge 1936) p5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he took the [[Kennedy Professorship of Latin]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he remained for the rest of his life. Classics Professor G. P. Goold at University College, wrote of Housman's scholar's accomplishments: &quot;The legacy of Housman's scholarship is a thing of permanent value; and that value consists less in obvious results, the establishment of general propositions about Latin and the removal of scribal mistakes, than in the shining example he provides of a wonderful mind at work.... He was and may remain the last great textual critic.&quot; &lt;ref Name=&quot;PF&quot;/&gt; During 1903–1930, he published his critical edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius's]] ''Astronomicon'' in five volumes. He also edited works of [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] (1905) and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] (1926). Many colleagues were unnerved by his scathing critical attacks on those whom he found guilty of shoddy scholarship.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt;  In his paper &quot;The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism,&quot; (1921) Housman stated: &quot;A textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like Newton investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas.&quot; He declared many of his contemporary scholars to be stupid, lazy, vain, or all three, proclaiming: &quot;Knowledge is good, method is good, but one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head.&quot; &lt;ref Name=&quot;PF&quot;&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/a-e-housman Poetry Foundation profile]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism,&quot; (1921) Housman&lt;/ref&gt; His younger colleague [[A. S. F. Gow]] quotes examples of these attacks, noting that they &quot;were often savage in the extreme.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gow (Cambridge 1936) p24&lt;/ref&gt; Gow also relates how Housman intimidated his students, sometimes reducing them to tears. According to Gow, Housman could never remember his students' names, maintaining that &quot;had he burdened his memory by the distinction between Miss Jones and Miss Robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gow (Cambridge 1936) p18&lt;/ref&gt;  Housman found his true vocation in classical studies and treated poetry as a secondary activity. He did not speak about his poetry in public until 1933 when he gave a lecture, &quot;The Name and Nature of Poetry&quot;, in which he argued that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than to the intellect. 

Housman died three years later, aged 77,  in Cambridge. His ashes are buried near St Laurence's Church, [[Ludlow]], Shropshire.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; The [[University of Worcester]] has acknowledged Housman's local connection by naming a new building after him.

'''A Shropshire Lad II:&lt;/br&gt; Loveliest of trees, the cherry now'''

Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.

Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.

And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.

&lt;/poem&gt; |source =from ''A Shropshire Lad'' (1896) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=173676  ''A Shropshire Lad'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During his years in London, A E Housman completed ''A Shropshire Lad'', a cycle of 63 poems.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; After several publishers had turned it down, he published it at his own expense in 1896. The volume surprised both his colleagues and students.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; At first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success, and its appeal to English musicians had helped to make it widely known before [[World War I]], when its themes struck a powerful chord with English readers.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; ''A Shropshire Lad'' has been in print continuously since May 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

The poems are pervaded by deep pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; Housman wrote most of them while living in [[Highgate]], London, before ever visiting that part of Shropshire (about thirty miles from his home), which he presented in an idealised pastoral light, as his 'land of lost content'.&lt;ref&gt;A E Housman, ''A Shropshire Lad'', XL&lt;/ref&gt; Housman himself acknowledged the influence of the songs of [[William Shakespeare]], the Scottish [[Border ballads|Border Ballads]] and [[Heinrich Heine]], but specifically denied any influence of Greek and Latin classics in his poetry.

===Later collections===
In the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in [[Canada]], Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that Jackson could read them before his death.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Poets&quot;/&gt; These later poems, mostly written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in ''A Shropshire Lad'' but lack the consistency of his previously published work. He published them as ''[[Last Poems]]'' (1922) because he felt his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime. This proved true. After his death Housman's brother, [[Laurence Housman|Laurence]], published further poems which appeared in ''More Poems'' (1936) and ''Collected Poems'' (1939). Housman also wrote a parodic ''Fragment of a Greek Tragedy'', in English, and humorous poems published posthumously under the title ''Unkind to Unicorns''.

[[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]] found statements in a letter written late in Housman's life which describe how his poems came into existence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Poetry was for him ...'a morbid secretion', as the pearl is for the oyster. The desire, or the need, did not come upon him often, and it came usually when he was feeling ill or depressed; then whole lines and stanzas would present themselves to him without any effort, or any consciousness of composition on his part. Sometimes they wanted a little alteration, sometimes none; sometimes the lines needed in order to make a complete poem would come later, spontaneously or with 'a little coaxing'; sometimes he had to sit down and finish the poem with his head. That .... was a long and laborious process.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Sparrow&quot;/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Sparrow himself adds, &quot;How difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in ''A Shropshire Lad''. Of its four stanzas, Housman tells us that two were 'given' him ready made; one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later; the remaining one took months of conscious composition. No one can tell for certain which was which.&quot;&lt;ref Name=&quot;Sparrow&quot;&gt;''Collected Poems'' Penguin, Harmondsworth (1956), preface by John Sparrow.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''De Amicitia'' (about friendship)===
In 1942 Laurence Housman also deposited an essay entitled &quot;A E Housman's 'De Amicitia'&quot; in the [[British Library]], with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years. The essay discussed A E Housman's homosexuality and his love for Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Summers ed. 1995, 371.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the conservative nature of the times, Housman, as distinct from the prudence of his public life, was quite open in his poetry, and especially his ''A Shropshire Lad'', about his deeper sympathies. Poem 30 of that sequence, for instance, speaks of how 'Fear contended with desire': &quot;Others, I am not the first / have willed more mischief than they durst&quot;. In ''More Poems'', he buries his love for Moses Jackson in the very act of commemorating it, as his feelings of love break his friendship, and must be carried silently to the grave:&lt;ref&gt;Summers (1995) p372.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt; 
Because I liked you better
Than suits a man to say
It irked you, and I promised
To throw the thought away.

To put the world between us
We parted, stiff and dry;
Goodbye, said you, forget me.
I will, no fear, said I

If here, where clover whitens
The dead man's knoll, you pass,
And no tall flower to meet you
Starts in the trefoiled grass,

Halt by the headstone naming
The heart no longer stirred,
And say the lad that loved you
Was one that kept his word.&lt;ref&gt;A E Housman, ''More Poems,'' Jonathan Cape, London 1936 p.48&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt; 

His poem, &quot;Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?&quot;, written after the trial of [[Oscar Wilde]], addressed more general social injustice towards homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Housman (1937) p213.&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem the prisoner is suffering &quot;for the colour of his hair&quot;, a natural, given attribute which, in a clearly coded reference to homosexuality, is reviled as &quot;nameless and abominable&quot; (recalling the legal phrase ''peccatum horribile, inter christianos non nominandum'', &quot;the horrible sin, not to be named amongst Christians&quot;).

==Housman in other art forms==
===Music and art song===
Housman's poetry, especially ''A Shropshire Lad'', provided texts for a significant number of British, and in particular English, composers in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref Name=&quot;PF&quot;/&gt; The national, pastoral and traditional elements of his style resonated with similar trends in English music. The first was probably the cycle ''A Shropshire Lad'' set by [[Arthur Somervell]] in 1904, who had begun to develop the concept of the English [[song-cycle]] in his version of [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s ''[[Maud and other poems|Maud]]'' a little previously. [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] produced his most famous settings of six songs, the cycle ''On Wenlock Edge'', for [[string quartet]], [[tenor]] and piano (dedicated to [[Gervase Elwes]]) in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;W. and R. Elwes, ''Gervase Elwes, The Story of his Life'' (Grayson and Grayson, London 1935), p195-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and it became very popular after Elwes recorded it with the [[London String Quartet]] and [[Frederick B. Kiddle]] in 1917. Between 1909 and 1911 [[George Butterworth]] produced settings in two collections or cycles, as ''Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad'', and ''Bredon Hill and other songs''. He also wrote an orchestral [[tone poem]] on ''A Shropshire Lad'' (first performed at [[Leeds]] Festival under [[Arthur Nikisch]] in 1912).&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Eaglefield Hull]], ''A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians'' Dent, London (1924), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterworth's death on [[the Somme]] in 1916 was considered a great loss to English music; [[Ivor Gurney]], another most important setter of Housman (''Ludlow and Teme'', a work for voice and string quartet, and a song-cycle on Housman works, both of which won the [[Carnegie Award]])&lt;ref&gt;Eaglefield-Hull (1924) p205.&lt;/ref&gt; experienced emotional breakdowns which were popularly (but wrongly) believed to have arisen from [[shell-shock]]. Hence the fatalistic strain of the poems, and the earlier settings, foreshadowed responses to the universal bereavement of the [[World War I|First World War]] and became assimilated into them. This was reinforced when their foremost interpreter and performer, [[Gervase Elwes]] (who had initiated the music festivals at [[Brigg]] in [[Lincolnshire]] at which [[Percy Grainger]] and others had developed their collections of country music&lt;ref&gt;W. and R. Elwes (1935) p156-166.&lt;/ref&gt;) died in a horrific accident in 1921. Elwes had been closely identified with English wartime morale, having given six benefit performances of ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]'' on consecutive nights in 1916, and many concerts in France in 1917 for British soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;W. &amp; R. Elwes (1935) pp244-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other composers who set Housman songs were [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (song cycle, ''Land of Lost Content''), [[Michael Head]] (e.g. 'Ludlow Fair'), [[Graham Peel]] (a famous version of 'In Summertime on Bredon'), [[Ian Venables]] (Songs of Eternity and Sorrow), and the American [[Samuel Barber]] (e.g. 'With rue my heart is laden'). [[Gerald Finzi]] repeatedly began settings, though never finished any.  Even composers not directly associated with the 'pastoral' tradition, such as [[Arnold Bax]], [[Lennox Berkeley]] and [[Arthur Bliss]], were attracted to Housman's poetry. A 1976 catalogue listed 400 musical settings of Housman's poems.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and Banfield 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Housman's poetry influenced British music in a way comparable to that of [[Walt Whitman]] in the music of [[Delius]], Vaughan Williams and others: Housman's works provided song texts, Whitman's the texts for larger choral works. The contemporary [[New Zealand]] composer [[David Downes (New Zealand composer)|David Downes]] includes a setting of &quot;March&quot; on his CD ''The Rusted Wheel of Things''.

===Works titled after Housman===
Housman is the main character in the 1997 [[Tom Stoppard]] play ''[[The Invention of Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/1997/oct/05/features.review7?INTCMP=SRCH 'Guardian'' article&quot;Hades and gentlemen&quot; 5 October 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Many titles for novels and films have been drawn from Housman's poetry. The line &quot;There's this to say for blood and breath,/ they give a man a taste for death&quot; supplies the title for [[Peter O'Donnell]]'s 1969 [[Modesty Blaise]] thriller, ''[[A Taste for Death (Modesty Blaise)|A Taste for Death]]'', also the inspiration for [[P. D. James]]'  1986 crime novel, ''[[A Taste for Death (P. D. James novel)|A Taste for Death]]'', the seventh in her [[Adam Dalgliesh]] series. The last words of the poem &quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; are used by Audrey R. Langer for the title of the 1989 novel ''Ashes Under Uricon''. The [[Nobel Prize]] winning novelist [[Patrick White]] named his 1955 novel ''[[The Tree Of Man]]'' after a line in ''A Shropshire Lad'' and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s first novel, ''[[Against the Fall of Night]]'', is taken from a work in Housman's ''More Poems''. The 2009 novel ''[[Blood's a Rover]]'' by [[James Ellroy]] takes its title from Housman's poem &quot;Reveille&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/housm02.html Poets' Corner - A E Housman - A Shropshire Lad]&lt;/ref&gt; and a line from Housman's poem XVI &quot;How Clear, How Lovely Bright&quot;, was used for the title of the last ''[[Inspector Morse]]'' book ''[[The Remorseful Day]]'' by Colin Dexter. ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'', a television play by [[Dennis Potter]], takes its title from &quot;Into My Heart an Air That Kills&quot; from ''A Shropshire Lad'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/123/40.html Bartleby.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the cycle also providing the name for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Die Another Day]]'': &quot;But since the man that runs away / Lives to die another day&quot;.

'''Attribution of recent climate change''' is the effort to [[scientific method|scientifically ascertain]] mechanisms responsible for recent changes observed in the [[Earth]]'s [[climate]]. The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of [[instrumental temperature record]], when records are most reliable; particularly on the last 50 years, when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the [[troposphere]] have become available. The dominant mechanisms to which recent climate change has been attributed all result from [[human]] activity. They are:&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-AR4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis|year=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[IPCC]]|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/contents.html|editor=Solomon, S., D. Qin, M. Manning, Z. Chen, M. Marquis, K.B. Averyt, M. Tignor and H.L. Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* increasing [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] concentrations of [[greenhouse gas]]es
* global changes to land surface, such as [[deforestation]]
* increasing atmospheric concentrations of [[aerosol]]s.

Attribution of recent change to anthropogenic forcing is based on the following facts:

* The observed change is not consistent with natural variability.
* Known natural forcings would, if anything, be negative over this period.
* Known anthropogenic forcings are consistent with the observed response.
* The pattern of the observed change is consistent with the anthropogenic forcing.

Recent reports from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) have concluded that:

* &quot;Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is ''very likely'' due to the observed increase in [[anthropogenic]] [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations.&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-SPM&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Working Group I: The Physical Basis for Climate Change (Summary for Policymakers) | publisher = [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-521-88009-1 | url = http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf | format = PDF | author = edited by Susan Solomon ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''It is extremely unlikely (&lt;5%) that the global pattern of warming during the past half century can be explained without external forcing'' (i.e., it is inconsistent with being the result of internal variability), and very unlikely that it is due to known natural external causes alone. The warming occurred in both the ocean and the atmosphere and took place at a time when natural external forcing factors would likely have produced cooling.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;From new estimates of the combined anthropogenic [[radiative forcing|forcing]] due to greenhouse gases, [[aerosol]]s, and [[land use|land surface changes]], it is ''extremely likely'' that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-AR4&quot; /&gt;
* &quot;It is ''virtually certain'' that anthropogenic aerosols produce a net negative [[radiative forcing]] (cooling influence) with a greater magnitude in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] than in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-AR4&quot; /&gt;

The panel defines &quot;very likely,&quot; &quot;extremely likely,&quot; and &quot;virtually certain&quot; as indicating probabilities greater than 90%, 95%, and 99%, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-AR4&quot; /&gt;
The IPCC's attribution of recent global warming to human activites is a view shared by most scientists,&lt;ref name=nrc2001&gt;{{cite book

and is also supported by a number of scientific organizations (see [[scientific opinion on climate change]]).

==Key attributions==
=== Greenhouse gases ===
[[File:Greenhouse Gas by Sector.png|thumb|350px|Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research version 3.2, fast track 2000 project]]
Scientific consensus has identified [[carbon dioxide]] as the dominant [[greenhouse gas]] forcing. (The dominant greenhouse gas overall is [[water vapor]]. Water vapor, however, has a very short atmospheric lifetime (about 10 days) and is very nearly in a dynamic equilibrium in the atmosphere, so it is not a [[radiative forcing|forcing]] gas in the context of global warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;rc_wv&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=142 | title = Water vapour: feedback or forcing? | accessdate = 2008-04-07 | last = Schmidt | first = Gavin A. | authorlink = Gavin Schmidt | date = 2005-04-06 |work = | publisher = [[RealClimate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are also major forcing contributors to the [[greenhouse effect]]. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] lists these together with [[hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs), [[perfluorocarbons]] (PFCs), and [[sulphur hexafluoride]] (SF6),&lt;ref name=&quot;kyoto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Kyoto Protocol | publisher = [[UNFCCC]] | url = http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are entirely artificial (i.e. anthropogenic) gases which also contribute to radiative forcing in the atmosphere.
The chart at right attributes anthropogenic greenhouse gas [[Air pollutants|emissions]] to eight main economic sectors, of which the largest contributors are [[power stations]] (many of which burn [[coal]] or other [[fossil fuel]]s), [[industry|industrial]] processes (among which [[cement]] production is a dominant contributor&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-TS&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Working Group I: The Physical Basis for Climate Change (Technical summary) | publisher = [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-521-88009-1 | url = http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf | format = PDF | author = edited by Susan Solomon ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[transportation]] [[fuel]]s (generally [[fossil fuel]]s), and [[agriculture|agricultural]] by-products (mainly methane from [[enteric fermentation]] and nitrous oxide from [[fertilizer]] use).

===Land use===
Climate change is attributed to [[land use]] for two main reasons.
While 66% of anthropogenic [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions over the last 250 years have resulted from burning fossil fuels, 33% have resulted from changes in land use, primarily [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-TS&quot; /&gt; Deforestation both reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by deforested regions and releases greenhouse gases directly, together with aerosols, through [[slash and burn|biomass burning]] that frequently accompanies it.
A second reason that climate change has been attributed to land use is that the [[albedo|terrestrial albedo]] is often altered by use, which leads to [[radiative forcing]]. This effect is more significant locally than globally.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-TS&quot; /&gt;

====Livestock and land use====
Worldwide, livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the ice-free land surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;livestock&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Livestock's Long Shadow | year = 2006 | publisher = Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N. | isbn = 9251055718 | url = http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf | format = PDF | author = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Henning Steinfeld ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More than 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to livestock and livestock-related activities such as deforestation and increasingly fuel-intensive farming practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;livestock&quot; /&gt; Specific attributions to the livestock sector include:
* 9% of global anthropogenic [[carbon dioxide]] emissions
* 35–40% of global anthropogenic [[methane]] emissions (chiefly due to [[enteric fermentation]] and [[manure]])
* 64% of global anthropogenic [[nitrous oxide]] emissions, chiefly due to [[fertilizer]] use.&lt;ref name=&quot;livestock&quot; /&gt;

===Aerosols===
With virtual certainty, scientific consensus has attributed various forms of climate change, chiefly cooling effects, to [[aerosol]]s, which are small particles or droplets suspended in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-FM&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Working Group I: The Physical Basis for Climate Change (Front matter) | publisher = [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-521-88009-1 | url = http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-frontmatter.pdf | format = PDF | author = edited by Susan Solomon ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Key sources to which anthropogenic aerosols are attributed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Aerosols and Climate | last = Geerts | first = B. | url = http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap02/aerosol&amp;climate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:

* biomass burning such as [[slash and burn]] deforestation. Aerosols produced are primarily [[black carbon]].
* industrial [[air pollution]], which produces [[soot]] and airborne [[sulfate]]s, [[nitrate]]s, and [[ammonium]]
* dust produced by [[land use]] effects such as [[desertification]]

== Attribution of 20th century climate change ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Global warming controversy]] --&gt;
{{IPCC}}
[[File:Climate Change Attribution.png|250px|thumb|One [[global climate model]]'s reconstruction of temperature change during the 20th century as the result of five studied forcing factors and the amount of temperature change attributed to each.]]

Over the past 150 years human activities have released increasing quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This has led to increases in mean global temperature, or [[global warming]]. Other human effects are relevant—for example, sulphate [[Particulate|aerosols]] are believed to have a cooling effect. Natural factors also contribute. According to the [[historical temperature record]] of the last century, the Earth's near-surface air temperature has risen around 0.74 [[Plus-minus sign|±]] 0.18&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius]] (1.3 ± 0.32&amp;nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit]]).

A historically important question in climate change research has regarded the relative importance of human activity and non-[[anthropogenic]] causes during the period of [[instrumental temperature record|instrumental record]]. In the 1995 Second Assessment Report (SAR), the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] made the widely quoted statement that &quot;The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate&quot;. The phrase &quot;balance of evidence&quot; suggested the (English) common-law standard of proof required in civil as opposed to criminal courts: not as high as &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. In 2001 the Third Assessment Report (TAR) refined this, saying &quot;There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2001-SPM&quot; /&gt; The 2007 fourth assessment report (WG1 AR4) strengthened this finding:
* &quot;Anthropogenic warming of the climate system is widespread and can be detected in temperature observations taken at the surface, in the free atmosphere and in the oceans. Evidence of the effect of external influences, both anthropogenic and natural, on the climate system has continued to accumulate since the TAR.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-TS&quot; /&gt;

Over the past five decades there has been a global warming of approximately 0.65&amp;nbsp;°C (1.17&amp;nbsp;°F) at the Earth's surface (see [[historical temperature record]]). Among the possible factors that could produce changes in global mean temperature are internal variability of the climate system, external forcing, an increase in concentration of greenhouse gases, or any combination of these. Current studies indicate that the increase in greenhouse gases, most notably {{CO2}}, is mostly responsible for the observed warming. Evidence for this conclusion includes:

* Estimates of internal variability from climate models, and reconstructions of past temperatures, indicate that the warming is unlikely to be entirely natural.
* Climate models forced by natural factors ''and'' increased greenhouse gases and aerosols reproduce the observed global temperature changes; those forced by natural factors alone do not.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2001-SPM&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Houghton|2001}} [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/007.htm Summary for Policymakers]&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Fingerprint&quot; methods indicate that the pattern of change is closer to that expected from greenhouse gas-forced change than from natural change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Houghton|2001}} [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/460.htm 12.4.3 Optimal Fingerprint Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The plateau in warming from the 1940s to 1960s can be attributed largely to sulphate aerosol cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Houghton|2001}} [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/figspm-4.htm Figure 4 Simulated annual global mean surface temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Detection and attribution of climate signals, as well as its common-sense meaning, has a more precise definition within the climate change literature, as expressed by the IPCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Houghton|2001}} [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/443.htm#1211 12.1.1 The Meaning of Detection and Attribution]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Detection'' of a signal requires demonstrating that an observed change is [[statistically significant]]ly different from that which can be explained by natural internal variability.

''Attribution'' requires demonstrating that a signal is:

* unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;
* consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing
* not consistent with alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of forcings.

Detection does not imply attribution, and is easier to show than attribution. Unequivocal attribution would require controlled experiments with multiple copies of the climate system, which is not possible. Therefore, attribution, as described above, can only be done within some margin of error. For example, the IPCC's [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] says &quot;it is ''extremely likely'' that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750,&quot; where &quot;extremely likely&quot; indicates a probability greater than 95%.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-AR4&quot; /&gt;

Following the publication of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, &quot;detection and attribution&quot; of climate change has remained an active area of research. Some important results include:

* A review of detection and attribution studies by the International [[Ad hoc|Ad Hoc]] Detection and Attribution Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Detecting and Attributing External Influences on the Climate System: A Review of Recent Advances | first = T. | last = Barnett | journal = Journal of Climate | volume = 18 | issue = 9 | month = May | year = 2005 | pages = 1291–1314 | url = http://www.llnl.gov/tid/lof/documents/pdf/315840.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.1175/JCLI3329.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that &quot;natural drivers such as solar variability and volcanic activity are at most partially responsible for the large-scale temperature changes observed over the past century, and that a large fraction of the warming over the last 50 yr can be attributed to greenhouse gas increases. Thus, the recent research supports and strengthens the IPCC Third Assessment Report conclusion that 'most of the global warming over the past 50 years is likely due to the increase in greenhouse gases.'&quot;
* Multiple independent reconstructions of the [[temperature record of the past 1000 years]] confirm that the late 20th century is probably the warmest period in that time
* Two papers in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in August 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Et Tu LT? | date = 2007-08-11 | publisher = RealClimate.org | last = Schmidt | first = Gavin A. | authorlink = Gavin Schmidt | url = http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The tropical lapse rate quandary | date = 2007-08-11 | publisher = RealClimate.org | last = Schmidt | first = Gavin A. | authorlink = Gavin Schmidt | url = http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; resolve the problem, evident at the time of the TAR, of [[troposphere|tropospheric]] temperature trends.

The [[IPCC First Assessment Report|IPCC's First Assessment Report]], published in 1990, was unable to distinguish a human influence on the climate. The later [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report]], published in 1996, concluded that human influences had had a &quot;discernable&quot; effect on the climate. More evidence of human-induced climate change was found in the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|third]] and [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|fourth Assessment Reports]], published in 2001 and 2007, respectively.

The IPCC's conclusions are consistent with those of several reports produced by the [[US National Research Council]].&lt;ref name=nrc2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Individual papers===

* An essay in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] surveyed 928 [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]] related to climate change, and concluded that most journal reports accepted the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Oreskes N |title=Beyond the ivory tower.

* A 2002 paper in the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' says &quot;Our analysis suggests that the early twentieth century warming can best be explained by a combination of warming due to increases in greenhouse gases and natural forcing, some cooling due to other anthropogenic forcings, and a substantial, but not implausible, contribution from internal variability. In the second half of the century we find that the warming is largely caused by changes in greenhouse gases, with changes in sulphates and, perhaps, volcanic aerosol offsetting approximately one third of the warming.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Tett SFB |authorlink1=Simon Tett |author2=''et al.'' |title=Estimation of natural and anthropogenic contributions to twentieth century temperature change |journal=J.

* In 1996, in a paper in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] titled &quot;A search for human influences on the thermal structure of the atmosphere&quot;, [[Benjamin D. Santer]] et al. wrote: &quot;The observed spatial patterns of temperature change in the free atmosphere from 1963 to 1987 are similar to those predicted by state-of-the-art climate models incorporating various combinations of changes in carbon dioxide, anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and stratospheric ozone concentrations. The degree of pattern similarity between models and observations increases through this period. It is likely that this trend is partially due to human activities, although many uncertainties remain, particularly relating to estimates of natural variability.&quot;

Some scientists do disagree with the consensus: see [[list of scientists opposing global warming consensus]]. For example [[Willie Soon]] and [[Richard Lindzen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lindzen RS |title=Can increasing carbon dioxide cause climate change? |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=94 |issue=16 |pages=8335–42 |date=August 1997|pmid=11607742 |pmc=33750 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11607742 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8335}}&lt;/ref&gt; say that there is insufficient proof for anthropogenic attribution. Generally this position requires new physical mechanisms to explain the observed warming.&lt;ref&gt;for example: {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s00585-000-0583-z |title=Climate hypersensitivity to solar forcing? |year=2000 |last1=Soon |first1=W. |last2=Posmentier |first2=E. |last3=Baliunas |first3=S. |journal=Annales Geophysicae |volume=18 |page=583| issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors other than increased {{CO2}} concentrations can initiate warming or cooling episodes (see, ''e.g.'', [[orbital forcing]]). The ice core record shows that on some occasions temperature starts rising hundreds of years before {{CO2}} increases.{{Clarify|date=March 2009|give precise time periods, page numbers and quotes from papers that claim this.

One proposed mechanism for this effect is increased release of sequestered {{CO2}} from oceans as circulation patterns shift, perhaps abruptly, in response to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Skinner | first = L.C. | year = 2006 | title = Glacial&amp;nbsp;– interglacial atmospheric {{CO2}} change: a simple &quot;hypsometric effect&quot; on deep-ocean carbon sequestration? | journal = [[Climate of the Past Discussions]] | volume = 2 | url = http://www.clim-past-discuss.net/2/711/2006/cpd-2-711-2006.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2000RG000091 |title=Glacial Cycles: Toward a New Paradigm |year=2001 |last1=Paillard |first1=Didier |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=39 |page=325| issue = 3 |bibcode=2001RvGeo..39..325P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more speculative and polemical inference sometimes drawn is that the causal relationship between temperature rises and global {{CO2}} concentrations is only one-way, so that historical increases in {{CO2}} have been nothing more than the product of independently rising temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a strictly &quot;one-way&quot; view of the relationship between {{CO2}} and temperature contradicts basic results in physics, specifically the fact that the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by {{CO2}} increases as its atmospheric concentration increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

First principles as well as empirical observation suggest that positive feedbacks from {{CO2}} concentrations amplify warming initially caused by other factors:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Close analysis of the relationship between the two curves [i.e., temperature and {{CO2}}] shows that, within the uncertainties of matching their timescales, the temperature led by a few centuries. This is expected, since it was changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters (including the shape of its orbit around the Sun, and the tilt of Earth’s axis) that caused the small initial temperature rise. This then raised atmospheric {{CO2}} levels, in part by outgassing from the oceans, causing the temperature to rise further. By amplifying each other’s response, this &quot;positive feedback&quot; can turn a small initial perturbation into a large climate change. There is therefore no surprise that the temperature and {{CO2}} rose in parallel, with the temperature initially in advance. In the current case, the situation is different, because human actions are raising the {{CO2}} level, and we are starting to observe the temperature response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/news/news_story.php?id=178 |title=News Story&amp;nbsp;— BAS Statement about Channel 4 programme on Global Warming&amp;nbsp;— British Antarctic Survey |publisher=Antarctica.ac.uk |date= | accessdate = 2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Present {{CO2}} levels greatly exceed the range found in the ice core data. [[Suess effect|Isotopic analysis of atmospheric {{CO2}}]] confirms that fossil fuel burning is the source of most of the {{CO2}} increase, unlike during prior interglacial periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Schimel D |chapter={{CO2}} and the carbon cycle |editor=Houghton JT, Meira Filho LG, Callander BA, Harris N, Kattenberg A, Maskell K |title=Climate change 1995: the science of climate change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1996 |pages=76–86 |isbn=0-521-56436-0 |oclc=123378640 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, models that include increased {{CO2}} levels when simulating recent climate match the observed data far better than those that do not.&lt;ref name=&quot;WG1-2007-SPM&quot; /&gt;

'''Achduart''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]: '''''Achadh Dhubhaird'''''&lt;ref name=&quot;Mac an Tàilleir&quot;/&gt;) is a small hamlet in [[Coigach]], in [[Wester Ross]] in northwestern [[Scotland]], now within the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] council area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|title=[[Google Maps]]|publisher=Google|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|title=[[Bing Maps]]|publisher= [[Microsoft]] and [[Harris Corporation]] Earthstar Geographics LLC|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated about 4 km southeast of the village of [[Achiltibuie]], at the end of a minor road. A footpath continues on to the hamlet of Culnacraig, then along the coast past [[Ben More Coigach]] to [[Strathcanaird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culnacraig circular|url=http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/ullapool/culnacraig.shtml|work=Walk Highlands|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Achduart has accommodation facilities for tourists, who come for its proximity to the ocean as well as its seclusion and remoteness. There is a [[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]] hostel in Acheninver, a short distance to the north.

The name of Achduart comes from the Gaelic for &quot;the field at the black headland&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mac an Tàilleir&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Iain Mac an Tàilleir |year=2003 |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |page= |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/gaelic/vl-trans.htm |title=Placenames collected by Iain Mac an Tailleir |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achduart was part of the Estate of Coigach, Lochbroom, belonging to the [[Earl of Cromartie|Countess of Cromartie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ct0MAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Achduart&amp;dq=Achduart&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iqbBTODFGJXn4AbR_PGaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA|title=Papers by command, Volume 15|publisher=Great Britain.

'''Achiltibuie''' ({{lang-gd|'''Achd Ille Bhuidhe'''}}) is a long [[linear village]] in [[Ross and Cromarty]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], on the [[Coigach]] coast of northwestern [[Scotland]], overlooking [[Badentarbet Bay]] to the west. [[Loch Broom]] and the [[Summer Isles]] also lie to the west. Located 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[Ullapool]], Achiltibuie is home to the Hydroponicum, a garden where plants are grown using a [[hydroponic]] system, in water and without soil.  It is the last stop on the road to [[Achduart]].

==History==
The first [[post office]] in the village opened on 28 July 1884.&lt;ref&gt; Mackay, James A. (1989) ''Scottish Post Offices'', p. 28, Dumfries: published by the author, ISBN 0-906440-48-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Eagle Of The Ninth==
The Roman epic [[The_Eagle_(2011_film)|The Eagle]], based on the novel by [[Rosemary Sutcliffe]], was recently filmed in Achiltibuie. Filming started in Achiltibuie on Wednesday the 7th of October 2009 and finished on Thursday the 15th of October 2009. The main location was Fox Point, Old Dornie. The [[Pictish]] village which was constructed at Fox Point was used on most days of the filming. Other sites included Achnahaird beach where a horse chase was filmed and [[Loch Lurgainn]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Economics sidebar}}
In [[economics]], '''adaptive expectations''' means that people form their expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past.  For example, if inflation has been higher than expected in the past, people would revise expectations for the future.

One simple version of adaptive expectations is stated in the following equation, where &lt;math&gt;p^e&lt;/math&gt; is the next year's rate of inflation that is currently expected; &lt;math&gt;p^e_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is this year's actual rate of inflation:

::&lt;math&gt;p^e = p^{e}_{-1} + \lambda (p_{-1} - p^{e}_{-1})&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is between 0 and 1, this says that current expectations of future inflation reflect past expectations and an &quot;error-adjustment&quot; term, in which current expectations are raised (or lowered) according to the gap between actual inflation and previous expectations.  This error-adjustment is also called &quot;''partial adjustment''.&quot;

The theory of adaptive expectations can be applied to all previous periods so that current inflationary expectations equal:

::&lt;math&gt;p^e = (1 - \lambda) \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} (\lambda^j p_j)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; equals actual inflation &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; years in the past. Thus, current expected inflation reflects a weighted average of all past inflation, where the weights get smaller and smaller as we move further in the past.

Once a forecasting error is made by agents, due to a stochastic shock, they will be unable to correctly forecast the price level again even if the price level experiences no further shocks since they only ever incorporate part of their errors. The backward nature of expectation formulation and the resultant systematic errors made by agents (see [[Cobweb model]]) was unsatisfactory to economists such as [[John Muth]], who was pivotal in the development of an alternative model of how expectations are formed, called [[rational expectations]]. This has largely replaced adaptive expectations in macroeconomic theory since its assumption of optimality of expectations is consistent with economic theory.

The '''Mexican tetra''' or '''Blind Cave Fish''' (''Astyanax mexicanus'')  is a [[freshwater]] [[fish]]
of the [[characin]] [[family (biology)|family]] (family [[Characidae]]) of
[[order (biology)|order]] [[Characiformes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase&quot;&gt;{{FishBase_species
|genus=Astyanax
|species=mexicanus
|year=2006
|month=March
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;itis&quot;&gt;{{ITIS
 |id=162850
 |taxon=''Astyanax mexicanus''
 |accessdate=1 July 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[type species]] of its [[genus]], it is native to the [[Nearctic]] [[ecozone]], originating in the lower [[Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River|Neueces]] and [[Pecos River]]s in [[Texas]] as well as the central and eastern parts of Mexico.

Growing to a maximum overall length of 12&amp;nbsp;cm (4.7&amp;nbsp;in), the Mexican tetra is of typical characin shape, with unremarkable, drab coloration.  Its blind cave form, however, is notable for having no eyes and being [[albino]], that is, completely devoid of pigmentation; it has a pinkish-white color to its body.

This fish, especially the blind variant, is reasonably popular among {{wict|aquarists}}.

''A. mexicanus'' is a peaceful species that spends most of its time in the mid-level of the water above the rocky and sandy bottoms of pools and backwaters of creeks and rivers of its native environment.  Coming from a [[subtropical]] climate, it prefers water with 6.0&amp;ndash;7.8 [[pH]], a [[Hard water|hardness]] of up to 30 [[dGH]], and a temperature range of 20 to 25 [[degree Celsius|°C]] (68 to 77 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]). In the winter it migrates to warmer waters.  Its natural diet consists of [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[annelid]]s, although in captivity it is [[omnivorous]].

The Mexican tetra has been treated as a subspecies of ''A. fasciatus,'' the [[banded tetra]], but this is not widely accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase&quot; /&gt;

==Blind cave form==

[[Image:Mexican Tetra as Blind Cave Fish.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Mexican Tetra in Blind Cave Fish form]]
''A. mexicanus'' is famous for its blind cave form, which is known by such names as '''blind cave tetra''', '''blind tetra''', and '''blind cavefish'''.  Some thirty distinct populations of Mexican tetras live in deep [[cave]]s and have lost the power of [[visual perception|sight]] and even their [[eye]]s. These fish can still, however, find their way around by means of their [[lateral line]]s, which are highly sensitive to fluctuating [[water pressure]].

The eyed and eyeless forms of ''A. mexicanus,'' being members of the same species, are closely related and can interbreed.  ''[[Astyanax jordani]],'' however, is another blind cave fish, independently and recently evolved from the sighted surface form, which is sometimes confused with the cave form of ''A. mexicanus.'' However, when born, the cave dwelling form of ''A. mexicanus'' has eyes. As they grow older, skin just grows over them and the eyes degenerate completely, because there is no need for sight in the pitch-black world of a cave.&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase_jordani&quot;&gt;{{FishBase_species
|genus=Astyanax
|species=jordani
|year=2006
|month=March
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the aquarium===

{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
''A. mexicanus'' only grows to a length of 12&amp;nbsp;cm (4.7&amp;nbsp;in) in the recommended minimum of 30 US gallons. The blind cave tetra is a fairly hardy species. They are not picky on food, as they will eat anything from standard flakes to sinking carnivore pellets. Their lack of sight does not hinder their ability to get any and all food before it hits the bottom.
They prefer subdued lighting with a rocky substrate, like gravel. It is recommended that the tank mimic their natural environment, so artificial or natural rock is highly appreciated. They become semi-aggressive as they age, but are by nature schooling fish, and a group of at least three is a good idea. However, it isn't imperative, as they can be kept as a single specimen. As stated earlier, they can get to their food rather swiftly, even more so than fish with the ability to see, so they aren't really good for a community, but one is OK for a semi-aggressive community. They are also incredibly fast, so catching them with the net is a chore in itself while conducting maintenance.

===Evolution research===

The surface and cave forms of the Mexican tetra have proven popular subjects for scientists studying [[evolution]].

A recent study suggests that there are at least two distinct genetic lineages among the blind populations, arguing that these represent a case of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dowling_et_al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Dowling, T.&amp;nbsp;E., D.&amp;nbsp;P. Martasian, and W.&amp;nbsp;R. Jeffrey
|title=Evidence for Multiple Genetic Forms with Similar Eyeless Phenotypes in the Blind Cavefish, ''Astyanax mexicanus''
|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution
|volume=19
|date= April 1, 2002 |pages=446&amp;ndash;55
|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/4/446
|pmid=11919286
|issue=4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory to the cave fish's evolution says that because of its dark habitat, the fish embryo saves energy it would normally use to develop eyes to develop other body parts, and this developmental choice would eventually dominate the population. This is called economical adaptation.
However, studies have shown that blind cave fish embryos begin to grow eyes during development but then something actively stops this process and flesh grows over the partially grown eyes.
Another theory is that some Mexican tetra randomly don't develop eyes (which is represented by broken genes in the fish's genome), and this lack of eyes spreads to the rest of the population despite having no advantage or disadvantage. This is called the neutral theory.

In one experiment studying eye development, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] scientists transplanted [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]es from the eyes of sighted surface-form [[embryo]]s into blind cave-form embryos, and vice versa.  In the cave form, lens development begins within the first 24 hours of embryonic development, but quickly aborts, the lens cells dying; most of the rest of the eye structures never develop.  Researchers found that the lens seemed to control the development of the rest of the eye, as the surface-form tetras which received cave-form lenses failed to develop eyes, while cave-form tetras which received surface-form lenses grew eyes with [[pupil]]s, [[cornea]]s, and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es.  (It is not clear whether they possessed sight, however.)&lt;ref name=&quot;yamamoto_jeffrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Blind cave tetras and creationism===

The blind form of the Mexican tetra is different from the surface-dwelling form in a number of ways, including having unpigmented skin, having a better [[olfaction|olfactory]] sense by having [[taste buds]] all over its head, and by being able to store four times more energy as fat allowing it to deal with irregular food supplies more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Helfman G., Collette B., &amp; Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 315, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is the lack of eyes that has been at the centre of discussion of the Mexican cave tetras among [[Creationism|creationists]].

Darwin said of sightless fish - {{Quote|By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have affected other changes, such as an increase in the length of antennae or palpi, as compensation for blindness.|Charles Darwin|Origin of Species (1859)}}

Modern genetics has made clear that the lack of use does not, in itself, necessitate a feature's disappearance. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_5_114/ai_n13811128] In this context, the positive genetic benefits have to be considered, i.e., what advantages are obtained by cave-dwelling tetras by losing their eyes? Possible explanations include:
*not developing eyes allows the individual more energy for growth and reproduction [http://www.daylightatheism.org/2006/02/evolved-minds.html]
*there remains less chance of accidental damage and infection, since the previously useless and exposed organ is sealed with a flap of protective skin

Another likely explanation for the loss of its eyes is that of ''selective neutrality'' and ''genetic drift'': in the dark environment of the cave, the eyes are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous and thus any genetic factors that might impair the eyes (or their development) can take hold with no consequence on the individual or species. Because there is no selection pressure for sight in this environment, any number of genetic abnormalities that give rise to the damage or loss of eyes could proliferate among the population with no effect on the fitness of the population.

Among some [[creation-evolution controversy|creationists]] the cave tetra is seen as evidence ''against'' evolution. One argument claims that this is an instance of &quot;[[Biological devolution|devolution]]&quot; -- showing an evolutionary trend of ''decreasing'' complexity. But evolution is a non-directional process, and while increased complexity is a common effect, there is no reason why evolution cannot tend towards simplicity if that makes an organism better suited to its environment.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R.: Climbing Mount Improbable, W. W. Norton &amp; Co, 1997, ISBN 0393316823&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''atom probe''' is a microscope used in [[material science]] that was invented in 1967 by [[Erwin Wilhelm Müller]], [[J. A. Panitz]], and [[S. Brooks McLane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=Erwin W.|authorlink1=Erwin Wilhelm Müller|authorlink2=J. A. Panitz|last2=Panitz|first2=John A.|authorlink3=S.

Atom probes are unlike conventional optical or [[electron microscope]]s, in that the magnification effect comes from the magnification provided by a highly curved electric field, rather than by the manipulation of radiation paths. Technically, the method is destructive in nature removing ions from a sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this magnification method with [[time of flight mass spectrometry]], ions evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-charge ratio computed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Müller70&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Müller, E. W. |title=The Atom-Probe Field Ion Microscope |series=Naturwissenschaften|year=1970|volume=5|pages=222–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through successive evaporation of material, layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not only of the surface, but also through the material itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;MillerSmith&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Atom Probe Microanalysis: Principles and Applications to Materials Problems|year=1989|publisher=Materials Research Society|author8=Miller, M and Smith, G.|isbn=0931837995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer methods are utilised to rebuild a three dimensional view of the sample, prior to it being evaporated, providing atomic scale information on the structure of a sample, as well as providing the type atomic species information.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|author=Miller, M.|title=Atom Probe Tomography: Analysis at the Atomic Level |publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|year=2000|isbn=0306464152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to hundreds of millions of [[atom]]s from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes of 10,000-1,000,000&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Overview ==
Atom probe samples are shaped to implicitly provide a highly curved electric potential to induce the resultant magnification, as opposed to direct use of lensing, such as via [[magnetic lens]]es. Furthermore, in normal operation (as opposed to a field ionization modes) the atom probe does not utilize a secondary source to probe the sample. Rather, the sample is evaporated in a controlled manner (field evaporation) and the evaporated ions are impacted onto a detector, which may be up to several meters from the specimen.

The samples used in atom probe are usually  a metallic or semi-conducting material, with the needle geometry produced by [[electropolishing]], or [[focused ion beam]] methods. Preparation is done, often by hand, to manufacture a tip radius sufficient to induce a high electric field, with radii on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]].

To conduct an atom probe experiment, such a needle is placed in an [[ultra high vacuum]] chamber. After introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100&amp;nbsp;K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A pulsed high voltage source (typically 1-2&amp;nbsp;kV) is generated and applied to the specimen, with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range. The application of the pulsed voltage to the sample allows for individual ions at the sample surface to have their electric field, and hence atomic bonding, temporarily disrupted. This results in ejection of an ionised atom from the sample surface at a known time. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion allows for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.

Whilst the uncertainty in the atomic mass computed by time-of-flight methods in atom probe is sufficiently small to allow for detection of individual isotopes within a material this uncertainty may still, in some cases, confound definitive identification of atomic species. Effects such as superposition of differing ions with multiple electrons removed, or through the presence of complex species formation during evaporation may cause two or more species to have sufficiently close time-of-flights to make definitive identification impossible.

== History ==
=== Field Ion Microscopy ===
{{main|Field ion microscopy}}
Field ion microscopy techniques were initially construed as a modification of [[field emission]], a technique which allows for a stream of electrons to be emitted from a sharp needle when subjected to a sufficiently high electric field (~3-6&amp;nbsp;V/nm).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Field emission and field ionization|author=Gomer, R|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1961|isbn=1563961245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The needle is oriented towards a phosphor screen to create a projected image of the tip's [[work function]], near the specimen surface. Whilst providing a projected image, the technique has limited resolution (2-2.5&amp;nbsp;nm), due to both quantum mechanical effects and lateral variation in electron velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsong&quot;/&gt;

In field ion and atom probe methods, the polarity of the electric field is reversed, with a high positive field applied to the sample. For field ion microscopy a gas is introduced, known as the imaging gas, into the chamber at very low pressures. By application of a voltage during the presence of this gas, gas ions in the vicinity of the tip undergo ionisation, with greater numbers of ions generated immediately above atoms occupying edge or planar sites.

==Imaging atom probe (IAP)==
The '''imaging atom probe''' ('''IAP'''), invented in 1974 by [[J. A. Panitz]], decreased the need to move the tip. In the IAP, ions emitted from the surface are recorded and mass analyzed at a detector placed within 12&amp;nbsp;cm of the tip (to provide a reasonably large field of view). By &quot;time-gating&quot; the detector for the arrival of a particular species of interest its crystallographic distribution on the surface, and as a function of depth, can be determined. Without time-gating all of the species reaching the detector are analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Panitz|first=John A.|authorlink=J. A. Panitz|year=1974|title=The Crystallographic Distribution of Field-Desorbed Species|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=207–210|issn=0022-5355|doi=10.1116/1.1318570|bibcode = 1974JVST...11..206P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Panitz|first=John A.|authorlink=J.

===Atom-probe tomography (APT)===
Atom-probe tomography (APT) uses a position-sensitive detector to deduce the lateral location of atoms. This allows 3-D reconstructions to be generated. The idea of the APT, inspired by J. A. Panitz's patent, was developed by Mike Miller starting in 1983 and culminated with the first prototype in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;/&gt; Various refinements were made to the instrument, including the use of a so-called position-sensitive (PoS) detector by Alfred Cerezo, Terence Godfrey, and George D. W. Smith at Oxford University in 1988. The Tomographic Atom Probe (TAP), developed by researchers at the University of Rouen in France in 1993, introduced a multichannel timing system and multianode array. Both instruments (PoSAP and TAP) were commercialized by [[Oxford Instruments|Oxford Nanoscience]] and CAMECA respectively. Since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument.  In 2005, the commercialization of the pulsed laser atom probe (PLAP) expanded the avenues of research from highly conductive materials (metals) to poor conductors (semiconductors like silicon) and even insulating materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunton|first1=J.|last2=Lenz|first2=D|last3=Olson|first3=J|last4=Thompson|first4=K|last5=Ulfig|first5=R|last6=Larson|first6=D|last7=Kelly|first7=T|year=2006|title=Instrumentation Developments in Atom Probe Tomography: Applications in Semiconductor Research|journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis (2006)|volume=12|issue=2|pages=1730–1731|issn=14319276|doi=10.1017/S1431927606065809|bibcode = 2006MiMic..12.1730B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[AMETEK]] acquired Cameca in 2007 and [[Imago Scientific Instruments]] (Madison, WI) in 2010, making the company the sole commercial developer of APTs.

Teeth of the [[radula]] of [[chiton]] ''[[Chaetopleura apiculata]]'' has been studied by atom-probe tomography for the chemical structure and it have been published in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon 2011&quot;&gt;Gordon L. M. &amp; Joester D. (2011). &quot;Nanoscale chemical tomography of buried organic–inorganic interfaces in the chiton tooth&quot;. ''[[Nature (journal)|]]'' '''469''': 194-197. [[doi:10.1038/nature09686]].&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown, that teeth contain fibres with surrounded by [[magnetite]] and some of them also with [[sodium]] or [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon 2011&quot;/&gt; It has been probably for the first time of using atom-probe tomography for the study of radula and in [[biomineral]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This method can be used for example for further study of [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] and [[dentin]] of [[Tooth (human)|human teeth]] and [[bone]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon 2011&quot;/&gt;

== Theory ==
=== Field evaporation ===
Field evaporation is an effect that can occur when an atom bonded at the surface of a material is in the presence of a sufficiently high and appropriately directed electric field, where the electric field is the differential of electric potential (voltage) with respect to distance. Once this condition is met, it is sufficient that local bonding at the specimen surface is capable of being overcome by the field, allowing for evaporation of an atom from the surface to which it is otherwise bonded.

=== Field ionisation ===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

=== Ion flight ===

Whether evaporated from the material itself, or ionised from the gas, the ions that are evaporated are accelerated by electrostatic force, acquiring most of their energy within a few tip-radii of the sample{{cite}}.

Subsequently, the accelerative force on any given ion is controlled by the [[electrostatic equation]], where ''n'' is the ionisation state of the ion, and ''e'' is the fundamental electric charge.

&lt;math&gt;F=ne \nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt;

This can be equated with the mass of the ion, ''m'', via Newton's law (F=ma):

&lt;math&gt; ma = q \nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; a = \frac{q}{m} \nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt;

Relativistic effects in the ion flight are usually ignored, as realisable ion speeds are only a very small fraction of the speed of light.

Assuming that the ion is accelerated during a very short interval, the ion can be assumed to be travelling at constant velocity. As the ion will travel from the tip at voltage V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to some nominal ground potential, the speed at which the ion is travelling can be estimated by the energy transferred into the ion during (or near) ionisation. Therefore the ion speed can be computed with the following equation, which relates kinetic energy to energy gain due to the electric field{{cite}}.

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}mU_{\mathrm{ion}}^2 = neV_1&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''U'' is the ion velocity. Solving for ''U'', the following relation is found:

:&lt;math&gt; U =\sqrt{ \frac{ 2neV_1}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

For a singly charged [[hydrogen]] ion, ionised at 8&amp;nbsp;kV, the resulting velocity would be X&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. For a singly charged [[deuterium]] ion, the velocity would be Y&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. If a detector was placed at a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;m, the ion flight times would be X and Y&amp;nbsp;ns. Thus, the time of the ion arrival can be used to infer the ion type itself, if the evaporation time is known.

From the above equation, it can be re-arranged to show that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{m}{n} = \frac{2eV_1}{U^2} &lt;/math&gt;

given a known flight distance. F, for the ion, and a known flight time, t,

:&lt;math&gt; U = \frac{f}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

and thus one can substitute these values to obtain the mass-to-charge for the ion.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{m}{n} = 2eV_1 \left(\frac{t}{f}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus for an ion which traverses a 1&amp;nbsp;m flight path, across a time of 2000&amp;nbsp;ns, given an initial accelerating voltage of 5000&amp;nbsp;V and noting that one amu is 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, the mass-to-charge ratio (more correctly the mass-to-ionisation value ratio) becomes Z amu/charge.

=== Magnification ===
The magnification in an atom is due to the projection of ions radially away from the small, sharp tip. Subsequently, in the far field, the ions will be greatly magnified. This magnification is sufficient to observe field variations due to individual atoms, thus allowing in field ion and field evaporation modes for the imaging of single atoms.

The standard projection model for the atom probe is an emitter geometry that is based upon a revolution of a [[conic section]], such as a sphere, [[hyperboloid]] or [[paraboloid]]. For these tip models, solutions to the field may be approximated or obtained analytically. The magnification for a spherical emitter is inversely proportional to the radius of the tip, given a projection directly onto a spherical screen, the following equation can be obtained geometrically.

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{r_{screen}}{r_{tip}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Where r&lt;sub&gt;screen&lt;/sub&gt; is the radius of the detection screen from the tip centre, and r&lt;sub&gt;tip&lt;/sub&gt; the tip radius. Practical tip to screen distances may range from several centimeters to several meters, with increased detector area required at larger to subtend the same [[field of view]].

Practically speaking, the usable magnification will be limited by several effects, such as lateral vibration of the atoms prior to evaporation.

Whilst the magnification of both the field ion and atom probe microscopes is extremely high, the exact magnification is dependant upon conditions specific to the examined specimen, so unlike for conventional [[electron microscope]]s, there is often little direct control on magnification, and furthermore, obtained images may have strongly variable magnifications due to fluctuations in the shape of the electric field at the surface.

=== Reconstruction ===
The computational conversion of the ion sequence data, as obtained from a  position sensitive detector, to a three dimensional visualisation of atomic types, is termed &quot;reconstruction&quot;. Reconstruction algorithms are typically geometrically based, and have several literature formulations. Most models for reconstruction assume that the tip is a spherical object, and utilise empirical corrections to [[stereographic projection]] to convert detector positions back to a 2D surface embedded in R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. By sweeping this surface through R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as a function of the ion sequence input data, such as via ion-ordering, a volume is generated onto which positions the 2D detector positions can be computed and placed three-dimensional space.

Typically the sweep takes the simple form of an advancement of the surface, such that the surface is expanded in a symmetric manner about its advancement axis, with the advancement rate set by some nominal volume attributed to each event, representative of the atomic volume of the atom prior to evaporation. This causes the final reconstructed volume to assume a rounded-conical shape, similar to a badminton [[shuttlecock]] for . The detected events thus become a [[point cloud]] data with attributed experimentally measured values, such as ion time of flight or experimentally derived quantities, e.g. time of flight or detector data.

This form of data manipulation allows for rapid computer visualisation and analysis, with data presented as point cloud data with additional information, such as each ion's mass to charge (as computed from the velocity equation above), voltage or other auxiliary measured quantity or computation therefrom.

=== Data features ===

The canonical feature of atom probe data its high spatial resolution in the direction through the material, which has been attributed to an ordered evaporation sequence. This data can therefore image near atomically sharp interfaces with the associated chemical information.

The data obtained from the evaporative process is however not without artefacts that form the physical evaporation or ionisation process. A key feature of the evaporation or field ion images is that the data density is highly inhomogeneous, due to the corrugation of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. This corrugation gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.

The resultant deflection means that in these regions of high curvature, atomic terraces are belied by an strong anisotropy in the detection density. Where this occurs due to a few atoms on a surface is usually referred to as a &quot;pole&quot;, as these are coincident with the crystallographic axes of the specimen ([[Cubic crystal system|FCC]], [[Cubic crystal system|BCC]], [[Close-packing of spheres|HCP]]) etc.  Where the edges of an atomic terrace causes deflection, a low density line is formed and is termed a &quot;zone line&quot;.

These poles and zone-lines, whilst inducing fluctuations in data density in the reconstructed datasets, which can prove problematic during post-analysis, are critical for determining information such as angular magnification, as the crystallographic relationships between features are typically well known.

When reconstructing the data, owing to the evaporation of successive layers of material from the sample, the lateral and in-depth reconstruction values are highly anisotropic. Determination of the exact resolution of the instrument is of limited use, as the resolution of the device is set by the physical properties of the material under analysis.

== Systems ==
Atom probe devices have only relatively recently been produced commercially, and many designs have been constructed since the method's inception. Initial field ion microscopes, precursors to modern atom probes, were usually glass blown devices developed by individual research laboratories.

=== System layout ===
At a minimum, an atom probe will consist of several key pieces of equipment.

* A vacuum system for maintaining the low pressures (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa) required.
* A system for manipulation of samples inside the vacuum, including sample viewing systems. Samples may be required to be cooled anywhere between room temperature to as low as 15&amp;nbsp;K.
* A cooling system to reduce atomic motion, such as a helium refrigeration circuit.
* A high voltage system to raise the sample voltage.
* A detection system for single ions for field evaporation.

Optionally, an atom probe may also include laser-optical systems for laser beam preparation, targeting and pulsing, if using laser-evaporation methods. Staged vacuum systems are regularly employed  to ensure that the system vacuum conditions remain stable. In-situ reaction systems may also be employed for some studies.

=== Performance ===

Collectable ion volumes were previously limited to several thousand, or tens of thousands of ionic events. Subsequent electronics and instrumentation devleopment has increased the rate of data accumulation, with datasets of several tens of miillion atoms (dataset volumes of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

== Applications ==
=== Metallurgy ===
Atom probe has typically been employed in the chemical analysis of alloy systems at the atomic level. This has arisen as a result of voltage pulsed atom probes providing good chemical and sufficient spatial information in these materials. Metal samples from large grained alloys may be simple to fabricate, particularly from wire samples, with hand-electropolishing techniques giving good results.

Subsequently, atom probe has been used in the analysis of the chemical composition of a wide range of alloys.

Such data is critical in determining the effeto of alloy constituents in a bulk material, identification of solid-state reaction features, such as solid phase precipitates. Such information may not be amenable to analysis by other means (e.g. [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) owing to the difficulty in generating a three dimensional dataset with composition.

=== Semiconductors ===
Semi-conductor materials are often analysable in atom probe, however sample preparation may be more difficult, and interpretation of results may be more complex, particularly if the semi-conductor contains phases which evaporate at differing electric field strengths.

Applications such as ion implantation may be used to identify the distribution of dopants inside a semi-conducting material, which is increasingly critical in the correct design of modern nanometre scale electronics.

== Limitations ==

* Materials implicitly control achievable, spatial resolution
* Specimen geometry is uncontrolled, yet controls projection behaviour, hence little control over the magnification. This may induce strong distortions into the computer generated 3D model dataset.
* Limited volume selectability, unlike EM methods. Site specific preparation methods, e.g. using [[Focussed ion beam]] preparation, although more time consuming, may be used to bypass such limitations.
* Features of interest may evaporate in a physically different manner to the bulk sample, altering projection geometry and the magnification of the reconstructed volume.
* Ion overlap in some samples (e.g. between oxygen and ) may result in ambiguous analysed species. This may be mitigated by selection of experiment temperature or laser input energy to influence the ionisation number (+, ++, 3+ etc.) of the ionised groups.
* Low molecular weight gases (Hydrogen &amp; helium) may be difficult to remove from the analysis chamber, and may be adsorbed and emitted from the specimen, even though not present in the original specimen. This may also limit identification of Hydrogen in some samples. However [[deuterated]] samples have been used to overcome this limitation.
* Results may be contingent on the parameters used to convert the 2D detected data into  3D. Subsequently spatial measurements can be greatly affected, and careful analysis of the reconstructed volume is needd to ensure the correct results. In more problematic materials, correct reconstruction may be impossible due to limited knowledge of the true magnification; particularly if zone or pole regions cannot be observed.

'''Alphonse Gabriel &quot;Al&quot; Capone''' (January 17, 1899 – January 25, 1947) was an [[United States|American]] [[gangster]] who led a [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition-era]] [[crime syndicate]]. Known as the &quot;Capones&quot;, the group was dedicated to [[smuggling]] and [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] [[alcoholic beverage|liquor]], and other illegal activities such as [[prostitution]], in [[Chicago]] from the early 1920s to 1931.

Born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants, Capone became involved with gang activity at a young age after being expelled from school at age 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Channel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?catId=259452&amp;action=view&amp;profileId=262834|title= Notorious Crime Files: Al Capone|accessdate=2010-11-12 |publisher= Biography.com|work= [[The Biography Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his early twenties, he moved to [[Chicago]] to take advantage of a new opportunity to make money smuggling illegal alcoholic beverages into the city during Prohibition.  He also engaged in various other criminal activities, including [[bribery]] of government figures and [[prostitution]]. Despite his illegitimate occupation, Capone became a highly visible public figure. He made various charitable endeavors using the money he made from his activities, and was viewed by many to be a &quot;modern-day [[Robin Hood]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcatrazhistory.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/cap1.htm|last= |first= |title= Al Capone at Alcatraz |publisher=Ocean View Publishing |year= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Capone gained infamy when the public discovered his involvement in the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]], which resulted in the death of seven of Capone's rival gang members.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt;  Capone's reign ended when he was found guilty of [[tax evasion]], and sent to [[federal prison]].  His incarceration included a stay at [[Alcatraz]] federal prison.  In the final years of Capone's life, his mental and physical health deteriorated  due to [[neurosyphilis]], a disease which he had contracted earlier.  On January 25, 1947, he died from [[cardiac arrest]] after suffering a [[stroke]].

==Early life==
[[File:Al Capone mother.jpg|thumb|upright|Capone as a child and his mother Teresina]]

Alphonse Gabriel Capone was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] on January 17, 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAPONE&quot;/&gt; His parents Gabriele (December 12, 1864 – November 14, 1920) and Teresina Capone (December 28, 1867 – November 29, 1952) were originally from Italy. His father Gabriele was a [[barber]] from [[Castellammare di Stabia]], a town about {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Naples]], Italy, and his mother Teresina was a [[sewing|seamstress]] and the daughter of Angelo Raiola from [[Angri]], a town in the province of [[Salerno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Capone|last=Kobler|first=John|year=1971|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn= 0-306-80499-9|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriele and Teresina had nine children: Alphonse &quot;Scarface Al&quot; Capone, [[James Capone]] (also known as Richard Two-Gun Hart), [[Ralph Capone|Raffaele Capone]] (also known as Ralph &quot;Bottles&quot; Capone and was later placed in charge of Al Capone's beverage industry), [[Frank Capone|Salvatore &quot;Frank&quot; Capone]], John Capone, Albert Capone, Matthew Capone, Rose Capone, and Mafalda Capone (later Mrs. John J. Maritote).

Capone showed promise as a student, but was reluctant to follow rules at the strict [[Catholic school|Catholic institution]] he attended. He permanently dropped out of school at the age of 14, after being expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Channel&quot;/&gt; He then worked at odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a candy store and a [[bowling alley]].&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Capone was influenced by gangster [[Johnny Torrio]], whom he came to regard as a mentor.&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After his initial stint with small-time gangs that included The Junior Forty Thieves and the [[Bowery Boys]], Capone joined the Brooklyn Rippers and then the notorious [[Five Points Gang]]. During this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer [[Frankie Yale]], a [[bartender]] in a [[Coney Island]] dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. It was in this field that Capone received the scars that gave him the nickname &quot;Scarface&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Married life and increase in gang activity===
On December 30, 1918, Capone wanted to get married. He was under the age of 21 and his parents were required to sign a consent form agreeing to allow their son to marry. The consent was executed and Capone married [[Mae Capone|Mae Josephine Coughlin]]. Earlier that month she had given birth to their son, [[Albert Francis Capone|Albert Francis (&quot;Sonny&quot;) Capone]].

Capone departed New York for [[Chicago]], without his new wife and son, who would join him later. Capone purchased a modest house at 7244 South Prairie Avenue in the Park Manor neighborhood on the city's south side in 1923 for [[United States dollar|USD]] $5,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hood |first=Joel |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-talk-caponeapr02,0,5381253.story |title=Capone home on the market - Chicago Tribune Archives |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capone came at the invitation of [[Johnny Torrio]], his Five Points Gang mentor who had gone to Chicago to resolve some family problems his cousin's husband was having with the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]]. He quickly resolved the issue by killing members of the Black Hand who had given his cousin's husband problems. He saw many business opportunities in Chicago, [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] following the onset of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Torrio had acquired the crime empire of [[Jim Colosimo|James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Colosimo]] after the latter refused to enter this new area of business and was subsequently murdered. Frankie Yale was a suspect but legal proceedings against him had to be dropped due to a lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Marilyn |last= Bardsley|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/chicago_5.html|title=Chicago|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= Crime Library|work= Al Capone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colosimo's secretary Frank Camilla described the fleeing assailant as a heavyset man with scars on the left side of his face. This was an accurate description of Al Capone, although he was never arrested. Capone was also a suspect for two murders at the time, and was seeking a safe haven and a better job to provide for his new family.&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1924 town council elections in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] became known as one of the most crooked elections in the Chicago area's long history, with voters threatened at polling stations by thugs. Capone's mayoral candidate won by a huge margin but only weeks later announced that he would run Capone out of town. Capone met with his puppet-mayor and personally knocked him down the town hall steps, a powerful assertion of gangster power and a major victory for the Torrio-Capone alliance.

For Capone, this event was marred by the death of his brother Frank at the hands of the police. Capone cried openly at his brother's funeral and ordered the closure of all the [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] in Cicero for a day as a mark of respect.

Much of Capone's family put down roots in Cicero as well. In 1930, Capone's sister Mafalda's marriage to John J. Maritote took place at [[St. Mary of Czestochowa in Cicero|St. Mary of Czestochowa]], a massive [[Neogothic]] edifice towering over Cicero Avenue in the so-called [[Polish Cathedral style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Added by bob armour |url=http://timelines.com/1923/al-capone-moves-his-gangs-headquarters-to-cicero-illinois |title=Al Capone moves his gang's headquarters to Cicero, Illinois |publisher=Timelines.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capone's wealth and power grows in Cicero===
The Torrio-Capone organization, as well as the Sicilian-American [[Genna crime family]], fell into a rivalry with the [[North Side Gang]] of [[Dean O'Banion]]. Events came to a head in May 1924 when O'Banion, having discovered that their Sieben Brewery was going to be subject to a Federal raid, sold his share of the brewery to Torrio. The raid took place on the 19th, and both O'Banion and Torrio were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Capone: The Man and the Era|last= Bergreen|first= Laurence|year= 1994|publisher= Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-684-82447-5|pages= 131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Banion was murdered in revenge on October 10, 1924, provoking a gang war.&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, pp 134-135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, p 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Severely injured in a 1925 assassination attempt by the North Side Gang, the shaken Torrio turned over his business to Capone and returned to Italy. Capone was notorious during the Prohibition Era for his control of large portions of the Chicago underworld, which provided [[Chicago Outfit|The Outfit]] with an estimated US $100 million per year&lt;ref&gt;Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to 2008.&quot; Online calculator appears on the right side of website. http://www.measuringworth.com/ppowerus/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; in revenue. This wealth was generated through all manner of illegal enterprises, such as [[gambling]] and [[prostitution]],&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; although the largest moneymaker was the sale of liquor. In those days Capone had the habit of &quot;interviewing&quot; new prostitutes for his club himself.

Demand was met by a transportation network that moved smuggled liquor from the rum-runners of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[The Purple Gang]] in [[Detroit]] and local production in the form of [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[moonshine]] operations and illegal breweries. With the funds generated by his bootlegging operation, Capone's grip on the political and law-enforcement establishments in Chicago grew stronger. He soon established a headquarters at Chicago's [[Lexington Hotel]]. This was soon nicknamed &quot;Capone's Castle&quot; after the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]].

Through this organized corruption, which included the bribing of Chicago Mayor [[William Hale Thompson|William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Hale Thompson]], Capone's gang operated largely free from legal intrusion, operating [[casino]]s and speakeasies throughout Chicago. Wealth also permitted Capone to indulge in a luxurious lifestyle of custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink (his preferred liquor was [[Templeton Rye]] from [[Iowa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/|title=Templeton Rye of Templeton, Iowa|last=Walker|first=Jason|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-12-04|publisher=Heavy Table}}&lt;/ref&gt;), jewelry, and female companionship. He garnered media attention, to which his favorite responses were &quot;I am just a businessman, giving the people what they want&quot; and &quot;All I do is satisfy a public demand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; Capone had become a celebrity.

The violence that led to Capone's unprecedented level of criminal success drew the ire of Capone's rivals, and spurred their retaliation, particularly by bitter rivals, North Side gangsters [[Hymie Weiss]] and [[Bugs Moran]]. More than once, Capone's car was riddled with bullets.

In a particularly unnerving incident on September 20, 1926, the North Side gang shot into Capone's entourage as he was eating lunch in the restaurant of the Hawthorne Hotel. A motorcade of ten vehicles, using [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and shotguns riddled the outside of the Hotel and the restaurant on the first floor of the building. Capone's bodyguard (Frankie Rio) threw him to the ground at the first sound of gunfire and lay on top of &quot;The Big Fellow&quot;, as the headquarters was riddled with bullet holes. Several bystanders were hurt from flying glass and bullet fragmentation in the raid, including a young boy and his mother who would have lost her eyesight had not Capone paid for top-dollar medical care. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This event prompted Capone to call for a truce. Negotiations fell through. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

These attacks prompted Capone to fit his [[Cadillac]] with [[Bulletproof glass|bullet-proof glass]], [[run-flat tire]]s, and a police siren. Every attempt on his life (by Moran, who was almost certainly involved in most of the attacks) left him increasingly shaken. This car was seized by the Treasury Department in 1932 and was later used as President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] limousine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By  Mike M. Ahlers and Eric Marrapodi CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/06/driving.obama/index.html#cnnSTCOther1 |title=Obama's wheels: Secret Service to unveil new presidential limo - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capone placed armed bodyguards around the clock at his headquarters at the [[Lexington Hotel]], at 22nd Street (later renamed Cermak Road) and Michigan Avenue. For his trips away from Chicago, Capone was reputed to have had several other retreats and hideouts located in [[Brookfield, Wisconsin|Brookfield]], [[Wisconsin]]; [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], [[Tennessee]]; [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]]; [[Olean, New York|Olean]], New York; [[French Lick, Indiana|French Lick]], as well as [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], Indiana; [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], [[Iowa]]; [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]; Grand Haven, Michigan and [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[Michigan]]; and [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], [[Arkansas]],  where former New York Goffer Gang member Owney &quot;The Killer&quot; Madden retired and married the postmaster's daughter. Owney and the old gang never lost contact and were always welcome to visit for a safe peaceful vacation. [[Lucky Luciano]]'s first arrest was in Hot Springs.  As a further precaution, Capone and his entourage would often suddenly show up at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire Pullman sleeper car on night trains to places like Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City and Little Rock/Hot Springs in Arkansas, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names with the apparent knowledge and connivance of local authorities. In 1928, Capone bought a 14-room retreat&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; on [[Palm Island (Florida)|Palm Island]], [[Florida]] close to [[Miami Beach]].

===Saint Valentine's Day Massacre===
{{Main|Saint Valentine's Day massacre}}
[[File:Valentine Day massacre.jpg|thumb|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre eliminated some of Capone's enemies, but outraged the general public]]

The bloody events of February 14, 1929, began nearly five years before with the murder of Dion O’Banion, the leader of Chicago’s North Side Irish mob. At that time, control of bootleg liquor in the city raged back and forth between the Irish North Siders, run by O’Banion, and the Italian South Side Outfit, which was controlled by Johnny Torrio and his henchman, Al Capone. In November 1924, Torrio ordered the assassination of O’Banion and started an all-out Irish vs Italian war in the city. The North Side Irishmen retaliated soon afterward and nearly killed Torrio outside of his home. This brush with death led to him leaving the city and turning over operations to Capone, who almost was killed himself in September 1926. It is believed Capone ordered the most notorious gangland killing of the century, the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in the [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood on Chicago's [[Neighborhoods of Chicago#North Side|North Side]], although details of the killing of the seven victims&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; in a garage at 2122 North Clark Street (then the SMC Cartage Co.) and the extent of Capone's involvement are widely disputed. No one was ever brought to trial for the crime.

The massacre was thought to be The Outfit's effort to strike back at [[Bugs Moran]]'s North Side gang, which had become increasingly bold in hijacking the Outfit's booze trucks, assassinating two presidents of the Outfit-controlled [[Unione Siciliane]], and three assassination attempts on one of Capone's top enforcers, [[Jack McGurn]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

To monitor their targets' habits and movements, Capone’s men rented an apartment across from the trucking warehouse that served as a Moran headquarters. On the morning of Thursday February 14, 1929, Capone’s lookouts signaled gunmen disguised as police to start a 'raid'. The faux police lined the seven victims along a wall without a struggle then signaled for accomplices with machine guns. The seven victims were machine-gunned and shot-gunned, each with 15 to 20 or more bullets. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Photos of the massacre shocked the public and greatly harmed Capone in the public opinion, prompting federal law enforcement to focus more closely on investigating his activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt;

===Conviction and imprisonment===
{{Wikisource|Portal:IRS investigation of Al Capone|IRS investigation of Al Capone}}
[[Image:Al-capone-cell.jpg|thumb|left|Al Capone's cell at the [[Eastern State Penitentiary]]]]

In 1929, [[Bureau of Prohibition]] agent [[Eliot Ness]] began an investigation of Capone and his business, attempting to get a conviction for Prohibition violations. However, it was [[Frank J. Wilson]] who conducted the investigation into Capone's income tax violations that the government decided was more likely to end in a conviction.

In 1931 Capone was indicted for [[income tax evasion]] and various violations of the [[Volstead Act]]. Facing overwhelming evidence, his attorneys made a plea deal, but the presiding judge warned he might not follow the sentencing recommendation from the prosecution, so Capone withdrew his plea of guilty. Attempting to bribe and intimidate the potential jurors, his plan was discovered by Ness's men. The [[venire]] (jury pool) was then switched with one from another case, and Capone was stymied. Following a long trial, he was found guilty on some income tax evasion counts (the Volstead Act violations were dropped). The judge gave him an 11-year sentence along with heavy fines, and liens were filed against his various properties. His appeal was denied. In May 1932, Capone was sent to [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary]], a tough federal prison, but he was able to obtain special privileges. Later, for a short period of time, he was transferred to the [[Lincoln Heights Jail]]. He was then transferred to [[Alcatraz Island#Federal prison|Alcatraz]] on August 11, 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timelines.com/1934/8/11/first-prisoners-arrive-at-alcatraz-prison-likely-including-al-capone |title=First Prisoners Arrive at Alcatraz Prison (Likely Including Al Capone) |publisher=Timelines.com |date=1934-08-11 |accessdate=2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; where tight security and an uncompromising warden ensured that Capone had no contact with the outside world. His isolation from his associates and the repeal of Prohibition in December, 1933, precipitously diminished his power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
[[Image:Acaponeh.jpg‎|thumb|Al Capone at Alcatraz]]
Though he adjusted relatively well to his new environment, he did encounter problems at Alcatraz.  While working in the prison basement, Capone got into an argument with an inmate who was standing in line waiting for a haircut, who stabbed Capone with a pair of shears. Capone was admitted into the prison hospital and released a few days later with a minor wound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcatrazhistory.com&quot;/&gt; In addition, his health declined as the [[syphilis]] he caught as a youth progressed. He spent the last year of his sentence in the prison hospital, confused and disoriented.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch11&quot;&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/chapter_11.html Al Capone: Chicago's Most Infamous Mob Boss - The Crime library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Capone completed his term in Alcatraz on January 6, 1939, and was transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution at [[Terminal Island]] in California, to serve his one-year [[misdemeanor]] sentence. He was paroled on November 16, 1939, spent a short time in a hospital, then returned to his home in Palm Island, Florida.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Physical decline and death===
Capone's control and interests within [[organized crime]] diminished rapidly after his imprisonment, and he was no longer able to run the Outfit after his release. He had lost weight, and his physical and mental health had deteriorated under the effects of [[Neurosyphilis#Tertiary|neurosyphilis]]. He had become mentally incapable of resuming his gang activity. In 1946, his physician and a Baltimore psychiatrist performed examinations and concluded that Capone then had the mental capability of a 12-year-old child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Bureau of Investigation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/al-capone|title=Famous Cases and Criminals - Al Capone|last=Federal Bureau of Investigation|first=|work= |publisher=www.fbi.gov|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often raved about Communists, foreigners, and [[George Moran]], who he was convinced was still plotting to kill him from his Ohio prison cell.

On January 21, 1947, Capone had a [[stroke]]. He regained consciousness and started to improve but contracted pneumonia on January 24. He suffered a fatal [[cardiac arrest]] the next day. He died in his home in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], surrounded by his family, including his wife, who collapsed at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0117.html |title=Capone Dead At 48; Dry Era Gang Chief|agency=Associated Press |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
One of the most notorious American gangsters of the 20th century, Capone has been the subject of numerous articles, books, and films. Capone's personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal [[Mastermind (Role Variant)|masterminds]] ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a blue pinstriped suit and tilted [[fedora]] is based on photos of Capone. His accent, mannerisms, facial construction, sometimes his physical stature, and  [[parody|parodies]] of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.

Generally, an '''amplifier''' or simply '''amp''', is a device for increasing the [[Power (physics)|power]] of a [[Signal (information theory)|signal]].

In popular use, the term usually describes an [[electronic amplifier]], in which the input &quot;signal&quot; is usually a voltage or a current. In [[sound recording and reproduction|audio]] applications, amplifiers drive the  [[loudspeaker]]s used in [[PA system]]s to make the human voice louder or play recorded music. Amplifiers may be classified according to the input (source) they are designed to amplify (such as a [[guitar amplifier]], to perform with an [[electric guitar]]), the device they are intended to drive (such as a [[headphone amplifier]]), the frequency range of the signals ([[Sound recording and reproduction|Audio]], [[Intermediate frequency|IF]], [[Radio frequency|RF]], and [[VHF]] amplifiers, for example), whether they invert the signal ([[inverting amplifier]]s and [[Operational amplifier applications|non-inverting amplifiers]]), or the type of device used in the amplification ([[valve amplifier|valve or tube amplifiers]], [[FET]] amplifiers, etc.).

A related device that emphasizes conversion of signals of one type to another (for example, a [[light]] signal in [[photon]]s to a [[Direct current|DC]] signal in [[ampere]]s) is a [[transducer]], a [[transformer]], or a [[sensor]]. However, none of these amplify [[Power (physics)|power]].

== Figures of merit ==
The quality of an amplifier can be characterized by a number of specifications, listed below.

=== Gain ===
The [[gain]] of an amplifier is the [[ratio]] of output to input power or amplitude, and is usually measured in [[decibel]]s.
(When measured in decibels it is [[logarithm]]ically related to the power ratio: ''G''(dB)=10 log(''P&lt;sub&gt;out''&lt;/sub&gt; /(''P&lt;sub&gt;in''&lt;/sub&gt;)). [[Radio Frequency|RF]] amplifiers are often specified in terms of the maximum '''power gain''' obtainable, while the [[voltage]] gain of audio amplifiers and [[instrumentation amplifier]]s will be more often specified (since the amplifier's [[input impedance]] will often be much higher than the source impedance, and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance).
* Example: an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20&amp;nbsp;dB will have a ''voltage gain'' of ten (but a power gain of 100 would only occur in the unlikely event the input and output impedances were identical).
If two equivalent amplifiers are being compared, the amplifier with higher gain settings would be more sensitive as it would take less input signal to produce a given amount of power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcae1.com/gaincon2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bandwidth===
The [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of an amplifier is the range of frequencies for which the amplifier gives &quot;satisfactory performance&quot;. The definition of &quot;satisfactory performance&quot; may be different for different applications. However, a common and well-accepted metric is the [[half power point]]s (i.e. frequency where the power goes down by half its peak value) on the output vs. frequency curve. Therefore bandwidth can be defined as the difference between the lower and upper half power points. This is therefore also known as the {{nowrap|−3 dB}} bandwidth. Bandwidths (otherwise called &quot;frequency responses&quot;) for other response tolerances are sometimes quoted ({{nowrap|−1 dB}}, {{nowrap|−6 dB}} etc.) or &quot;plus or minus 1dB&quot; (roughly the sound level difference people usually can detect).

The gain of a good quality full-range audio amplifier will be essentially flat between 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to about 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (the range of normal human hearing). In ultra high fidelity amplifier design, the amp's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more octaves either side) and might have {{nowrap|−3 dB}} points &lt; 10 and &gt; {{nowrap|65&amp;nbsp;kHz}}. Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond {{nowrap|20&amp;nbsp;Hz-20&amp;nbsp;kHz}}; too much of the amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on [[infrasonic]] and [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies, and the danger of AM [[radio interference]] would increase. Modern [[switching amplifier]]s need steep low pass filtering at the output to get rid of high frequency switching noise and harmonics.

=== Efficiency ===
Efficiency is a measure of how much of the power source is usefully applied to the amplifier's output. [[Electronic amplifier#Power amplifier classes|Class A]] amplifiers are very inefficient, in the range of 10–20% with a max efficiency of 25% for [[direct coupling]] of the output. [[Inductive coupling]] of the output can raise their efficiency to a maximum of 50%.

Drain efficiency is the ratio of output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of an FET. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding.  In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both above and below the rail during operation.  While the voltage level is above the DC rail current is supplied by the inductor.

Class B amplifiers have a very high efficiency but are impractical for audio work because of high levels of distortion (See: [[Crossover distortion]]). In practical design, the result of a tradeoff is the class AB design. Modern Class AB amplifiers commonly have peak efficienies between 30–55% in audio systems and 50-70% in radio frequency systems with a theoretical maximum of 78.5%.

Commercially available Class D [[switching amplifier]]s have reported efficiencies as high as 90%. Amplifiers of Class C-F are usually known to be very high efficiency amplifiers. RCA manufactured an AM broadcast transmitter employing a single class-C low mu triode with an RF efficiency in the 90% range.

More efficient amplifiers run cooler, and often do not need any cooling fans even in multi-kilowatt designs. The reason for this is that the loss of efficiency produces heat as a by-product of the energy lost during the conversion of power. In more efficient amplifiers there is less loss of energy so in turn less heat.

In RF linear Power Amplifiers, such as cellular base stations and broadcast transmitters, special design techniques can be used to improve efficiency.  Doherty designs, which use a second output stage as a &quot;peak&quot; amplifier, can lift efficiency from the typical 15% up to 30-35% in a narrow bandwidth.  Envelope Tracking designs are able to achieve efficiencies of up to 60%, by modulating the supply voltage to the amplifier in line with the envelope of the signal.

=== Linearity ===
An ideal amplifier would be a totally linear device, but real amplifiers are only linear within limits. 

When the signal drive to the amplifier is increased, the output also increases until a point is reached where some part of the amplifier becomes saturated and cannot produce any more output; this is called clipping, and results in [[distortion]].

In most amplifiers a reduction in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; the result is a ''compression'' effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. For these amplifiers, the {{nowrap|1 dB}} compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is {{nowrap|1 dB}} less than the small signal gain. Sometimes this nonlinearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.

Ill effects of nonlinearity can be reduced with negative feedback.

[[Linearization]] is an emergent field, and there are many techniques, such as [[feedforward]], [[predistortion]], postdistortion, in order to avoid the undesired effects of the non-linearities.

=== Noise ===
This is a measure of how much [[noise]] is introduced in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is [[noise figure]] or noise factor. Noise figure is a comparison between the output signal to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.

=== Output dynamic range ===
Output [[dynamic range]] is the range, usually given in dB, between the smallest and largest useful output levels. The lowest useful level is limited by output [[noise]], while the largest is limited most often by distortion. The ratio of these two is quoted as the amplifier dynamic range. More precisely, if ''S'' = maximal allowed signal power and ''N'' = noise power, the dynamic range ''DR'' is ''DR = (S + N ) /N''.&lt;ref name=Verhoeven&gt;
{{cite book
|author=Verhoeven CJM, van Staveren A, Monna GLE, Kouwenhoven MHL and Yildiz E
|title=Structured electronic design: negative feedback amplifiers

|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/1-4020-7590-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In many switched mode amplifiers, dynamic range is limited by the minimum output step size.

=== Slew rate ===
[[Slew rate]] is the maximum rate of change of the output, usually quoted in volts per second (or microsecond). Many amplifiers are ultimately [[slew rate]] limited (typically by the impedance of a drive current having to overcome capacitive effects at some point in the circuit), which sometimes limits the full [[power bandwidth]] to frequencies well below the amplifier's small-signal frequency response.

===Rise time===
The [[rise time]], t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, of an amplifier is the time taken for the output to change from 10% to 90% of its final level when driven by a [[step response|step input]].
For a [[Gaussian]] response system (or a simple RC [[roll-off|roll off]]), the rise time is approximated by: 


'''t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; * BW = 0.35''', where t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is rise time in [[second]]s and BW is bandwidth in [[hertz|Hz]].

=== Settling time and ringing===
The time taken for the output to settle to within a certain percentage of the final value (for instance 0.1%) is called the [[settling time]], and is usually specified for oscilloscope vertical amplifiers and high accuracy measurement systems. [[Ringing (signal)|Ringing]] refers to an output variation that cycles above and below an amplifier's final value and leads to a delay in reaching a stable output.  Ringing is the result of overshoot caused by an [[Damping#Under-damping (0 ≤ ζ &lt; 1)|underdamped]] circuit.

===Overshoot===
In response to a [[step response|step input]], the [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] is the amount the output exceeds its final, steady-state value.

===Stability===
Stability is an issue in all amplifiers with feedback, whether that feedback is added intentionally or results unintentionally. It is especially an issue when applied over multiple amplifying stages.

[[BIBO stability|Stability]] is a major concern in [[Radio Frequency|RF]] and [[microwave]] amplifiers. The degree of an amplifier's stability can be quantified by a so-called stability factor. There are several different stability factors, such as the Stern stability factor and the Linvil stability factor, which specify a condition that must be met for the absolute stability of an amplifier in terms of its [[two-port parameters]].

== Electronic amplifiers ==
{{Main|Electronic amplifier}}
There are many types of electronic amplifiers, commonly used in [[radio]] and [[television]] [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[high-fidelity]] (&quot;hi-fi&quot;) stereo equipment, microcomputers and other electronic digital equipment, and [[guitar]] and other [[instrument amplifier]]s. Critical components include [[active device]]s, such as [[vacuum tube]]s or [[transistor]]s.

== Other amplifier types ==
=== Carbon microphone ===
One of the first devices used to amplify signals was the [[carbon microphone]] (effectively a sound-controlled [[variable resistor]]). By channeling a large electric current through the compressed [[carbon]] granules in the microphone, a small sound signal could produce a much larger electric signal. The carbon microphone was extremely important in early telecommunications; [[Plain old telephone service|analog telephones]] in fact work without the use of any other amplifier. Before the invention of electronic amplifiers, mechanically coupled carbon microphones were also used as amplifiers in [[repeater|telephone repeaters]] for long distance service.

=== Magnetic amplifier ===
{{Main|magnetic amplifier}}
A '''magnetic amplifier''' is a [[transformer]]-like device that makes use of the saturation of magnetic materials to produce amplification. It is a non-electronic electrical amplifier with no moving parts. The bandwidth of magnetic amplifiers extends to the hundreds of kilohertz.

=== Rotating electrical machinery amplifier ===
A [[Ward Leonard control]] is a rotating machine like an [[electrical generator]] that provides amplification of electrical signals by the conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy. Changes in generator field current result in larger changes in the output current of the generator, providing gain. This class of device was used for smooth control of large motors, primarily for elevators and naval guns.

Field modulation of a very high speed AC generator was also used for some early [[AM broadcasting|AM]] radio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquewireless.org/otb/blw535202.htm OTB - Below 535, A Historical Review of Continuous Wave Radio Frequency Power Generators&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Alexanderson alternator]].

=== Johnsen-Rahbek effect amplifier ===
The earliest form of audio power amplifier was [[Thomas Edison|Edison]]'s &quot;electromotograph&quot; loud-speaking telephone, which used a wetted rotating chalk cylinder in contact with a stationary contact. The friction between cylinder and contact varied with the current, providing gain. Edison discovered this effect in 1874, but the theory behind the [[Johnsen-Rahbek effect]] was not understood until the semiconductor era.

=== Mechanical amplifiers ===
Mechanical amplifiers were used in the pre-electronic era in specialized applications.

Early '''[[autopilot]]''' units designed by [[Elmer Ambrose Sperry]] incorporated a mechanical amplifier using belts wrapped around rotating drums; a slight increase in the tension of the belt caused the drum to move the belt. A paired, opposing set of such drives made up a single amplifier.
This amplified small gyro errors into signals large enough to move aircraft control surfaces.
A similar mechanism was used in the [[Vannevar Bush]] [[differential analyzer]].

The '''Electrostatic drum amplifier''' used a band wrapped partway around a rotating drum, and fixed at its anchored end to a spring. The other end connected to a speaker cone. The input signal was transformed up to high voltage, and added to a high voltage dc supply line. This voltage was connected between drum and belt. Thus the input signal varied the electric field between belt and drum, and thus the friction between them, and thus the amount of lateral movement of the belt and thus speaker cone.

Other variations on the theme also existed at one time.

=== Optical amplifiers ===
{{Main|Optical amplifier}}

'''Optical amplifiers''' amplify [[light]] through the process of [[stimulated emission]]. See [[Laser]] and [[Maser]].

=== Miscellaneous types ===
*There are also mechanical amplifiers, such as the automotive [[servomechanism|servo]] used in [[brake|braking]].
*[[Relays]] can be included under the above definition of amplifiers, although their transfer function is not [[linear]] (that is, they are either open or closed).
*Also purely mechanical manifestations of such digital amplifiers can be built (for theoretical, didactical purposes, or for entertainment), see e.g. [[domino computer]].
*Another type of amplifier is the [[Fluidics#Amplifier|fluidic amplifier]], based on the [[fluidic triode]].

'''''Army of Darkness''''' (also known as '''''Evil Dead III''''', '''''Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness''''', '''''Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness''''', or '''''The Medieval Dead''''') is a 1992 [[comedy horror]] [[fantasy film]] and the third installment of the [[The Evil Dead (franchise)|''Evil Dead'']] film trilogy. It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]], written by Raimi and his brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]], produced by [[Robert Tapert]], and starred [[Bruce Campbell]] and [[Embeth Davidtz]]. Continuing where ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' left off, [[Ash Williams]] is trapped in the [[Middle Ages]] and he battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.

''Army of Darkness'' is not as violent or gory as the prior ''Evil Dead'' films, relying more on [[slapstick]]. The film was produced as part of a production deal with [[Universal Studios]] after the financial success of ''[[Darkman]]''. Filming took place in California in 1991. The Director's Cut premiered in October 1992 and the Theatrical Cut was released in the US on February 19, 1993. It was a commercial success, grossing $21.5 Million, though critical response was generally less positive than the first two films. Since its video release it has acquired a [[Cult film|cult following]], along with the other two films in the trilogy.

==Plot==
After a brief flashback to ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', which explains the ''[[Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]'' and how [[Ash Williams|Ash]] got to where he is, Ash lands in Medieval England, where he is almost immediately captured by Lord Arthur's men, who suspect him to be an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he fights off a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free (since Henry stood up for him, and swore he did not know who Ash was), Ash is celebrated as a hero. He also grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.

According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is to retrieve the Necronomicon. After bidding goodbye to Sheila, Ash starts his search for the Necronomicon. Entering a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash through the woods. Fleeing, Ash ducks into a windmill where he crashes into a mirror. The small reflections of Ash climb out from the shattered mirror and torment him. One of the reflections dives down Ash's throat and uses his body to become a life-sized copy of Ash, after which Ash kills him and buries him.

When he arrives at the Necronomicon's location, he finds three books instead of one. Ash eventually finds the real one and attempts to say the magic phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely — &quot;[[Klaatu barada nikto]]&quot;. (The line was taken from the 1951 film ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''). However, forgetting the last word, he tries to trick the book by mumbling the missing word. He then grabs the book from the cradle, and rushes back to the castle, while the dead rise from graves all around. During Ash's panicked ride back, Ash's evil copy rises from his grave and unites the Deadites into the Army of Darkness.

Despite causing the predicament faced by the Medieval soldiers, Ash initially demands to be returned to his own time.  However, Sheila is captured by a Flying Deadite, and then transformed into a Deadite. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the skeletal Deadite army. Reluctantly, the people agree to join Ash. Using scientific knowledge from textbooks in the trunk of his 1973 [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]], and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the Medieval soldiers to defeat his Deadite clone, Evil Ash, and his Deadite Army, and save Sheila.  After this, he is brought back to his own time using a potion made from the ''Necronomicon.''

The final scene (See [[#Different versions|Different versions]]) begins with Ash back at the S-Mart store, telling a male co-worker (Ted Raimi) all about his adventure back in time, and how he could have been king.  After this, a female co-worker becomes possessed by a demon and starts wreaking havoc on the store (it is implied that he again raised the dead by saying the wrong words needed to travel through time), and Ash slays the creature. The film ends with Ash in voice over saying, &quot;Sure, I could have stayed in the past. Could have even been king. But in my own way, I am king.&quot;  He then says, while kissing the attractive female co-worker whose life he has just saved, &quot;Hail to the King, baby!&quot;

==Production==
Plans to make a third ''[[Evil Dead]]'' film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of ''[[Darkman]]''.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Muir | first = John Kenneth | authorlink = John Kenneth Muir | title = The Unseen Force: The Films of Sam Raimi | work = | pages = 152 | language = | publisher = Applause | year = 2004 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' made enough money internationally that [[Dino De Laurentiis]] was willing to finance a sequel.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir&quot;/&gt;  Director and script writer [[Sam Raimi]] drew from a variety of sources, including literature with ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' and [[Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift's]] ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and films like ''[[The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad]]'', ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', and [[The Three Stooges]].  ''Evil Dead II'', according to [[Bruce Campbell]], &quot;was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Warren&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | authorlink = Bill Warren | title = The Evil Dead Companion | work = | pages = 143 | language = | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2000 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Promotional drawings were created and published in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot.  The working title for the project was ''Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren2&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; came from an idea by [[Irvin Shapiro]], during the production of ''Evil Dead II''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Raimi. DVD audio commentary, 3:12.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was used after Sam Raimi was unable to use his original title &quot;The Medieval Dead.&quot; (&quot;The Medieval Dead&quot; would later be used as the films subtitle for its UK release as ''Army of Darkness: The Medieval Dead'').

===Screenplay and pre-production===
Initially, Raimi invited [[Scott Spiegel]] to co-write ''Army of Darkness'' because he had done a good job on ''Evil Dead II'', but he was busy on rewrites for the [[Clint Eastwood]] film, ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren3&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called ''Easy Wheels'', Sam and his brother [[Ivan Raimi]] decided to co-write the film together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren4&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of ''Darkman''.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir&quot;/&gt; After filming ''Darkman'', they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan &quot;has a good sense of character&quot; and that he brought more comedy into the script.&lt;ref name= &quot;Warren4&quot;/&gt;  Campbell remembers, &quot;We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Warren&quot;/&gt; Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren6&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir&quot;/&gt;  ''Darkman'' was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had multi-picture deal with Universal and so ''Army of Darkness'' became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren5&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer [[Rob Tapert]] to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir&quot;/&gt; Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from [[Victor Fleming|Victor Fleming's]] film ''[[Joan of Arc]]'' that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in ''Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir2&quot;/&gt; A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the ''Joan of Arc'' storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir2&quot;/&gt;

===Principal photography===
Principal photography took place between soundstage and on-location work. ''Army of Darkness'' was filmed in [[Bronson Canyon]] and [[Vasquez Rocks|Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park]]. The interior shots were filmed on an [[front projection|Introvision]] stage in [[Hollywood]]. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the [[stop-motion animation]] work of [[Ray Harryhausen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir2&quot;&gt;Muir 2004, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional [[rear projection]] that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir2&quot;/&gt; According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was &quot;the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Robley&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Robley | first = Les Paul | authorlink =  | title = Mobilizing ''Army of Darkness'' via &quot;Go-Animation&quot; | work = American Cinematographer | pages = 74 | language = | publisher = | date = March 1993 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooting for ''Army of Darkness'' began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren9&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near [[Acton, California|Acton]], California on the edge of the [[Mojave Desert]], the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir3&quot;&gt;Muir 2004, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren7&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Money problems forced cinematographer [[Bill Pope]] to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir4&quot;&gt;Muir 2004, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir5&quot;&gt;Muir 2004, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Mesa remembers, &quot;Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir5&quot;/&gt; Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir5&quot;/&gt;

===Soundtrack===
[[Danny Elfman]], who composed the score for ''Darkman'', wrote the &quot;March of the Dead&quot; theme for ''Army of Darkness'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren8&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; but after the re-shoots were completed [[Joseph LoDuca]], who composed the music for ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', returned to score the new film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir7&quot;&gt;Muir 2004, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  LoDuca sat down with Raimi and they went over the entire film, scene by scene. The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he took them in front of an orchestra.&lt;ref name= &quot;Warren8&quot;/&gt;

===Post-production===
While [[Dino De Laurentiis]] gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the movie the way it wanted, Universal Pictures took over during post-production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir6&quot;&gt;Muir 2004, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending of the movie and felt that it was negative.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir6&quot;/&gt; A more upbeat ending was shot a month after ''Army of Darkness'' was made. It was shot in a lumber store in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], California over three or four nights. Then, two months after ''Army of Darkness'' was finished, a round of re-shoots began in [[Santa Monica]] and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with [[Bridget Fonda]] done for very little money.&lt;ref name= &quot;Muir6&quot;/&gt; Raimi recalls, &quot;Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren11&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Raimi needed $3 million to finish his movie, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release because they were upset that De Laurentiis would not give them the rights to the [[Hannibal Lecter]] character so that they could film a sequel to [[Jonathan Demme|Jonathan Demme's]] ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir8&quot;&gt;Muir 2004, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was finally resolved, but ''Army of Darkness''' release date had been pushed back from its original summer of 1992 release to February 1993.

For the movie's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of this [[Frank Frazetta]]-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren12&quot;&gt;Warren 2000, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Raimi ran into further troubles with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] over the film's rating. The MPAA gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film.  Universal, however, wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with the MPAA's R rating.&lt;ref name= &quot;Warren8&quot;/&gt; In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut ''Army of Darkness'' to 81 minutes in length and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, ending up with an R rating as a result.&lt;ref name= &quot;Warren8&quot;/&gt;

==Release==
===Box office performance===
''Army of Darkness'' was released by Universal Pictures on February 19, 1993 in 1,387 theaters in the United States, grossing $4.4 million (38.5% of total gross) on its first weekend.  In total, the film earned $11.5 million in the US&lt;ref name= &quot;boxoffice&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = Box Office Mojo | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=armyofdarkness.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and $21.5 million worldwide.

===Critical reception===
''Army of Darkness'' had received generally mixed to positive response from critics, with a 71% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 38 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/army_of_darkness/ |title= ''Army of Darkness'' Movie Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made its critical reception above average but is lower than ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', which received 100% and 98% critical approval, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil_dead/ |title=''The Evil Dead'' Movie Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn/ |title=''Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn'' Movie Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, &quot;The movie isn't as funny or entertaining as ''Evil Dead II'', however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Ebert&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 19, 1993 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930219/REVIEWS/302190301/1023 | accessdate = 2008-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] praised, &quot;Mr. Campbell's manly, mock-heroic posturing is perfectly in keeping with the director's droll outlook&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Maslin&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | coauthors = | title = An Army of Skeletons In a Dark Ages Battle | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 19, 1993 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DF123EF93AA25751C0A965958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=%22Army+of+Darkness%22&amp;st=nyt | accessdate = 2008-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Desson Howe, in this review for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' praised the film's style: &quot;Bill Pope's cinematography is gymnastic and appropriately frenetic. The visual and make-up effects (from artist-technicians William Mesa, Tony Gardner and others) are incredibly imaginative&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Howe&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Howe | first = Desson | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = [[Washington Post]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 19, 1993 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/armyofdarknessrhowe_a0af6d.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a &quot;C+&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;This spoofy cast of thousands looks a little too much like a crew of bland Hollywood extras. By the time ''Army of Darkness'' turns into a retread of ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Gleiberman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Gleiberman | first = Owen | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = March 5, 1994 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305759,00.html | accessdate = 2008-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===

==Different versions==
{{ref improve section|date=December 2010}}
There are four different versions of ''Army of Darkness'': the 96-minute director's cut, the 81-minute US theatrical version, the 88-minute international edit, and the 88-minute US television version. The director's cut includes numerous new scenes and extensions compared to the US theatrical version.  Among the changes are more violence in the pit, a love scene between Ash and Sheila, an extended windmill scene, different dialogue between Good and Bad Ash, an extended speech on the castle roof and a vastly different ending. The television version (which is not available on DVD) includes two scenes not in any other version of the film (though they do appear in rough cut form in the &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot; section of the DVD.) 

The theatrical release picks up after Ash has returned to the present, in which he stages one final confrontation with the &quot;she-bitch&quot; in the S-Mart Housewares Department. The alternative ending, which was favored by Raimi and Bruce Campbell, depicts Ash as he sits in his Oldsmobile (the same 1973 Oldsmobile featured in many Sam Raimi films), in a cave, the entrance caved in by some of the black powder he made earlier. As he drinks the magic potion (given to him by a person that may or may not be Merlin - the king's name being &quot;Arthur&quot;), he is distracted by a falling rock and takes one drop too many. Ash sleeps well beyond his time, not aging but growing a very large beard, and shouts &quot;I've slept too long!&quot; after awakening in a post-apocalyptic England. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/alternateversions |title= ''Army of Darkness'': Alternate versions |publisher=IMDb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When test audiences did not approve of Raimi's original ending, he cut the film down to the international cut that now exists on DVD. When it was again rejected by Universal, Raimi was forced to edit it again to the US theatrical version. The original cut had an opening that was more in tune with the ''Evil Dead'' series (included as a deleted scene on Anchor Bay's director's cut DVD).

The MGM Hong Kong Region 3 DVD edits together the US altered theatrical, European and director's cuts into a final, 96-minute cut of the film. The film is digitally re-mastered, compiled from original source prints (not from VHS sources as with the Anchor Bay Entertainment releases). A new Blu-ray release of ''Army of Darkness'' from Optimum Releasing in the UK was rumored to be of the director's cut, however it was released on September 19, 2008 and included the director's cut as an extra, in standard definition. The movie was released as ''Bruce Campbell vs Army of Darkness'' for the UK Blu-ray release.

'''ASROC''' (for '''Anti-Submarine ROCket''') is an all-weather, all sea-conditions anti-submarine missile system. Developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s, it was deployed in the 1960s, updated in the 1990s, and eventually installed on over 200 USN surface ships, specifically [[cruiser (warship)|cruisers]], [[destroyer]]s, and [[frigates]]. The ASROC has been deployed on scores of warships of many other navies, including Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of China, Greece, Pakistan and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavInstGuid&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Description==

After a surface ship, patrol plane or anti-submarine helicopter detects an enemy [[submarine]] by using [[sonar]] and/or other sensors, it could relay the sub's position to an ASROC-equipped ship for attack.  The attacking ship would  then fire an ASROC missile carrying an acoustic homing [[torpedo]] or a [[Nuclear Depth Bomb]] (NDB) onto an unguided ballistic trajectory toward the target. At a pre-determined point on the missile's trajectory, the payload separates from the missile and deploys a parachute to permit splashdown and water entry at a low speed and with minimum detectable noise. The water entry activates the torpedo, which is guided by its own sonar system, and homes in on the target using either [[active sonar]] or [[passive sonar]]. 

In cases where the ASROC missile carried an NDB, the unguided bomb would sink quickly to a predetermined depth where it would detonate. The nuclear-armed ASROC was never used beyond one or two tests in 1961-62. Eventually the Limited [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] banning underwater nuclear tests went into effect. The nuclear weapon was never used in combat. An ASROC missile could hypothetically carry a 10 [[kiloton]] [[W44|W44 nuclear warhead]], although the W44-armed nuclear weapons were retired by 1989, and all types of nuclear depth bombs were removed from deployment.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavInstGuid&quot; /&gt;

The first ASROC system using the MK-112 &quot;Matchbox&quot; launcher, was developed in the 1950s and installed in the 1960s.  This system was phased out in the 1990s and replaced with the RUM-139 Vertical Launch ASROC, or &quot;VLA&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavInstGuid&quot; /&gt;

==Specific Installations==

The 31 [[U.S. Navy]] [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class destroyer]]s were all built in the shipyard with the Mark 16 Mod 7 ASROC Launching Group and MK 4 ASROC Weapons Handling System (AWHS) reload system.  These had one standard Mark 112 octuple ASROC launcher, located immediately above a reload system holding an additional 16 assembled rounds (two complete reloads of eight missiles apiece). Thus, each ''Spruance''-class destroyer originally carried a maximum total of 24 ASROC.&lt;ref&gt;US Destroyers - Norman Friedman&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most other U.S. Navy and allied navy destroyers, destroyer escorts, frigates, and several different classes of cruisers only carried the one ASROC 'matchbox' MK 112 launcher with eight ASROC missiles (although later in service, some of those missiles could be replaced by the [[Harpoon (missile)|''Harpoon'']] anti-ship missile. The &quot;matchbox&quot; Mk 112 launchers were capable of carrying a mixture of the two types. Reloads were carried in many classes, either on first level of the superstructure immediately abaft the launcher, or in a separate deckhouse just forward or abaft the Mk 112. 

The MK 16 Launching Group also had configurations that supported HARPOON RGM-84 (Onboard Knox Class Destroyer Escorts (Fast Frigates)) or a variation of the Tartar missile in limited distribution. 

Ships with the [[List of United States Navy Guided Missile Launching System|Mk 26 GMLS]], and late marks of the Mk 10 GMLS aboard the [[Belknap class cruiser|&quot;Belknap&quot;-class]], could accommodate ASROC in these power-loaded launchers (the Mk 13 GMLS was not able to fire the weapon, as the launcher rail was too short).

Most ''Spruance''-class destroyers were later modified to include the MK 41 VLS, these launchers are capable of carrying a mixture of the VL-ASROC, the ''Tomahawk'' TLAM, and other missiles. All of the ''Spruance'' destroyers carried two separate quad ''Harpoon'' launchers. Other US ships with the Mk 41 can also accommodate VL-ASROC.

A former law student and muezzin, '''Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Nami''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أحمد بن عبد الله النامي, ''ʼAḥmad bin ‘Abdullāh an-Nāmī''; also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alnami''') &lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;(December 7, 1977 – September 11, 2001)&lt;/span&gt; was one of four [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. 

Born in [[Saudi Arabia]], Nami had served as a [[muezzin]] and was a college student. He left his family in 2000 to complete the [[Hajj]], but later went to [[Afghanistan]] bound for an [[al-Qaeda]] training camp where he befriended other future hijackers and would soon be chosen to participate in the attacks.

He arrived in the [[United States]] in May 2001, on a tourist visa, where he would settle in [[Florida]] up until the attacks. On September 11, 2001, Nami boarded [[United Airlines Flight 93|United 93]] and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in rural [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], after a passenger uprising, due to the passengers receiving information from their families of the 3 other hijacked planes that hit the [[World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]].

==History==

Nami, much like [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]], [[Wail al-Shehri]], [[Waleed al-Shehri]], and [[Mohand al-Shehri]] was born in the [['Asir Province]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].  Born to the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] tribe of [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;willalOmari&quot;&gt;Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others&lt;/ref&gt; Nami served as a [[muezzin]] at the Seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early 1999. That autumn he enrolled in the [[King Khaled University]] at [[Abha]] to study [[Sharia]], he left his family home in [[Khamis Mushayt]] in the summer of 2000 to complete the [[Hajj]], but never returned – instead travelling to the [[Al Farouq training camp]] in [[Afghanistan]] where he met  and befriended [[Waleed al-Shehri|Waleed]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]], two brothers from Khamis Mushayt, and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]]. The four reportedly pledged themselves to [[Jihad]] in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail – who had dubbed himself ''Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi'' after one of [[Muhammad]]'s companions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boston Globe]], [http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml Driving a Wedge: Part I]&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed &quot;Abu Hashim&quot;, Nami was considered &quot;gentle in manner&quot; by his colleagues, and reported that he had a dream in which he rode a [[mare]] along with [[Muhammad]], and that the prophet told him to dismount and fight his enemies to liberate his land.&lt;ref name=&quot;willalOmari&quot;/&gt;

During his time at al-Farooq, there is a curious mention under [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]]'s details that Nami had recently had [[laser eye surgery]], an uncited fact that does not reappear. 

By October he had taken a prospective hijacker [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]] from [[Afghanistan]] to Saudi Arabia where they both procured [[B-1/B-2 Visa|B-1/B-2 tourist/business visa]]s on October 28 – but Hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family. Nami's Visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that Mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as ''student'' but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as [[Los Angeles]] – in the end he never used this Visa to enter the United States, and reported his [[passport]] (C115007, which showed evidence of travel to [[Afghanistan]]) as &quot;lost&quot;, and procured a new one from [[Jeddah]] (C505363).  He used the new passport to acquire a new B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah on April 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding Mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a visa.&lt;ref name=&quot;visa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |title=Staff Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel |publisher=9/11 Commission |year=2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application.  Records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a visa, so the officer had no way of realising that Nami had successfully received an earlier visa.

In mid-November 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that Nami, [[Wail al-Shehri|Wail]] and [[Waleed al-Shehri]], all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to [[Beirut]] and then onward to [[Iran]] where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get &quot;clean&quot; passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.  

While in the [[United Arab Emirates]], Nami purchased [[traveler's cheque]]s presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]].

===2001===
In March 2001, Ahmed al-Nami appeared in an [[al-Qaeda]] farewell video showing 13 of the ''muscle hijackers'' before they left their training centre in [[Kandahar]]; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.

On April 23, Nami was recorded obtaining a new US Visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/911/911Report-542.html |title=Page 542 |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, Nami arrived in the United States from [[Dubai]] with fellow-hijackers [[Mohand al-Shehri]] and [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]]. By early June, Nami was living in apartment 1504 at the ''Delray Racquet Club condominiums'' with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] in [[Delray Beach, Florida]]. He [[telephone]]d his family in 'Asir shortly after arriving in the country.

In June, he phoned his family for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A19549-2001Sep24&amp;notFound=true | work=The Washington Post | title=Some Light Shed On Saudi Suspects | first1=Caryle | last1=Murphy | first2=David B. | last2=Ottaway | date=September 25, 2001 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of 9 hijackers to open a [[SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on June 29 received either a Florida State Identification Card or Drivers License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Ch2.pdf |title=Chapter 2- Chronology |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He may have been one of three hijackers that listed the Naval Air Station in [[Pensacola, Florida]] as their permanent address on drivers' licenses, though other sources claim he listed the Delray condominium.

On August 28, Nami and [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] reportedly bothered a [[Delray Beach]] resident, Maria Siscar Simpson, to let them through her apartment to retrieve a towel that had fallen off their balcony onto hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/01/911/Florida__terror_s_lau.shtml |title=911: Florida: terror's launching pad |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, Nami and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] purchased tickets for a September 7 flight to [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] at ''Mile High Travel'' on Commercial Boulevard—paying cash for their tickets. [[Ziad Jarrah]] and [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] also purchased tickets for the same flight from ''Passage Tours''.

On September 7, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from [[Fort Lauderdale]] to [[Newark International Airport]] aboard [[Spirit Airlines]].

==Attacks==
{{Main|United Airlines Flight 93}}

On September 11, 2001, Nami arrived in Newark to board [[United Airlines Flight 93]] along with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Ziad Jarrah]]. Some reports suggest Haznawi was pulled aside for screening while others claim there is no record of whether any of the four were screened; the lack of [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras at the time has compounded the problem. Nami boarded the plane between 7:39&amp;nbsp;am and 7:48&amp;nbsp;am; seated in First Class 3C, next to Saeed al-Ghamdi.

Due to the flight's routine delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings and were told to be on the alert, though within two minutes Jarrah had stormed the cockpit leaving the pilots dead or injured.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some have questioned may have signified an allegiance to the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was.

Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and organized a brief assault to retake the cockpit. It is believed the hijackers crashed the plane into the [[Pennsylvania]] farmland rather than cede control of the plane. All aboard died.

==Aftermath==
After the attacks, an employee of [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] named Ahmed al-Nami came forward to say that he feared his identity had been stolen, although he had never lost his passport.

'''Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi''' ({{lang-ar|احمد ابراهيم الحزناوي}}, ''ʼAḥmad Ibrāhīm al-Ḥaznāwī'') (October 11, 1980 &amp;ndash; September 11, 2001) was one of four [[Organizers of the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. 

A [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]], Haznawi had trained in [[Afghanistan]] after leaving his family to fight in [[Chechnya]] in 2000. He arrived in the [[United States]] in June 2001 under the direction of [[Al-Qaeda]] for terrorist attacks, on a tourist visa. Once he was in the U.S., he settled in [[Florida]] and helped plan out how the attacks would take place.

On September 11, 2001, Haznawi boarded United Airlines Flight 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], after a passenger uprising.

==Early life==
Ahmed al-Haznawi was the son of a Saudi [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imam]] from the [[Al-Bahah]] province, which is located in an isolated and underdeveloped part of [[Saudi Arabia]].  Haznawi grew up in the village of Hezna, where his father was a cleric at the mosque in the central marketplace section of the village.  Haznawi belonged to a family that was part of the larger, al-Ghamdi tribe, sharing the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], and [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-20020303&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Driving a Wedge - Bin Laden, the US and Saudi Arabia (Part 1) |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2002-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He memorised the [[Quran]], giving him the title [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Hafiz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;martyr&quot;&gt;Bell, Stewart. &quot;The Martyr's Oath&quot;, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
===1999&amp;ndash;2000===
Haznawi announced he was leaving his family in 1999 to help fight in [[Chechnya]], although his father forbade him.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,685102,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Chilling, defiant: the video suicide message of a September 11 killer | first=Julian | last=Borger | date=April 16, 2002 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father and brother, Abdul Rahman al-Haznawi, reportedly last heard from him in late 2000, after he made references to training in [[Afghanistan]].

On November 12, 2000, Haznawi applied for and received a two-year US [[B-1/B-2 Visa|B-1/B-2
(tourist/business) visa]] in [[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;visa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |title=Staff Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel |publisher=9/11 Commission |year=2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 27, 2000 through December 27, 2000, Haznawi was in [[Saudi Arabia]] for [[Ramadan]].  It is theorized that during this trip, he may have initially told [[Saeed al-Ghamdi|Saeed]] and [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]] about the operation.

Some time late in 2000, Haznawi traveled to the [[United Arab Emirates]], where he purchased [[traveler's cheque]]s presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], [[Wail al-Shehri]] and [[Ahmed al-Nami]].

===2001===
[[File:Alhaznawi video aljazeera.jpg|thumb|right|Haznawi appeared in an [[al-Qaeda]] video, pledging to give his life to [[martyr]]dom.]]
He was one of four hijackers  believed to be staying at a [[Kandahar]] [[guest house (lodging)|guest house]] in March 2001, where they were seen by [[Mohammed Jabarah]]. Jabarah remembered Haznawi specifically, saying that he was &quot;very devout and could recite the entire Koran from memory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot;&gt;Ressa, Maria. &quot;Seeds of Terror&quot;, 2003. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8 he arrived in [[Miami, Florida]] with fellow hijacker [[Wail al-Shehri]].  He was one of 9 hijackers to open a [[SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001.  He is believed to have moved in with [[Ziad Jarrah]], who got a new apartment on Bougainvilla Dr. in [[Lauderdale-by-the-Sea]], after both men gave the landlord photocopies of their German passports, which he later turned over to the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20011019090410/www.miami.com/herald/special/news/worldtrade/digdocs/046328.htm Miami Herald: Hijack plotters used S. Florida as a cradle for conspiracy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, Jarrah took Haznawi to [[Holy Cross Hospital (Fort Lauderdale)|Holy Cross Hospital]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]] on advice of his landlord Charles Lisa.  Haznawi was treated by Dr. Christos Tsonas, who gave him antibiotics for a small gash on his left calf.  While he told staff that he had bumped into a suitcase,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anthraxinvestigation.com/wp0328.html&lt;/ref&gt; the media briefly reported it as a sign of [[anthrax|cutaneous anthrax]] and a possible link to the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], although FBI later addressed the rumors stating that &quot;Exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/03/23/anthrax/?related | work=CNN | title=Report raises question of anthrax, hijacker link | date=March 23, 2002 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10 Haznawi obtained a Florida driver's license, later obtaining another copy on September 7, 2001 by filling out a change-of-address form. Five other suspected hijackers also received duplicate Florida licenses in 2001, and others had licenses from different states. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040604015841/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-worldtrade-suspectprofiles.story Multiple identities of hijack suspects confound FBI: South Florida Sun-Sentinel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarrah and Haznawi both received their one-way tickets for United Airlines Flight 93, on September 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html Statement of Robert S.

On September 11, 2001, Haznawi arrived at [[Newark International Airport]] to board Flight 93.  Although he was selected for additional security by [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System|CAPPS]] and screened, he was able to board the flight without incident, with only his checked bags requiring extra screening for explosives.&lt;ref name=&quot;staff&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_3.pdf |title=The Aviation Security System and the 9/11 Attacks - Staff Statement No. 3 |publisher=9/11 Commission|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day and were told to be on the alert.  Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some believe may have signified an allegiance to the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside - it is not known which hijacker this was.  Some passengers expressed doubt that the bomb was real.

[[Passengers]] on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. A passenger uprising soon took place. Hijacker-pilot, [[Ziad Jarrah]], crashed the plane into an empty field near Shanksville, [[Pennsylvania]] in order to prevent the passengers from gaining control of the plane. The crash killed everyone on board.

==Aftermath==
After the attacks, before the release of the FBI pictures of the hijackers, [[Arab News]] reported that Haznawi's brother Abdul Rahman had told al-Madinah newspaper that a photograph published by local newspapers bore no resemblance to his brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=9490&amp;d=1&amp;m=10&amp;y=2001 Hanjour family denies Hani’s involvement in crime&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A videotape released with The Wills of the New York and Washington Battle Martyrs, was aired on [[Al Jazeera]] on April 16, 2002. While the name beneath the speaker read ''al-Ghamdi'', the image is of Haznawi speaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Officials suggested that the name was merely a reference to his tribal affiliation.  The film was thought to have been made in March 2001.  In it, he talked about his plans to bring the &quot;bloodied message&quot; to America.  In September 2002, a similar tape made by [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]] appeared.

'''Athanasius of Alexandria''' ({{lang-el|Ἀθανάσιος, ''Athanásios''}}) [b. ca. (296-298) – d. 2 May 373] is also given the titles '''St. Athanasius the Great''', '''Pope St. Athanasius I of Alexandria''', '''St Athanasius the Confessor''' and (in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], mainly) '''St Athanasius the Apostolic'''. He was the 20th [[bishop of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suscopts.org/stathanasiuschattanooga/St.%20Athanasius.htm%20St.%20Athanasius%20the%20Apostolic St. Athanasius the Apostolic] - From the Coptic Synaxarium St. Athanasius Coptic Orthodox Church - Retrieved 14 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His long episcopate lasted 45 years (c. 8 June 328 - 2 May 373), of which over 17 years were spent in five exiles ordered by four different Roman [[emperors]]. He is considered to be a renowned [[Christian theologian]], a [[Church Father]], the chief defender of Orthodoxy against [[Arianism]], and a noted [[Egypt]]ian leader of the fourth century. 

He is remembered for his role in the conflict with [[Arius]] and Arianism. In 325, at the age of 27, Athanasius had a leading role against the Arians in the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. At the time, he was a deacon and personal secretary of the 19th Bishop of Alexandria, Alexander. Nicaea was convoked by the Emperor [[Constantine]] in May–August 325 to address the Arian heresy that [[Christ]] is of a distinct substance from the Father.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 328, at the age of 30, three years after Nicæa and upon the repose of Bishop Alexander, he became archbishop of Alexandria. He continued to lead the conflict against the Arians for the rest of his life and was engaged in theological and political struggles against the Emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and powerful and influential Arian churchmen, led by Arian Bishop [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] and others. He was known as '''''&quot;Athanasius Contra Mundum&quot;'''''. Within few years of his departure, [[St. Gregory of Nazianzus]] called him the ''&quot;Pillar of the Church&quot;''. His writings were well regarded by all Church fathers who followed, in both the West and the East. His writings show a rich devotion to the Word-become-man, great pastoral concern, and profound interest in monasticism.

Athanasius is counted as one of the Great Doctors of the Church in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] where he is also labeled the &quot;Father of Orthodoxy&quot;. He is also one of the four Great [[Doctors of the Church]] from the East in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Doctors&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Doctors of the Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is renowned in the Protestant churches, who label him &quot;Father of The Canon&quot;. Athanasius is venerated as a Christian [[saint]], whose [[feast day]] is 2 May in [[Western Christianity]], 15 May in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], and 18 January in the other Eastern Orthodox churches. He is venerated by the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox, the Roman Catholics, the Lutherans, and the Anglican Communion.

==Biography==
St Athanasius was born in the city of [[Alexandria]] or possibly the nearby Nile Delta town of Damanhur ca. 296-298.It is speculated that his parents were wealthy enough to afford giving him an esteemed secular learning. In his earliest work [''Against the Heathen - On the Incarnation'', written before 319], he repeatedly quoted [[Plato]] and used a definition from the ''Organon'' of [[Aristotle]]. He was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of [[Neo-Platonism]]. In later works, he quotes [[Homer]] more than once (''Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29''). In his letter to [[Emperor Constantius]], he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of Demosthenes de Corona (''Fialon'').

He came from a Christian family, despite accounts to the contrary, as in his writings he tells more that once of an aunt who taught him some principles of the Christian faith, and a father who did the same, as well as mentioning (once) his mother doing the same. He had a Christian brother, and later in his life, in one of his exiles, he hid in his father's tomb in what appears to be described as a Christian cemetery.

He knew [[Greek language|Greek]] and he admits to not knowing [[Hebrew]] [see, e.g., the 39th Festal Letter of St. Athan.]. The Old Testament passages he quotes frequently come from the [[Septuagint]] Greek translation. Ignorant of Hebrew, and only rarely appealing to other Greek versions (to [[Aquila]] once in the ''Ecthesis'', to other versions once or twice on the Psalms), his knowledge of the Old Testament is limited to the Septuagint. But of it, as well as of the New Testament, he had an astonishing command.&lt;ref name=&quot;GK&quot;&gt;᾽Αλεξανδρεὺς τῷ γένει, ἀνὴρ λόγιος, δυνατὸς ὢν ἐν ταῖς γραφαῖς&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to write a letter in exile, with no access to a copy of the Scriptures, and quote from memory every verse in the Old Testament with reference to the [[Trinity]] without missing any. The combination of Scriptural study and of Greek learning was what one expects in a pupil of the famous Alexandrian School, the School of [[Clement]], [[Origen]], [[Dionysius]] and [[Theognostus]]. 

At the time he was a student, The influence of [[Origen]] was still felt in the traditions of the theological school of Alexandria. It was from St. [[Alexander of Alexandria]], Bishop of Alexandria, 312–328, himself an Origenist, that St Athanasius received his main instruction. His earliest work [''Against the Heathen - On the Incarnation'', written before 319] bears traces of the Origenist Alexandrian thought but in an orthodox way. He later modified the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the &quot;entirely allegorical interpretation of the text&quot; proposed by [[Origen]].

He was ordained a deacon by the contemporary patriarch, [[Alexander of Alexandria]], in 319.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia Americana'', vol. 2 [[Danbury, Connecticut]]: Grolier Incorporated, 1997. ISBN 0-7172-0129-5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 325, he served as Alexander's secretary at the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. Already a recognized theologian and [[ascetic]], he was the obvious choice to replace Alexander as the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] on the latter's death in 328,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia Britannica'', 15th edition. Chicago: Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. ISBN 0-85229-633-0.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the opposition of the followers of Arius and [[Meletius of Lycopolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt;

Athanasius spent the first years of his patriarchate visiting the churches with people of his territory, which at that time included all of [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]]. During this period, he established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including [[Pachomius]], which would be very valuable to him over the years. Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the disputes with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Arianism|Arians]] which would occupy much of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

Athanasius' first problem lay with the [[Meletius of Lycopolis|Meletians]], who had failed to abide by the terms of the decision made at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] which had hoped to reunite them with the Church. Athanasius himself was accused of mistreating Arians and the followers of [[Meletius of Lycopolis]], and had to answer those charges at a gathering of bishops in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], the [[First Synod of Tyre]], in 335. At that meeting, [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] and the other supporters of Arius deposed Athanasius.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt; On November 6, both parties of the dispute met with [[Constantine I]] in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Timothy D., Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1993), 23&lt;/ref&gt; At that meeting, Athanasius was accused of threatening to interfere with the supply of grains from Egypt, and, without any kind of formal trial, was exiled by Constantine to [[Trier]] in the [[Rhineland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

On the death of Emperor [[Constantine I]], Athanasius was allowed to return to his [[Episcopal see|See]] of Alexandria. Shortly thereafter, however, Constantine's son, the new [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantius II]], renewed the order for Athanasius' banishment in 338. Athanasius went to [[Rome]], where he was under the protection of [[Constans]], the Emperor of the West. During this time, [[Gregory of Cappadocia]] was installed as the Patriarch of Alexandria, usurping the absent Athanasius. Athanasius did, however, remain in contact with his people through his annual ''Festal Letters'', in which he also announced on which date [[Easter]] would be celebrated that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

[[Pope Julius I]] wrote to the supporters of Arius strongly urging the reinstatement of Athanasius, but that effort proved to be in vain. He called a [[synod]] in Rome in the year 341 to address the matter, and at that meeting Athanasius was found to be innocent of all the charges raised against him. Julius also called the [[Council of Sardica]] in 343. This council confirmed the decision of the earlier Roman synod, and clearly indicated that the attendees saw St Athanasius as the lawful Patriarch of Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt; It proved no more successful, however, as only bishops from the West and Egypt bothered to appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

Early in the year 343, Athanasius went to Gaul, where he had gone to consult the saintly [[Hosius of Corduba]], the great champion of orthodoxy in the West. The two together set out for the [[Council of Sardica]] which had been summoned in deference to the Roman pontiff's wishes. At this great gathering of prelates the case of Athanasius was taken up and once more his innocence reaffirmed. Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the Council was made known. The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigor, and [[Constantius II]] was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. Orders were given that if the Saint attempted to re-enter his [[episcopal see]], he should be put to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1930&quot;&gt;Clifford, Cornelius, Catholic Encyclopedia 1930, Volume 2, Pgs: 35-40 &quot;Athanasius&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 346, following the death of Gregory, Constans used his influence to allow Athanasius to return to Alexandria. Athanasius' return was welcomed by the majority of the people of Egypt who had come to view him as a national hero. This was the start of a &quot;golden decade&quot; of peace and prosperity, during which time Athanasius assembled several documents relating to his exiles and returns from exile in the ''Apology Against the Arians''. However, upon Constans' death in 350, a civil war broke out which left Constantius as sole emperor. Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service. Following this, Athanasius left for [[Upper Egypt]], where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work ''Four Orations against the Arians'' and defended his own recent conduct in the ''Apology to Constantius'' and ''Apology for His Flight''. Constantius' persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop [[George of Laodicea]], prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional ''History of the Arians'', in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

In 361, after the death of Emperor Constantius, shortly followed by the murder of the very unpopular Bishop George, the popular St Athanasius now had the opportunity to return to his [[patriarchate]]. The following year he convened a council at Alexandria at which he appealed for unity among all those who had faith in Christianity, even if they differed on matters of terminology. This prepared the groundwork for the definition of the orthodox doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. In 362, the new Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], noted for his opposition to Christianity, ordered Athanasius to leave Alexandria once again. Athanasius left for [[Upper Egypt]], remaining there until Julian's death in 363. Two years later, the Emperor [[Valens]], who favored the Arian position, in his turn exiled Athanasius. This time however, Athanasius simply left for the outskirts of Alexandria, where he stayed for only a few months before the local authorities convinced Valens to retract his order of exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; Some of the early reports explicitly indicate that Athanasius spent this period of exile in his ancestral tomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt;

[[Valens]], who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of a popular outbreak, gave orders within a few weeks for the return of Athanasius to his [[episcopal see]]. Here, St Athanasius, spent his remaining days, characteristically enough, in re-emphasizing the view of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] which had been defined at [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]].
He died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1930&quot; /&gt;

===A Note About His Year of Birth===
St Athanasius' year of birth is given anywhere from 296-298 or in 293. The arguments for a later date (i.e., 296-298, and most probably 298) can be summarized as follows. The author of the ''Festal Index'', who was the original collector of St. Athanasius' famed ''Festal Epistles'' (collected shortly after his death), stated that the Arians had accused St. Athanasius, among other accusations, that his ordination as Pope of Alexandria in 328 was not canonical because at the time of the consecration to the episcopate he had not yet attained the canonical age 30. While there is no reason to believe the Arian claim, it can be surmised that he was close enough to 30 years old in 328 for them to contemplate raising such an accusation.

In two distinct passages of his writings (''Hist. Ar., lxiv'', and ''De Syn., xviii''), St Athanasius does not recall from memory being a first hand witness to the onset of the great persecution by the [[Tetrarchy]] of [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] in February 303, for in referring to the events of this period he makes no direct appeal to his own personal recollections, but falls back on tradition. Being unable to recall the events from memory (because he was still young) places him at an age much younger than 10 in 303. 

Moreover, his parents were still alive in Alexandria in 358, which would also place the date of his birth later rather than earlier. These considerations would seem to make it likely that he was born no earlier than 296 and no later than 298. ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states he was born c. 296. 

The earlier date, 293, is sometimes assigned and apparently supported  by the authority of a &quot;Coptic Fragment&quot; (published by Dr. O. von Lemm among the Mémoires de l'académie impériale des sciences de S. Péterbourg, 1888) and corroborated by the maturity revealed in his two earliest treatises ''Contra Gentes'' (''Against the Heathens'') and ''De Incarnatione'' (''On the Incarnation''), which were admittedly written about the year 318 before Arianism had begun to make itself felt, as those writings do not show an awareness of Arianism.

===A Note About His National Origin===
St Athanasius was an [[Egyptian]] born in the city of [[Alexandria]] or possibly the nearby Nile Delta town of Damanhur. His superior command of [[Greek]], and the fact that the vast majority of his writings were in Greek, led some in the West to claim that he was a [[Greek people|Greek]] born in [[Alexandria]]. However, in [[Coptic literature]], St Athanasius is the first patriarch of Alexandria to use [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as well as Greek in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026215/Coptic-literature encyclopedia britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;. The fact that he assumed the Episcopal see of Alexandria at a time of rising Egyptian Nationalism and of him being a Noted Egyptian leader lends additional support to his Egyptian Ancestry.  

He received secular, philosophical, as well as theological training at [[Alexandria]]. Specifically his theological learning was in the famed Catechetical School of Alexandria. He recounts being a student in that school who was eeducated by the Martyrs of the Great (tenth) and last persecution of Christianity at the hands of pagan Rome. This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. Possibly one of his teachers was St. [[Pope Peter of Alexandria|Peter of Alexandria]], the 17th archbishop of Alexandria who was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution.

===His Exiles===
St Athanasius' long episcopate lasted 45 years (c. 8 June 328 - 2 May 373) of which over 17 years were spent in five exiles ordered by four different RomaneEmperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which he had to flee Alexandria for his own safety to escape people seeking to take his life.  

'''''First exile:'''''  under [[Emperor Constantine]], for 2.5 years [11 Jul 335 - 22 Nov 337]; in Trier (Germany).

'''''Second exile:''''' under [[Emperor Constantius]], for 7.5 years [16 Apr 339 - 21 Oct 346]; lived at Rome.

'''''Third exile:''''' under [[Emperor Constantius]], for 6 years [9 Feb 356 - 21 Feb 362]; in the Egyptian desert.

'''''Fourth exile:''''' under Apostate [[Emperor Julian]], 10 months [24 Oct 362 - 5 Sep 363]; in the Egyptian desert.

'''''Fifth exile:''''' under [[Emperor Valens]], 4 months [5 Oct 365 - 31 Jan 366]; in his father's tomb.

==Works==
{{wikisource|History of the Arians}}{{Wikisourcelang|el|Εγκώμιον εις τον Άγιον Ανδρέαν τον Απόστολον}}
Athanasius other works include his two-part ''Against the Heathen'' and ''The Incarnation of the Word of God''. Completed probably early in his life, before the Arian controversy,&lt;ref&gt;Justo L. Gonzalez in ''A History of Christian Thought'' notes (p292) that E. Schwartz places this work later, around 335, but &quot;his arguments have not been generally accepted&quot;. The introduction to the CSMV translation of ''On the Incarnation'' places the work in 318, around the time Athanasius was ordained to the diaconate (''St Athanasius On the Incarnation'', Mowbray, England 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; they constitute the first classic work of developed Orthodox theology. In the first part, Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs. The second part presents teachings on the redemption.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt; Also in these books, Athanasius put forward the belief that the [[Son of God]], the eternal Word through whom God created the world, entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away.  His other important works include his ''Letters to Serapion'', which dealt with the [[divinity]] of the [[Holy Spirit]], and his classic ''Life of [[Anthony of Egypt|St Anthony]]'', which was translated into several languages and played an important role in the spreading of the [[ascetic]] ideal in Eastern and Western Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; He also wrote several works of [[Biblical exegesis]], primarily of volumes in the [[Old Testament]], which are preserved in excerpts regarding the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Song of Solomon]], and [[Psalms]]. His works on ascetism, include the aforementioned ''Life of St. Anthony'', as well as a ''Discourse on Virginity'', a short work on ''Love and Self-Control'', and a treatise ''On Sickness and Health'' which is only preserved in fragments.

Athanasius' letters include one ''&quot;Letter Concerning the Decrees of the Council of Nicaea&quot;'' (''De Decretis''), which is an account of the proceedings of that council, and another letter in the year 367 which was the first known listing of the New Testament including all those books now accepted everywhere as the New Testament.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt; (earlier similar lists vary by the omission or addition of a few books, see ''[[Development of the New Testament canon]]''). Several of his letters also survive. In one of these, to [[Epictetus of Corinth]], Athanasius anticipates future controversies in his defense of the humanity of Christ. Another of his letters, to Dracontius, urges that monk to leave the desert for the more active duties of a bishop.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;

There are several other works ascribed to him, although not necessarily generally accepted as being his own work. These include the [[Athanasian creed]], which is today generally seen as being of 5th-century Galician origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt;

Athanasius was not what would be called a speculative theologian. As he stated in his ''First Letters to Serapion'', he held on to &quot;the tradition, teaching, and faith proclaimed by the apostles and guarded by the fathers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt; In some cases, this led to his taking the position that faith should take priority over reason. He held that not only was the Son of God [[consubstantiality|consubstantial]] with the Father, but so was the [[Holy Spirit]], which had a great deal of influence in the development of later doctrines regarding the Trinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt;

St Athanasius was originally buried in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], but his body was later transferred to the [[Chiesa di San Zaccaria]] in [[Venice]], [[Italy]]. During [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]]'s visit to Rome from 4 May to 10 May 1973, [[Pope Paul VI]] gave the [[Copt]]ic Patriarch a [[relic]] of Athanasius,&lt;ref&gt;[http://metroplit-bishoy.org/files/Dialogues/Catholics/ICTD.doc Metropolitan Bishoy of Damiette]&lt;/ref&gt; which he brought back to Egypt on 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avarewase.org/en/map/athanas.htm Saint Athanasius]&lt;/ref&gt; The relic of St Athanasius the Great of Alexandria is currently preserved under the new [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Deir El-Anba Rowais, Abbassiya, Cairo, Egypt. The body of St Athanasius continues to repose in the [[Chiesa di San Zaccaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum Planet, Chiesa di San Zaccaria Tour, http://www.museumplanet.com/tour.php/venice/zac/23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanidopoulos, John &quot;The Incorrupt Relics of Saint Athanasios the Great&quot; http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2010/05/incorrupt-relics-of-saint-athanasios.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a [[troparion]] (hymn) to St Athanasius sung in some Eastern Orthodox churches.
: ''O Holy father Athanasius,''
: ''like a pillar of orthodoxy''
: ''you refuted the heretical nonsense of Arius''
: ''by insisting that the Father and the Son are equal in essence.''
: ''O venerable father, beg Christ our God to save our souls.''

Athanasius is venerated as a saint by the majority of major Christian denominations which officially approve of and recognize saints. His [[feast day]] is observed on 2 May, the day of his death. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] he is deemed a [[Doctor of the Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Doctors&quot; /&gt;

He has been hailed as &quot;the pillar of the Church&quot; by [[Gregory of Nazianzus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt;

[[St Gregory Nazianzen]], fellow [[Doctor of the Church]], 330-390, said in Or.21: &quot;When I praise Athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for I name every virtue as often as I mention him who was possessed of all virtues. He was the true pillar of the Church. His life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1930&quot; /&gt;

==Historical significance==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2011}}
===Early life===
The [[Alexandria]] of his boyhood was an epitome—intellectually, morally, and politically—of the ethnically diverse Graeco-Roman world. It was the most important center of trade in the whole empire; and its primacy as an emporium of ideas was more commanding than that of Rome or Constantinople, Antioch or Marseilles. Its famous catechetical school, while sacrificing none of its famous passion for orthodoxy since the days of [[Pantaenus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Origen of Alexandria]], had begun to take on an almost secular character in the comprehensiveness of its interests, and had counted influential pagans among its serious auditors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], Hist. Eccl., VI, xix&lt;/ref&gt;

St Athanasius seems to have been brought early in life under the immediate supervision of the ecclesiastical authorities of his native city. A story has been preserved by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] (Hist. Eccl., I, xiv). Bishop [[Alexander of Alexandria|Alexander]], so the tale runs, had invited a number of fellow prelates to meet him at breakfast after a great religious function. While Alexander was waiting for his guests to arrive, he stood by a window, watching a group of boys at play on the seashore below the house. He had not observed them long before he discovered that they were imitating the elaborate ritual of Christian baptism. He sent for the children and, in the investigation that followed, it was discovered that one of the boys (none other than Athanasius) had acted the part of the bishop and in that character had actually baptized several of his companions in the course of their play. Alexander determined to recognize the make-believe baptisms as genuine, and decided that Athanasius and his playfellows should go into training in order to prepare themselves for a clerical career.

[[Sozomen]] speaks of his &quot;fitness for the priesthood&quot;, and calls attention to the significant circumstance that he was &quot;from his tenderest years practically self-taught&quot;. &quot;Not long after this,&quot; adds the same authority, Bishop Alexander &quot;invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen&quot; (Soz., II, xvii). That &quot;wisdom and acumen&quot; manifested themselves in a varied environment. While still a deacon under Alexander's care, he seems to have been brought for a while into close relations with some of the solitaries of the Egyptian desert, and in particular with the [[Anthony the Great]], whose life he is said to have written.

===Opposition to Arianism===
{{See|Arian controversy}}

In about 319, when Athanasius was a [[deacon]], a [[presbyter]] named [[Arius]] came into a direct conflict with [[Alexander of Alexandria]]. It appears that Arius reproached Alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Kannengiesser, Charles, “Alexander and Arius of Alexandria: The last Ante-Nicene theologians”, Miscelanea En Homenaje Al P. Antonio Orbe Compostellanum Vol. XXXV, no. 1-2. (Santiago de Compostela, 1990),398&lt;/ref&gt; Arius’ theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in Alexandrian Christianity, and his Christological views were certainly not radical at all.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rowan, Arius: Heresy and Tradition (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1987),175&lt;/ref&gt; He embraced a subordinationist [[Christology]] (that God did not have a beginning, but the [[Logos]] did), heavily influenced by Alexandrian thinkers like [[Origen]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 175&lt;/ref&gt; which was a common Christological view in Alexandria at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 154-155&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Arius from powerful bishops like [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]&lt;ref&gt;Arius letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander of Alexandria's Catholic Epistle&lt;/ref&gt; further illustrate how Arius' subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the Empire. Arius was subsequently excommunicated by Alexander, and he would begin to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position. Athanasius may have accompanied Alexander to the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, the council which produced the [[Nicene Creed]] and [[anathematized]] Arius and his followers. On 9 May 328, Athanasius succeeded Alexander as bishop of Alexandria. As a result of rises and falls in [[Arianism]]'s influence after the First Council of Nicaea, Emperor [[Constantine I]] banished him from Alexandria to [[Trier]] in the [[Rhineland]], but he was restored after the death of Constantine I by the emperor's son [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]]. In 339, he was banished once again. This time he went to [[Rome]], and spent seven years there before returning to Alexandria. The years from 346 through 356 were a relatively peaceful period for Athanasius, and some of his most important writings were composed during this period. Unfortunately, the emperor Constantius II seems to have been committed to having Athanasius [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]], and went so far as to send soldiers to arrest him. Athanasius went into hiding in the desert with the [[Desert Fathers]], and continued in his capacity as bishop from there until the death of Constantius II in 361.

At the [[Councils of Alexandria|Alexandrian Council of 326]], Athanasius was elected to succeed the aged Alexander, and various heresies and schisms of Egypt were denounced. In 340, one hundred bishops met at Alexandria, declared in favor of Athanasius, and vigorously rejected the criticisms of the Eusebian faction at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. At a council in 350, Athanasius was replaced in his see. In 362 was held one of the most important of these councils. It was presided over by Athanasius and [[Eusebius of Vercelli]], and was directed against those who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the human soul of Christ, and Christ's divinity. Mild measures were agreed on for those heretic bishops who repented, but severe penance was decreed for the chief leaders of the major heresies.

In 363, another council met under Athanasius for the purpose of submitting to the new Roman Emperor Jovian an account of the true faith. Somewhat similar was the purpose of the Council of 364.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Alexandria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two more brief periods when Athanasius was exiled. In the spring of 365, after the accession of Emperor [[Valens]] to the throne, troubles again arose. Athanasius was once more compelled to seek safety from his persecutors in concealment (October 365), which lasted, however, only for four months.

From 366 he was able to serve as bishop in peace until his death.

Athanasius was restored on at least five separate occasions, perhaps as many as seven. This gave rise to the expression &quot;Athanasius contra mundum&quot; or &quot;Athanasius against the world&quot;.

He spent his final years repairing all the damage done during the earlier years of violence, dissent, and exile, and returning to his writing and preaching undisturbed. On 2 May 373, having consecrated [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter II]], one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died quietly in his house.

===Writings===
Athanasius spent a good deal of his energy on polemical writings against his theological opponents. Examples include ''Orations Against the Arians'', his defence of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]] (''Letters to Serapion'' in the 360s, and ''On the Holy Spirit'') against [[Macedonians (religious group)|Macedonianism]] and On the Incarnation.

Arguably his most read work is his biography of [[Anthony the Great]] entitled ''Vita Antonii'', or ''Life of Antony''. This biography depicts Anthony as an illiterate and holy man who through his existence in a primordial landscape has an absolute connection to the divine truth, which always is synonymous with that of Athanasius as the biographer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dag Øistein Endsjø]] ''Primordial landscapes, incorruptible bodies. Desert asceticism and the Christian appropriation of Greek ideas on geography, bodies, and immortality.'' New York: Peter Lang 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It later served as an inspiration to Christian [[monasticism|monastics]] in both the East and the West. The so-called [[Athanasian Creed]] dates from well after Athanasius's death and draws upon the phraseology of Augustine's ''[[De trinitate]]''.

In [[Coptic literature]], St. Athanasius is the first patriarch of Alexandria to use [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as well as Greek in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026215/Coptic-literature encyclopedia britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quotes from St Athanasius====

He said:

&quot;Jesus that I know as my Redeemer cannot be less than God&quot; ~at the Council of Nicæa (c. 325)

&quot;Both from the confession of the evil spirits and from the daily witness of His works, it is manifest, then, and let none presume to doubt it, that the Savior has raised His own body, and that He is very Son of God, having His being from God as from a Father, Whose Word and Wisdom and Whose Power He is. He it is Who in these latter days assumed a body for the salvation of us all, and taught the world concerning the Father. He it is Who has destroyed death and freely graced us all with incorruption through the promise of the resurrection, having raised His own body as its first-fruits, and displayed it by the sign of the cross as the monument to His victory over death and its corruption&quot;. - ''The Incarnation of the Word'', Chapter 5, The Resurrection (5:32)

&quot;But for the searching and right understanding of the Scriptures there is need of a good life and a pure soul, and for Christian virtue to guide the mind to grasp, so far as human nature can, the truth concerning God the Word. One cannot possibly understand the teaching of the saints unless one has a pure mind and is trying to imitate their life. Anyone who wants to look at sunlight naturally wipes his eye clear first, in order to make, at any rate, some approximation to the purity of that on which he looks; and a person wishing to see a city or country goes to the place in order to do so. Similarly, anyone who wishes to understand the mind of the sacred writers must first cleanse his own life, and approach the saints by copying their deeds. Thus united to them in the fellowship of life, he will both understand the things revealed to them by God and, thenceforth escaping the peril that threatens sinners in the judgment, will receive that which is laid up for the saints in the kingdom of heaven.&quot; ~in his conclusion to ''The Incarnation of the Word'', Chapter 9, (9:57)

&quot;These are fountains of salvation that they who thirst may be satisfied with the living words they contain. In these alone is proclaimed the doctrine of godliness. Let no man add to these, neither let him take out from these. For concerning these, the Lord put to shame the Sadducees, and said, 'Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures' and He reproved the Jews, saying, 'Search the Scriptures, for these are they that testify of ME&quot;. ~describing the canon in his 39th Festal Letter (c.367)

&quot;The Son of God became man so that we might become God.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Weigel |first = George |authorlink = George Weigel |coauthors = |title = The Truth of Catholicism |publisher = [[Harper Collins]] |year = 2001 |location = New York City |pages =9 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-06-621330-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Later echoed by Thomas Aquinas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Later echoed by Witness Lee&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament canon===
{{See also|Biblical canon}}
St Athanasius is also the first person to identify the same 27 books of the [[New Testament]] that are in use today. Up until then, various similar lists of works to be read in churches were in use. A milestone in the evolution of the [[Biblical canon#Christian canons|canon of New Testament books]] is his [[Easter letter]] from Alexandria, written in 367, usually referred to as his ''39th Festal Letter''. [[Pope Damasus I]], the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] in 382, promulgated a list of books which contained a New Testament canon identical to that of Athanasius.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} A [[Synod of Hippo|synod in Hippo]] in 393 repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' New Testament list (without the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]), and a [[Councils of Carthage|synod in Carthage]] in 397 repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' complete New Testament list.

Scholars have debated whether Athanasius' list in 367 was the basis for the later lists. Because Athanasius' canon is the closest canon of any of the Church Fathers to the canon used by Protestant churches today, many Protestants point to Athanasius as the father of the canon. They are identical except that Athanasius includes the [[Book of Baruch]] and the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] and places the [[Book of Esther]] among the &quot;7 books not in the canon but to be read&quot; along with the [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]], [[Ben Sira|Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)]], [[Book of Judith|Judith]], [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], the [[Didache]], and the [[The Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd of Hermas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-93.htm Excerpt from Letter 39]&lt;/ref&gt; See the article, [[Biblical canon]], for more details.

==Recent Opinions==
[[File:Athanasius of Alexandria.jpg|thumb|220px|Statue of the saint in St Athanasius' [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]].]]
There are at present two completely opposite views about the personality of Athanasius. While some scholars praise him as an orthodox saint with great character, others see him as a power-hungry politician who employed questionable ecclesiastical tactics.

===Critics of Athanasius===
[[Richard E. Rubenstein]] and [[Timothy Barnes]] have painted a less than flattering picture of the saint. They argue that his ascension to the station of bishop in [[Alexandria]] occurred under questionable circumstances. Upon the death of his predecessor Alexander in 328, more than fifty bishops gathered to choose a new leader to the [[Alexandria]]n see. While Alexander had been priming Athanasius to assume the bishopric after his death, it is said, he was not unanimously supported, and questions of his age (the minimum age to become a bishop was thirty, and questions remain to this day whether he was yet that old). Having less than overwhelming support as well did not help his candidacy. According to recent academics, Athanasius, growing impatient, took a small number of bishops who supported his claim, and held a private consecration making him bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, Richard E., When Jesus Became God: The Epic Fight over Christ’s Divinity in the Last Days of Rome (New York: Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, 1999), 105-106&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of his career, Athanasius had many detractors. There were allegations of defiling an altar, selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and for suppressing dissent through violence and murder.&lt;ref name = &quot;wxdxek&quot;&gt;Barnes, Timothy D., Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1993),37&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be claimed, beyond all doubt, whether any or all of these specific allegations were true, but [[Richard E. Rubenstein|Rubenstein]] suggests that Athanasius employed a level of force when it suited his cause or personal interests.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein,106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporters of Athanasius===
However, there are also many modern historians who object to this view and point out that such a hostile attitude towards Athanasius is based on an unfair judgment of historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 24-99; Ng, 273-292.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian denominations revere Athanasius as a saint, teacher, and father. They cite his defense of the Christology described in the first chapter of the Gospel of John (&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God&quot; (John 1:1,2)) and his significant theological works ([[C.S. Lewis]] calls his ''De Incarnatione'' a &quot;masterpiece&quot;) &lt;ref&gt;Introduction to St. Athanasius on the Incarnation. Translated and edited by Sister Penelope Lawson, published by Mowbray 1944. p.9&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence of his righteousness. They also emphasize his close relationship with St Anthony, who is almost universally revered throughout Christendom.

[[St Gregory Nazianzen]], 330-390, begins Or. 21 with: &quot;When I praise Athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for I name every virtue as often as I mention him who was possessed of all virtues. He was the true pillar of the church. His life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1930&quot; /&gt;

[[St Pius X]] said in a letter to philosopher-friend and correspondent in the closing years of his life, (Epist. lxxi, ad Max.): &quot;Let what was confessed by the fathers of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] prevail&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clifford1930&quot; /&gt;

===Anti-Arianism===
Athanasius presented his opponents, the [[Arianism|Arians]], as a cohesive group that backed [[Arius]]’ views and followed him as a leader. It is now accepted by most scholars that the Arian Party was not a monolithic group,&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Christopher, “The Arians of Alexandria”, Vigiliae Christianae Vol. 47, no. 3 (1993), 239&lt;/ref&gt; holding drastically different theological views that spanned the early Christian theological spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Henry, “Faith and Order at the Council of Nicaea”, Harvard Theological Review LIII (Cambridge Mass: 1960),173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kannengiesser &quot;Alexander and Arius&quot;, 403&lt;/ref&gt; They supported the tenets of Origenist thought and theology,&lt;ref&gt;Kannengiesser, “Athanasius of Alexandria vs. Arius: The Alexandrian Crisis”, in The Roots of Egyptian Christianity (Studies in Antiquity and Christianity), ed. Birger A. Pearson and James E. Goehring (1986),208&lt;/ref&gt; but had little else in common. The term Arian was first coined by Athanasius to describe both followers of Arius, and followers of ideas that he deemed as bad as Arius'. Athanasius used the term Arian to describe many of his opponents, except for [[Miletus|Miletian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes &quot;Athanasius and Constantius&quot;,135&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term in a derogatory fashion to chide Arius’ supporters&lt;ref&gt;Barnes &quot;Athanasius and Constantius&quot;,14&lt;/ref&gt; who did not see themselves as followers of Arius.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 82&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Timothy Barnes, Athanasius used “invented dialogue to ridicule his adversaries”, and used “suppression and distortion” to serve his own means.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes &quot;Athanasius and Constantius&quot;,128&lt;/ref&gt; He often blamed charges and accusations leveled at him on “Arian madmen” who he claimed conspired to destroy him and Christianity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}The [[Arianism|Arian]] party, as described by Athanasius, may not have existed in the form he portrayed in his writings. Some argue that the view of [[Arianism]] that exists to this day among most Christians would not have existed were it not for Athanasius. However, others point to the Council of Nicaea as proof in and of itself that Arianism was a real theological ideology. While Athanasius may have affected the general perception of Arianism, they say, his portrayal was polemical, not creative.

The Archipelago of the '''Azores''' ({{IPA-en|əˈzɔrz}} {{Respell|ə|ZORZ|'}} or {{IPA-en|ˈeɪzɔrz}} {{Respell|AY|zorz}}; {{IPA-pt|ɐˈsoɾɨʃ|lang}}, '''Açores''') is composed of nine [[volcanic island]]s situated in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[archipelago]] is located about {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}} west from [[Lisbon]] and about {{convert|3900|km|mi|abbr=on}} east from the east coast of [[North America]]. The archipelago, and economic exclusion zone, forms the '''Autonomous Region of the Azores''', one of the two [[autonomous regions of Portugal]]. Its main industries are: [[agriculture]], [[dairy farming]] (for cheese and butter products primarily), minor livestock [[ranching]], [[Fishing in Portugal|fishing]] and [[Tourism in Portugal|tourism]], which is becoming the major service activity in the region. In addition, the government of the Azores is responsible for employing a large percentage of population directly or indirectly in many aspects of the service and tertiary sectors.

There are nine major Azorean [[island]]s and an islet cluster, in three main groups. These are [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] and [[Corvo Island|Corvo]], to the west; [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]], [[Terceira Island|Terceira]], [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]], [[Pico Island|Pico]] and [[Faial Island|Faial]] in the centre; and [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]] and the [[Formigas|Formigas Reef]] to the east.  These extend for more than {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} and lie in a northwest-southeast direction. 
The vast extent of the islands defines an immense [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|1100000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The westernmost point of this area is {{convert|3380|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the North American continent. All of the islands have [[volcanic]] origins, although some, such as [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], have had no historical activity since the islands were settled. [[Mount Pico]], on the island of [[Pico Island|Pico]], is the highest point in Portugal, at {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in altitude. The Azores are actually the peaks of several of the tallest mountains on the planet, as measured from their base at the bottom of the ocean, breaking the surface of the Atlantic.

Because these once uninhabited and remote islands were settled sporadically over a span of two centuries, their culture, dialect, cuisine and traditions vary considerably from island to island. Farming and fishing are key industries that support the Azorean economy.

==History==
{{main|History of the Azores}}

===Exploration and rediscovery===
[[File:Azores old map.jpg|thumb|left|235px|1584 map of the Azores.]]
The discovery and settlement of the Azores archipelago, much like the islands of [[Madeira]], is one of the more controversial aspects of the Portuguese Age of Discovery. In addition to many theories, myths and stories written about the Azores there have been various Genovese and Catalan maps produced since 1351 that identified islands in the Atlantic.   Some chroniclers note that sailors knew of the islands, and visited them during return voyages from the [[Canary Islands]] (about 1340-1345), during the reign of King [[Afonso IV]]. In &quot;A History of the Azores&quot; by [[Thomas Ashe]] written in 1813&lt;ref name=&quot;History1813&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Ashe|title=History of the Azores, or. Western islands|year=1813|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author identified a [[Flemish people|Fleming]], Joshua Vander Berg of [[Bruges]], who made land in the archipelago during a storm on his way to [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History1813&quot; /&gt;  Ashe then claimed that the Portuguese explored the area and claimed it for Portugal shortly after.&lt;ref name=&quot;History1813&quot; /&gt;  Other stories note the discovery of the first islands ([[São Miguel Island]], [[Santa Maria Island]] and [[Terceira Island]]) were made by sailors in the service of [[Henry the Navigator|Infante D. Henrique]], although there are few written documents to support the claims.  Supporting the official history of the islands are latter day writings, based on oral tradition, that appeared in the first half of the 15th century.  Legends and myths also developed during pre-official history to include myths of about [[Prester John]], the &quot;Ilhas Afortunadas&quot; (the [[Fortunate Isles]]), the &quot;Ilhas Azuis&quot; (the Blue Islands), the &quot;Ilhas [[Cassiterides]]&quot; (the islands of Tin and Silver) or &quot;Ilhas de Sete Cidades&quot; (the islands of the Seven Cities), all noting the knowledge of undiscovered lands in the middle of the Atlantic.

Officially, the first islands were &quot;discovered&quot; in the 15th century (in 1431) by [[Gonçalo Velho|Gonçalo Velho Cabral]] a Captain in the service of [[Henry the Navigator|Infante D. Henrique]], though credit is also given to the explorer [[Diogo de Silves]] (in 1427).

Although it is commonly said that the archipelago received its name for the [[Northern Goshawk|goshawk]] ({{lang|pt|''Açor''}} in Portuguese) due to its being a common bird at the time of discovery, it is unlikely that the bird nested or hunted in the islands.  Some people, however, insist that the name is derived from birds, pointing to a local subspecies of the [[common buzzard|buzzard]] ({{lang|pt|''Buteo buteo''}}) as the animal the first explorers erroneously identified as goshawks. The name may also derive from the word ''azor'', meaning ''blue'' in [[vernacular]] [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and used by those sailors who identified the islands by their blue color as they appeared in the distance by sea. The proper word for ''blue'' in Portuguese is ''azul''.

===Settlement===
[[File:Cidade de Angra do Heroísmo, ilha Terceira, Açores.jpg|235px|thumb|left|[[Angra do Heroísmo]], the oldest continuously-settled town in the archipelago of the Azores and UNESCO World Heritage Site]]
At some point, following the discovery of Santa Maria, sheep were let loose on the island before settlement actually took place. This was done to supply the future settlers with food because there were no large animals on the island. Settlement did not take place right away, however. There was not much interest among the Portuguese people in an isolated archipelago hundreds of miles from civilization. But patiently Cabral gathered resources and settlers for the next three years (1433–1436) and sailed to establish colonies on Santa Maria first and then later on São Miguel.

Brush had to be cleared and rocks removed for the planting of crops;[[Grain]], [[grape]] vines, [[sugar cane]], and other plants suitable for settler use and of commercial value, were planted. Domesticated animals were brought, such as [[chicken]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goats]], and [[Domestic pig|hogs]]. Houses were built and villages established.

The islands were settled by a mixed group of people from the Portuguese provinces of [[Algarve]] and [[Minho Province|Minho]]. Also, Madeirans, Moorish prisoners, enslaved Africans, French, Italians, Scots, English, Germans and [[Flemings]] were among the early settlers. There were petty criminals, Spanish clergy, Sephardic Jews, soldiers, government officials, European merchants and sugar cane growers.

São Miguel was first settled in 1444, the settlers — mainly from the [[Estremadura Province (historical)|Estremadura]], Alto Alentejo and Algarve areas of Portugal, under the command of  ''Gonçalo Velho Cabral'' — landing at the site of modern-day [[Povoação]]. In 1522 [[Vila Franca do Campo]], then the capital of the island, was devastated by a landslide caused by an earthquake which killed about 5,000 people, and the capital was moved to [[Ponta Delgada]]. The town of Vila Franca was rebuilt on the original site and today is a thriving fishing and yachting port.  Ponta Delgada received its city status in 1546.  Since the first settlement the pioneers applied themselves to the area of agriculture. By the 15th century Graciosa exported wheat, barley, wine and brandy. The goods were sent to Terceira largely due to the proximity of the island.

During the 18th and 19th century, Graciosa was host to many prominent figures, including [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], the French writer who passed through upon his escape to America during the French revolution; [[Almeida Garrett]], the Portuguese poet who visited an uncle and wrote some poetry while there; and [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert of Monaco]], the 19th century oceanographer who led several expeditions in the waters of the Azores. He arrived on his yacht &quot;Hirondelle&quot;, and visited the &quot;furna da caldeira&quot;, the noted hot springs grotto.

The first reference to the island of São Jorge was made in 1439 but the actual date of discovery is unknown. In 1443 the island was already inhabited but active settlement only began with the arrival of the noble Flemish native ''Wilhelm Van der Haegen''. Arriving at [[Topo (Azores)|Topo]], where he lived and died, he became known as ''Guilherme da Silveira'' to the islanders. [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] received the captaincy of the island in 1483. [[Velas]] became a town before the end of the 15th century. By 1490, there were 2,000 Flemings living in the islands of Terceira, Pico, Faial, São Jorge and Flores. Because there was such a large Flemish settlement, the Azores became known as the Flemish Islands or the Isles of Flanders. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was responsible for this settlement. His sister, [[Infanta Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabel]], was married to [[Philip the Good|Duke Philip of Burgundy]] of which Flanders was a part. There was a revolt against Philip's rule and disease and hunger became rampant. Isabel appealed to Henry to allow some of the unruly Flemings to settle in the Azores. He granted this and supplied them with the necessary transportation and goods.

The [[Human settlement|settlement]] of the then-unoccupied islands started in 1439 with people mainly from the continental provinces of Algarve and [[Alentejo]]. In 1583, [[Philip II of Spain]], as [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]], sent his fleet to clear the Azores of a combined multinational force of adventurers, mercenaries, volunteers and soldiers who were attempting to establish the Azores as a staging post for a rival [[pretender]] to the Portuguese throne. Following the success of his fleet at the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada]], the captured enemies were hanged from yardarms, as they were considered pirates by Philip II. (This was added to the &quot;[[Black Legend]]&quot; by his enemies.) An English expedition against the Azores in 1597, the [[Islands Voyage]], also failed.  Spain held the Azores in what is called The Babylonian captivity of 1580-1642. Into the late 16th century, the Azores as well as [[Madeira]] began to face problems of overpopulation. Spawning from that particular economic problem, some of the people began to emigrate to [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ImperialAge1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=G.V|last=Scammell|title=The First Imperial Age|year=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iberian Union===
The Azores were the last part of the [[Portuguese Empire]] to resist Philip's reign over Portugal ([[Macau]] resisted any official recognition) and were returned to Portuguese control with the end of the [[Iberian Union]] in 1640, not by the professional military, who were used in the [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]] in the mainland, but by local people attacking a fortified [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] garrison.

===Liberal Wars===
{{main|Portuguese Civil War}}
The [[Liberal Wars|Portuguese Civil War]] (1828–1834) had strong repercussions in the Azores. In 1829, in [[Praia da Vitoria]], the [[Liberalism|Liberals]] won over the [[Political absolutism|absolutists]], making [[Terceira Island]] the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency ({{lang|pt|''Conselho de Regência''}}) of [[Maria II of Portugal]] was established.

Beginning in 1868, [[Portugal]] issued its stamps overprinted with &quot;{{lang|pt|AÇORES}}&quot; for use in the islands. Between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.

From 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three '''districts''', equivalent (except in area) to those in the [[Administrative divisions of Portugal#Districts|Portuguese mainland]]. The division was arbitrary, and did not follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (none of which were on the western group).

*'''Angra do Heroísmo''' consisted of Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa, with the capital at [[Angra do Heroísmo]] on Terceira.
*'''Horta''' consisted of Pico, Faial, Flores, and Corvo, with the capital at [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.
*'''Ponta Delgada''' consisted of São Miguel and Santa Maria, with the capital at [[Ponta Delgada]] on São Miguel.

===Defence===
In 1943, during [[World War II]], Portuguese dictator [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] leased bases in the Azores to the British, despite his previous collaboration with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_neutrality_europe.asp |title=The Role of Portugal -co-opting Nazi Gold, Jonathan Petropoulos, &quot;Dimensions&quot;, Vol 11, No 1, 1997 |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of these facilities in October 1943 was codenamed [[Operation Alacrity]] by the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Bromet.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This was a key turning point in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939-1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]], allowing the Allies to provide aerial coverage in the [[Mid-Atlantic gap]]; helping them to hunt [[U-boat]]s and protect convoys.

In 1944, [[Military of the United States|American forces]] constructed a small and short-lived air base on the island of Santa Maria. In 1945, a new base was constructed on the island of [[Terceira]] and is currently known as [[Lajes Field]]. This base is in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island. This [[Air Force Base|Air Force base]] is a joint American and Portuguese venture. Lajes Field continues to support United States and [[Portuguese Armed Forces|Portuguese military]] operations. During the [[Cold War]], [[United States Navy|the United States Navy]] [[P-3 Orion]] anti-submarine squadrons patrolled the North Atlantic for Soviet submarines and surface spy vessels. Since its inception, Lajes Field has been used for refuelling aircraft bound for Europe, and more recently, the Middle East. [[United States Navy|The United States Navy]] operates a small fleet of military ships in the harbour of [[Praia da Vitória]], three kilometres (2&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of Lajes Field. The airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from other islands in the archipelago, Europe, and North America.

In 1976, the Azores became the Autonomous Region of the Azores ({{lang|pt|''Região Autónoma dos Açores''}}), one of the [[Autonomous regions of Portugal]], and the Azorean districts were suppressed.

===International affairs===
In 2003, the Azores saw international attention when United States President [[George W. Bush]], British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Spanish Prime Minister [[José María Aznar]] and the Portuguese Prime Minister [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]] held a summit there days before the commencement of the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/16/sprj.irq.main/index.html CNN.com - Bush speaking in the Azores, March 17, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Azores-map.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Azores]]

===Physical geography===
The [[archipelago]] of the Azores is located in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the  [[Atlantic Ocean]]  and extends along a west-northwest to east-southeast orientation (between  36.5º-40º North [[latitudes]] and 24.5º-31.5º West [[longitudes]]) in an area approximately 600&amp;nbsp;km wide. The islands of the Azores emerged from what is called the Azores Platform, a 5.8 million km² region that is morphologically accented by a depth of 2000 meters.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, et.al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Machado, et.al., 2008, p.14&quot;&gt;Machado, et.al., 2008, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

From a geostructural perspective the Azores is located above an active [[triple junction]] between three of the world's large tectonic plates (the [[North American Plate]], the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[African Plate]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Machado, et.al., 2008, p.14&quot;/&gt; a condition that has translated into the existence of many faults and fractures in this region of the Atlantic .&lt;ref&gt;Lúis, 1994, p.439-440&lt;/ref&gt; The westernmost islands of the archipelago ([[Corvo Island|Corvo]] and [[Flores Island|Flores]]) are located in the North American Plate, while the remaining islands are located within the boundary that divides the Eurasian and African Plates.

[[File:Sete cidades twin lakes.JPG|235px|left|thumb|Volcanic crater lake, Lagoa das Sete Cidades, on the island of São Miguel]]

The principal tectonic structures that exist in the region of the Azores are the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], the [[Terceira Rift]], the Azores Fracture Zone and the Glória Fault.&lt;ref name=&quot;Machado, et.al., 2008, p.14&quot;/&gt; The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the main frontier between the American Plate and the African-Eurasian Plates that crosses the Azores Platform between the islands of [[Flores Island|Flores]] and [[Faial Island|Faial]] from north to south then to the southwest; it is an extensive form crossed by many transform faults running perpendicular to its north-south orientation, that is seismically active and susceptible to volcanism.  The Terceira Rift is a system of fractures that extends from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the Glória Fault that represents the main frontier between the Eurasian and African Plates.  It is defined by a line of submarine volcanoes and island mounts that extend northwest to southeast for about 550&amp;nbsp;km, from the area west of [[Graciosa]] until the islets of the [[Formigas]], that includes the islands of Graciosa, Terceira and São Miguel. Its northwest limit connects to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the southeast section intersects the Gloria Fault southeast of the island of [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]]. The Azores Fracture Zone is that extends from the Glória Fault and encompasses a relatively inactive area to the south of the islands of the Central and Eastern groups north to the Terceira Rift,  along a 45º angle. The Glória Fault, for its part, extends 800&amp;nbsp;km along a linear line from the Azores to the [[Azores-Gibraltar Transform Fault]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeira, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The island's volcanism is associated with the rifting along the [[Azores Triple Junction]]; the spread of the crust along the existing faults and fractures has produced many of the active volcanic and seismic events,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferreira, 2005, p.4&quot;&gt;Ferreira, 2005, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; while supported by buoyant upwelling in the deeper mantle, some associate with an [[Azores hotspot]].&lt;ref&gt;Ting Yang, et.al., 2006, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the volcanic activity has centered, primarily, along the Terceira Rift.  From the beginning of the island's settlement, around the 15th Century, there have been 28 registered volcanic eruptions (15 terrestrial and 13 submarine).  The last significant volcanic eruption, the  [[Capelinhos]] volcano ({{lang|pt|''Vulcão dos Capelinhos''}}), occurred off the coast of the island of Faial (in 1957); the most recent volcanic activity occurred in the seamounts and submarine volcanoes off the coast of [[Serreta (Azores)|Serreta]] and in the Pico-Jão Jorge Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvarg.azores.gov.pt/Cvarg/CentroVulcanologia/geologiaacores/GA+-+Vulcanismo+Historico.htm|title=Erupções vulcânicas históricas|trans_title=Historical Volcanic Eruptions|publisher= Centro de Vulcanologia e Avaliação de Riscos Geológicos (CVARG) |year=2010|accessdate= April 15, 2010}}; Evidence for the submarine eruptions off the coasts of [[Velas]], [[São Jorge Island]] and Cachorro, [[Santa Luzia]], [[Pico Island]] included primarily from inferences and eyewitness testimonies about sulfuric gases and vapors released from the waters along the coast (February 15–24, 1964 and December 15, 1963, respectively)&lt;/ref&gt; The islands have many examples of volcano-built geomorphology, including: many of the caves and subterranean lava tubes (such as the [[Gruta das Torres]], [[Algar do Carvão]], [[Gruta do Natal]], Gruta das Cinco Ribeiras), the coastal lava fields (like the coast of [[Feteiras]], [[Faial]], the Mistério of [[Prainha (São Roque do Pico)|Prainha]] or São João  on [[Pico Island]]) in addition to the currently inactive cones in central [[São Miguel Island]], the aforementioned Capelinhos  on Faial,  the volcanic complexes of [[Terceira]]  or [[Plinian]] caldeira of [[Corvo Island]].

The islands of the archipelago were formed through volcanic and seismic activity during the late [[Tertiary]] geological period; the first embryonic surfaces started to appear in the waters of Santa Maria during the [[Miocene epoch]] (from circa 8 million years ago). The sequence of the island formation has been generally characterized as: Santa Maria (8.12 Ma), São Miguel (4.1 Ma), Terceira (3.52 Ma), Graciosa (2.5 Ma), Flores (2.16 Ma), Faial (0.7 Ma), São Jorge (0.55 Ma), Corvo (0.7 Ma) and the youngest, Pico (0.27 Ma).&lt;ref name=&quot;Carine, 2010, p.78&quot;&gt;Carine, 2010, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Although all islands have experienced volcanism during their geological history, within recorded &quot;human settlement&quot; history the islands of Santa Maria, Flores, Corvo and Graciosa have not experienced any volcanic eruptions; in addition to active fumaroles and hot-springs, the remaining islands have had sporadic eruptions since the 14th Century. Apart from the [[Capelinhos]] volcano in 1957-58, the last recorded instance of &quot;island formation&quot; occurred off the coast of São Miguel, when the island of [[Sabrina Island (Azores)|Sabrina]] was briefly formed.

Owing to its geodynamic environment, the region has been center of intense seismic activity, particularly along its tectonic boundaries on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Terceira Rift.  Seismic events although frequent, usually tectonic or vulco-tectonic in nature, but in general low to medium intensities, occasionally punctuated by events of level 5 or greater on the [[Richter scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, 2005, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvarg.azores.gov.pt/Cvarg/CentroVulcanologia/geologiaacores/VA+-+Sismicidade+instrumental.htm|title=Actividade Sísmica|trans_title=Seismic Activity|year=2010|accessdate=15 April 2010|language=Portuguese|publisher=CVARG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe earthquake was registered in 1757, near [[Calheta (Azores)|Calheta]] on the island of [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]], which exceeded 7 on the [[Richter scale]]. In comparison, the 1522 earthquake, mentioned by [[Gaspar Frutuoso]] the historian, was only a magnitude 6.8, but a level 10 on the [[Mercalli scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, 2005, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; but responsible for the destruction of [[Vila Franca do Campo]] and landslides that may have killed less than 5000 of the inhabitants.

The nine islands that comprise the archipelago occupy a surface area of {{convert|2346|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, that includes both the main islands and many islets located in their vicinities. Each of the islands have their own distinct geomorphological characteristics that make them unique:  [[Corvo Island|Corvo]] (the smallest island) is a crater of a major [[Plinian]] eruption; [[Flores Island|Flores]] (its neighbor on the [[North American Plate]]) is a rugged island carved by many valleys and escarpments; [[Faial Island|Faial]] characterized for its [[volcano#Shield volcanoes|shield volcano]] and caldera ([[Cabeço Gordo]]); [[Pico Island|Pico]], is the highest point, at  {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|spell=us}}, in the Azores and continental Portugal; [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]] is known for its active Furnas do Enxofre and mixture of volcanic cones and plains; [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]] is a long slender island, formed from [[fissural eruptions]] over thousands of years; [[Terceira]], almost circular, is the location of one of the largest craters in the region; [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] is the largest island, and is pitted with many large craters and fields of spatter cones; and [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], the oldest island, is heavily eroded, being one of the few places to encounter brown sandy beaches in the archipelago. They range in surface area from  the largest, São Miguel, at {{convert|759|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|}}  to the smallest, Corvo, at approximately {{convert|17|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|}}.

These islands have naturally evolved into three recognizable groups located within the Azores Platform; they are:
* The Eastern Group ({{lang|pt|''Grupo Oriental''}}) of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]] and [[Formigas Islets]]
* The Central Group ({{lang|pt|''Grupo Central''}}) of [[Terceira Island|Terceira]], [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]], [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]], [[Pico Island|Pico]] and [[Faial Island|Faial]]
* The Western Group ({{lang|pt|''Grupo Ocidental''}}) of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] and [[Corvo Island|Corvo]].
In addition, several sub-surface reefs (particularly the [[Dollabarat]] on the fringe of the Formigas), banks (specifically the [[Princess Alice Bank]] and [[Dom João de Castro Bank|D. João de Castro Bank]], as well as many  [[Hydrothermal vents and seamounts of the Azores|hydrothermal vents and sea-mounts]] are monitored by the regional authorities, owing to the complex geotectonic and socio-economic significance within the economic exclusion zone of the archipelago.

===Biome===
The archipelago lies in the [[Palearctic ecozone]], forming a unique [[biome]] that includes the [[macaronesian]] [[subtropical]] [[laurissilva]], with many [[endemic species]] of plants. Even though the Azores look very green and sometimes wild, the vegetation has been extremely altered. Approximately 95% of [[laurisilva]] has been wiped out in the past 600 years for its valuable wood (for tools, buildings, boats, [[Wood fuel|fire wood]], and so on.) and to clear land for agriculture. As a result, it is estimated that more than half of insects on the islands have gone or will go extinct.&lt;ref name=Kostas2010&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06203.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultivated places (which are traditionally dedicated to pasture or to growing [[colocasia]], [[potato]]es, [[maize]] and other crops) have now been abandoned, especially as a result of emigration. Consequently, some [[Invasive species|invasive]] plants have filled these deserted and disturbed lands. The two most common of these alien species are ''[[Pittosporum undulatum]]'' and ''[[Acacia melanoxylon]]''. They are usually restricted to ancient agricultural land and only rarely penetrate into undisturbed native vegetation. The main loss is in the lowlands (below 400 metres), where virtually all laurisilva was eradicated.

A few ''[[Persea indica]]'' and ''[[Picconia azorica]]'' still survive in some places, but appear to be extremely vulnerable. Only ''[[Myrica faya]]'' seems to have survived human impact quite well, and it is commonly found in hedges or among exotic trees. More recent introductions could become a serious threat, like ''[[Leptospermum scoparium]]'' which has the ability to colonize the still nearly untouched medium-altitude vegetation (''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Myrsine]] africana'', ''[[Erica]]'', and so on.).

[[Hydrangea]]s are another potential pest, but their threat is less serious. Notwithstanding the fact that Hydrangeas were introduced from America or Asia, some locals consider them to be  a symbol of the archipelago and propagate them along roadsides, helping them to escape into the wild. ''[[Cryptomeria]]'', the Japanese cedar, is a [[conifer]] extensively grown for its timber; many seedlings can be found in the last remnants of medium-altitude native vegetation.

The Azores has two [[endemism|endemic]] bird species. The [[Azores Bullfinch]], or ''Priolo'', is restricted to remnant laurisilva forest in the mountains at the eastern end of São Miguel, and is classified by BirdLife International as [[endangered]]. [[Monteiro's Storm-petrel]], described to science as recently as 2008, is known to breed in just two locations in the islands, but may occur more widely. The Azores also has an endemic [[bat]], the [[Azores Noctule]], which is unusual in regularly feeding during the day.

The islets of the [[Formigas]] (the Portuguese word for &quot;[[ant]]s&quot;), including the area known as the [[Dollabarat]] Reef, has a rich environment of maritime species, such as [[black coral]] and [[manta ray]]s, sharks, and [[sea turtle]]s. On São Miguel there are notable micro-habitats formed by hot springs that host extremophile microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=C. Michael|last=Hogan|date=10 December 2010|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Extremophile?topic=49540|contribution=Extremophile|editor-first=Emily|editor-last=Monosson|editor2-first=Cutler J.|editor2-last=Cleveland|title=Encyclopedia of Earth|publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment|location=Washington D.C.|accessdate=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The [[archipelago]] is spread out in the area between 37° N and the [[Circle of latitude|parallels of latitude]] that pass through the [[Lisbon#Climate|Lisbon]] area (38° 43'&amp;nbsp;/ 38° 55' N), giving it generally a tepid, oceanic, subtropical climate, with mild annual oscillations. Daily maximum temperatures usually range between {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The average annual rainfall increases from east to west, and it ranges from 700 to 1600 annual millimetres (27.6–63&amp;nbsp;in) on average, reaching {{convert|6300|mm|in|-1}} on [[Mount Pico]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate of the Azores islands&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azoresweather.com |title=Climate of the Azores islands |publisher=Azores Weather |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest Portuguese mountain at {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The [[Azores high]], an area of high [[atmospheric pressure]], is named after the islands.

The Azores are divided into 19 municipalities ({{lang|pt|''concelhos''}}); each municipality is further divided into parishes ({{lang|pt|''freguesias''}}), of which there is a [[List of parishes of Portugal|total of 156]] in all of the Azores.  The municipalities, by island, are:

There are five cities ('''''Portuguese''''': ''cidades'') in the Azores:  [[Ponta Delgada]] and [[Ribeira Grande, São Miguel|Ribeira Grande]] on the island of São Miguel; [[Angra do Heroísmo]] and [[Praia da Vitória]] on the island of Terceira, and [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial. Three of these [[Ponta Delgada]], [[Angra (Azores)|Angra]] and [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] are considered [[Capital (political)|capital/administrative cities]] to the regional government: homes to the President (Ponta Delgada), the Judiciary (Angra) and the Regional Assembly (Horta). Angra also serves as the ecclesiastical centre of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Angra]].

====Population====
On 31 December 2002, the Azores' population was 238,767 at a density of {{convert|106|PD/km2}}.

The Azores were uninhabited when Portuguese navigators arrived in the early 15th century; the settlement process was initiated in 1439 with individuals from various regions of mainland Portugal and from Madeira island. Today, the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Azores are an admixture of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], descendants of 15th century immigrants from [[Algarve]], [[Alentejo]] and from [[Minho (province)|Minho]], as well as [[Sephardic Jews]],  [[Moorish]] prisoners, [[Flemish people|Flemish]], French, Spaniards, and other populations who contributed to the successive settlement process of the islands. The nature of the economy dictated that [[Atlantic slave trade|African slavery]] never became common in the Azores because they were sent to Brazil and the Caribbean, only a few remained in the Azores to help with domestic chores, although the islands sometimes served as a waypoint for ships carrying [[History of slavery|African slaves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Colonialism: An International, Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=azores+slavery| title=Colonialism: An International, Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia|author= Melvin Eugene Page and Penny M. Sonnenburg|accessdate=2008-12-16 | isbn=9781576073353 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Genetics=====
Genetic studies (Pacheco et al., 2005; Branco et al., 2006; Branco et al., 2008a, 2008b, 2008c) report high genetic variability and heterogeneity in the Azorean population, as compared with mainland Portugal and other European populations. This high genetic variability may be explained by the history of the settlement of the islands, as well as genetic contributions that occurred during the expansion of trade navigation between Europe, America, and Asia in the 16th and 17th centuries. As in [[continental Portugal]], the most frequent [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mtDNA haplogroup]] in the Azores is [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]] (45.2%). After R, Haplogroup J is the second most frequent Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup in the Azores. Y-chromosome [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]], found in greatest concentration in Southwest Asia, is thought to have originated in the [[Middle East]]. Data show that in the Azores this haplogroup is the second most common, with a frequency of 13.4%, twice as high as in mainland Portugal(6.8%; Rosser et al. 2000). The other non-European haplogroups, N3 and E3a, which are prevalent in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, respectively, have been found in the Azores (0.6% and 1.2%, respectively) but not in mainland Portugal.

====Diaspora====
Since the 17th century, many Azoreans have emigrated, mainly to [[Brazil]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/azores.html |title=Azores Islands |publisher=Library.csustan.edu |date=1997-01-17.|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rhode Island]] and Southeastern Massachusetts, especially the cities of [[New Bedford]], Bristol, Barrington, Pawtucket, Central Falls, West Warwick, Hudson, River Point, and [[Fall River]] have been, and continue to be the primary destination for Azorean emigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By: Lurdes C. da Silva 08/22/2008 |url=http://www.ojornal.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20087125&amp;BRD=2677&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=543384&amp;rfi=6 |title=Mass.- Azores links inked |publisher=O Jornal |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2009-05-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern California was the final destination for many of the Massachusetts immigrants who then moved on to the [[San Joaquin Valley]], especially the city of [[Turlock, California|Turlock]], just south of Modesto. In 1919, there were approximately 300,000 people in the Azores while there were 100,000 Azoreans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwlibrary.csustan.edu/bsantos/migrat.html &quot;Azorean Migration&quot;]. Library.csustan.edu. 1997-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961 to 1977, about 150,000 Azoreans immigrated to
the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwlibrary.csustan.edu/bsantos/immigr.html &quot;Azorean Immigration into the United States&quot;]. Library.csustan.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; There were an estimated 83,000 Azoreans in California in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;diaspora&quot;/&gt;

Many Azoreans also moved to [[Bermuda]] and pre-U.S. [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diaspora&quot;/&gt; [[Florianópolis]] and [[Porto Alegre]] in the [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern Region]] of Brazil were founded by Azoreans, who accounted for over half of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]'s population in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/7tipos/acores.html Imigrantes: Açorianos]&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1870-4 some 46,000 Portuguese emigrated to Brazil and a large proportion were from the Azores.&lt;ref name=&quot;diaspora&quot;&gt;Russell King, John Connell (1999). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=8asL17kRGToC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Small worlds, global lives: islands and migration]''&quot;.

==Politics==
{{Main|Political status of the Autonomous Region of the Azores}}
Politically, since 1976, the Azores is an autonomous region integrated within the framework of the Portuguese Republic.  It has its own government and autonomous legislature within its own political-administrative statute and organic law. Its governmental organs include: the Legislative Assembly, a [[unicameral]] parliament composed of 52 elected deputies, elected by universal [[suffrage]] for a four-year term; the Regional Government and Presidency, with parliamentary legitimacy, composed of a President, a Vice-President and seven Regional Secretaries responsible for day-to-day operations. It is represented in the Council of Ministers by a representative appointed by the President of the Republic, which was created during the revision of the constitution of 2004 (which, among other things, removed the older Portuguese representative that was appointed by the President of the Republic, beholden to the Council of State and coincident with the President).

Since becoming a Portuguese autonomous region, the executive branch of the regional authority has been located in [[Ponta Delgada]], the legislative branch in [[Horta]], and the judicial branch in [[Angra do Heroísmo]].

The islands of the archipelago do not have independent status in law, except in electoral law and are governed by 19 municipalities that subdivide the islands. In addition, until the administrative reform of the 19th Century, the following civil parishes had municipal standing: Topo (today integrated into the municipality of [[Calheta]], São Jorge); [[São Mateus|Praia]] da Graciosa (today integrated into municipality of [[Santa Cruz da Graciosa]]); [[São Sebastião]] (today an integral part of the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo); Capelas (now part of the municipality of Ponta Delgada); and Água de Pau (now a civil parish in the municipality of Lagoa).  These civil parishes still retain their titles of &quot;vila&quot; in name only, by Regional Legislative Decree n.º 29/2003/A, June 24, 2003; the populations of Capelas and neighbouring parish still protest the change and promote the restoration of their status. The municipalities are also subdivided into several civil parishes, with the exception of [[Corvo (Azores)|Corvo]] (the only municipality by law without a civil parish, owing to its size).

Azorean politics are dominated by the two largest Portuguese political parties, the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]] and the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party (PS)]], the latter holding a majority in the Regional Legislative Assembly. The [[Democratic and Social Center / People's Party]] (CDS/PP), the [[Left Bloc]] (BE), the  [[Unitarian Democratic Coalition]] (CDU) and the [[People's Monarchist Party (Portugal)|People's Monarchist Party]] (PPM) are also represented in the local parliament. Currently, as of the 2008 Regional Elections, the Socialist Party (PS) and its leader, [[Carlos César]] have a plurality of the seats in the Assembly, and operate the Regional Government. Although the PS dominates the regional politics, the PSD is traditionally popular in city and [[town council]] elections.

==Transport==
===Aviation===
Each of the nine islands has an airfield,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flugplaetze.org/PT/ |title=Flughäfen in Portugal (PT) |publisher=Flugplaetze.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the majority are [[aerodromes]] rather than airports.  The commercial terminals in Ponta Delgada, Horta, Vila do Porto and Santa Cruz das Flores are operated by [[ANA - Aeroportos de Portugal]], a public entity that oversees the operations of airports across Portugal.  The remaining, except for [[Lajes Field]],  are operated by the Regional Government.  Lajes, is a military airbase, as well as commercial aerodrome, and is operated by the Portuguese Armed Forces in conjunction with the [[United States]]

===Water transport===
The Azores has had a long history of water transport to overcome distances and establish inter-community contacts and trade. Consequently, the shipbuilding industry developed in many islands, from small fishing boats, to whaling sloops to larger passenger services.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticoline.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=60&amp;lang=en|title=History|location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal|publisher=Atlânticoline|accessdate=14 March 2011|year=2009|language=Porutguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger traffic to the main islands (São Miguel, Santa Maria, Terceira and Faial) began in the 17th century, and between the 18th-19th century, the ''Pico Yacht'' controlled the lucrative summer traffic season.&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt;

After 1871, the '''Insulana Shipping Company''' was the only entity responsible for regular traffic between the islands (except Corvo), Madeira and the United States.&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt; But, cargo and passenger transportation ceased in the 1970s, and the ships sold or converted into tuna fishing boats. For the next 20 years, commercial maritime service between the islands (except between Faial-Pico and Lajes das Flores-Vila do Corvo) ceased.&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt;

Transmaçor (Transportes Marítimos Açorianos, Lda.) was founded on 22 December 1987, resulting from the fusion of ''Empresa das Lanchas do Pico, Ld'', owners of the ships ''Espalamaca'' and ''Calheta'' (ships that had travelled the canal between Faial and Pico for several years); ''Empresa Açoreana de Transportes Marítimos, Lda'', which operated the ship ''Terra Alta''; and ''Transcanal (Transportes Marítimos do Canal, Lda.)'' operator the traditional boats ''Picaroto'' and ''Manuel José''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transmacor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Transmaçor - Transportes Marítimos Açorianos, Ldª.|editor=Transmaçor|location=Horta (Azores), Portugal|publisher=Transportes Marítimos Açorianos, Lda.|language=Portguese|year=2010|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The societies and companies comprise 80% of the capital, with the remaining shares owned by the Azores Regional Government.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Central Group, the shipping company operates four to six time daily connections between Horta and Madalena throughout the year, using its small fleet of ships (''Cruzeiro das Ilhas'', ''Cruzeiro do Canal'', ''Expresso das Ilhas'' and ''Expresso do Triângulo''), in addition to inter-island connections between Faial, Pico, São Jorge and Terceira during the summer months.&lt;ref name=Transmacor/&gt;

Meanwhile, new initiatives began in the late 1990s: the catamaran ''Iapetos'' began services, followed by ''Lady of Mann'' and ''Golfinho Azul'' (chartered by Açorline).&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt; In 2005, '''Atlanticoline''' was established, providing services with the ships ''Ilha Azul'' and ''Express Santorini'', later adding the ''Viking'' in 2009.&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt;

==Culture==
Azoreans have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits, from a combination of continental Portuguese customs brought by various waves of immigration and local political and environmental factors.

Religious festivals, patron saints and traditional holidays mark the Azorean calender. The most important religious events are tied with the festivals associated with the [[Cult of the Holy Spirit]], commonly referred to as the festivals of the Holy Spirit (or Espírito Santo), rooted in millenarian dogma, and held on all islands from May to September. These festivals are very important to the Azorean people, who are primarily [[Roman Catholic]], which combine profane religious rituals and processions celebrating the benevolence and egalitarianism of neighbours. These events are centred around ''treatros'' or ''impérios'', small buildings that host the meals, adoration and charity of the participants, and used to store the artefacts associated with the events. On Terceira, for example, these impérios have grown into ornate buildings painted and cared for by the local brotherhoods in their respective parishes. The events are normally closed to the public (confined to the members of the parish brotherhoods), although some limited events have been organized by the tourist-friendly populous, including the a public event held by the city government in Ponta Delgada, on the island of São Miguel, which attracts visitors and locals.  

Another event, the Festival of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres ({{lang-en|Lord Holy Christ of Miracles}}) in Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel is the largest individual religious event in the Azores, and which takes place on the fifth Sunday after Easter. Pilgrims from within the Portuguese diaspora normally travel to Ponta Delgada to participate in an afternoon procession behind the image of Christ along the flower-decorated streets of the city. Although the solemn procession is only held on one day, the events of the Festival of Senhor Santo Cristo occur within a period of a week, and involve a ritual of moving the image between the main church and convent nightly, ultimately culminating in the procession, which is televised within the Azores and to the Portuguese diaspora. 
The Sanjoaninas Festivities in Angra do Heroísmo in Terceira are held in June honoring S. Antonio, S. Pedro and St. João, in a large religious celebration. 

The festival of Nossa Senhora de Lourdes, ([[Our Lady of Lourdes]]), [[patron saint]] to the whalers, begins in Lajes on Pico on the last Sunday the August and runs through the week—Whalers Week. It is marked by social and cultural events connected to the tradition of [[Whaling|whale hunting]]. The Festa das Vindimas, (Wine [[Harvest festival|Harvest Festival]]), takes place during the first week of September and is a century old custom ways by the people of Pico.

In Corvo the people celebrate their patron saint Nossa Senhora dos Milagres, (Our Lady of Miracles), on August 15 every year in addition to the festivals of the Divine Holy Spirit. The Festival da Maré de Agosto (August Sea Festival), takes place every year beginning on 15 August in Praia Formosa on Santa Maria. And, the Semana do Mar (Sea Week), dedicated almost exclusively to [[Watersport|water sports]], takes place in August in the city of Horta, on Faial.

[[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also celebrated in the Azores. Parades and pageants are the heart of the Carnaval festivities. There is lively music, colorful costumes, hand-made masks, and floats.
The traditional bullfights in the bullring are ongoing, as is the running of bulls in the streets.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2008}}
The '''Outback''' is the vast, remote, arid area of [[Australia]], although the term colloquially can refer to any lands outside the main [[urban area]]s. The term &quot;the outback&quot; is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas named &quot;[[the bush]]&quot;.

==Overview==
The outback is home to a diverse set of animal species, such as the [[kangaroo]], [[emu]] and [[dingo]]. The [[Dingo Fence]] was built to restrict dingo movements into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent. The marginally fertile parts are primarily utilised as [[rangeland]]s and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle grazing, on [[cattle station]]s which are [[pastoral lease|leased]] from the Federal Government. While small areas of the outback consist of [[Vertisol|clay soils]] the majority has exceedingly infertile [[palaeosol]]s. [[Riversleigh]], in Queensland, is one of Australia's most renowned fossil sites and was recorded as a [[World Heritage]] site in 1994. The {{convert|100|km²|0|abbr=on}} area contains fossil remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] age.

==History==
{{main|European exploration of Australia}}
Early European exploration of inland Australia was sporadic. More focus was on the more accessible and fertile coastal areas. The first party to successfully cross the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] just outside Sydney was led by [[Gregory Blaxland]] in 1813, 25 years after the colony was established. People starting with [[John Oxley]] in 1817, 1818 and 1821, followed by [[Charles Sturt]] in 1829–1830 attempted to follow the westward-flowing rivers to find an &quot;inland sea&quot;, but these were found to all flow into the [[Murray River]] and [[Darling River]] which turn south.

Over the period 1858 to 1861, [[John McDouall Stuart]] led six expeditions north from Adelaide into the outback, culminating in successfully reaching the north coast of Australia and returning, without the loss of any of the party's members' lives. This contrasts with the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]] in 1860–61 which was much better funded, but resulted in the deaths of three of the four members of the transcontinental party.

The [[Overland Telegraph]] line was constructed in the 1870s along the route identified by Stuart, who had found enough water to support the needed repeater stations.

Exploration of the outback continued in the 1950s when [[Len Beadell]] explored, surveyed and built many roads in support of the nuclear weapons tests at [[Emu Field]] and [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]] and rocket testing on the [[Woomera Prohibited Area]]. Mineral exploration continues as new mineral deposits are identified and developed.

While the early explorers used horses to cross the outback, the first woman to make the journey riding a horse was [[Anna Hingley]], who rode from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] to [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article685404.ece First woman conquers Outback]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining==
Other than agriculture and tourism, the main economic activity in this vast and sparsely settled area is mining. Owing to the complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the [[Permian]] (in many areas since the [[Cambrian]]) ages, the outback is extremely rich in iron, aluminium, [[manganese]] and uranium ores, and also contains major deposits of gold, nickel, iron, lead and zinc ores. Because of its size, the value of grazing and mining is considerable. Major mines and mining areas in the outback include opals at [[Coober Pedy, South Australia|Coober Pedy]], [[Lightning Ridge, New South Wales|Lightning Ridge]] and [[White Cliffs, New South Wales|White Cliffs]], metals at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]], [[Tennant Creek, Northern Territory|Tennant Creek]], [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Olympic Dam]] and the remote [[Challenger Mine]]. Oil and gas are extracted in the [[Cooper Basin]] around [[Moomba, South Australia|Moomba]].

In Western Australia the [[Argyle diamond mine]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)]] is the world's biggest producer of natural diamonds and contributes approximately one-third of the world's natural supply. The [[Pilbara]] region's economy is dominated by mining and petroleum industries.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pilbara's oil and gas industry is the region's largest export industry earning $5.0 billion in 2004/05 accounting for over 96% of the State's production.'' source – [http://www.pdc.wa.gov.au/industry/types-of-industries/oil-and-gas.aspx WA.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Australia's [[iron ore]] is also mined in the Pilbara and it also has one of the world's major [[manganese]] mines, Woodie Woodie.

== Population ==
Owing to the low and erratic rainfall over most of the outback, combined with soils which are usually not very fertile, inland Australia is relatively sparsely settled. More than 90 percent of Australians live in urban areas on the coast. However the outback and the history of its exploration and settlement provides Australians with a culturally valued backdrop, and stories of [[swagman|swagmen]], [[squatter]]s, and [[bushrangers]] are central to the national ethos. The song [[Waltzing Matilda]], which is about a swagman and squatters, is probably Australia's best internationally known and most well-loved song.

[[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] communities in outback regions have not been displaced as they have been in areas of intensive agriculture and large cities, in coastal areas. So a significant proportion of the country's indigenous population lives in the Outback,&lt;ref&gt;World Book Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; in areas such as the [[Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara]] lands in northern South Australia.

==Medicine==
[[Image:Outback.jpg|thumb|right|Flying over western [[New South Wales]]. Near the bottom of the picture, a squiggly line appears; apparently, a [[stream|creek]] created by recent rain.]]

{{Main|Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia}}

Owing to the wide expanses and remoteness of people in the outback, a 'Flying Doctor Service' exists to provide medical services and [[medevac]] to remote areas. This service was created in 1928 in [[Cloncurry, Queensland|Cloncurry]], Queensland by the Very Reverend [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]] (known as Flynn of the Inland). The aim of the service is to provide medical care, primary and emergency, to people who cannot reach hospitals or general practitioners.  Regular Clinics are flown out to remote communities, with consultations held in a specially built clinic, in a homestead, or even under the wing of the plane. In addition The Royal Flying doctors Service provides Air Ambulance to remote areas, Hospital to Hospital Transport and Telephone and Radio consultations.  In Queensland  RFDS nurses are [[RIPRN]] endorsed so that they can offer a greater level of knowledge and skills to outback people, often in areas where there may be no doctor in the town.

==Education==

{{Main|School of the Air}}

In most outback communities, the number of children is too small for a conventional school to operate. Children are educated at home by the [[School of the Air]]. Originally the teachers communicated with the children via radio, but now satellite telecommunication is used instead.
Some children attend boarding school, mostly only those in secondary school.

==Terminology==
Culturally, many urban Australians have had very generalised terms for the otherwise complex range of environments that exist within the inland and tropical regions of the continent. Regional terminology can be very specific to specific locations in each mainland state.

The concept of 'back' country, which initially meant land beyond the settled regions, was in existence in 1800. Crossing of the Blue Mountains and other exploration of the inland however gave a different dimension to the perception. The term &quot;outback&quot; was first used in print in 1869, when the writer clearly meant west of [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coupe&quot;&gt;Coupe, Sheena (ed.),  Frontier Country, Vol. 1, Weldon Russell Publishing, Willoughby, 1989, ISBN 1 875202 01 3&lt;/ref&gt;

It is colloquially said that 'the outback' is located &quot;beyond the [[Black Stump]]&quot;. The location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore. It has been suggested that the term comes from the ''Black Stump Wine Saloon'' that once stood about 10 kilometres out of [[Coolah, New South Wales]] on the Gunnedah Road. It is claimed that the saloon, named after the nearby Black Stump Run and Black Stump Creek, was an important staging post for traffic to north-west New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMHOutback2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Lewis | first = Daniel | authorlink =   | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/outback/outer-limits/2005/05/16/1116095894531.html | title= Outer limits  | work=Travel  | publisher= [[Sydney Morning Herald]]   | date= 2005-05-17  | accessdate= 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:West MacDonnell National Park.JPG|thumb|left|The MacDonnell Ranges in the [[Northern Territory]] are found in the centre of the country.]]
&quot;The Never-Never&quot; is a term referring to remoter parts of the Australian outback. The outback can be also referred to as &quot;back of beyond&quot;,  &quot;back o' [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]]&quot; although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere, or a long way away. The well-watered north of the continent is often called the &quot;[[Top End]]&quot; and the arid interior &quot;The Red Centre&quot;, owing to its vast amounts of red soil and sparse greenery amongst its landscape.

==Wildlife==
[[Image:BrunbyAusschnitt.jpg|thumb|100px|right|A Brumby in the Outback]]
The Australian Outback is full of very well-adapted wildlife, although much of it may not be immediately visible to the casual observer.  Many animals, such as [[kangaroo]]s and [[dingo]]es, hide in bushes to rest and keep cool during the heat of the day.

Birdlife is prolific, most often seen at waterholes at dawn and dusk.  Huge flocks of [[budgerigars]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[corella]]s and [[galah]]s are often sighted. On bare ground or roads during the winter, various species of snakes and lizards bask in the sun, but they are rarely seen during the summer months.

Feral animals such as camels thrive in central Australia, brought to Australia by the early [[Afghan (Australia)|Afghan drivers]]. Feral horses known as '[[brumby|brumbies]]' are station horses that have run wild.  Feral pigs, foxes, cats and rabbits are also imported animals that degrade the environment, so time and money is spent eradicating them in an attempt to help protect fragile rangelands.

==Tourism==

[[Image:ISS007 Gosses Bluff.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gosses Bluff crater]], one of a number of [[meteor]] [[impact crater]]s that can be found across outback Australia.]]
There are many popular tourist attractions in the outback. Some of the well known destinations include:
*[[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]]
*[[Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame]]
*[[Birdsville, Queensland]]
*[[Broken Hill, New South Wales]]
*[[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]
*[[Coober Pedy, South Australia]]
*[[Devils Marbles]]
*[[Kakadu National Park]]
*[[Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Western Australia]]
*[[Kata Tjuta]] (The Olgas)
*[[Nitmiluk National Park|Katherine Gorge]]
*[[Kings Canyon, Northern Territory|Kings Canyon (Watarrka)]]
*[[MacDonnell Ranges]]
*[[Monkey Mia]]
*[[Mount Isa, Queensland]]
*[[Mount Augustus National Park]]
*[[Tennant Creek, Northern Territory]]
*[[Uluru|Uluru (Ayers Rock)]]
*[[Willandra Lakes Region]]
Visitors to the outback often drive their own or rented vehicles, or take organised tours. Travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no advance planning.  However travel through very remote areas, on isolated tracks, requires advance planning and a suitable, reliable vehicle (usually a [[four-wheel drive]]). On very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required, this can include prearranged caches. It is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle, unless fully equipped with good communication technology (e.g. a satellite phone, EPIRB etc.).  Many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy. Deaths from tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur, sometime because insufficient water and food supplies were taken, or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help.  Travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected destination arrival time, and remember that a vehicle is much easier to locate in an aerial search, than a person, so in the event of a breakdown, they must not leave their vehicle.

==Transport==
[[Image:Gibb River Rd-1.jpg|thumb|right|A road sign warning of potentially dangerous conditions ahead.]]
The outback is criss-crossed by historic tracks. Most of the major highways have an excellent [[bitumen]] surface and other major roads are usually well-maintained dirt roads.  Tracks in very sandy or exceedingly rocky areas may require high-clearance four wheel drives and spare fuel, tyres, food and water before attempting to travel them, however most outback roads are easily traversed in ordinary vehicles, provided care is taken.  Drivers unused to dirt roads should be especially cautious – it is recommended that drivers reduce their speed, drive with extra care, and avoid driving at night because animals can stray on to roads.  Travelling in remote areas in northern Australia is not advisable during the wet season (November to April), as heavy tropical downpours can quickly make dirt roads impassable. In the remotest parts of Australia fuel sellers are located hundreds of kilometres apart, so spare fuel must be carried or refuelling spots calculated carefully in order not to run out of fuel in between towns. In addition, multiple trailer trucks (known as Road Trains) traverse these roads and extreme care must be taken when around these vehicles, due to their weight, length (often three full trailers long) and amount of dust thrown up by 46+ tyres.

The [[Stuart Highway]] runs from north to south through the centre of the continent, roughly paralleled by the [[Adelaide-Darwin railway]]. There is a proposal to develop some of the roads running from the SW to the NE to create an all-weather road named the [[Outback Highway]], crossing the continent diagonally from [[Laverton, Western Australia]] (north of [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], through the Northern Territory to [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]], in Queensland.

Air transport is relied on for mail delivery in some areas, owing to sparse settlement and wet-season road closures.  Most outback mines have an airstrip and many have a [[fly-in fly-out]] workforce. Most outback [[sheep station]]s and [[cattle station]]s have an airstrip and quite a few have their own light plane. Medical and ambulance services are provided by the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]]. The [[School of the Air]] is a radio-based school using the RFDS radios.

'''Atomic weight''' (symbol: ''A''{{sub|r}}) is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] [[physical quantity]], the ratio of the average [[mass]] of [[atom]]s of an [[chemical element|element]] (from a given source) to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of [[carbon-12]] (known as the [[unified atomic mass unit]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC1979&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] | title = Atomic Weights of the Elements 1979 | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1980/pdf/5210x2349.pdf | doi = 10.1351/pac198052102349 | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl.

Chem.]] | volume = 78 | issue = 11 | pages = 2051–66 | doi = 10.1351/pac200678112051 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The updated list of standard atomic weights is expected to be formally published in late 2008. The IUPAC(International Union Of Pure And Applied Chemistry) Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights [http://www.iupac.org/objID/Note/nt50112469625981329917907 announced] in August 2007 that the standard atomic weights of the following elements would be revised (new figures quoted here): [[lutetium]] 174.9668(1); [[molybdenum]] 95.96(2); [[nickel]] 58.6934(4); [[ytterbium]] 173.054(5); [[zinc]] 65.38(2). The recommended value for the isotope amount ratio of {{sup|40}}Ar/{{sup|36}}Ar (which could be useful as a [[Scientific control|control measurement]] in [[argon–argon dating]]) was also changed from 296.03(53) to 298.56(31).&lt;/ref&gt; and which are intended to be applicable to normal laboratory materials. These standard atomic weights are reprinted in a wide variety of textbooks, commercial catalogues, wallcharts etc., and in the table below. The fact &quot;relative atomic mass of the element&quot; may also be used to describe this physical quantity, and indeed the continued use of the term &quot;atomic weight&quot; has attracted considerable controversy since at least the 1960s&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAChist&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = P. | last = de Bièvre | year = 1992 | title = 'Atomic Weight'—The Name, Its History, Definition, and Units | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1992/pdf/6410x1535.pdf | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] | volume = 64 | issue = 10 | pages = 1535–43 | doi = 10.1351/pac199264101535 | last2 = Peiser | first2 = H. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see below).

Atomic weights, unlike atomic masses (the masses of individual atoms), are not [[physical constant]]s and vary from sample to sample. Nevertheless, they are sufficiently constant in &quot;normal&quot; samples to be of fundamental importance in [[chemistry]].

== Definition ==
The IUPAC definition&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC1979&quot; /&gt; of atomic weight is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An atomic weight (relative atomic mass) of an element from a specified source is the ratio of the average mass per atom of the element to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of {{sup|12}}C.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The definition deliberately specifies &quot;'''''An''''' atomic weight…&quot;, as an element will have different atomic weights depending on the source. For example, [[boron]] from [[Turkey]] has a lower atomic weight than boron from [[California]], because of its different [[Isotope|isotopic composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;21, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rev2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] | title = Atomic Weights of the Elements: Review 2000 | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2003/pdf/7506x0683.pdf | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] | volume = 75 | issue = 6 | pages = 683–800 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1351/pac200375060683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, given the cost and difficulty of [[isotope analysis]], it is usual to use the tabulated values of standard atomic weights which are ubiquitous in chemical laboratories.

== Naming controversy ==
The use of the name &quot;atomic weight&quot; has attracted a great deal of controversy among scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAChist&quot; /&gt; Objectors to the name usually prefer the term &quot;relative atomic mass&quot; (not to be confused with [[atomic mass]]). The basic objection is that atomic weight is not a [[weight]], that is the [[force]] exerted on an object in a [[gravitational field]], measured in units of force such as the [[newton (unit)|newton]].

In reply, supporters of the term &quot;atomic weight&quot; point out (among other arguments)&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAChist&quot; /&gt; that
*the name has been in continuous use for the same quantity since it was first conceptualized in 1808;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John | last = Dalton | author-link = John Dalton | title = A New System of Chemical Philosophy | url = http://www.archive.org/details/newsystemofchemi01daltuoft | location = Manchester | year = 1808}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*for most of that time, atomic weights really were measured by weighing (that is by [[gravimetric analysis]]) and that the name of a physical quantity should not change simply because the method of its determination has changed;
*the term &quot;relative atomic mass&quot; should be reserved for the mass of a specific [[nuclide]] (or [[isotope]]), while &quot;atomic ''weight''&quot; be used for the [[weighted mean|''weighted'' mean]] of the atomic masses over all the atoms in the sample;
*it is not uncommon to have misleading names of physical quantities which are retained for historical reasons, such as
**[[electromotive force]], which is not a force
**[[resolving power]], which is not a [[power (physics)|power]] quantity
**[[molar concentration]], which is not a molar quantity (a quantity expressed per unit amount of substance)
It could be added that atomic weight is often not truly &quot;atomic&quot; either, as it does not correspond to the property of any individual atom. The same argument could be made against &quot;relative atomic mass&quot; used in this sense.

== Determination of atomic weight ==
Modern atomic weights are calculated from measured values of atomic mass (for each nuclide) and [[isotopic composition]]. Highly accurate atomic masses are available&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST&quot;&gt;[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl?ele=&amp;ascii=html&amp;isotype=some Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions for All Elements].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AME2003&quot;&gt;{{AME 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; for virtually all non-radioactive nuclides, but isotopic compositions are both harder to measure to high precision and more subject to variation between samples.&lt;ref name=&quot;TICE1997&quot;&gt;{{AtWt TICE 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IAvar&quot;&gt;{{AtWt IAV}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the atomic weights of the twenty-two [[mononuclidic element]]s are known to especially high accuracy – an uncertainty of only one part in 38&amp;nbsp;million in the case of [[fluorine]], a precision which is greater than the current best value for the [[Avogadro constant]] (one part in 20&amp;nbsp;million).

The calculation is exemplified for [[silicon]], whose atomic weight is especially important in [[metrology]]. Silicon exists in nature as a mixture of three isotopes: {{sup|28}}Si, {{sup|29}}Si and {{sup|30}}Si. The atomic masses of these nuclides are known to a precision of one part in 14&amp;nbsp;billion for {{sup|28}}Si and about one part in one billion for the others. However the range of [[natural abundance]] for the isotopes is such that the standard abundance can only be given to about ±0.001% (see table).
The calculation is
:''A''{{sub|r}}(Si) = (27.97693 × 0.922297) + (28.97649 × 0.046832) + (29.97377 × 0.030872) = 28.0854

The relative standard uncertainty in this value is 1{{e|–5}} or 10&amp;nbsp;ppm.

The '''Absolute Infinite''' is [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]]'s concept of an &quot;[[infinity]]&quot; that transcended the [[transfinite number]]s.  Cantor equated the Absolute Infinite with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;§3.2, {{cite journal
 | author=Ignacio Jané
 | title=The role of the absolute infinite in Cantor's conception of set
 | journal=Erkenntnis
 | volume=42 | issue=3 | month=May | year=1995 | pages=375–402 | doi=10.1007/BF01129011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He held that the Absolute [[Infinite]] had various [[mathematical]] properties, including that every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}.

== Cantor's view ==

Cantor is quoted as saying:

{{quote|The actual infinite arises in three contexts: first when it is realized in the most complete form, in a fully independent otherworldly being, ''in Deo'', where I call it the Absolute Infinite or simply Absolute; second when it occurs in the contingent, created world; third when the mind grasps it ''in abstracto'' as a mathematical magnitude, number or order type.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Mind Tools: The Five Levels of Mathematical Reality'', Rudy Rucker, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987; ISBN 0395383153.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[Richard Dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in original):{{#tag:ref|''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'',&lt;ref&gt;''Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts'', Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, with biography by Adolf Fraenkel; orig. pub. Berlin: Verlag von Julius Springer, 1932; reprinted Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1962, and Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1980, ISBN 3540098496.&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1962, pp. 443–447; translated into English in ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931'', ed. Jean van Heijenoort, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1967, pp. 113–117.  These references both purport to be a letter from Cantor to Dedekind, dated July 28, 1899.  However, as [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] has discovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/home/services/pdfterms/?ID=516899 The Rediscovery of the Cantor-Dedekind Correspondence], I. Grattan-Guinness, ''Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung'' '''76''' (1974/75), pp. 104–139, at p. 126 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; this is in fact an amalgamation by Cantor's editor, [[Ernst Zermelo]], of two letters from Cantor to Dedekind, the first dated July 28 and the second dated August 3.|name=GesammelteAbhandlungen}}

{{quotation|
A [[cardinal number|multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a &quot;sequence&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''Ω''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The system ''Ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a &quot;sequence&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''Ω′'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0, 1, 2, 3, ... &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1, ..., &amp;gamma;, ...
&lt;br /&gt;
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0).  (The sequence ''Ω'' has this property first for ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1. [ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1 should be ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now ''Ω&amp;prime;'' (and therefore also ''Ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''Ω&amp;prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''Ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''Ω'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}

== The Burali-Forti paradox ==
{{main|Burali-Forti paradox}}
The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox|Cesare Burali-Forti's &quot;paradox&quot;]] that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by [[A.W. Moore (mathematician)|A.W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

However, while this neatly solves the logical problem, the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a [[Class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly &quot;large&quot;) entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics.

In [[engineering]] and its various [[fields of engineering|subdisciplines]], '''acceptance testing''' is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a [[specification]] or [[contract]] are met.  It may involve  [[chemical test]]s, [[physical test]]s, or [[performance test]]s    

In [[systems engineering]] it may involve [[black-box testing]] performed on a [[system]] (for example: a piece of software, lots of manufactured mechanical parts, or batches of chemical products) prior to its delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Black | first=Rex | year=August 2009 | title= Managing the Testing Process: Practical Tools and Techniques for Managing Hardware and Software Testing | publisher=Hoboken, NJ: Wiley | isbn=0-470-40415-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as [[functional testing]], [[black-box testing]], QA testing, application testing, confidence testing, final testing, validation testing, or factory acceptance testing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Software developers often distinguish acceptance testing by the system provider from acceptance testing by the [[customer]] (the user or client) prior to accepting transfer of ownership. In the case of software, acceptance testing performed by the customer is known as [[#User acceptance testing|user acceptance testing]] (UAT), end-user testing, site (acceptance) testing, or field (acceptance) testing.

A [[smoke test]] is used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a build to the main testing process.

==Overview==
Acceptance testing generally involves running a suite of tests on the completed system. Each individual test, known as a case, exercises a particular operating condition of the user's environment or feature of the system, and will result in a pass or fail, or [[boolean logic|boolean]], outcome. There is generally no degree of success or failure. The test environment is usually designed to be identical, or as close as possible, to the anticipated user's environment, including extremes of such. These test cases must each be accompanied by test case input data or a formal description of the operational activities (or both) to be performed—intended to thoroughly exercise the specific case—and a formal description of the expected results.

Acceptance Tests/Criteria (in [[Agile Software Development]]) are usually created by business customers and expressed in a [[Domain Specific Language|business domain language]]. These are high-level tests to test the completeness of a [[user story]] or stories 'played' during any sprint/iteration. These tests are created ideally through collaboration between business customers, business analysts, testers and developers, however the business customers (product owners) are the primary owners of these tests. As the user stories pass their acceptance criteria, the business owners can be sure of the fact that the developers are progressing in the right direction about how the application was envisaged to work and so it's essential that these tests include both business logic tests as well as UI validation elements (if need be).

Acceptance test cards are ideally created during sprint planning or iteration planning meeting, before development begins so that the developers have a clear idea of what to develop. Sometimes (due to bad planning!) acceptance tests may span multiple stories (that are not implemented in the same sprint) and there are different ways to test them out during actual sprints. One popular technique is to mock external interfaces or data to mimic other stories which might not be played out during an iteration (as those stories may have been relatively lower business priority). A user story is not considered complete until the acceptance tests have passed.

==Process==
The acceptance test suite is run against the supplied input data or using an acceptance test script to direct the testers. Then the results obtained are compared with the expected results. If there is a correct match for every case, the test suite is said to pass. If not, the system may either be rejected or accepted on conditions previously agreed between the sponsor and the manufacturer.

The objective is to provide confidence that the delivered system meets the business requirements of both sponsors and users. The acceptance phase may also act as the final [[Quality (business)|quality]] gateway, where any quality defects not previously detected may be uncovered.

A principal purpose of acceptance testing is that, once completed successfully, and provided certain additional (contractually agreed) acceptance criteria are met, the sponsors will then sign off on the system as satisfying the [[contract]] (previously agreed between sponsor and manufacturer), and deliver final payment.

==User acceptance testing==
'''User Acceptance Testing''' (UAT) is a process to obtain confirmation that a system meets mutually agreed-upon requirements. A [[Subject Matter Expert]] (SME), preferably the owner or client of the object under test, provides such confirmation after trial or review. In [[Software development process|software development]], UAT is one of the final stages of a project and often occurs before a client or customer accepts the new system.

Users of the system perform these tests, which developers derive from the client's contract or the [[Requirements analysis|user requirements specification]].

Test-designers draw up formal tests and devise a range of severity levels. Ideally the designer of the user acceptance tests should not be the creator of the formal integration and system [[test case]]s for the same system. The UAT acts as a final verification of the required business function and proper functioning of the system, emulating real-world usage conditions on behalf of the paying client or a specific large customer. If the software works as intended and without issues during normal use, one can reasonably extrapolate the same level of stability in production.

User tests, which are usually performed by clients or end-users, do not normally focus on identifying simple problems such as spelling errors and cosmetic problems, nor [[showstopper]] defects, such as [[crash (computing)|software crashes]]; testers and developers previously identify and fix these issues during earlier [[unit testing]], [[integration testing]], and [[system testing]] phases.

The results of these tests give confidence to the clients as to how the system will perform in production. There may also be legal or contractual requirements for acceptance of the system.

=== Q-UAT - Quantified User Acceptance Testing ===
'''Quantified User Acceptance Testing''' (Q-UAT or, more simply, the &quot;Quantified Approach&quot;) is a revised [[Business Acceptance Testing]] process which aims to provide a smarter and faster alternative to the traditional UAT phase.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Depth-testing is carried out against business requirements only at specific planned points in the application or service under test. A reliance on better quality code-delivery from the development/build phase is assumed and a complete understanding of the appropriate [[business process]] is a pre-requisite. This methodology - if carried out correctly - results in a quick turnaround against plan, a decreased number of test scenarios which are more complex and wider in breadth than traditional UAT and ultimately the equivalent confidence-level attained via a shorter delivery-window, allowing products/changes to come to market quicker.

The Q-UAT approach depends on a &quot;gated&quot; three-dimensional model. The key concepts are:
# Linear Testing (LT, the 1st dimension)
# Recursive Testing (RT, the 2nd dimension)
# Adaptive Testing (AT, the 3rd dimension).

The four{{which?|date=November 2010}} &quot;gates&quot; which conjoin and support the 3-dimensional model act as quality safeguards and include contemporary testing concepts such as:
* Internal Consistency Checks (ICS)
* Major Systems/Services Checks (MSC)
* Realtime/Reactive Regression (RTR).

The Quantified Approach was shaped by the former &quot;guerilla&quot; method of acceptance testing which was itself a response to testing phases which proved too costly to be sustainable for many small/medium-scale projects.

==Acceptance testing in Extreme Programming==
Acceptance testing is a term used in [[agile software development]] methodologies, particularly [[Extreme Programming]], referring to the functional testing of a [[user story]] by the software development team during the implementation phase.

The customer specifies scenarios to test when a user story has been correctly implemented. A story can have one or many acceptance tests, whatever it takes to ensure the functionality works. Acceptance tests are black box system tests. Each acceptance test represents some expected result from the system. Customers are responsible for verifying the correctness of the acceptance tests and reviewing test scores to decide which failed tests are of highest priority. Acceptance tests are also used as regression tests prior to a production release. A user story is not considered complete until it has passed its acceptance tests. This means that new acceptance tests must be created for each iteration or the development team will report zero progress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/functionaltests.html Acceptance Tests]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of acceptance testing ==
Typical types of acceptance testing include the following
;User acceptance testing:
:This may include factory acceptance testing, i.e. the testing done by factory users before the factory is moved to its own site, after which site acceptance testing may be performed by the users at the site.
;[[Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT)]]:Also known as operational readiness testing, this refers to the checking done to a system to ensure that processes and procedures are in place to allow the system to be used and maintained. This may include checks done to back-up facilities, procedures for disaster recovery, training for end users, maintenance procedures, and security procedures.
;Contract and regulation acceptance testing
:In contract acceptance testing, a system is tested against acceptance criteria as documented in a contract, before the system is accepted. In regulation acceptance testing, a system is tested to ensure it meets governmental, legal and safety standards.
;Alpha and beta testing
:Alpha testing takes place at developers' sites, and involves testing of the operational system by internal staff, before it is released to external customers. Beta testing takes place at customers' sites, and involves testing by a group of customers who use the system at their own locations and provide feedback, before the system is released to other customers. The latter is often called “field testing”.

{{History of Latvia}}
The '''Archbishopric of Riga''' ({{lang-la|Archiepiscopatus Rigensis}}, {{lang-nds|Erzbisdom Riga}}) was an [[archbishop]]ric in [[Terra Mariana|Medieval Livonia]], a subject to the [[Holy See]]. It was established in 1186 as bishopric of [[Livonia]], called [[Bishopric of Riga]] in 1202 and elevated to an Archbishopric in 1255.

== Archbishops of Riga ==

The Archbishops of Riga (1202) 1255–1561 were the secular rulers of [[Riga]], the capital of [[Terra Mariana]] (now the capital of [[Latvia]]) in medieval Livonia. It was abolished in 1561 due to the conversion of the territory of the Livonian Order from [[Catholicism]] to [[Lutheranism]]. The see was restored as a [[diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in 1918 and raised into an archdiocese in 1923.

== Coinage ==

The '''Archbishops of Riga'''  were innovators in the field of minting currency, reviving techniques abandoned since the collapse of [[Rome]]. The names of individual archbishops after 1418, as well as the years of their respective reigns, are stamped on Livonian [[penny|pennies]] excavated at [[archaeological site]]s; in many cases, this is the only biographical data available. No Livonian pennies before 1418 have been found.

'''Albert Frederick''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht Friedrich}}; 7 May 1553 [[Königsberg]] &amp;ndash; 28 August 1618 [[Fischhausen]]) was [[duke]] of [[Duchy of Prussia|Prussia]] from 1568 until his death.  He was a son of [[Albert of Prussia]] and Anna Marie of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. He was the second and last Prussian duke of the [[Ansbach]] branch of the [[Hohenzollern]] family. He exhibited signs of mental disorder. In early 1578, the regency was taken over by his cousin, [[George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George Frederick of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] (1539–1603).

Albrecht Friedrich was married in 1573 to [[Marie Eleonore of Cleves]], a daughter of [[Wilhelm, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] and [[Maria of Habsburg, Archduchess of Austria|Archduchess Maria of Austria]] (1531&amp;ndash;1581). Maria was a daughter of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]].

==Issue==
Albert Frederick and Marie were parents to seven children:
# [[Duchess Anna of Prussia|Anna of Prussia]] (3 July 1576 &amp;ndash; 30 August 1625). Married [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg]].
# Marie of Prussia (23 January 1579 &amp;ndash; 21 February 1649). Married [[Christian, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]].
# Albert Frederick of Prussia (1 June - 8 October 1580).
# [[Duchess Sophie of Prussia|Sophie of Prussia]] (31 March 1582 &amp;ndash; 4 December 1610). Married [[Wilhelm Kettler]] of [[Courland]].
# Eleonore of Prussia (22 August 1583 - 31 March/9 April 1607). Married [[Joachim Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg]].
# Wilhelm of Prussia (23 June 1585 &amp;ndash; 18 January 1586).
# [[Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia]] (31 December 1586 &amp;ndash; 22 February 1659). Married [[John George I, Elector of Saxony]].

At his death, the duchy passed to his son-in-law [[John Sigismund, Margrave of Brandenburg]], combining the two territories under a single dynasty and forming [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].

'''Ansbach''', originally '''Onolzbach''', is a town in [[Bavaria]], Germany. It is the capital of the [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]] of [[Mittelfranken|Middle Franconia]]. Ansbach is situated {{convert|25|mi}} southwest of [[Nuremberg]] and {{convert|90|mi}} north of [[Munich]], on the [[Fränkische Rezat]], a tributary of the [[Main (river)|Main]] river. Population: 40,723 (2004).

Ansbach is location of the [[Ansbach University of Applied Sciences]]. The city is connected by the autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 6|A6]] and the highways [[Bundesstraße 13|B13]] and [[Bundesstraße 14|B14]]. [[Ansbach station]] is on the [[Nuremberg–Crailsheim railway|Nürnberg–Crailsheim]] and [[Treuchtlingen–Würzburg railway|Treuchtlingen–Würzburg]] railways and is the terminus of line S4 of the [[Nuremberg S-Bahn]].
 
==History==
A Benedictine monastery at the place was founded around 748 by a [[Franks|Frankish]] noble, [[Gumbertus]], who was later canonized. In the following centuries the monastery and the adjoining village (''Onoldsbach'') grew to become the town of Ansbach (called a town in 1221 for the first time).

The counts of [[Oettingen]] ruled over Ansbach until the [[Hohenzollern]] burgraves of Nuremberg took over in 1331. The Hohenzollerns made Ansbach the seat of their dynasty until their acquisition of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1415. However, after the 1440 death of [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg]], the Franconian cadet branch of the family was not politically united with the main Brandenburg line, remaining independent as &quot;[[Brandenburg-Ansbach]]&quot;. 

Margrave [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George the Pious]] introduced the [[Protestant Reformation]] to Ansbach in 1528, leading to the secularization of [[St. Gumbertus Abbey]] in 1563.

In 1792 Ansbach was annexed by the Hohenzollerns of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. In 1796 the Duke of Zweibrücken, [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian Joseph]], the future Bavarian king Max I. Joseph, was exiled to Ansbach after Zweibrücken had been taken by the French. In Ansbach [[Maximilian von Montgelas]] wrote an elaborate concept for the future political organisation of Bavaria, which is known as the &quot;[http://www.hdbg.de/montgelas/pages/hmv33.htm Ansbacher Mémoire]&quot;. In 1806 [[Prussia]] ceded Ansbach and the Principality of Ansbach to Bavaria in exchange for the Bavarian [[Berg (German region)|duchy of Berg]].

At the end of the 17th century, the [[margraves' palace]] at Ansbach was rebuilt in [[Baroque]] style. 

Jewish families were resident in Ansbach from at least the end of the 18th century. They set up a Jewish Cemetery in the Ruglaender Strasse, which was vandalised and razed under the Nazi tyranny. It was repaired in 1946, but it was damaged several times more. A plaque on the wall of the cemetery commemorates these events. The Jewish Congregation built its synagogue at No 3 Rosenbadstrasse, but it too was damaged by the SA, though it was not burnt down for fear of damaging the neighbouring buildings. It serves today as a &quot;Symbolic House of God&quot;. A plaque in the entrance serves as a memorial to the synagogue and to Jewish residents who were murdered during the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansbach&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, at least 500 patients were deported from the Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Ansbach [''Ansbach Medical and Nursing Clinic''] to the extermination facilities Sonnenstein and Hartheim which were disguised as psychiatric institutions, as part of the T4 euthanasia action. They were gassed there. At the clinic in Ansbach itself, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with the drug Luminal and killed that way. A plaque was erected in their memory in 1988 in the local hospital at No. 38 Feuchtwangerstrasse.&lt;ref&gt;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansbach&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], a subcamp of [[Flossenburg concentration camp]] was located here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tartanplace.com/tartanhistory/concentrationcamps.html Christine O'Keefe. ''Concentration Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the Second World War the Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht had bases here. The nearby airbase was the home station for the Stab &amp; I/KG53 (Staff &amp; 1st Group of Kampfgeschwader 53) operating 38 [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers. On 1 September 1939 this unit was one of the many that participated in the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|attack on Poland]] that started the war. During the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]] in April 1945, the airfield was seized by the [[United States Third Army]], and used by the [[USAAF]] [[354th Fighter Wing|354th Fighter Group]] which flew [[P-47 Thunderbolts]] from the aerodrome (designated [[Advanced Landing Ground|ALG R-82]]) from late April until the German capitulation on 7 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9966 354 Operations Group Fact Sheet, USAFHRA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skylighters.org/history/airfields USAAF Airfields in the ETO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eucmh.com/2008/08/10/aaf-airfields-fr-be-nl-lu-deprocessing AAF Airfields in France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, 19-year old student Robert Limpert tried to get the town to surrender to the US Forces without a fight. He was betrayed by Hilter Youth and was hung from the portal of the City Hall by the city's Military Commander Oberst Meyer. Several memorials to his heroic deed have been erected over the years, against great opposition from the citizenry: in the Ludwigskirche, in the Gymnasium Carolinum and at No 6 Kronenstrasse.&lt;ref&gt;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansbach&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, Ansbach belonged to the American Zone. The American Military authorities established a displaced persons (DP) camp in what used to be a sanatorium in what is today the Strüth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansbach&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1970, Ansbach has enlarged its municipal area by incorporating adjacent communities.

Ansbach was a small town largely by-passed by the [[Industrial Revolution]], an administrative and cultural center. Although all bridges were destroyed, the historical center of Ansbach was spared during [[World War II]] and it has kept its baroque character. 

Ansbach hosts several units of the U.S. armed forces, associated with German units under [[NATO]]. There are five separate U.S. installations: Shipton Kaserne, home to 412th Aviation Support Battalion, Katterbach Kaserne, formally the home of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division's]] [[4th Combat Aviation Brigade]], which has been replaced by the [[12th Combat Aviation Brigade (United States)|12th Combat Aviation Brigade]] as of 2006, as part of the 1st Infantry Division's return to [[Fort Riley]], Kansas; Bismarck Kaserne, which functions as a satellite post to Katterbach, hosting their [[Post Exchange]], Theater, Barracks, Franconia Inn, Military Police, and other support agencies, Barton Barracks, home to the USAG Ansbach and Bleidorn Barracks, which has a library and housing.
Ansbach was also home to the headquarters of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)]] from 1972 to the early1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ridinthewave.com/thinkytees/1stArmorDivision.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Alliance''' ({{lang-it|Alleanza Nazionale}}, AN) was a [[conservatism|conservative]]&lt;ref&gt;Chiara Moroni, ''Da Forza Italia al Popolo della Libertà'', Carocci, Roma 2008, pp. 75-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oreste Massari, ''I partiti politici nelle democrazie contemporanee'', Laterza, Roma-Bari 2004, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardi&quot;&gt;Luciano Bardi - Piero Ignazi - Oreste Massari, ''I partiti italiani'', Egea 2007, pp. 151, 173n.&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]]. 

[[Gianfranco Fini]] was the leader of the party since its foundation in 1995, however he stepped down in 2008 after being elected to the nominally non-partisan post of President of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] and was succeeded by [[Ignazio La Russa]], who managed to merge the party into [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL). This finally happened in 2009.

==History==
===Foundation===
National Alliance was formed in January 1995 when the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), the former [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] party, merged with conservative elements of the former [[Christian Democracy (Italy, historical)|Christian Democracy]], which had disbanded in 1994 after two years of scandals and various splits due to [[Political corruption|corruption]] at its highest levels, exposed by the [[Mani Pulite]] investigation, and the [[Italian Liberal Party (historical)|Italian Liberal Party]], disbanded in the same year. Former MSI members were however still the bulk of the new party and former MSI leader [[Gianfranco Fini]] was elected leader of the new party.

The logo followed a template very similar to the [[Democratic Party of the Left]], with the previous logo in a small circle, as a means of legally preventing others from using it. The name was suggested by an article on the Italian newspaper ''[[Il Tempo (newspaper)|Il Tempo]]'' written in 1992 by [[Domenico Fisichella]], a prominent conservative academic. Starting in the 1990s, the MSI gradually transformed into a mainstream [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] party, culminating in its 1995 dissolution into AN.

===Government participation===
The party was part of all three [[House of Freedoms]] coalition governments led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Gianfranco Fini was notably nominated Deputy Prime Minister after the [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 general election]] and was Foreign Minister from November 2004 to May 2006.

When Gianfranco Fini visited [[Israel]] in late November 2003 in the function of Italian Deputy Prime Minister, he labeled the racial laws issued by the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] regime in 1938 as &quot;infamous&quot;, as also [[Giorgio Almirante]], historic leader of MSI, had done before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ildomenicale.it/approfondimento.asp?id_approfondimento=16 Il Domenicale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also referred to the [[Italian Social Republic]] as belonging to the most shameful pages of the past, and considered fascism part of an era of &quot;absolute evil&quot;, something which was hardly acceptable to the few remaining hardliners of the party. As a result, [[Alessandra Mussolini]], the granddaughter of the former fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], who had been at odds with the party on a number of issues for a long time, and some hardliners left the party and formed [[Social Action]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignazi&quot;&gt;Piero Ignazi, ''Partiti politici in Italia'', Il Mulino, Bologna 2008, pp. 27-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Logo AN 2006.png|right|float|thumb|150px|Logo of National Alliance for the 2006 general election]]

In occasion of the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], AN ran within the House of Freedoms, with new allies. The centre-right lost by 24,000 votes in favor of the centre-left coalition [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]]. Individually AN received nearly 5 million votes, amounting to 12.3%. In July 2007 a group of splinters led by [[Francesco Storace]] formed [[The Right]], which was officially founded on 10 November. Seven MPs of AN, including [[Teodoro Buontempo]] and [[Daniela Santanchè]], joined the new party.

===The People of Freedom===
In November 2007 [[Silvio Berlusconi]] announced that Forza Italia would have soon merged or transformed into the [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL) party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skylife.it/html/skylife/tg24/politica.html?idvideo=56053 Sky tg24 - Tutte le notizie in formato video&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_novembre_18/berlusconi_partito_popolo_italiano.shtml «Oggi nasce il partito del popolo italiano». Corriere della Sera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_65043240.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sudden fall of the [[Prodi II Cabinet|second Prodi government]] in January 2008, the break up of [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]] and the subsequent political crisis which lead to a fresh general election, Berlusconi hinted that Forza Italia would have probably contested its last election and the new party would have been officially founded only after that election. In an atmosphere of reconciliation with Gianfranco Fini, Berlusconi also stated that the new party could see the participation of other parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_25/berlusconi_napoli_a48218f8-cb73-11dc-9e0e-0003ba99c667.shtml «Via l'Ici e stretta sulle intercettazioni» Corriere della Sera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on 8 February, Berlusconi and Fini agreed to form a joint list under the banner of the &quot;The People of Freedom&quot;, allied with Lega Nord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/191851/notiziario-antiproibizionista-del-25-ottobre-1999 Svolta di Berlusconi, arriva il Pdl: &quot;Forza Italia-An sotto stesso simbolo&quot; - LASTAMPA.it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory of the PdL in the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], AN was merged into the PdL in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/5039109/Mussolinis-heirs-merge-with-Silvio-Berlusconis-Forza-Italia-party.html Mussolini's heirs merge with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party] The Telegraph. 23 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
National Alliance's political program emphasized:
*[[traditionalist Catholic|traditional values]], being often close to the position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], despite some [[social liberalism|social liberal]] and [[Secularism|secular]] attitudes;
*[[law and order (politics)|law and order]], especially laws aimed at controlling [[immigration]] and implementing [[punishment]];
*support for [[Israel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignazi&quot;/&gt; the [[United States]] and [[European integration]];
*[[prohibitionism]] about any kind of drugs, including [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].

Distinguishing itself from the MSI, the party distanced itself from [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian fascism|Fascism]] and made efforts to improve relations with [[Jew]]ish groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardi&quot;/&gt; With most hardliners leaving the party,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignazi&quot;/&gt; it sought to present itself as a respectable [[conservatism|conservative]] party and to join forces with [[Forza Italia]] in the [[European People's Party]] and, eventually, in a united party of the centre-right.

Although the party approved [[market economy]] and held favourable views on [[liberalization]]s and the [[privatization]] of [[public ownership|state industries]], however AN was to the left of Forza Italia on economic issues and sometimes supported [[statism|statist]] policies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} That is why the party was strong in [[Rome]] and [[Lazio]], where most civil servants live. Moreover AN presents itself as a party promoting national cohesion, [[nation|national identity]] and [[patriotism]].

Regarding institutional reforms, the party was a long-time supporter of [[presidential democracy|presidentialism]] and a [[plurality voting system]], and came to support also [[federalism]] and to fully accept the alliance with [[Lega Nord]], although the relations with that party were tense at times, especially about issues regarding national unity.

[[Gianfranco Fini]], a moderniser who sees [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[David Cameron]] as models, impressed an ambitious political line to the party, combining the pillars of conservative ideology like security, family values and patriotism with a progressive approach in other areas such as [[stem cell]] research and supporting voting rights for legal aliens. Anyway some of these positions were not shared by many members of the party, most of whom staunchly opposed stem cell research and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignazi&quot;/&gt;

==Factions==
National Alliance was a heterogeneous political party and within it members were divided in different factions, some of them very organized:
*'''[[Protagonist Right]]''' (''Destra Protagonista''), headed by [[Maurizio Gasparri]] and [[Ignazio La Russa]], was the bigger faction and the closest to [[Forza Italia]], due to its [[Liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] stances.
*'''[[New Alliance (Italy)|New Alliance]]''' (''Nuova Alleanza''), formerly called '''Right and Freedom''' (''Destra e Libertà''), headed by [[Altero Matteoli]] and [[Adolfo Urso]], was formed by the staunchest supporters of [[Gianfranco Fini]] within the party and supported a [[Liberalism|liberal]] political agenda.
*'''[[Social Right]]''' (''Destra Sociale''), led by [[Gianni Alemanno]], advocated a more &quot;social&quot; approach to economic policy and was considered at the right of the party. It had close ties with the [[General Labour Union (Italy)|General Labour Union]].
*'''''D-Destra''''', led by [[Francesco Storace]], was the most conservative component of the party, proud of the MSI's tradition and in open opposition to Fini. Formed as a split from the Social Right, in July 2007 the group finally left AN and launched [[The Right]].
*'''[[Christian Reformists]]''' (''Cristiano Riformisti'') was a minor [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] faction.

In the party there was also a group named '''Ethic-Religious Council''', whose board members included [[Gaetano Rebecchini]] (founder, ex-DC), [[Riccardo Pedrizzi]] (president), [[Franco Tofoni]] (vice president), [[Luigi Gagliardi]] (secretary-general), [[Alfredo Mantovano]], [[Antonio Mazzocchi]] and [[Riccardo Migliori]]. This was not a faction but an official organism within the party and expressed the official position of the party on ethical and religious matters. Sometimes the group criticized [[Gianfranco Fini]] for his liberal views on abortion, artificial insemination and stem-cell research, which led some notable ex-DC members as [[Publio Fiori]] to leave the party. Some members of the Council, such as Pedrizzi and Mantovano were described as members of an unofficial '''Catholic Right''' faction.

== Popular support ==
The party had roughly 10-15% support across Italy, having its stongholds in [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy]] ([[Lazio]] 18.6%, [[Umbria]] 15.2%, [[Marche]] 14.3%, [[Abruzzo]] 14.3%, [[Puglia]] 13.2%, [[Sardinia]] 12.9%, [[Tuscany]] 12.6% and [[Campania]] 12.6% in the last [[Italian general election, 2006|general election]]), scoring badly in [[Lombardy]] (10.2%) and [[Sicily]] (10.9%), while competing in the North-East ([[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] 15.5% and [[Veneto]] 11.3%).

The party had a good showing in the first general election to which it took part (13.5% in [[Italian general election, 1994|1994]]) and reached 15.7% in [[Italian general election, 1996|1996]], when Fini tried for the first time to replace [[Silvio Berlusconi]] as leader of the centre-right. From that moment the party suffered an electoral decline, but remained the third force of Italian politics.

In the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], the final election to which the party participated with its own list, AN won 12.3% of the vote, securing 71 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 41 in the Senate. In the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]] the party got 90 deputies&lt;ref&gt;Excluding [[Fiamma Nirenstein]], [[Alessandro Ruben]] and [[Souad Sbai]], whose election was supported both by Forza Italia and National Alliance, http://download.alleanzanazionale.it/Elezioni2008/DeputatiPDLinXVIlegislatura.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and 48 senators&lt;ref&gt;http://download.alleanzanazionale.it/Elezioni2008/SenatoriPDLinXVILEGISLATURA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; elected.

The '''Arno''' is a [[river]] in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Italy]]. It is the most important river of [[central Italy]] after the [[Tiber]].

== Source and route ==

The river originates on [[Mount Falterona]] in the [[Casentino]] area of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and takes initially a southward curve. The river turns to the west near [[Arezzo]] passing through [[Florence]], [[Empoli]] and [[Pisa]], flowing into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] at [[Marina di Pisa]].  With a length of 241 kilometers, it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries and these are them: [[Sieve (river)|Sieve]] (60 kilometers), [[Bisenzio River|Bisenzio]] (49 kilometers), [[Ombrone]], [[Era (river)|Era]], [[Elsa (river)|Elsa]], [[Pesa (river)|Pesa]] and [[Pescia (River)|Pescia]]. The drainage basin amounts to more than 8,200&amp;nbsp;km² and drains the waters of the following sub-basins:

*The [[Casentino]], in the [[province of Arezzo]], formed by the upper course of the river until the confluence with the Maestro della Chiana channel.
*The [[Valdichiana|Val di Chiana]], a plain dried in the 18th century, which, until the 18th century, was a marshy area tributary of the Tiber.
*The upper [[Valdarno]], a long valley bordered from East by the [[Pratomagno]] massif and from West by the hills around [[Siena]].
*The Sieve's basin, which flows in the Arno immediately before Florence.
*The middle Valdarno, with the plain including Florence, [[Sesto Fiorentino]], [[Prato]] and [[Pistoia]].
*The lower Valdarno, with the valley of important tributaries such as the Pesa, Elsa and Era and in which, after [[Pontedera]], the Arno flows into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. The river has a very variable discharge, ranging from minimum values such as 6&amp;nbsp;m³/s to more than 2,000. The mouth of the river was once near [[Pisa]], but is now several kilometres westwards.

It crosses [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], where it passes below the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the [[Ponte Santa Trinita|Santa Trìnita bridge]] (built by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]], but inspired by [[Michelangelo]]). The river [[flood]]ed this city regularly in historical times, the last occasion being the [[Flood of the River Arno in Florence|famous flood of 1966]], with 4,500 m³/s  after a rain of 437.2&amp;nbsp;mm in Badia Agnano and 190 millimetres in Florence, in only 24 hours.

The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrent-like behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near-flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between 0.56 m³/s and 3,540 m³/s. New [[dam]]s built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.

A [[The Flood of the River Arno in Florence, Italy|flood on November 4, 1966]] collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books.  New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even 40 years later hundreds of works still await restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alison McLean | year = 2006 | month = November | title = This Month in History | journal = Smithsonian | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aveiro.jpg|thumb|Aveiro's canal]]
There are several attractions in the city of Aveiro, including cathedrals, canals and the beaches of the Peninsula de São Jacinto. Attractions near Aveiro include the ''Ílhavo ceramica de Vista Alegre'' and the beaches of Barra, Costa Nova do Prado, and [[Gafanha da Nazare]].

==Gastronomy==
Aveiro is known in Portugal for its traditional sweets, ''[[ovos moles]]'', ''trouxas de ovos'', both made from eggs and &quot;tripa de aveiro&quot;.

==Aveiro nickname==
Aveiro is sometimes called &quot;The Portuguese [[Venice]]&quot;, because of its canals and boats that remind one of the Italian city of Venice, as the city faced similar problems when it tried to conquer the water.

==History==
The city dates back at least to the 10th century when it was known by its first [[Latin language|Latin]] name of ''Alavarium'', literally, &quot;a gathering place or preserve of birds.&quot; The [[Moors]] invaded and then held it until the 11th century, after which it became popular with Portuguese royalty. In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in [[metal]]s and [[tile]]s. The same storm also created a reef barrier at the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Industry==
The city is also famous for its production of [[salt]] and for its [[seaweed]] harvest, which is used for fertilizer in the area.

==Famous people==
The famous explorer [[Afonso de Paiva|João Afonso]] was born in Aveiro. He was the first European to visit the region of [[Benin]] in [[Nigeria]] and named the river located there, the Rio Fermoso. He helped to build a fort in [[Elmina Castle|Mina]]. Unfortunately, he never came back to Portugal; he died in the region and is credited for bringing to Lisbon the first pepper that ever came out of those parts. He was also credited as one of the discoverers of the [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] fisheries.

[[Zeca Afonso]] was a singer and composer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diafrica.org/nigeriaop/kenny/DH06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is also famous for the ''Convento de Jesus'' (now known as the City Museum &quot;Santa Joana&quot;), built in the 15th century, which contains the tomb of the daughter of [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|St. Joana]], who died in 1490. The presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1693, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, which produced many of the sumptuous pieces kept in the museum.

==Aveiro University==
The [[Universidade de Aveiro|University of Aveiro]] was created in 1973 and is considered one of the most dynamic and innovative universities of Portugal, attracting thousands of students to the city.
The University has about 430 professors (with Ph.D. degrees), 11,000 undergraduate students, and 1,300 post-graduate students.

==Sports==
[[S.C. Beira-Mar|Sport Clube Beira-Mar]], an [[association football]] club, currently play in the [[Liga ZON Sagres]], the first-tier of Portuguese football. News from local newspapers are available at http://www.recortes.pt.

'''Anthony the Great''' or '''Antony the Great''' (c. 251–356), ([[Coptic language|Coptic]] Ⲁⲃⲃⲁ Ⲁⲛⲧⲱⲛⲓ), also known as '''Saint Anthony''', '''Anthony the Abbot''', '''Anthony of Egypt''', '''Anthony of the Desert''', '''Anthony the Anchorite''', '''Abba Antonius''' (Ἀββᾶς Ἀντώνιος), and '''Father of All Monks''', was a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[saint]] from [[Egypt]], a prominent leader among the [[Desert Fathers]]. He is celebrated in many churches on his [[feast day]]s: 17 January in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]; and 30 January in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], the [[Coptic Catholic Church]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]

The biography of Anthony's life by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] helped to spread the concept of [[monasticism]], particularly in Western Europe through [[Latin]] translations. He is often erroneously considered the first monk, but as his biography and other sources make clear, there were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, the first known ascetic going into the wilderness, a geographical shift that seems to have contributed to his renown.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York 2008&quot;&gt;[[Dag Øistein Endsjø]] ''Primordial landscapes, incorruptible bodies. Desert asceticism and the Christian appropriation of Greek ideas on geography, bodies, and immortality.'' New York: Peter Lang 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony is appealed to against infectious diseases, particularly skin diseases. &quot;Saint Anthony's fire&quot; has described different afflictions including [[ergotism]], [[erysipelas]] and [[Herpes zoster|shingles]].

==Life==
Most of what is known about the life of Anthony comes from the ''Life of Anthony''. Written in Greek around 360 by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. It depicts Anthony as an illiterate and holy man who through his existence in a primordial landscape has an absolute connection to the divine truth, which always is synonymous with that of Athanasius as the biographer.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York 2008&quot;/&gt; Sometime before 374, it was translated into Latin by [[Evagrius of Antioch]]. The Latin translation helped the ''Life'' become one of the best known works of literature in the Christian world, a status it would hold through the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;White, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ''Life'', several surviving homilies and epistles of varying authenticity provide some additional autobiographical detail.

Anthony was born in Cooma near [[Herakleopolis Magna]] in [[Lower Egypt]] in 251 to wealthy landowner parents. When he was about 18 years old, his parents died and left him with the care of his unmarried sister.

There are various legends associating him with pigs: one is that for a time he worked as a [[swineherd]].[http://www.h-net.org/~nilas/seasons/stanthony.html][http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-anthony-the-abbot/][http://users.netnitco.net/~legend01/pig.htm]

In 285, at the age of 34, he decided to follow the words of [[Jesus]], who had said: &quot;If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasures in heaven; and come, follow Me.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Mt 19:21&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of the [[Evangelical counsels]]. Taking these words quite literally, Anthony gave away some of the family estate to his neighbors, sold the remaining property, donated the funds thus raised to the poor, placed his sister with a group of [[Consecrated virgin|Christian virgins]],&lt;ref&gt;Athanasius of Alexandria, Life of Antony, 3. In ''Early Christian Lives'', Carolinne White, trans. (London: Penguin Books, 1998), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; a sort of proto-nunnery at the time, and himself became the disciple of a local hermit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;&gt;Burns, Paul, ed. ''Butler's Lives of the Saints:New Full Edition'' January vol. Collegeville, MN:The Liturgical Press. ISBN 0-8146-2377-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellation &quot;Father of [[Monasticism]]&quot; is misleading, as [[Christian monasticism]] was already being practiced in the deserts of [[Egypt]]. [[Asceticism|Ascetics]] commonly retired to isolated locations on the outskirts of cities. Anthony is notable for being one of the first ascetics to attempt living in the desert proper, completely cut off from civilization. His [[Hermit|anchoretic]] lifestyle was remarkably harsher than that of his predecessors. By the 2nd century there were also famous Christian ascetics, such as [[Thecla|Saint Thecla]]. Saint Anthony decided to follow this tradition and headed out into the alkaline desert region called Nitria in Latin ([[Wadi El Natrun]] today), about {{convert|95|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]], some of the most rugged terrain of the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]]. Here he remained for some 13 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;/&gt;

Also note that the ''[[Therapeutae]]'', pagan ascetic hermits and loosely organized [[cenobitic]] communities described by the Hellenized Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] in the first century, were long established in the harsh environments by the [[Lake Mareotis]] close to Alexandria, and in other less-accessible regions. Philo understood that for &quot;this class of persons may be met with in many places, for both Greece and barbarian countries want to enjoy whatever is perfectly good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philo,''De vita contemplativa''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Athanasius, the devil fought St. Anthony by afflicting him with boredom, laziness, and the phantoms of women, which he overcame by the power of prayer, providing a theme for [[Christian art]]. After that, he moved to a tomb, where he resided and closed the door on himself, depending on some local villagers who brought him food. When the devil perceived his ascetic life and his intense worship, he was envious and beat him mercilessly, leaving him unconscious. When his friends from the local village came to visit him and found him in this condition, they carried him to a church.

After he recovered, he made a second effort and went back into the desert to a farther mountain by the [[Nile]] called [[Pispir]], now [[Der el Memun]], opposite [[Crocodilopolis]]. There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fort for some twenty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;/&gt; According to Athanasius, the devil again resumed his war against Saint Anthony, only this time the phantoms were in the form of wild beasts, wolves, lions, snakes and scorpions. They appeared as if they were about to attack him or cut him into pieces. But the saint would laugh at them scornfully and say, &quot;If any of you have any authority over me, only one would have been sufficient to fight me.&quot; At his saying this, they disappeared as though in smoke, and God gave him the victory over the devil. While in the fort he only communicated with the outside world by a crevice through which food would be passed and he would say a few words. Saint Anthony would prepare a quantity of bread that would sustain him for six months. He did not allow anyone to enter his cell; whoever came to him stood outside and listened to his advice.

[[Image:Antoniusaltaar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The former main altar of the hermitage church in [[Warfhuizen]] in the [[Netherlands]] with a mural of Anthony Abbot and a [[reliquary]] with some of his [[relic]]s. Since then they have been moved to a new golden shrine on a side-altar especially made for them.]]

Then one day he emerged from the fort with the help of villagers to break down the door. By this time most had expected him to have wasted away, or gone insane in his solitary confinement, but he emerged healthy, serene, and enlightened. Everyone was amazed that he had been through these trials and emerged spiritually rejuvenated. He was hailed as a hero and from this time forth the legend of Anthony began to spread and grow.

Anthony went to the [[Al Fayyum|Fayyum]] and confirmed the brethren there in the [[Christian]] faith, then returned to his old Roman fort. In 311, Anthony wished to become a [[martyr]] and went to [[Alexandria]]. He visited those who were imprisoned for the sake of [[Christ]] and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his [[Christianity]] publicly, not caring what might happen to him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be tortured and martyred, but it did not happen.

He left Alexandria to return to the old Roman fort upon the end of the persecutions. Here, many came to visit him and to hear his teachings. He saw that these visits kept him away from his worship. As a result, he went further into the [[Eastern Desert]] of [[Egypt]]. He travelled to the inner wilderness for three days, until he found a spring of water and some palm trees, and then he chose to settle there. On this spot now stands the monastery of Saint Anthony the Great. There, he anticipated the rule of [[Benedict of Nursia]] who lived about 200 years later; &quot;pray and work&quot;, by engaging himself and his disciple or disciples in manual labor. Anthony himself cultivated a garden and wove mats of [[juncus|rushes]]. He and his disciples were regularly sought out for words of enlightenment. These statements were later collected into the book of ''[[Sayings of the Desert Fathers]]''. Anthony himself is said to have spoken to those of a spiritual disposition personally, leaving the task of addressing the more worldly visitors to [[Macarius of Alexandria|Macarius]]. On occasions, he would go to the monastery on the outskirts of the desert by the [[Nile]] to visit the brethren, then return to his inner [[monastery]].

The backstory of one of the surviving epistles, directed to [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], recounts how the fame of Saint Anthony spread abroad and reached Emperor Constantine. The Emperor wrote to him offering him praise and asking him to pray for him. The brethren were pleased with the Emperor's letter, but Anthony did not pay any attention to it, and he said to them, &quot;The books of God, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, commands us every day, but we do not heed what they tell us, and we turn our backs on them.&quot; Under the persistence of the brethren who told him, &quot;Emperor Constantine loves the church,&quot; he accepted to write him a letter blessing him, and praying for the peace and safety of the empire and the church.

[[Image:Piero di Cosimo 025.jpg|thumb|Painting of Saint Anthony, a part of ''The Visitation with [[Saint Nicholas]] and Saint Anthony Abbot'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], ''ca''. 1480.]]

According to Athanasius, Saint Anthony heard a voice telling him, &quot;Go out and see.&quot; He went out and saw an angel who wore a girdle with a cross, one resembling the holy Eskiem ([[Tonsure]] or [[Schema (Orthodoxy)|Schema]]), and on his head was a head cover (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, &quot;Anthony, do this and you will rest.&quot; Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never got bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution that was about to happen to the church and the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its formal glory, and the end of the age. When [[Macarius of Alexandria|Saint Macarius]] visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him. When the day drew near of the departure of [[Paul of Thebes|Saint Paul the First Hermit]] in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St Athanasius the Apostolic]], the 20th [[List of Patriarchs of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria]].

In 338, he was summoned by Athanasius of Alexandria to help refute the teachings of [[Arius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;/&gt;

==Final days==

When Saint Anthony felt that the day of his departure had approached, he commanded his disciples to give his staff to [[Macarius of Egypt|Saint Macarius]], and to give one [[Sheepskin (material)|sheepskin]] cloak to [[Saint Athanasius]] and the other sheepskin cloak to [[Saint Serapion of Thmuis|Saint Serapion]], his disciple. He further instructed his disciples to bury his body in an unmarked, secret [[Grave (burial)|grave]], lest the Egyptians divide his body in pieces, as was the custom in Egypt.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} He stretched himself on the ground and gave up his spirit. Saint Anthony the Great lived for 105 years and departed on the year 356.

He probably spoke only his native language, [[Coptic language|Coptic]], but his sayings were spread in a [[Greek language|Greek]] translation. He himself left no writings. His biography was written by [[Saint Athanasius]] and titled ''Life of Saint Anthony the Great''. Many stories are also told about him in various collections of sayings of the [[Desert Fathers]].

Though Anthony himself did not organize or create a monastery, a community grew around him based on his example of living an [[asceticism|ascetic]] and isolated life. Athanasius' biography helped propagate Anthony's ideals. Athanasius writes, &quot;For monks, the life of Anthony is a sufficient example of [[asceticism]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;/&gt;

==Temptation==
[[image:The Torment of Saint Anthony (Michelangelo).jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo]] (1487-9). ''[[The Torment of Saint Anthony (Michelangelo)|The Torment of Saint Anthony]]''. Oil and tempera on panel. One of many artistic depictions of Saint Anthony's trials in the desert, this painting was copied by the young Michelangelo after an engraving by [[Martin Schongauer]]]]
{{See|The temptation of St. Anthony in visual arts}}
Famously, Anthony is said to have faced a series of supernatural [[temptation]]s during his pilgrimage to the desert. The first to report on the temptation was his contemporary [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. However, some modern scholars have argued that the demons and temptations that Anthony is reported to have faced may have been related to Athanasius by some of the simpler pilgrims who had visited him, who may have been conveying what they had been told in a manner more dramatic than it had been conveyed to them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} It is possible these events, like the paintings, are full of rich metaphor or in the case of the animals of the desert, perhaps a vision or dream. Some of the stories included in Saint Anthony's biography are perpetuated now mostly in paintings, where they give an opportunity for artists to depict their more lurid or bizarre interpretations. Many artists, including [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[Salvador Dalí]], have depicted these incidents from the life of Anthony; in prose, the tale was retold and embellished by [[Gustave Flaubert]] in ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]''. Emphasis on these stories, however, did not really begin until the [[Middle Ages]], when the psychology of the individual became of greater interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;/&gt; Below are some of these controversial tales.

===The satyr and the centaur===
Saint Anthony was on a journey in the desert to find his predecessor, [[Paul of Thebes|Saint Paul of Thebes]]. Saint Anthony had been under the impression that he was the first person to ever dwell in the desert; however, due to a vision, Saint Anthony was called into the desert to find his predecessor, Saint Paul. On his way there he ran into two demons in the forms of a [[centaur]] and a [[satyr]]. Many works of art depict Saint Anthony meeting with this centaur and satyr. Western theology considers these demons to have been temptations. At any rate, he was stopped by these demons and asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot; To that the satyr replied, &quot;I am a mortal, one of those whom the gentiles call Fauns, Satyrs and Incubi, I am on a mission from my flock. We request thee to pray for us unto the common God, whom ye know to have come for the salvation of the world, and whose praise is sounded all over the earth.&quot; Rejoicing at the glory of Christ, St. Anthony, turning his face towards Alexandria...  In the end, the centaur showed Saint Anthony the way to his destination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11590b.htm St. Paul the Hermit], Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver and gold===
Another time Saint Anthony was traveling in the desert he found a plate of silver coins in his path. He pondered for a moment as to why a plate of silver coins would be out in the desert where no one else travels. Then he realized the devil must have laid it out there to tempt him. To that he said, &quot;Ha! Devil, thou weenest to tempt me and deceive me, but it shall not be in thy power.&quot; Once he said this, the plate of silver vanished. Saint Anthony continued walking along and saw a pile of gold in his way which the devil had laid there to deceive him. Saint Anthony cast the pile of gold into a fire, and it vanished just like the silver coins did. After these events, Saint Anthony had a vision where the whole world was full of snares and traps. He cried to the Lord, &quot;Oh good Lord, who may escape from these snares?&quot; A voice said back to him, &quot;humility shall escape them without more. &quot;

===Demons in the cave===
One time Saint Anthony tried hiding in a cave to escape the demons that plagued him. There were so many little demons in the cave though that Saint Anthony's servant had to carry him out because they had beaten him to death. When the hermits were gathered to Saint Anthony's corpse to mourn his death, Saint Anthony was revived. He demanded that his servants take him back to that cave where the demons had beaten him. When he got there he called out to the demons, and they came back as wild beasts to rip him to shreds. All of a sudden a bright light flashed, and the demons ran away. Saint Anthony knew that the light must have come from God, and he asked God where was he before when the demons attacked him. God replied, &quot;I was here but I would see and abide to see thy battle, and because thou hast manly fought and well maintained thy battle, I shall make thy name to be spread through all the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden153.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
[[Image:Vaantjeantoniuswarfhuizenkleiner copy.jpg|left|thumb|Pilgrimage banners from the shrine in [[Warfhuizen]]]]
He was secretly buried on the mountain-top where he had chosen to live. His remains were reportedly discovered in 361, and transferred to [[Alexandria]]. Some time later, they were taken from Alexandria to [[Constantinople]], so that they might escape the destruction being perpetrated by invading [[Saracen]]s. Later, in the eleventh century, the emperor gave them to the [[France|French]] [[count]] Jocelin. Jocelin had them transferred to La-Motte-Saint-Didier, which was then renamed [[Saint-Antoine-en-Dauphiné]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;/&gt; There, Anthony is credited with assisting in a number of miraculous healings, primarily from [[ergotism]], which became known as &quot;[[St. Anthony's Fire]]&quot;. He was credited by two local noblemen of assisting them in recovery from the disease. They then founded the [[Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony]] in honour of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;/&gt; Veneration of Anthony in the East is more restrained. There are comparatively few icons and paintings of him. He is regarded as the &quot;first master of the desert and the pinnacle of holy monks&quot;, however, and there are monastic communities of the Maronite, Chaldean, and Orthodox churches which state that they follow his monastic rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler's&quot;/&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], Anthony, along with [[Quirinus of Neuss]], [[Saint Cornelius|Cornelius]] and [[Hubertus]], was venerated as one of the [[Four Holy Marshals]] (''Vier Marschälle Gottes'') in the [[Rhineland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienQ/Quirinus_von_Rom_von_Neuss.htm Quirinus von Rom (von Neuss) - Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soetele.de/links/quellen/kalvarien/muhresoat/marschaelle/marschaelle.html marschaelle&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrdorf.de/html/body_die_kapelle.html Die Kapelle&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coptic literature==
Examples of purely [[Coptic literature]] are the works of Saint Anthony and Saint [[Pachomius]], who only spoke Coptic, and the sermons and preachings of [[Saint Shenouda the Archmandrite]], who chose to only write in Coptic. Saint Shenouda was a popular leader who only spoke to the Egyptians in [[Egyptian language]] ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]), the language of the repressed, not in Greek, the language of the rulers.

The earliest original writings in [[Coptic language]] were the letters by Saint Anthony. During the 3rd and 4th centuries many ecclesiastics and monks wrote in Coptic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026215/Coptic-literature Encyclopedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amblypoda''' is a taxonomic hypothesis uniting a group of extinct, herbivorous [[mammal]]s. They were considered a suborder of the primitive [[ungulate]] mammals and have since been shown to represent a [[polyphyletic]] group.

==Characteristics==
The Amblypoda take their name from their short and stumpy feet, which were furnished with five toes each and supported massive pillar-like limbs. The brain cavity was extremely small and insignificant in comparison to the bodily mass, which was equal to that of the largest [[rhinoceros]]es. These animals were, in fact, descendants of the small ancestral ungulates that retained all the primitive characteristics of the latter, accompanied by a huge increase in body size. 

The Amblypoda were confined to the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] periods and occurred in [[North America]], [[Asia]] (especially [[Mongolia]]) and [[Europe]]. The cheek teeth were short-crowned ([[brachyodont]]), with the tubercles more-or-less completely fused into transverse ridges, or cross-crests ([[lophodont]] type), and the total number of teeth was in one case the typical 44, but in another was fewer. The [[vertebra]] of the neck unite on nearly flat surfaces, the [[humerus]] had lost the foramen, or perforation, at the lower end, and the third trochanter to the [[femur]] may have also been wanting. In the forelimb, the upper and lower series of [[carpal]] (finger) bones scarcely alternated, but in the hind foot, the astragalus overlapped the cuboid, while the [[fibula]], which was quite distinct from the [[tibia]] (as was the [[radius (bone)|radius]] from the [[ulna]] in the forelimb), articulated with both astragalus and calcaneum.

==Types of amblypods==
The most generalized type was ''[[Coryphodon]]'', representing the family [[Coryphodontidae]], from the lower Eocene of Europe and North America, in which there were 44 teeth and no horn-like excrescences on the long skull, while the femur had a third trochanter. The canines were somewhat elongated and were followed by a short gap in each jaw, and the cheek-teeth were adapted for succulent food. The length of the body reached about six feet in some cases. 

In the middle Eocene formations of North America occurred the more specialized ''[[Uintatherium]]'' (or ''Dinoceras''), typifying the family [[Uintatheriidae]]. Uintatheres were huge creatures with long narrow skulls, of which the elongated facial portion carried three pairs of bony horn-cores, probably covered with short horns in life, the hind-pair having been much the largest. The dental formula was i. 0/3, c. 1/1, p. 3/3·4, m. 3/3, the upper canines having been long sabre-like weapons, protected by a descending flange on each side of the lower front jaw. 

In the basal Eocene of North America, the Amblypoda were represented by extremely primitive, five-toed, small ungulates such as ''[[Periptychus]]'' and ''[[Pantolambda]]'', each of these typifying a family{{Vague|date=April 2009}}. The full typical series of 44 teeth was developed in each, but whereas in the [[Periptychidae]], the upper molars were [[bunodont]] and [[tritubercular]], in the [[Pantolambdidae]], they had assumed a [[selenodont]] structure. [[Creodonta|Creodont]] characters were displayed in the skeleton.

==Current taxonomy of animals once classified in Amblypoda==
Few authorities recognize Amblypoda in modern classifications.  The following mammals were once considered part of this group:

*Order Pholidota ([[pangolin]]s)
*Order [[Pantodonta]]
**Family [[Wangliidae]]
**Family [[Harpyodidae]]
**Family [[Bemalambdidae]]
**Family [[Pastoralodontidae]]
**Family [[Titanoideidae]]
**Family [[Pantolambdidae]] (including ''[[Pantolambda]]'')
**Family [[Barylambdidae]]
**Family [[Cyriacotheriidae]]
**Family [[Pantolambdodontidae]]
**Family [[Coryphodontidae]] (including ''[[Coryphodon]]'')

*Order [[Dinocerata]]
**Family [[Uintatheriidae]] (includes ''[[Uintatherium]]'', ''Eobasileus'', ''Tetheopsis'', etc.  ''[[Gobiatherium]]'' is sometimes placed in its own family.)

*Order [[Condylarthra]]
**Family [[Hyopsodontidae]]
**Family [[Mioclaenidae]]
**Family [[Phenacodontidae]]
**Family [[Periptychidae]] (including ''[[Periptychus]]'')
**Family [[Peligrotheriidae]]
**Family [[Didolodontidae]]

'''Amblygonite''' is a fluorophosphate mineral, (Li,Na)AlPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(F,OH), composed of [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[aluminium]], [[phosphate]], [[fluoride]] and [[hydroxide]]. The mineral occurs in [[pegmatite]] deposits and is easily mistaken for [[albite]] and other [[feldspar]]s. Its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic. Amblygonite forms a series with ''montebrasite'', the low fluorine endmember. Geologic occurrence is in [[granite]] pegmatites, high-temperature [[tin]] veins, and [[greisen]]s. Amblygonite occurs with [[spodumene]], [[apatite]], [[lepidolite]], [[tourmaline]], and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins.  It contains about 10% lithium, and has been utilized as a source of lithium. The chief commercial sources have historically been the deposits of California and France.

==History==
The mineral was first discovered in [[Saxony]] by [[August Breithaupt]] in 1817, and named by him from the Greek ''amblus'', blunt, and ''gouia'', angle, because of the obtuse angle between the cleavages. Later it was found at Montebras, Creuse, [[France]], and at Hebron in [[Maine]]; and because of slight differences in optical character and chemical composition the names montebrasite and hebronite have been applied to the mineral from these localities.  It has been discovered in considerable quantity at Pala in San Diego county, [[California]];  Caceres, [[Spain]]; and the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]]. The largest documented single crystal of amblygonite measured 7.62x2.44x1.83 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and weighed ~102 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| page = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P. C. Rickwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gemology==
Transparent amblygonite has been faceted and used as a gemstone. As a gemstone set into jewelry it is vulnerable to breakage and abrasion from general wear, as its hardness and toughness are poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRG&quot;/&gt; The main sources for gem material are [[Brazil]] and the [[U.S.]]. [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Namibia]], [[Norway]], and [[Spain]] have also produced gem quality amblygonite.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRG&quot;/&gt;

==Chemistry==
Amygdalin is extracted from almond or apricot kernel cake by boiling in [[ethanol]]; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of [[diethyl ether]], amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Liebig and Wöhler were already able to find three decomposition products of the newly discovered amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid ([[hydrogen cyanide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later research showed that [[sulfuric acid]] decomposes it into [[Glucose|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]], [[benzaldehyde]], and prussic acid; while [[hydrochloric acid]] gives [[mandelic acid]], &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose, and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; 

The decomposition induced by enzymes may occur in two ways.  [[Maltase]] partially decomposes it, giving &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose and [[mandelic nitrile glucoside]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH(CN)O·C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;; this compound is isomeric with [[sambunigrin]], a glucoside found by E.E. Bourquelot and Danjou in the berries of the [[Common Elder]], ''Sambucus nigra''. [[Emulsin]], on the other hand, decomposes it into [[benzaldehyde]], [[cyanide]], and two molecules of [[glucose]]; this [[enzyme]] occurs in the [[bitter almond]], and consequently the seeds invariably contain free cyanide and benzaldehyde.  An &quot;[[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] amygdalin&quot; is said to occur in the [[Prunus laurocerasus|cherry laurel (''Prunus laurocerasus'')]].  Closely related to these [[glucoside]]s is [[dhurrin]], C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;N, isolated by W. Dunstan and T. A. Henry from the common [[sorghum]] or &quot;great millet,&quot; ''Sorghum vulgare''; this substance is decomposed by [[emulsin]] or hydrochloric acid into &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose, cyanide, and [[4-hydroxybenzaldehyde]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Natural amygdalin has the ''R'' configuration at the [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[benzyl]] center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center [[epimerizes]]; the ''S'' epimer is called '''neoamygdalin'''.&lt;ref name=fenselau/&gt;

==Toxicity==
The metabolism of amygdalin produces [[hydrogen cyanide]], a potent toxin. [[Amygdalin beta-glucosidase|Beta-glucosidase]], one of the enzymes that catalyzes the release of cyanide from amygdalin, is present in the human small intestine and in a variety of common foods. This leads to an unpredictable and potentially lethal toxicity when amygdalin or laetrile is taken orally.&lt;ref name=CaCancer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Newmark J, Brady RO, Grimley PM, Gal AE, Waller SG, Thistlethwaite JR |title=Amygdalin (Laetrile) and prunasin beta-glucosidases: distribution in germ-free rat and in human tumor tissue |journal=Proc.

Some laetrile promoters have claimed that the cyanide generated by laetrile is harmlessly detoxified by the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]]. However, these claims are false, as regardless of the level of rhodanese present, the body's available stores of [[cystine]], [[cysteine]], and other sulfates necessary to detoxify cyanide are rapidly depleted in laetrile poisoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajcn&quot;/&gt;

==Cancer treatment==
Amygdalin was first isolated in 1830. In 1845 it was used as a cancer treatment in Russia, and in the 1920s in the United States, but it was considered too poisonous.&lt;ref name=CancerInstitute/&gt; In the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative,&lt;ref name=patent&gt;{{Cite journal | inventor-last = Krebs | inventor-first =Ernst T. | inventor2-last =Krebs, Jr. | inventor2-first =Ernst T. | date = May 23, 1961 | title = Hexuronic acid derivatives | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2985664.html | country-code = US | patent-number = 2985664}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later marketed as laetrile for cancer treatment.&lt;ref name=CancerInstitute/&gt;

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] prohibited the interstate shipment of amygdalin and laetrile in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Daniel|title= Reputation and Power: Organizational Image and Pharmaceutical Regulation at the FDA.

=== Initial studies at Sloan-Kettering ===
In 1972, [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] (MSKCC) board member [[Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.]] convinced the hospital to test laetrile so that he could assure others of its ineffectiveness &quot;with some conviction.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wade1977/&gt; [[Kanematsu Sugiura]], the scientist who performed the requested tests, found that laetrile inhibited secondary tumors in mice, though it did not destroy the primary tumors. He repeated the experiment several times with the same results. However, three other researchers were unable to [[reproducibility|confirm]] Sugiura's results. While these uncontrolled and inconclusive results were considered too preliminary to publish, they were leaked to laetrile advocates, resulting in significant public attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade1977&quot;/&gt;

To expand on Sugiura's results, MSKCC researchers conducted a [[Scientific control|controlled]] experiment in which they injected some mice with laetrile (as Sugiura had done) and others with [[placebo]]. Sugiura, who was [[Double-blind#Double-blind_trials|unaware of which mice had received laetrile]], performed the pathologic analysis. In this controlled, blinded follow-up of Sugiura's initial uncontrolled experiment, laetrile showed no more activity than placebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade1977&quot;/&gt;

Subsequently, laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems without evidence of effectiveness. Given this collection of results, MSKCC concluded that &quot;laetrile showed no beneficial effects.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wade1977/&gt; Mistakes in the MSKCC press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents led by [[Ralph W. Moss (science writer)|Ralph Moss]], former public affairs official of MSKCC who was fired following his appearance at a press conference accusing the hospital of covering up the benefits of laetrile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budiansky1995&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Budiansky | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Cures or Quackery: How Senator Harkin shaped federal research on alternative medicine | date=1995-07-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/950717/archive_032434.htm | work =US News and World Report | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mistakes were considered scientifically inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in ''Science'' stated that &quot;even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wade1977&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wade N |title=Laetrile at Sloan-Kettering: A Question of Ambiguity |journal=Science |volume=198 |issue=4323 |pages=1231–4 |year=1977 |month=December |pmid=17741690 |doi=10.1126/science.198.4323.1231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from these studies were published all together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stock CC, Tarnowski GS, Schmid FA, Hutchison DJ, Teller MN |title=Antitumor tests of amygdalin in transplantable animal tumor systems |journal=J Surg Oncol |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=81–8 |year=1978 |pmid=642516  |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112720432/issue |doi=10.1002/jso.2930100202}}&lt;br/&gt;

=== Subsequent clinical studies ===

A 2006 [[systematic review]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded: &quot;The claim that [l]aetrile has beneficial effects for cancer patients is not supported by data from controlled clinical trials. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for randomised or controlled clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of [l]aetrile or amygdalin for cancer treatment.&quot;&lt;ref name=CochraneReview&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milazzo S, Ernst E, Lejeune S, Schmidt K |title=Laetrile treatment for cancer |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=2 |pages=CD005476 |year=2006 |pmid=16625640 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005476.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the lack of evidence, laetrile has not been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=ncifaq/&gt; 

The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] evaluated the evidence separately and concluded that clinical trials of amgydalin showed little or no effect against cancer.&lt;ref name =CancerInstitute&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/allpages#Section_20 Laetrile/Amygdalin - National Cancer Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 1982 trial of 175 patients found that tumor size had increased in all but one patient [http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/laetrile]. The authors reported that &quot;the hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range.&quot;&lt;ref name=Moertel82/&gt;
  
The study concluded &quot;Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment&quot;.

=== Advocacy and legality ===

Although laetrile is widely considered [[quackery]] in the [[Consensus (medical)|medical community]], advocates for laetrile dispute this label, asserting that there is a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] between the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the medical community, including the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Cancer Society]], to exploit the American people, and especially cancer patients.&lt;ref name=ConsumerReports&gt;{{Citation  | last = Editors of Consumer Reports Books | title = Health Quackery | place = Vernon, New York | publisher = Consumers Union | year = 1980 | chapter = Laetrile: the Political Success of a Scientific Failure | pages = 16–40 | isbn = 0-89043-014-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some North American cancer patients have traveled to [[Mexico]] for treatment with the substance, allegedly under the auspices of Dr. [[Ernesto Contreras (physician)|Ernesto Contreras]].&lt;ref name=Moss2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moss RW |title=Patient perspectives: Tijuana cancer clinics in the post-NAFTA era |journal=Integr Cancer Ther |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=65–86 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15695477 |doi=10.1177/1534735404273918 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these patients was actor [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]], who died in Mexico following treatment with laetrile and surgery to remove a stomach tumour while undergoing treatment for [[mesothelioma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/health/15essa.html?ex=1289710800&amp;en=8059981c17deec5d&amp;ei=5088|title=McQueen's Legacy of Laetrile|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2005-11-15 | first=Barron H. | last=Lerner | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Running amok''', sometimes referred to as simply '''amok'''&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid984220&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carr JE, Tan EK |title=In search of the true amok: amok as viewed with the Malay culture |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=133 |issue=11 |pages=1295–9 |year=1976 |month=November |pmid=984220 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=984220}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also spelled '''amuk''', from the [[Malay language|Malay]] meaning &quot;mad with uncontrollable [[rage (emotion)|rage]]&quot;) is a term for a [[killing spree]] perpetrated by an individual out of rage or resentment over perceived mistreatment.

The syndrome of &quot;Amok&quot; is found in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV TR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Appendix I: Outline for Cultural Formulation and Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|title=Appendix I: Outline for Cultural Formulation and Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes|volume=1|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890423349.7060|url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=14123&amp;searchStr=amok#14123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is often used in a less serious manner in relation to someone or something that is out of control and causing trouble (e.g., a dog tearing up the living room furniture might be said to be running amok). Such usage does not imply murderous actions, and any emotional implications (e.g., rage, fear, excitement) must be gleaned from context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/amuck Dictionary.com (definition 3b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysian origin==
Amok originated from the Malay word mengamok, which roughly defined means “to make a furious and desperate charge” much like the ancient Norse berserker warriors practiced before going into battle. &lt;ref&gt;Hempel, A. A., Levine, R. D., Meloy, J. D., &amp; Westermeyer, J. D. (2000). Cross-cultural review of sudden mass assault by a single individual in the oriental and occidental cultures. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 45(3), 582-588.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malay culture, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief. They believed that amok was caused by the hantu belian, which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act, as a result of the belief, those in Malaysian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after effects with no ill will towards the assailant.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Martin, Michael. (1999) Running amok: A modern perspective on a culture-bound syndrome. Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Retrieved April 28, 2011, from  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181064/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic [[culture-bound syndrome]] in [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysian culture]]. In a typical case of ''running amok'', a male who has shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence will acquire a weapon, traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently a variety of weapons are used, and, in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters. Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders, or committing [[suicide], citing theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized. For those who do not commit suicide or are killed typically black out and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

The western world was made known of amok upon reading the journals of Captain James Cook, who was a British explorer in the mid to late 18th century.  He discovered firsthand the practice of amok in 1770 during his voyage around the world. He wrote about witnessing individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and “indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack.” &lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, Y. (Ed.).(2006). Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology . University of Kansas: Sage Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely accepted explanation links  amok  with  male [[honor]] (amok by women is virtually unknown). 
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.  
Some observers have related this explanation to [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]]'s ban on suicide, which, it is suggested, drove Malay men to create circumstances in which [[suicide by cop|others would kill them]].

== Contemporary syndrome ==
&quot;Running amok&quot; is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities. The slang term [[going postal]] is similar in scope. 
Police describe such an event as a [[spree killer|killing spree]]. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often [[suicide by cop]].

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15014687&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saint Martin ML |title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=66–70 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=15014687 |pmc=181064 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1427677&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gaw AC, Bernstein RL |title=Classification of amok in DSM-IV |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=789–93 |year=1992 |month=August |pmid=1427677 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1427677}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors.  Other reported culture-bound syndromes are [[latah]] and [[Penis panic|koro]].  Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).

==Link between amok and mental health==
Amok is traditionally thought to be a culture bound syndrome specific to Malaysia, but upon further investigations and research of various case studies has lead many experts to believe that it is in fact not a culture bound syndrome, but rather a result of mental health issues.
Dr. Pow Meng Yap, a psychiatrist for the Hong Kong Government, wrote that since amok is typically preceded by a period of reflection and brooding, and if the attacker wasn’t killed or killed themselves in the process, they would collapse and upon gaining consciousness, would cite amnesia. Thus leading him to conclude amok is a type of “depressive disorder or a dissociative disorder.” For a condition to be fully culture bound it cannot be found in any other distinctive culture and the culture must be indispensable to its pathogenesis, which in the case of amok, has never been true. A similar study by Jin-Inn Teoh, of University of Aberdeen in London, stated that amok or amok like behavior has occurred in all countries around the world. There were small discrepancies and variances in the weapons and techniques used. Teoh says that culture has a distinct role in how the act is manifested, but no role in if the act occurs or not. Teoh’s study was the last of its kind in major psychiatric literature, but since its publishing, the spread, or reporting of amok worldwide has only grown. &lt;ref&gt;Saint Martin, Michael.

==Officially classified as a psychiatric condition==
Amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition in 1849 based on the numerous reports and case studies which showed that the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Martin, Michael. (1999) Running amok: A modern perspective on a culture-bound syndrome.Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Retrieved April 28, 2011, from  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181064/&lt;/ref&gt; However, DSM-IV-TR does not break amok down into two official categories, as many feel it is. The two forms are; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders.
Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person or society for a wide variety of reasons.Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, such as bi-polar disease, and other forms of delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Martin, Michael. (1999) Running amok: A modern perspective on a culture-bound syndrome.Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Retrieved April 28, 2011, from  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181064/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical and cross-cultural comparanda ==
Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers facing apparently inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.  This form of amok appears to resemble the [[berserker]] of the [[Norsemen|Norse]], the cafard or cathard (Polynesia), mal de pelea (Puerto Rico), and [[iich'aa]] (Navaho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/ant100/pdf/MedicalAnthropology.pdf|title=Medical Antropology: Culture-bound syndromes|accessdate=2009-04-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Indonesia, the term amok (amuk) generally refers not to individual violence, but to apparently frenzied violence by mobs.  Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok.

Norse berserkers and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.  The 1911 ''Webster Encyclopedia'' comments:

''In 1634, the eldest son of the [[raja]] of [[Jodhpur]] ran amok at the court of [[Shah Jahan]], failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.''

[[File:Creed-apos.jpg|thumb|The Apostles' Creed]]
The '''Apostles' Creed''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''Symbolum Apostolorum'' or ''Symbolum Apostolicum''), sometimes titled '''Symbol of the Apostles''', is an early statement of [[Christianity|Christian]] belief, a [[creed]] or &quot;symbol&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Not in the sense that the word &quot;symbol&quot; has in modern English, but in the original meaning of the word, derived from &quot;Latin ''symbolum'', sign, token, from Greek σύμβολον, token for identification (by comparing with its counterpart), from συμβάλλειν, to throw together, compare&quot; [http://www.bartleby.com/61/74/S0957400.html (The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language)].&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used by a number of [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechesis|catechetical]] purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition, including the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and [[Western Orthodoxy]]. It is also used by [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].

The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[Canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Because of its early origin, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the later [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian Creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[God the Son|Jesus]] or of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. This makes it acceptable to many [[Arianism|Arians]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Nor does it address many other theological questions that became objects of dispute centuries later.

The name of the Creed may come from the probably [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th-century]] tradition that, under the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit]] after [[Pentecost]], each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] dictated part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/apostles_creed_orr.html |title=James Orr: ''The Apostles' Creed'', in International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |publisher=Reformed.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally divided into twelve articles.

==Origins==
The title, ''Symbolum Apostolicum'' (Symbol or Creed of the Apostles), appears for the first time in a letter from a Council in [[Early centers of Christianity#Milan|Milan]] (probably written by [[Ambrose]] himself) to [[Pope Siricius]] in about 390: &quot;Let them give credit to the Creed of the Apostles, which the Roman Church has always kept and preserved undefiled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=St. Ambrose of Milan |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_05_letters41_50.htm#Letter42 |title=St. Ambrose of Milan, Letter 42:5 |publisher=Tertullian.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC&gt;''Apostles' Creed'' in Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005, ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; But what existed at that time was not what is now known as the Apostles' Creed but a shorter statement of belief that, for instance, did not include the phrase &quot;maker of heaven and earth&quot;, a phrase that may have been inserted only in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=C4I9AAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22inserted+primarily%22&amp;pgis=1 Gardiner Mumford Day,The Apostles' Creed: an interpretation for today] (Scribner, 1963), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the origin of this creed, the forerunner and principal source of the Apostles' Creed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=woD7QYAjV3QC Arthur Cushman McGiffert, The Apostles' Creed: Its Origin, Its Purpose, and Its Historical Interpretation] (2008 ISBN 0559851995), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; as having been jointly created by the Apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, with each of the twelve contributing one of the articles, was already current at that time.&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC/&gt;

The earlier text evolved from simpler texts based on {{bibleverse||Matthew|28:19}},&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC/&gt; part of the [[Great Commission]], and it has been argued that it was already in written form by the late [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] (c. 180).&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Documents of the Christian Church,'' 2nd edn, edited by Henry Bettenson (London, 1963), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Lynch, ''The Medieval Church'' (Longman: London and NY, 1992), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the individual statements of belief that are included in the Apostles' Creed – even those not found in the [[Old Roman Symbol]] – are found in various writings by [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Novatian]], [[Marcellus of Ancyra|Marcellus]], [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], [[Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Nicetus]], and [[Eusebius Gallus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.iv.i.i.v.html |title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume II. The History of Creeds. &amp;#124; Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest appearance of what we know as the Apostles' Creed was in the ''De singulis libris canonicis scarapsus'' (&quot;''Excerpt from Individual Canonical Books''&quot;) of [[Saint Pirmin|St. Pirminius]] ([[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' 89, 1029 ff.), written between 710 and 714.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Creeds'', third edition, (London: Longman, Green &amp; Co, 1972), 398–434&lt;/ref&gt; Bettenson and Maunder state that is first from ''Dicta Abbatis Pirminii de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus'' (''idem quod excarpsus'', excerpt), c.750.&lt;ref&gt;Bettenson, Henry, and Chris Maunder. Documents of the Christian Church. 3 ed. New York: Oxford University Press, USA, 1999. p. 26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This longer Creed seems to have arisen in what is now France and Spain. [[Charlemagne]] imposed it throughout his dominions, and it was finally accepted in Rome, where the Old Roman Creed or similar formulas had survived for centuries.&lt;ref name=ODCC:AC/&gt; It has been argued nonetheless that it dates from the second half of the 5th century, though no earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newadvent&quot;&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, Origin of the Creed. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01629a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the Apostles' Creed was spliced together with phrases from the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Trillhaas, &quot;Creeds, Lutheran Attitude Toward&quot; in '''The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church''' edited by Julius Bodensieck (Minneapolis: Augsburg, Vol. A-E, p. 629)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the phrase &quot;descendit ad inferos&quot; ([[Harrowing of Hell|&quot;he descended into hell&quot;]]) echoes {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:9|NIV}}, &quot;κατέβη εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς&quot; (&quot;he descended into the lower, earthly regions&quot;).

This phrase and that on the [[communion of saints]] are articles found in the Apostles' Creed, but not in the Old Roman Symbol nor in the Nicene Creed.

==Musical settings==
Musical settings of the Symbolum Apostolorum as a [[motet]] are rare. The French composer Le Brung published one Latin setting in 1540, the Spanish composer [[Fernando de las Infantas]] published two in 1578.

More recently, in 1979 [[John Michael Talbot]], a Catholic Monk, composed and recorded &quot;Creed&quot; on his album, ''The Lord's Supper''. [[Rich Mullins]] and [[Beaker (musician)|Beaker]] also composed a musical setting titled &quot;Creed&quot;, released on Mullins' 1993 album ''[[A Liturgy, a Legacy, &amp; a Ragamuffin Band]]''.

==English translations==
===Catholic Church===
The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' gives the following English translation of the Apostles' Creed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c3a2.htm#credo |title=English translation of the Apostles' Creed in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|publisher=Va |date=1997-03-25 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its discussion of the Creed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P14.HTM |title=Part I, Section II |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Catechism maintains the traditional division into twelve articles, the numbering of which is here added to the text.

:1. I believe in [[God the Father|God, the Father]] almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
:2. I believe in [[Jesus Christ]], his only Son, our Lord.
:3. He was conceived by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] and born of the [[Virgin Mary]].
:4. He suffered under [[Pontius Pilate]], was crucified, died, and was buried.
:5. He [[Harrowing of Hell|descended to the dead]]. On the third day [[Resurrection of Jesus|he rose again]].

:8. I believe in the Holy Spirit,
:9. the holy catholic Church, the communion of [[saints]],
:10. the forgiveness of [[sins]],
:11. the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection of the body]],
:12. and life everlasting.
:[[Amen]].

===Church of England===
In the [[Church of England]] there are currently two authorized forms of the creed: that of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (1662) and that of ''[[Common Worship]]'' (2000).

===Presbyterian Church===
The Presbyterian Church uses the same text as is in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, but with the modernized spelling &quot;catholic&quot; and some changes from upper to lowercase letters.

{{Lutheranism}}

===Lutheran Church===
:I believe in God, the Father Almighty,

::and the life everlasting. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'', (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 2006), 159, 175, 192, 207; ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'', (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1982), 142, 167, 186; The [[Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod]] has a slightly different text posted on their website [http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=3355], and the version used by the [http://www.german-lutherans-melbourne.asn.au/en/16311e_confapost.shtml German Lutheran Trinity Church Melbourne] is also slightly different.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, uses the ELLC ecumenical version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/communication/creeds/apostles.html |title=The Apostles Creed from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's Web site |publisher=Elca.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase &quot;he descended to the dead&quot; is footnoted to indicate the alternate reading: &quot;or 'he descended into hell,' another translation of this text in widespread use&quot;. It does not alter the phrase &quot;the holy catholic church&quot;. The ELLC version is also used in the ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', which is the primary worship resource for the ELCA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Resources/ELCA-Worship-Books/ELW.aspx |title=''Evangelical Lutheran Worship'' webpage |publisher=Elca.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worship.ca |title=ELC Canada worship webpage |publisher=Worship.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], in its current hymnal ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' includes the phrase &quot;he descended into hell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=3355 Apostles' Creed | The Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Danish National Church]] still uses the phrase &quot;I renounce the devil and all his works and all his ways&quot; as the beginning of this creed, before the line &quot;I believe in God etc.&quot;. This is mostly due to the influence of [[Grundtvig]]. See [[:da:Den apostolske trosbekendelse|(da)]].

===Unity of the Brethren===
In the version recited by Unity churches, the only variation from the Lutheran Creed is &quot;I believe in the holy Christian Church,&quot; instead of the &quot;catholic Church.&quot;

===United Methodist Church===
The [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services. The version which is most often used is located at #881 in the ''[[United Methodist Hymnal]]'', one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to [[John Wesley]], founder of [[Methodism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |title=Catalyst: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher=Catalystresources.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |title=Catalyst: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher=Catalystresources.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable for omitting the line &quot;he descended into hell&quot;, but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version. The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version (see below), which includes &quot;he descended to the dead.&quot;

:I believe in God the Father Almighty,
:maker of heaven and earth;

:And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord:
:who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
:born of the Virgin Mary,
:suffered under Pontius Pilate,
:was crucified, dead, and buried;
:the third day he rose from the dead;
:he ascended into heaven,
:and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;
:from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

:I believe in the Holy Spirit,
:the holy catholic church,&lt;ref&gt;Understood by Methodists as referring to the [[Christian Church]] in general&lt;/ref&gt;
:the communion of saints,
:the forgiveness of sins,
:the resurrection of the body,
:and the life everlasting. Amen.

The ''United Methodist Hymnal'' also contains (at #882) what it terms the &quot;Ecumenical Version&quot; of this creed—a version which is identical to that found in the Episcopal Church's current ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use.

===Ecumenical version of the English Language Liturgical Consultation===
The [[English Language Liturgical Consultation]] (ELLC) is an international ecumenical group whose primary purpose is to provide ecumenically accepted texts for those who use English in their liturgy. In 1988 it produced a translation of the Apostles' Creed, distinguished among other things by its avoidance of the word &quot;his&quot; in relation to God. The text is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewingworship.org/resources/ELLC/texts/apostles_creed.html |title=Worship - Evangelical Lutheran Church in America |publisher=Renewingworship.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:I believe in God, the Father almighty,
::creator of heaven and earth.

:I believe in Jesus Christ, God's only Son, our Lord,
::who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
::born of the Virgin Mary,

::was crucified, died, and was buried;
::he descended into hell.
::On the third day he rose again;
::he ascended into heaven,
::he is seated at the right hand of the Father,

::and the life everlasting. Amen.

==Liturgical use in Western Christianity==
The liturgical communities in western Christianity that derive their rituals from the [[Roman Missal]], including those particular communities which use the Roman Missal itself (Roman Catholics), the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' ([[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] / Episcopalians), the ''Lutheran Book of Worship'' ([[ELCA]] [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]), ''Lutheran Service Book'' ([[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod|Missouri-Synod Lutherans]]), use the Apostles' Creed and interrogative forms of it in their rites of [[Baptism]], which they consider to be the first [[sacrament]] of initiation into the Church.

===Roman Catholic Church===
====Rite of Baptism====
An interrogative form of the Apostles' Creed is used in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). The minister of baptism asks the following questions ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974):
:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?
:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?
:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?

To each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers &quot;I do.&quot; Then the celebrant says:
:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And all respond: Amen.

====Profession of faith at Mass====
Since the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the [[Roman Missal]] with the indication, &quot;Instead of the [[Nicene Creed|Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]], especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles’ Creed, may be used.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clerus.org/bibliaclerusonline/en/emy.htm#b5k |title=Order of Mass, 19 |publisher=Clerus.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the Nicene Creed was the only profession of faith that the Missal gave for use at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], except in Masses for children; but in some countries use of the Apostles' Creed was already permitted.

===Church of England===
The Apostles' Creed is used in the non-Eucharistic services of [[Matins]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] ([[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]]). It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the [[Canticles#Anglican|Canticles]], and it is the only part of the services in which the congregation is required to turn and face the front of the church building, if they are seated transversely in the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]].

===Episcopal Church (United States)===
The [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] uses the Apostles' Creed as a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. Regardless of age, candidates are to be sponsored by parents and/or godparents. Youths able to understand the significance of the Rite may go through the ritual speaking for themselves. Younger children and infants rely on their sponsors to act upon their behalf.

1. The celebrant calls for the candidates for Baptism to be presented.

2. The catechumen or sponsors state their request for Baptism.

3a. If the catechumen is of age, the celebrant will ask him or her if he or she desires Baptism, to which the catechumen will respond: &quot;I do.&quot;

3b. If the candidate relies on sponsors, the celebrant asks them if they will raise the child in &quot;the Christian faith and life&quot; (ECUSA BCP), and will raise the child through &quot;prayers and witness to grow into the full stature of Christ&quot; to which the parents will state to each, &quot;I will, with God's help.&quot;

4. A series of questions is then asked, to which the reply is always &quot;I renounce them&quot;:

:''Do you renounce [[Satan]] and all the spiritual forces of wickedness that rebel against God?''
:''Do you renounce the evil powers of this world which corrupt and destroy the creatures of God?''
:''Do you renounce all [[sin]]ful desires that draw you from the love of God?''

5. The second half of the query is asked, to which the reply is always &quot;I do&quot;:

:''Do you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your [[salvation|Savior]]?''
:''Do you put your whole trust in his [[divinity|grace]] and [[love]]?''
:''Do you promise to follow and obey him as your Lord?''

6. The Apostles' Creed is then recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, 'Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?'

===Lutheran Church===
[[Lutheran]]s, like Roman Catholics, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacramental Rite of Baptism:

:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth?
:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead?
:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting?

Following each question, the candidate answers by saying &quot;Yes, I believe&quot;. If the candidate is a child, the godparents are to answer the questions.&lt;ref&gt;''Lutheran Service Book'', &quot;Rite of Baptism&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amicable numbers''' are two different [[number]]s so related that the [[addition|sum]] of the [[proper divisor]]s of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer divisor other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.) A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an [[aliquot sequence]] of [[Periodic sequence|period]] 2. A related concept is that of a [[perfect number]], which is a number which equals the sum of ''its own'' proper divisors, in other words a number which forms an aliquot sequence of period 1. Numbers that are members of an aliquot sequence with period greater than 2 are known as [[sociable number]]s.

For example, the smallest pair of amicable numbers is ([[220 (number)|220]], [[284 (number)|284]]); for the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142, of which the sum is 220.

The first few amicable pairs are: (220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924), (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368) {{OEIS|id=A063990}}.

==History==
Amicable numbers were known to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], who credited them with many mystical properties. A general formula by which some of these numbers could be derived was invented circa 850 by [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (826-901). Other Arab mathematicians who studied amicable numbers are [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti|al-Majriti]] (died 1007), [[Ibn Tahir al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]] (980-1037), and [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī|al-Fārisī]] (1260–1320). The [[Iran]]ian mathematician [[Muhammad Baqir Yazdi]] (16th century) discovered the pair (9363584, 9437056), though this has often been attributed to [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Costello |first = Patrick  | title = New Amicable Pairs Of Type (2; 2) And Type (3; 2)  | journal = Mathematics of computation | volume = 72 | pages = 489–497 | publisher = American Mathematical Society  | date = 1 May 2002 | url = http://www.ams.org/mcom/2003-72-241/S0025-5718-02-01414-X/S0025-5718-02-01414-X.pdf | accessdate = 19 April 2007 |issue=241 | doi = 10.1090/S0025-5718-02-01414-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work of Eastern mathematicians in this area has been forgotten.

Thābit's formula was rediscovered by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] (1601–1665) and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] (1596–1650), to whom it is sometimes ascribed, and extended by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783). It was extended further by Borho in 1972. Fermat and Descartes also rediscovered pairs of amicable numbers known to Arab mathematicians. Euler also discovered dozens of new pairs. The second smallest pair, (1184, 1210), was discovered in 1866 by a then teenage B. Nicolò I. Paganini, having been overlooked by earlier mathematicians.

As of 1946 there were 390 known pairs, but the advent of computers has allowed the discovery of many thousands since then. Exhaustive searches have been carried out to find all pairs less than a given bound, this bound being extended from 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; in 1970, to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; in 1986, 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; in 1993, and to a bound well over that today.

In 2007, there were almost 12,000,000 known amicable pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Munch Pedersen [http://amicable.homepage.dk/knwnc2.htm Known Amicable Pairs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules for generating==
[[Thâbit ibn Kurrah rule|Thābit's rule]] states that if
:''p'' = 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,
:''q'' = 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,
:''r'' = 9&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,
where ''n'' &gt; 1 is an [[integer]] and ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are [[prime number]]s, then 2''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;pq'' and 2''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;r'' are a pair of amicable numbers. This formula gives the pairs (220, 284) for ''n''=2, (17296, 18416) for ''n''=4, and (9363584, 9437056) for ''n''=7, but no other such pairs are known. Numbers of the form 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 are known as [[Thabit number]]s. In order for Thābit's formula to produce an amicable pair, two consecutive Thabit numbers must be prime; this severely restricts the possible values of ''n''.

A generalization of this is [[Euler's rule]], which states that if
:''p'' = (2&lt;sup&gt;(n&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/sup&gt;+1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,
:''q'' = (2&lt;sup&gt;(n&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/sup&gt;+1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,
:''r'' = (2&lt;sup&gt;(n&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;/sup&gt;+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,
where ''n''&gt;''m''&gt; 0 are [[integer]]s and ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are [[prime number]]s, then 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;pq and 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;r are a pair of amicable numbers. Thābit's rule corresponds to the case m=n-1. Euler's rule creates additional amicable pairs for (m,n)=(1,8), (29,40) with no others being known.

While these rules do generate some pairs of amicable numbers, many other pairs are known, so these rules are by no means comprehensive.

==Regular pairs==
Let (''m'', ''n'') be a pair of amicable numbers with ''m''&lt;''n'', and write ''m=gM'' and ''n=gN'' where ''g'' is the [[greatest common divisor]] of ''m'' and ''n''. If ''M'' and ''N'' are both [[coprime]] to ''g'' and [[Square-free integer|square free]] then the pair (''m'', ''n'') is said to be '''regular''', otherwise it is called '''irregular''' or '''exotic'''. If (''m'', ''n'') is regular and ''M'' and ''N'' have ''i'' and ''j'' prime factors respectively, then (''m'', ''n'') is said to be of '''type''' (''i'', ''j'').

For example, with (''m'', ''n'') = (220, 284), the greatest common divisor is 4 and so M = 55 and N = 71. Therefore (220, 284) is regular of type (2, 1).

==Other results==
In every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both [[Even and odd numbers|even]] or both odd. It is not known whether an even-odd pair of amicable numbers exists, but if it does, the even number must either be a square number or twice one, and the odd number must be a square number. Also, every known pair shares at least one common [[Divisor|factor]], higher than 1. It is not known whether a pair of [[coprime]] amicable numbers exists, though if any does, the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the two must be greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, a pair of coprime amicable numbers cannot be generated by Thabit's formula (above), nor by any similar formula.

In 1955, [[Paul Erdős]] showed that the density of amicable numbers, relative to the positive integers, was 0.

==Popular culture references==
Amicable numbers are featured in the Japanese film [[The Professor's Beloved Equation (film)|The Professor's Beloved Equation]].

Paul Auster's collection of short stories entitled ''True Tales of American Life'' contains a story ('Mathematical Aphrodisiac' by Alex Galt) in which amicable numbers play an important role.

'''Agar''' or '''agar-agar''' is a [[gelatin]]ous substance derived from a [[polysaccharide]] that accumulates in the [[cell wall]]s of [[agarophyte]] [[red algae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;Davidson, Alan, and Tom Jaine. ''The Oxford companion to food''. Oxford University Press, USA, 2006. 805. Print. Retrieved Aug. 08, 2010, from [http://books.google.com/books?id=JTr-ouCbL2AC&amp;lpg=PA805&amp;dq=baumkuchen&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, Peter W.; Phillips, Glyn O. |title=Handbook of hydrocolloids |publisher=Woodhead |location=Cambridge |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=1-85573-501-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically and in a modern context, it is chiefly used as an ingredient in [[desserts]] throughout Asia and also as a solid [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] to contain [[Growth medium|culture medium]] for [[microbiology|microbiological]] work. The gelling agent is an unbranched [[polysaccharide]] obtained from the [[cell wall]]s of some species of red algae, primarily from the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Gelidium]]'' and ''[[Gracilaria]]'', or [[seaweed]] (''Sphaerococcus euchema''). Commercially it is derived primarily from ''[[Gelidium amansii]]''.

Agar (agar-agar) can be used as a [[laxative]], a [[vegetarian]] [[gelatin]] substitute, a thickener for [[soup]]s, in [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jellies]], [[ice cream]] and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in [[brewing]], and for [[sizing]] paper and fabrics.

Chemically, agar is a [[polymer]] made up of subunits of the sugar [[galactose]]. Agar [[polysaccharide]]s serve as the primary structural support for the algae's cell walls.

== Names ==
The word &quot;agar&quot; comes from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word '''agar-agar''' (meaning jelly). It is also known as '''kanten''', '''China grass''', or '''Japanese isinglass'''. The various species of alga or seaweed from which agar is derived are sometimes called '''Ceylon moss''' or '''Jaffna moss'''. ''Gracilaria lichenoides'' specifically is referred to as '''agal-agal''' or '''Ceylon agar'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodchem.com/products_detail/&amp;productId=eb3f3cb4-2a68-4226-a2ac-c5b9bc2edc18&amp;comp_stats=comp-FrontProducts_list01-1286764117585.html Agar-Agar] at Foodchem.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malay and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], it is known as ''agar-agar''. In Japanese, it is known as ''kanten'' ({{linktext|寒天}}) meaning &quot;cold weather,&quot; referring to the fact that it is harvested in the winter months. In [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]] as hǎicài ({{linktext|海菜}}) meaning &quot;ocean vegetable&quot;, hǎizàoqióngzhī ({{linktext|海藻瓊脂}}) or dòngfěn ({{linktext|凍粉}}).

== Structure ==
[[Image:Agarose polymere.svg|right|thumb|The structure of an agarose polymer.]]

Agar consists of a mixture of agarose and agaropectin. Agarose is a linear polymer, made up of the repeating monomeric unit of agarobiose. Agarobiose is a disaccharide made up of D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactopyranose. Its major differences from carrageenans are the presence of L-3,6-anhydro-α-galactopyranose rather than D-3,6-anhydro-α-galactopyranose units and the lack of sulfate groups. Agaropectin is a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules that occur in lesser amounts. Their structures are similar but slightly branched and sulfated, and they may have methyl and pyruvic acid ketal substituents. They gel poorly and may be simply removed from the excellent gelling agarose molecules by using their charge. The quality of agar is improved by toe treatment that converts of any L-galactose-6-sulfate to 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose.

The gel network of agarose contains double helices formed from left-handed threefold helices. These double helices are stabilized by the presence of water molecules bound inside the double helical cavity [508]. Exterior hydroxyl groups allow aggregation of up to 10,000 of these helices to form suprafibers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hyagar.html Agar] at lsbu.ac.uk Water Structure and Science&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Agar exhibits [[hysteresis]], melting at 85 °C (358 K, 185 °F) and solidifying from 32-40 °C (305-313 K, 90-104 °F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/MicroBio_Agar.shtml |title=All About Agar |publisher=Sciencebuddies.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property lends a suitable balance between easy melting and good gel stability at relatively high temperatures. Since many scientific applications require incubation at temperatures close to human body temperature (37 °C), agar is more appropriate than other solidifying agents that melt at this temperature, such as gelatin.

== Microbiology ==
[[Image:Agar Plate.jpg|right|thumb|100mm diameter petri dishes containing agar jelly for bacterial culture]]
{{Main|Agar plate}}

Agar is used throughout the world to provide a solid surface containing [[growth medium|medium]] for the growth of [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. Microbial growth does not destroy the gel structure because most microorganisms are unable to digest agar. Agar is typically sold commercially as a powder that can be mixed with water and prepared similarly to gelatin before use as a growth medium. Other ingredients are added to the agar to meet the nutritional needs of the [[microbe]]s. Many specific formulations are available, because some microbes prefer certain environmental conditions over others.

== Motility assays ==
As a gel, an agarose medium is porous and therefore can be used to measure microorganism motility and mobility. The gel's porosity is directly related to the concentration of agarose in the medium, so various levels of effective viscosity (from the cell's &quot;point of view&quot;) can be selected, depending on the experimental objectives.

A common identification assay involves culturing a sample of the organism deep within a block of nutrient agar. Cells will attempt to grow within the gel structure. Motile species will be able to migrate, albeit slowly, throughout the gel and infiltration rates can then be visualized; whereas non-motile species will only show growth along the now-empty path introduced by the invasive initial sample deposition.

Another setup commonly used for measuring chemotaxis and chemokinesis utilizes the under-agarose cell migration assay whereby a layer of agarose gel is placed between a cell population and a chemoattractant. As a concentration gradient develops from the diffusion of the chemoattractant into the gel, various cell populations requiring different stimulation levels to migrate can then be visualized over time using microphotography as they tunnel upward through the gel against gravity along the gradient.

== Molecular biology ==
Agar is a heterogeneous mixture of two classes of polysaccharide: '''agaropectin''' and '''agarose'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/AB730E/AB730E03.htm |title=FAO agar manual |publisher=Fao.org |date=1965-01-01 |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both polysaccharide classes share the same galactose-based backbone, '''agaropectin''' is heavily modified with acidic side-groups, such as sulfate and pyruvate.

The neutral charge and lower degree of chemical complexity of '''agarose''' make it less likely to interact with biomolecules and therefore agarose has become the preferred matrix for work with proteins and nucleic acids. Gels made from purified agarose have a relatively large pore size, making them useful for separation of large molecules, such as proteins and protein complexes &gt;200 kilodaltons, as well as DNA fragments &gt;100 basepairs. Agarose has been used widely for [[immunodiffusion]] and [[immunoelectrophoresis]] as the agarose fibers functions as an anchor for immunocomplexes. Agarose is used generally as the medium for analytical scale[[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] and for column-based preparative scale separation as in [[Size exclusion chromatography|gel filtration chromatography]] and [[affinity chromatography]].

== Plant biology ==
[[Image:Physcomitrella growing on agar plates.jpg|thumb|''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' plants growing [[axenic]]ally [[in vitro]] on [[agar plate]]s ([[Petri dish]], 9&amp;nbsp;cm diameter).]]

Research grade agar is used extensively in plant biology as it is supplemented with a nutrient and vitamin mixture that allows for seedling germination in petri dishes under sterile conditions (given that the seeds are sterilized as well). Nutrient and vitamin supplementation for ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is standard across most experimental conditions. [[Murashige and Skoog medium|Murashige &amp; Skoog]] (MS) nutrient mix and Gamborg's B5 vitamin mix are generally used. A 1.0% agar/0.44% MS+vitamin dH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 solution is suitable for growth media between normal growth temps.

The solidification of the agar within any growth media (GM) is pH-dependent, with an optimal range between 5.4-5.7. Usually, the application of KOH is needed to increase the pH to this range. A general guideline is about 600 µl 0.1M KOH per 250 ml GM. This entire mixture can be sterilized using the liquid cycle of an [[autoclave]].

This medium nicely lends itself to the application of specific concentrations of phytohormones etc. to induce specific growth patterns in that one can easily prepare a solution containing the desired amount of hormone, add it to the known volume of GM, and autoclave to both sterilize and evaporate off any solvent that may have been used to dissolve the often polar hormones. This hormone/GM solution can be spread across the surface of petri dishes sown with germinated and/or etiolated seedlings.

Experiments with the [[moss]] ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', however, have shown that choice of the gelling agent&amp;nbsp;— agar or [[Gellan gum|Gelrite]] - does influence [[phytohormone]] sensitivity of the [[plant]] [[cell culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birgit Hadeler&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal|author=Birgit Hadeler, Sirkka Scholz, [[Ralf Reski]] |title=Gelrite and agar differently influence cytokinin-sensitivity of a moss |journal=Journal of Plant Physiology |volume=146 |pages=369–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culinary ==
Agar-agar is a natural vegetable [[gelatin]] counterpart. White and semi-[[translucent]], it is sold in packages as washed and dried strips or in powdered form. It can be used to make jellies, [[puddings]], and [[custard]]s. For making jelly, it is boiled in water until the solids dissolve. Sweetener, flavouring, colouring, fruit or vegetables are then added and the liquid is poured into [[molding (process)|molds]] to be served as desserts and vegetable [[aspic]]s, or incorporated with other desserts, such as a jelly layer in a [[cake]].

Agar-agar is approximately 80% fiber, so it can serve as an intestinal regulator. Its bulk quality is behind one of the latest fad diets in Asia, the ''kanten'' (the Japanese word for agar-agar&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot; /&gt;) diet. Once ingested, ''kanten'' triples in size and absorbs water. This results in the consumer feeling more full. Recently this diet has received some press coverage in the United States as well. The diet has shown promise in obesity studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maeda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maeda H, Yamamoto R, Hirao K, Tochikubo O | title=Effects of agar (kanten) diet on obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes | date = January 2005 | journal = Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism |volume=7 |issue=1 |pmid=15642074 | pages = 40–6 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2004.00370.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Philippine cuisine]], it is used to make the jelly bars in the various [[gulaman]] refreshments or desserts such as ''sago gulaman'' (aka ''gulaman at sago''), ''buko pandan'', ''agar flan'', [[halo-halo]], the various ''Filipino fruit salads'', ''black gulaman'', and ''red gulaman''.  One use of agar in [[Japanese cuisine]] is [[anmitsu]], a dessert made of small cubes of agar jelly and served in a bowl with various fruits or other ingredients. It is also the main ingredient in Mizuyōkan, another popular Japanese food. (See very top image.) In [[Indian cuisine]], agar agar is known as &quot;China grass&quot; and is used for making desserts. In [[Burmese cuisine]], a sweet jelly known as ''kyauk kyaw'' (​ေကျာက်​ေကြာ {{IPA-my|tɕauʔtɕɔ́|}}) is made from agar. In Russia it is used in addition or as a replacement to [[pectin]] in jams and marmalades, as a substitute to gelatin for its superior gelling properties, and as a strengthening ingredient in souffles and custards. The most famous use of agar-agar is in ''Ptich'ye moloko'' ([[Bird's Milk]]), a rich gellied custard (or soft [[meringue]]) used as a cake filling or chocolate-glazed as individual sweets.

== Other uses ==
Agar is used:
* As an [[Impression (Dental)|impression material]] in [[dentistry]].
* To make [[salt bridge]]s for use in [[electrochemistry]].
* In [[ant farm|formicariums]] as a transparent substitute for sand and a source of nutrition.

[[File:Origins of acid rain.svg|thumb|350px|Processes involved in acid deposition (note that only SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; play a significant role in acid rain).]]
'''Acid rain''' is a [[rain]] or any other form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that is unusually [[acid]]ic, meaning that it possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low [[pH]]). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals, and infrastructure through the process of wet deposition. Acid rain is caused by emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s which react with the [[water]] molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide into the [[atmosphere]] with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by [[lightning]] strikes and sulfur dioxide is produced by [[volcanic]] eruptions.

==Definition==
&quot;Acid rain&quot; is a popular term referring to the deposition of wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog,  cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. A more accurate term is “acid deposition”. [[Distilled water]], once [[carbon dioxide]] is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a pH greater than 7 are alkaline. “Clean” or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of over 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Likens, G. E., W. C. Keene, J. M. Miller and J. N. Galloway. 1987. Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia. J. Geophys. Res. 92(D11):13,299-13,314.&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula |C||O|2}} (g) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq)

Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of [[hydronium]] and [[carbonate]] ions:

: {{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H||C||O|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + {{Chemical formula|H|3|O}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)

Acid deposition as an [[environmental issue]] would include additional acids to {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}}.

==History==

Fourth Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, [[Robert Angus Smith]] was the first to show the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in [[Manchester]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seinfeld 1998&quot;&gt;Seinfeld, John H.; Pandis, Spyros N (1998). Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics&amp;nbsp;— From Air Pollution to Climate Change. John Wiley and Sons, Inc. ISBN 978-0-471-17816-3&lt;/ref&gt; Though acidic rain was discovered in 1852, it was not until the late 1960s that scientists began widely observing and studying the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Likens, G. E., F. H. Bormann and N. M. Johnson. 1972. Acid rain. Environment 14(2):33-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;acid rain&quot; was coined in 1872 by Robert Angus Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Harold Harvey was among the first to research a &quot;dead&quot; lake. Public awareness of acid rain in the U.S increased in the 1970s after [[The New York Times]] promulgated reports from the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest]] in [[New Hampshire]] of the myriad deleterious environmental effects demonstrated to result from it.&lt;ref&gt;Likens, G. E. and F. H. Bormann. 1974. Acid rain: a serious regional environmental problem.

Acid rain: the smokestack is the “smoking gun.” Garden 8(4):12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions, with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition (simply because of their higher rainfall). An example of this effect is the low pH of rain (compared to the local emissions) which falls in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emep.int/publ/common_publications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of acid rain in the United States===
[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the bronze and marble statues on its campus, such as this &quot;[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]&quot;, with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by acid rain (or, actually, acid snow)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]&quot; , Harvard Magazine, March-April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1980, the U.S. Congress passed an Acid Deposition Act. This Act established a 10-year research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). NAPAP looked at the entire problem. It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.

In 1991, NAPAP provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States. It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.

Meanwhile, in 1990, the US Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act. Title IV of these amendments established the [[Acid Rain Program]], a [[cap and trade]] system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO2 emissions from power plants. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.

During the 1990s, research continued. On March 10, 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO2 and NOx in the eastern United States. When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO2 emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70 percent and NOx emissions by over 60 percent from 2003 levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;US Environmental Protection Agency&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |title=US EPA: A Brief History of Acid Rain |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the Program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals. Since the 1990s, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the [[Pacific Research Institute]], acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/03/MNMMTJUS1.DTL&amp;hw=Cap+trade+Acid+Rain&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 'Cap-and-trade' model eyed for cutting greenhouse gases], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2facts.com/RecordUrl.asp?article=/icof/search/i0702840.asp |title=Facts On File News Services Databases |publisher=2facts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was significantly less successful than conventional regulation in the European Union, which saw a decrease of over 70% in SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Gilberston, T. and Reyes, O. 2009. [http://www.carbontradewatch.org/carbon-trade-fails Carbon Trading: how it works and why it fails]. Dag Hammerskjold Foundation: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/arp07.html Acid Rain Program 2007 Progress Report], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA estimates that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers will be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate.com&quot;/&gt;

==Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification==
The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulfur dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form [[nitric acid]] are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur containing compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes from [[fossil fuel]] combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from [[wildfires]] and 7-8 Tg(S) per year from [[volcanoes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berresheim 1995&quot;&gt;Berresheim, H.; Wine, P.H. and Davies D.D., (1995). Sulfur in the Atmosphere. In Composition, Chemistry and Climate of the Atmophere, ed. H.B. Singh. Van Nostran Rheingold ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural phenomena===
The principal natural [[phenomena]] that contribute acid-producing gases to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] are emissions from volcanoes. Thus, for example, [[fumarole]]s from Laguna Caliente crater of [[Poás Volcano]] create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog with acidity 2 of pH, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;wond&quot;&gt;{{Cite document |title =  Poás Volcano and Laguna Caliente |publisher = Wondermondo |date =  24 October 2010 |url = http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/NA/CostaRica/Alajuela/PoasCaliente.htm |postscript =  &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Acid-producing gasses are created also by [[biology|biological]] processes that occur on the land, in [[wetland]]s, and in the [[ocean]]s. The major biological source of sulfur containing compounds is [[dimethyl sulfide]].

Nitric acid in [[rainwater]] is an important source of fixed [[nitrogen]] for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as lightning.

Acidic deposits have been detected in [[glacier|glacial ice]] thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Likens, G. E. 1979&quot;/&gt;

Soils of Coniferous forests are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles and this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.

===Human activity===
[[File:Gavin Plant.JPG|thumb|The coal-fired [[Gavin Power Plant]] in [[Cheshire, Ohio]]]]
The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as [[electricity generation]], factories, and [[motor vehicle]]s. Coal power plants are one of the most polluting. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage. Also, [[Agriculture#Livestock production systems|livestock production]] plays a major role. It is responsible for almost two-thirds of all sources of [[ammonia]] produced through human activities, which contributes significantly to acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm|title=Livestock impacts on the environment|date=November 2006|journal=Spolight|publisher=[[United Nations]]|author=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical processes==
Combustion of fuels creates sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulfuric acid and nitric acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAA01&quot;&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/09/980928072644.htm Clean Air Act Reduces Acid Rain In Eastern United States], ''ScienceDaily'', Sept. 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas phase chemistry===
In the [[gas phase]] sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the [[hydroxyl]] radical via an [[intermolecular]] reaction:&lt;ref name=&quot;Seinfeld 1998&quot;/&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·
which is followed by:
:HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
In the presence of water, [[sulfur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted rapidly to [[sulfuric acid]]:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (l)

[[Nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with OH to form nitric acid:
:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Chemistry in cloud droplets===
When clouds are present, the loss rate of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.

;Hydrolysis

Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] in a series of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

;Oxidation

There are a large number of aqueous reactions that [[redox|oxidize]] sulfur from S([[oxidation state|IV]]) to S(VI), leading to the formation of sulfuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]] (reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by [[iron]] and [[manganese]] in the cloud droplets).

For more information see Seinfeld and Pandis (1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;Seinfeld 1998&quot;/&gt;

==Acid deposition==
===Wet deposition===
Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.

===Dry deposition===
Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive glossary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |title=UK National Air Quality Archive: Air Pollution Glossary |publisher=Airquality.co.uk |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.

==Adverse effects==
[[File:Waterspecies.gif|thumb|300px|This chart shows that not all fish, shellfish, or the insects that they eat can tolerate the same amount of acid; for example, frogs can tolerate water that is more acidic (i.e., has a lower pH) than trout.]]
Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.

===Surface waters and aquatic animals===
Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. At pHs lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pHs can kill adult fish. As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the [[brook trout]] in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot;&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/surface_water.html Effects of Acid Rain - Surface Waters and Aquatic Animals]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website states: &quot;Of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75 percent of the acidic lakes and about 50 percent of the acidic streams&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot;/&gt;

===Soils===
Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pHs and are killed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodhe, H., et al. The global distribution of acidifying wet deposition. Environmental Science and TEchnology. vlo. 36, no. 20 (October) p. 4382-8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[enzyme]]s of these microbes are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize [[toxin]]s such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA: Forests&quot;&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html Effects of Acid Rain - Forests]&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; (clay) {{eqm}} 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (clay) + Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as [[sugar maple]] ([[Acer saccharum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Likens, G. E., C. T. Driscoll, D. C. Buso, M. J. Mitchell, G. M. Lovett, S. W. Bailey, T. G. Siccama, W. A. Reiners and C. Alewell. 2002. The biogeochemistry of sulfur at Hubbard Brook. Biogeochemistry 60(3):235-316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Likens, G. E., C. T. Driscoll and D. C. Buso. 1996. Long-term effects of acid rain: response and recovery of a forest ecosystem. Science 272:244-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests and other vegetation===
[[File:Acid rain woods1.JPG|Effect of acid rain on a forest, Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic|thumb|right]]
Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.

Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.&lt;ref&gt;DeHayes, D.H., Schaberg, P.G., and G.R. Strimbeck. 2001. Red Spruce Hardiness and Freezing Injury Susceptibility. In: F. Bigras, ed. Conifer Cold Hardiness. Kluwer Academic Publishers, the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, B. E., P. G. Schaberg, G. Hawley and D. H. DeHayes. 2006. Landscape-scale spatial patterns of winter injury to red spruce foliage in a year of heavy region-wide injury. Can. J. For. Res. 36:142-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human health effects===
Acid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. However, the particulates responsible for acid rain (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air do contribute to heart and lung problems including asthma and bronchitis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/health.html EPA, ''Effects of Acid Rain - Human Health,'' 5/13/2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse effects===
[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|Effect of acid rain on statues|thumb|right]]
Acid rain can also damage buildings and historic monuments, especially those made of rocks such as [[limestone]] and [[marble]] containing large amounts of calcium carbonate. Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) {{eqm}} CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. Acid rain also increases the oxidation rate of metals, in particular [[copper]] and [[bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m0441x12l06k5n23/ |title=ICP on effects on materials |publisher=Springerlink.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/WP-89-104.pdf |title=Approaches in modeling the impact of air pollution-induced material degradation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affected areas==
Places with significant impact by acid rain around the globe include most of eastern Europe from [[Poland]] northward into Scandinavia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/acid_rain_in_europe|title=Acid Rain in Europe|author=Ed. Hatier|year=1993|accessdate=2010-01-31|publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] GRID Arendal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eastern third of the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/ARP_4/NOx-Emission-Trends-for-All-Acid-Rain-Program-Units.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/ARP_4.html&amp;usg=__qYQtwO9Hldtam9UIQp48Gy58lmU=&amp;h=355&amp;w=788&amp;sz=18&amp;hl=en&amp;start=5&amp;um=1&amp;tbnid=4GNKn98e78ebJM:&amp;tbnh=64&amp;tbnw=143&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dacid%2Brain%2B.gov%26hl%3Den%26um%3D1|title=Clean Air Markets 2008 Highlights|author=US Environmental Protection Agency|year=2008|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and southeastern [[Canada]]. Other affected areas include the southeastern coast of [[China]] and [[Taiwan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Prevention methods==
===Technical solutions===
Many coal-burning [[power plant]]s use [[Flue gas desulfurization]] (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95 percent or more of the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.

In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as [[gypsum]] when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. In others, they are placed in [[landfill]]. However, the effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to [[Restoration ecology|restore]] native life.

[[Vehicle emissions control]] reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.

===International treaties===
A number of international treaties on the long range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, [[Sulphur Emissions Reduction Protocol]] under the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]]. Canada and the US signed the [[Air Quality Agreement]] in 1991.  Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties.

===Emissions trading===
{{main|Emissions trading}}
{{See also|Acid Rain Program}}
In this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.

The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]]. The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 ''U.S. Code'' 7651&lt;/ref&gt; is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), the primary causes of acid rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.

{{wiktionary}}
'''Acephali''' (from the [[Greek language]] ''a-'', &quot;without,&quot; and ''kephalos'', &quot;head&quot;) is a term applied to several sects as having no head or leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;brewer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Brewer | first = E. Cobham | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | publisher = Avenel Books | date = 1978 (reprint of 1894 version) | location = Edwinstowe, England | pages = 9 | isbn = 0-517-25921-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the term refers to a strict [[monophysite]] sect that separated itself, in the end of the 5th century, from the rule of [[Peter III of Alexandria|Peter Mongus]], [[List of Patriarchs of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria]], and remained &quot;without king or bishop&quot; until they were reconciled by [[Pope Mark II of Alexandria|Mark II]] (799 - 819).

The term is also used to denote ''clerici vagantes'', i.e. clergy without title or benefice, picking up a living anyhow. Certain persons in [[England]] during the reign of King [[Henry I of England]] were called Acephali because they had no lands by virtue of which they could acknowledge a superior lord.&lt;ref name=&quot;brewer&quot;/&gt;

The name is also given to certain legendary races described by ancient naturalists and 
geographers as having no heads, their mouths and eyes being in their breasts, generally identified with [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Blemmyes (legendary creatures)|Blemmyae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brewer&quot;/&gt; They live in [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-00-720873-1|year=2005|last=Matthews|first=John &amp; Caitlin|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony''' (b. [[Dresden]], 27 December 1755 &amp;ndash; d. [[Dresden]], 6 June 1836), also known by his [[German language|German name]] '''Anton''' (full name: ''Anton Clemens Theodor Maria Joseph Johann Evangelista Johann Nepomuk Franz Xavier Aloys Januar''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Holborn&quot;&gt;Holborn, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Kingdom of Saxony|King of Saxony]] (1827–1836) from the [[House of Wettin]]. He became known as ''Anton der Gütige'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinger&quot;&gt;Quinger p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; (en: &quot;Anthony the Kind&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.die-sachsen-kommen.de/en/king.htm  The Kings of Saxony]&quot;. Accessed 27 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the fifth but third surviving son of [[Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony]], and [[Maria Antonia of Bavaria]].

==Early life==
With few chances to take part in the politics of the Electorate of Saxony or receive any land from his older brother Frederick Augustus III, Anton lived under the shadows. No Elector of Saxony after Johann Georg I gave appananges to his younger sons.

During the first years of the reign of his older brother as Elector, Anton was the third in line, preceded only by his older brother Karl. The death of Karl (8 September 1781) make him the next in line to the Electorate as Crown Prince (de: ''Kronprinz''); this was because all the pregnancies of the Electress Amalie, except for one daughter, ended in a stillbirth.
[[File:Maria Carolina Antonietta Adelaide of Savoy 1764-1782.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Caroline of Savoy]].]]
[[File:Maria Theresia Josepha Habsburg Sachsen 1767 1827 litho.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Maria Theresa of Austria (1767–1827)|Maria Theresa of Austria]].]]

His aunt, the [[Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731–1767)|Dauphine of France]], had wanted to engage her daughter [[Princess Marie Zéphyrine of France|Marie Zéphyrine of France]] to Anthony; Marie Zéphyrine died in 1755 abandoning plans. Another French candidate was Marie Zéphyrine's sister [[Clotilde de France|Marie Clotide]] (later [[Queen of Sardinia]]) but again nothing happened.

In [[Turin]] on 29 September 1781 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 24 October 1781 (in person), Anton married firstly with the Princess [[Caroline of Savoy]] (Maria Carolina Antonietta Adelaida), daughter of the King [[Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia]] and [[Maria Antonietta of Spain]]. Caroline died after only one year of marriage, on 28 December 1782 having succumbed to [[smallpox]]. They had no children.

In [[Florence]] on 8 September 1787 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 18 October 1787 (in person), Anton married a second time with the Archduchess [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1767–1827)|Maria Theresia of Austria]] (Maria Theresia Josephe Charlotte Johanna), daughter of the Grand Duke Leopold I of Tuscany, later [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]]. [[Mozart]]'s opera [[Don Giovanni]] was originally intended to be performed in honor of Anton and his wife for a visit to [[Prague]] on  14 October 1787, as they traveled between Dresden and [[Vienna]], and [[libretto]]s were printed with dedication to them. The [[premiere]] could not be arranged in time, however, so the opera [[The Marriage of Figaro]] was substituted on the express orders of the bride's uncle, Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. The choice of ''The Marriage of Figaro'' was considered improper for a new bride by many observers, and the couple left the opera theater early without seeing the entire work performed. Mozart complained bitterly of the intrigues surrounding this incident in a letter to his friend [[Gottfried von Jacquin]] that was written in stages between 15 October and  25 October 1787.

The couple had four children, but none survived to the age of two:
#Maria Ludovika Auguste Fredericka Therese Franziska Johanna Aloysia Nepomucena Ignatia Anna Josepha Xaveria Franziska de Paula Barbara (b. Dresden, 14 March 1795 - d. Dresden, 25 April 1796).
#Frederick Augustus (b. and d. Dresden, 5 April 1796).
#Maria Johanna Ludovica Anna Amalia Nepomucena Aloysia Ignatia Xaveria Josepha Franziska de Chantal Eva Apollonia Magdalena Crescentia Vincentia (b. Dresden, 5 April 1798 - d. Dresden, 30 October 1799).
#Maria Theresia (b. and d. Dresden, 15 October 1799).

The Electress gave birth for last time in 1797 to another stillborn child. After this Anton became, officially, the Heir to the Electorate and, since 1806, the Kingdom of Saxony.

==King of Saxony==
Anton succeeded his brother Frederick August I as King of Saxony when he died, on 5 May 1827. The 71-years-old new King was completely inexperienced in government, thus he had no intention of initiating profound changes in foreign or domestic policy.

[[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] diplomats discussed granting the [[Rhine Province|Prussian Rhineland]] (predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]) to Anton (a Catholic) in exchange for [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Saxony in 1827, but nothing came of these talks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freitag&quot;&gt;Freitag, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 in France, disturbances in Saxony began in autumn. These were directed primarily against the old Constitution. Therefore, on 13 September the cabinet dismissed Count [[Detlev von Einsiedel]], followed by [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]. Because the people wished a younger regent, Anton agreed to appoint his nephew Frederick Augustus Prince Co-Regent (de: ''Prinz-Mitregenten''). As another consequence of the disturbances, a new constitution was accepted in 1831 which came into effect on 4 September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;James K. Pollock &amp; Homer Thomas, ''Germany in Power and Eclipse'' D. Van Nostrand Co.: New York, 1952) p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; With it Saxony became a [[Constitutional monarchy]] and obtained a bi-cameral legistature and a responsible ministry, which replaced the old feudal estates.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution was more conservative than other constitutions existing at this time in the German Union. Still the constitution served Saxony until 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; The King kept his exclusive sovereignty but was bound by the Government Business to cooperate with the Ministers and the decisions of both Chambers of the States (de: ''Kammern der Ständeversammlung'') meeting. The entry of Saxony into the ''[[Zollverein]]'' in 1833 let trade, industry and traffic blossom farther.

Without surviving male issue, Anton was succeeded as King by his nephew, [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony|Frederick Augustus II]].

'''Albert III''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht}}) (27 January 1443 – 12 September 1500) was a [[rulers of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]]. He was nicknamed '''Albert the Bold''' or '''Albert the Courageous''' and founded the Albertine line of the [[House of Wettin]].

Albert was born in [[Grimma]] as the third and youngest son (but fifth child in order of birth) of [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II the Gentle, Elector of Saxony]], and Margarete of Austria, sister of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Later, he was a member of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

After escaping from the hands of [[Kunz von Kaufungen]], who had abducted him together with his brother [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]], he spent some time at the court of the emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] in [[Vienna]].

In [[Cheb|Eger (Cheb)]] on 11 November 1464 Albert married [[Sidonie Podiebrad|Zdenka (Sidonie)]], daughter of [[George of Podebrady]], King of [[Bohemia]]; but failed to obtain the Bohemian Crown on the death of George in 1471.

After the death of his father in 1464, Albert and Ernest ruled their lands together, but in 1485 a division was made by the [[Treaty of Leipzig]], and Albert received the [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]], together with some adjoining districts, and founded the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin.

Regarded as a capable soldier by the emperor, Albert (in 1475) took a prominent part in the campaign against [[Charles the Bold]], [[duke of Burgundy]], and in 1487 led an expedition against [[Matthias Corvinus]], King of Hungary, which failed owing to lack of support on the part of the emperor.

In 1488 he was appointed Stattholder of the Netherlands (until 1493) and marched with the imperial forces to free the Roman king [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] from his imprisonment at Bruges, and when, in 1489, the King returned to Germany, Albert was left as his representative to prosecute the war against the rebels. He was successful in restoring the authority of Maximilian in [[Holland]], [[Flanders]] and [[Brabant (duchy)|Brabant]], but failed to obtain any repayment of the large sums of money which he had spent in these campaigns.

His services were rewarded in 1498 when Maximilian bestowed upon him the title of Hereditary governor (''potestat'') of [[Friesland]], but he had to make good his claim by force of arms. He had to a great extent succeeded, and was paying a visit to Saxony, when he was recalled by news of a fresh rising. [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] was captured, but soon afterwards the duke died at [[Emden]]. He was buried at Meissen.

Albert, who was a man of great strength and considerable skill in feats of arms, delighted in tournaments and knightly exercises.  His loyalty to the emperor Frederick, and the expenses incurred in this connection, aroused some irritation among his subjects, but his rule was a period of prosperity in Saxony.

One of Guthrie's better-known works is &quot;[[Alice's Restaurant|Alice's Restaurant Massacree]]&quot;, a satirical [[talking blues]] song of about 18 minutes in length.

==Early life==
Arlo Guthrie was born in [[Kings County, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York, New York|New York]], the son of [[folk singer]] and composer [[Woody Guthrie]] and his wife [[Marjorie Guthrie|Marjorie Mazia Guthrie]]. His sister is [[Nora Guthrie]]. His mother was a one-time professional dancer with the [[Martha Graham|Martha Graham Company]] and founder of the Committee to Combat [[Huntington's disease]], the disease that took her husband's life in 1967. His maternal grandmother was renowned Yiddish poet [[Aliza Greenblatt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/greenblat-aliza Jewish Women's Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  Arlo Guthrie received religious training for his [[bar mitzvah]] from [[Rabbi]] [[Meir Kahane]], who would go on to form the [[Jewish Defense League]]. &quot;Rabbi Kahane was a really nice, patient teacher,&quot; Guthrie later recalled, &quot;but shortly after he started giving me my lessons, he started going haywire. Maybe I was responsible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/a_jewish_visit_to_guthries_land_20041203/ A Jewish Visit to Guthrie's Land, Jewish Journal, Dec. 4, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie attended Woodward School in Clinton Hill Brooklyn 1st through 8th grades and later graduated from the [[Stockbridge School]], in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], in 1965, and briefly attended [[Rocky Mountain College]]. He received an [[Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Westfield State College]], in 2008.

As a singer, songwriter and lifelong political activist, Guthrie carries on the legacy of his legendary father. He was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award on September 26, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Recipients List&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot;==
His most famous work is &quot;[[Alice's Restaurant Massacree]]&quot;, a [[talking blues]] song that lasts 18 minutes and 34 seconds in its original recorded version. Guthrie has pointed out that this was also the exact length of one of the famous gaps in [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Watergate tapes]]. He has been known to spin the story out to forty-five minutes in concert. The Alice in the song is [[Alice's Restaurant#Real restaurant and people|Alice Brock]], who now runs an art gallery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alicebrock.com Alice Brock&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]].

The song lampoons the [[Vietnam War]] [[conscription|draft]].  However, Guthrie stated in a 2009 interview with [[Ron Bennington]] that Alice's Restaurant is more an &quot;anti-stupidity&quot; song than an anti-war song, adding that it is based on a true incident. In the song, Guthrie is called up for a draft examination, and rejected as unfit for [[military]] service as a result of a criminal record — consisting in its entirety of a single arrest, court appearance, fine and clean-up order for [[littering]] and creating a [[public nuisance]] on Thanksgiving Day in 1965, when Arlo was 18 years old.  On the DVD commentary for the film, Guthrie states that the events as presented in the song are true to real-life occurrences.

For a short period of time after its release in 1967, &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot; was heavily played on U.S. college and counter-culture radio stations. It became a symbol of the late 1960s and for many it defined an attitude and lifestyle that were lived out across the country in the ensuing years. Many stations across the States have made playing &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot; a Thanksgiving Day tradition.

A 1969 [[film]], directed and co-written by [[Arthur Penn]], was based on the true story told in the song, but with the addition of a large amount of fictional scenes. This film, also called ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]'' featured Arlo portraying himself.  However, the part of his father Woody Guthrie was played by an actor, Joseph Boley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064002/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its popularity, the song Alice's Restaurant Massacree is not always featured on the set list of any given performance.

==Popular and critical reception==
In 1972 Guthrie made famous [[Steve Goodman]]'s song &quot;[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]&quot;, a [[paean]] to long-distance passenger [[railway|rail]] travel. Guthrie's first trip on that train was in December 2005 (when his family joined other musicians on a train trip across the country to raise money for musicians financially devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], in the South of the United States).  He also had a minor hit with his song &quot;Coming into Los Angeles,&quot; which was played at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]], and success with a live version of &quot;The Motorcycle Song.&quot;  Guthrie's 1976 album ''Amigo'' received a 5-star (highest rating) from ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' and may be his best-received work; unfortunately that milestone album, like Guthrie's earlier [[Warner Brothers]] albums, is rarely heard today even though each boasts compelling folk and folk rock music accompanied by top-notch musicians such as [[Ry Cooder]].

==Shenandoah==
In the fall of 1975 during a benefit concert in Massachusetts, Arlo Guthrie performed with his band Shenandoah in public for the first time. They continued to tour and record throughout the 1970s until the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Although the band received good reviews, it never gained the popularity that Guthrie did while playing solo. This band is not to be confused with the popular country music group [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], an entirely different group that had musical hits from 1986 to 2006.  Arlo Guthrie's band Shenandoah consisted (after 1976) of David Grover, Steve Ide, Carol Ide, Terry A La Berry and Dan Velika.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.nodepression.com/2001/01/arlo-guthrie-outlasting-the-bluespower-of-love/&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of musicians from a variety of genres have joined Guthrie on stage, including [[Pete Seeger]], [[David Bromberg]], [[Cyril Neville]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Judy Collins]], [[John Prine]], Wesley Gray, [[Josh Ritter]], and others.

==Acting==
Though Guthrie is best known for being a musician, singer, and composer, throughout the years he has also appeared as an actor in films and on television. The film ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]'' (1969) is his best known role, but he has had small parts in several films and even co-starred in a television drama, ''[[Byrds of Paradise]]''.

Guthrie has had minor roles in several movies and [[television]] series. Usually, he has appeared as himself, often performing music and/or being interviewed about the 1960s, folk music and various social causes.  His television appearances have included a broad range of programs from [[The Muppet Show]] (1979) to [[Politically Incorrect]] (1998).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0349241/&lt;/ref&gt;  A rare dramatic film part was in the 1992 movie [[Roadside Prophets]]. Guthrie's memorable appearance at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] was documented in the [[Michael Wadleigh]] film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt;

Guthrie also made a pilot for a TV variety show called &quot;The Arlo Guthrie Show&quot; in February, 1987.  The hour-long program included story telling and musical performances and was filmed in Austin, Texas.  It was broadcast nationally on PBS. Special guests were Pete Seeger, Bonnie Raitt, David Bromberg and Jerry Jeff Walker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arlo.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=3192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
A registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Guthrie endorsed Texas Congressman [[Ron Paul]] for the [[Results of the 2008 Republican presidential primaries|2008 Republican Party nomination]]. He said, &quot;I love this guy. Dr. Paul is the only candidate I know of who would have signed the [[Constitution]] of the United States had he been there. I'm with him, because he seems to be the only candidate who actually believes it has as much relevance today as it did a couple of hundred years ago. I look forward to the day when we can work out the differences we have with the same revolutionary vision and enthusiasm that is our American legacy.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/01/29/group-w-grad-endorses-ron-paul/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Group W Grad Endorses Ron Paul | date=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the New York Times Magazine that he is a Republican because, &quot;We had enough good Democrats. We needed a few more good Republicans. We needed a loyal opposition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/magazine/26fob-q4-t.html | work=The New York Times | title=Just Folk | first=Deborah | last=Solomon | date=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About once a month, Guthrie posts short writings to the Announcements area of www.arlo.net, often sounding libertarian themes.  However, on February 1, 2011, his post was to promote the cause of the [[public-sector trade union|public employee unions]] being opposed by Wisconsin Republicans, and to favor the cause of labor unions in general.  Previously Guthrie had made comments in public disparaging musicians' unions and stating that he had refused to join one.&lt;ref&gt;http://pajamasmedia.com/ronradosh/2009/07/26/hey-arlo-the-times-they-are-a-changin/&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier years, at least from the 1960s to the 1980s, Guthrie had taken a decidedly [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] approach to American politics.  In his often lengthy comments during concerts his expressed positions were consistently anti-war, anti-Nixon, pro-drugs and in favor of making nuclear power illegal.  However, he apparently regarded himself as more an individualist than the major youth culture spokesperson he had been regarded as by the media, as evidenced by the lyrics in his 1979 song &quot;Prologue&quot;:  &quot;I can remember all of your smiles during the demonstrations, ... and together we sang our victory songs though we were worlds apart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arlo.net/resources/lyrics/prologue.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, he was the featured celebrity in [[George McGovern]]'s [[George_McGovern#1984 presidential campaign|campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination]] in Guthrie's home state of Massachusetts, performing at rallies and receptions.&lt;ref&gt;Marano, Richard Michael, ''Vote Your Conscience: The Last Campaign of George McGovern'', Praeger Publishers, 2003, pp. 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/georgemcgovern/photos/48035887#%7B%22ImageId%22%3A48035887%7D Promotional flyer for &quot;Rally for McGovern&quot; on March 12, 1984, Copley Square, Boston, Massachusetts (Special guest: Arlo Guthrie)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Like his father, [[Woody Guthrie]], Guthrie often sings [[protest song|songs of protest]] against social injustice.  He collaborated with poet [[Adrian Mitchell]] to tell the story of [[Chile]]an folk singer and activist [[Víctor Jara]] in song.  He regularly performed with folk legend [[Pete Seeger]], one of his father's longtime partners.

In 1991, Guthrie bought the church that had served as Alice and Ray Brock's former home in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], and converted it to the Guthrie Center, an interfaith meeting place that serves people of all religions.  The center provides weekly free lunches in the community and support for families living with HIV/AIDS as well as other life-threatening illnesses. It also hosts a summertime concert series and Guthrie does six or seven fund raising shows there every year. There are several annual events such as the Walk-A-Thon to Cure Huntington's Disease and a &quot;Thanksgiving Dinner That Can't Be Beat&quot; for families, friends, doctors and scientists who live and work with Huntington's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/11/AR2005081100624_2.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Richard | last=Harrington | title=Arlo Guthrie's Storied Career | date=August 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Guthrie and his wife Jackie reside in the Town of [[Washington, Massachusetts]].  Guthrie's son [[Abe Guthrie]] and his daughters [[Sarah Lee Guthrie]] and [[Cathy Guthrie]] have also become musicians. [[Annie Guthrie]] writes songs and performs, and also takes care of family touring details. Sarah Lee performs and records with her husband [[Johnny Irion]]. Cathy plays [[ukulele]] in [[Folk Uke]], a group she formed with [[Amy Nelson]], the daughter of [[Willie Nelson]]. Abe Guthrie was formerly in a folk-rock band called Xavier, and now tours with his father. Abe Guthrie's son, Krishna, is a drummer and toured with Arlo Guthrie on his European tour in 2006&lt;ref&gt;http://visions-of-dylan.blogspot.com/2006/08/arlo-at-vicar-st.html&lt;/ref&gt; and plays guitar for the 2009-2010 Tour. Krishna plays drums in another local band and aspires to be the lead of his own band some day.  Arlo Guthrie is a grandfather of Abe's son Krishna and daughter Serena, Annie's son Shiva Das (Mo) and daughter Jacklyn, Sarah Lee's daughters Olivia Nora and Sophia Irion and Cathy's daughter Marjorie Maybelle Midwood.

==In fiction==

Arlo Guthrie is mentioned in Tim Winton's novel ''[[The Riders]]'' - shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]] in 1995. A character in the novel overhears locals in the small Irish town of [[Shinrone]], recount the night Arlo Guthrie came to play.
The actual event occurred in February 1988, when Arlo played the local gymnasium in [[Shinrone]], County [[Offaly]]. The concert was organised by a local postman, Tom Stapleton.

{{Books of the Book of Mormon}}
'''The Book of Alma''' is one of the books that make up the [[Book of Mormon]]. The full title is '''The Book of Alma: The Son of Alma'''. The title refers to [[Alma the Younger]], a prophet and &quot;chief judge&quot; of the Nephites.

==Content==
===Historical Outline===

The Book of Alma is the longest of all the books of the Book of Mormon, consisting of 63 chapters. The book records the first 39 years of what the [[Nephite]]s termed &quot;the reign of the judges&quot;, a period in which the Nephite nation adopted a constitutional theocratic government in which the judicial and executive branches of the government were combined.

The history of the book is outlined as follows:

====Challenges to the Beginning of the Republic====
The first four chapters, describe the rebellions of followers of [[Nehor]] and [[Amlici]]. Contrary to the dominant lay ministry that existed in the Nephite culture, Nehor established a church in which priests were given a separate social status and were paid for their ministry. After killing a religious leader during a [[theological argument]], Nehor was tried and executed for his crimes. The followers of Amlici resented the dominant political and religious parties and sought to reestablish the monarchy that the reign of the judges replaced. [[Alma the Younger|Alma]], the chief judge and governor as well as the high priest over the people of Nephi, lead an army against Amlici and his followers and drove the rebellion out of the land.

====The Ministry of Alma Among the Nephites====
Towards the end of chapter four, Alma realizes that the affairs of the Church require his entire concentration. He resigns from his political office and appoints [[Various Book of Mormon people#Nephihah|Nephihah]] as chief judge and governor of the land.  Chapters 5-16 record sermons and missionary travels of Alma between 83 and 78 B.C.  Alma and one of his converted followers, Amulek, provide important teachings about the atonement of Christ, overcoming pride and the natural man, retaining conversion, the resurrection of all men, and judgment day.  Later, their teachings about faith and worship in Alma 32-34 are important sources of instruction and insight.

====The Ministry of the Sons of Mosiah Among the Lamanites====
Chapters 17 to 27 describe the missionary labors of the sons of [[King Mosiah II]] who was the last king over the people of Nephi prior to the peaceful transition of the nation from a monarchy to a republican form of government. The [[sons of Mosiah]], named Ammon, [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]] and [[Himni]], chose to devote themselves to missionary labors preaching to the people of the [[Lamanite]] nation, which periodically went to war against the Nephite nation. They lived and taught among the Lamanites between the years 91 and 77 B.C.

====The Ministry of Alma Among the Zoramites====
Chapters 28 to 35 relate the account of a rebellion of a subgroup of the Nephite nation who called themselves [[Zoramites]]. The Zoramites believed in a form of predestination and taught that all others except their people would be damned. Their apostasy from the Church was conjoined with plans to rebel against the Nephite government. Alma took two of his sons, the sons of Mosiah, Amulek, and [[Zeezrom]] on a mission among the Zoramites in an attempt to restore their loyalty to both the Church and the state.  Alma and his companions had some success among the poor class of Zoramites who were then exiled from the Zoramite community by the governing rich class of Zoramites. The wealthier Zoramites eventually defected and united with the Lamanites.

====The Commandments of Alma to his Children====
Chapters 36 to 42 record the teachings of Alma to his sons, [[Helaman]], [[Shiblon]], and [[Corianton]]. These teachings discuss the ministry and atonement of [[Jesus]], the laws of justice and mercy, the need for repentance, and the resurrection and judgment of all people.

====A Period of War====
[[File:Moroni - Book of Mormon.jpg|thumb|400px|Captain Moroni raises the &quot;Title of Liberty&quot;]]
Chapters 43 to 62 record the struggles of the Nephite people during a war against the attacking Lamanite nation between the years of 74 and 57 B.C. The Chief Captain (senior military commander) of the Nephites during this time was [[Captain Moroni]]. The Nephites were ultimately successful in their defense against the Lamanites.

====Conclusion====
Chapter 63 includes concluding historical notes covering the years 56 to 53 B.C. This is largely a period of post-war reconstruction and exploration in the Nephite nation.

===Simple Outline===

This outline is based on ''main sections'' and ''[[antagonist]] characters'' in the Book of Alma. There are two main features in this history, chapters 1 - 42 deal with Missionary Work, and chapters 43 - 63 contain the Wars. The history of the [[Zoramites]] provides a transition from Missionary Work to the War chapters of the Book of Alma. The two main sections also mirror the first two antagonist characters, Nehor (''religious agenda'') and Amlici (''political agenda'').

=== 50 Questions of Alma ===
In Alma [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/5 Chapter 5], Alma the Younger speaks to the people of Zarahemla in which he asks 50 rhetorical questions which are widely cited in the LDS church.

===Faith as a seed===

Alma's sermon on faith to the Zoramites in [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/32 in Alma 32] is widely used to explain the process of developing faith.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?locale=0&amp;sourceId=cbd8759235d0c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators are invited to try a similar experiment of faith in order to come to develop a testimony. It is worth noting that Alma doesn't actually compare faith to a seed, he compares the word to a seed,&lt;ref&gt;http://scriptures.lds.org/alma/32/35#28&lt;/ref&gt; although this is a common misconception.

[[Image:Glutathione-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|300px|Space-filling model of the antioxidant [[metabolomics|metabolite]] [[glutathione]]. The yellow sphere is the [[redox|redox-active]] sulfur atom that provides antioxidant activity, while the red, blue, white, and dark grey spheres represent oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon atoms, respectively.]]

An '''antioxidant''' is a [[molecule]] capable of inhibiting the [[Redox|oxidation]] of other molecules. Oxidation is a [[chemical reaction]] that transfers [[electron]]s from a substance to an [[oxidizing agent]]. Oxidation reactions can produce [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]]s.  In turn, these radicals can start [[chain reaction]]s.  When the chain reaction occurs in a [[cell (biology)|cell]], it can cause damage or death. When the chain reaction occurs in a purified monomer, it produces a polymer resin, such as a [[Thermoplastic|plastic]], a [[synthetic fiber]], or an [[Drying oil|oil paint film]].  Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions. They do this by being oxidized themselves, so antioxidants are often [[reducing agent]]s such as [[thiol]]s, [[ascorbic acid]] or [[polyphenol antioxidant|polyphenol]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sies&quot; /&gt;

Although oxidation reactions are crucial for life, they can also be damaging; hence, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s maintain complex systems of multiple types of antioxidants, such as [[glutathione]], [[vitamin C]], and [[vitamin E]] as well as [[enzyme]]s such as [[catalase]], [[superoxide dismutase]] and various [[peroxidase]]s. Low levels of antioxidants, or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of the antioxidant enzymes, cause [[oxidative stress]] and may damage or kill cells.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

As oxidative stress appears to be an important part of many human diseases, the use of antioxidants in [[pharmacology]] is intensively studied, particularly as treatments for [[stroke]] and [[neurodegenerative disease]]s. However, it is unknown whether oxidative stress is the cause or the consequence of disease.

Antioxidants are widely used as ingredients in [[dietary supplements]] and have been investigated for the prevention of diseases such as [[cancer]], [[coronary heart disease]] and even [[altitude sickness]]. Although initial studies suggested that antioxidant supplements might promote health, later large [[clinical trial]]s did not detect any benefit and suggested instead that excess supplementation is harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=341–8 |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcp026 |title=Oral antioxidant supplementation does not prevent acute mountain sickness: double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial |year=2009 |last1=Baillie |first1=J.K. |last2=Thompson |first2=A.A.R. |last3=Irving |first3=J.B. |last4=Bates |first4=M.G.D. |last5=Sutherland |first5=A.I. |last6=MacNee |first6=W. |last7=Maxwell |first7=S.R.J. |last8=Webb |first8=D.J. |journal=QJM |volume=102 |issue=5 |pmid=19273551}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these uses of natural antioxidants in medicine, these compounds have many industrial uses, such as [[preservatives]] in food and cosmetics and preventing the degradation of [[rubber]] and [[gasoline]].

== History ==
As part of their adaptation from marine life, terrestrial plants began producing non-marine antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] ([[Vitamin C]]), [[polyphenol antioxidant|polyphenol]]s and [[tocopherol]]s.  Further development of [[angiosperm]] plants between 50 and 200 million years ago, particularly during the [[Jurassic]] period, produced many antioxidant pigments evolved during the late [[Jurassic]] period as chemical defences against [[reactive oxygen species]] produced during [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=113–26 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00368-9 |title=Evolution of dietary antioxidants |year=2003 |last1=Benzie |first1=I |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology |volume=136 |pmid=14527634 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=727–9 |doi=10.1089/10507250050137851 |title=Environmental Iodine Deficiency: A Challenge to the Evolution of Terrestrial Life? |year=2000 |last1=Venturi |first1=Sebastiano |last2=Donati |first2=Francesco M. |last3=Venturi |first3=Alessandro |last4=Venturi |first4=Mattia |journal=Thyroid |volume=10 |issue=8 |pmid=11014322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term antioxidant originally was used to refer specifically to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study was devoted to the uses of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal [[corrosion]], the [[vulcanization]] of rubber, and the [[polymerization]] of fuels in the [[fouling]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=177–92 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.16.070147.001141 |title=Antioxidants |year=1947 |last1=Mattill |first1=H A |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=16 |pmid=20259061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of [[unsaturated fat]]s, which is the cause of [[rancidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10335367 |year=1999 |last1=German |first1=JB |title=Food processing and lipid oxidation |volume=459 |pages=23–50 |journal=Advances in experimental medicine and biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of [[Vitamin A|vitamins A]], [[Vitamin C|C]], and [[Vitamin E|E]] as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of [[Organism|living organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8821966 |year=1996 |last1=Jacob |first1=RA |title=Three eras of vitamin C discovery |volume=25 |pages=1–16 |journal=Sub-cellular biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9846200 |year=1998 |last1=Knight |first1=JA |title=Free radicals: Their history and current status in aging and disease |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=331–46 |journal=Annals of clinical and laboratory science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible [[mechanisms of action]] of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moreau |last2=Dufraisse |year=1922 |journal=Comptes Rendus des Séances et Mémoires de la Société de Biologie |volume=86 |pages=321}}{{vs|missing article title, does oclc 20845936 have the correct journal title?|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into how [[vitamin E]] prevents the process of [[lipid peroxidation]] led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging]] [[reactive oxygen species]] before they can damage cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolf |first1=George |pmid=15735064 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15735064 |year=2005 |title=The discovery of the antioxidant function of vitamin E: The contribution of Henry A.

A [[paradox]] in [[metabolism]] is that while the vast majority of complex [[life on Earth]] requires [[oxygen]] for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8660387 |year=1995 |last1=Davies |first1=KJ |title=Oxidative stress: The paradox of aerobic life |volume=61 |pages=1–31 |journal=Biochemical Society symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant [[metabolite]]s and [[enzyme]]s that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as [[DNA]], [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sies&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sies |first1=Helmut |pmid=9129943 |url=http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9129943 |year=1997 |title=Oxidative stress: Oxidants and antioxidants |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=291–5 |journal=Experimental physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vertuani&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1677–94 |doi=10.2174/1381612043384655 |title=The Antioxidants and Pro-Antioxidants Network: An Overview |year=2004 |last1=Vertuani |first1=Silvia |last2=Angusti |first2=Angela |last3=Manfredini |first3=Stefano |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |volume=10 |issue=14 |pmid=15134565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sies&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot; /&gt; However, since reactive oxygen species do have useful functions in cells, such as [[redox signaling]], the function of antioxidant systems is not to remove oxidants entirely, but instead to keep them at an optimum level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1882–3 |doi=10.1126/science.1130481 |title=CELL SIGNALING: H2O2, a Necessary Evil for Cell Signaling |year=2006 |last1=Rhee |first1=S.

The reactive oxygen species produced in cells include [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), and [[free radicals]] such as the [[hydroxyl radical]] (·OH) and the [[superoxide|superoxide anion]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;emfafb&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=44–84 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.001 |title=Free radicals and antioxidants in normal physiological functions and human disease |year=2007 |last1=Valko |first1=M |last2=Leibfritz |first2=D |last3=Moncol |first3=J |last4=Cronin |first4=M |last5=Mazur |first5=M |last6=Telser |first6=J |journal=The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology |volume=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules.

== Metabolites ==
=== Overview ===

Antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in [[water]] ([[hydrophile|hydrophilic]]) or in lipids ([[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell [[cytosol]] and the [[blood plasma]], while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect [[cell membrane]]s from lipid peroxidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sies&quot; /&gt; These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vertuani&quot; /&gt; The different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in [[Bodily fluid|body fluids]] and tissues, with some such as glutathione or [[ubiquinone]] mostly present within cells, while others such as [[uric acid]] are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in [[pathogen]]s and can be [[virulence factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8993856 |year=1997 |last1=Miller |first1=RA |last2=Britigan |first2=BE |title=Role of oxidants in microbial pathophysiology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |pmc=172912 |journal=Clinical microbiology reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a very complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having [[synergy|synergistic]] and interdependent effects on one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=949–62 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(99)00090-3 |title=Intracellular Antioxidants: From Chemical to Biochemical Mechanisms |year=1999 |last1=Chaudiere |first1=J |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=37 |issue=9–10 |pmid=10541450 |last2=Ferrari-Iliou |first2=R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=213–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18025.x |title=Strategies of antioxidant defense |year=1993 |last1=Sies |first1=Helmut |journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=215 |issue=2 |pmid=7688300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vertuani&quot; /&gt; The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vertuani&quot; /&gt;

Some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by [[chelation|chelating]] [[transition metal]]s and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important is the ability to [[sequestering|sequester]] [[iron]], which is the function of [[iron-binding proteins]] such as [[transferrin]] and [[ferritin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pathways Ofoxidativedamage&quot;/&gt; [[Selenium]] and [[zinc]] are commonly referred to as ''antioxidant nutrients'', but these [[chemical element]]s have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.

[[Melatonin]] is a powerful antioxidant and, unlike conventional antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and glutathione, it is both produced in the human body and is acquired in the diet (fruits, vegetables, cereals and herbs etc., contain melatonin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=28–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-079X.2006.00407.x |title=One molecule, many derivatives: A never-ending interaction of melatonin with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species? |year=2007 |last1=Tan |first1=Dun-Xian |last2=Manchester |first2=Lucien C. |last3=Terron |first3=Maria P. |last4=Flores |first4=Luis J. |last5=Reiter |first5=Russel J. |journal=Journal of Pineal Research |volume=42 |pmid=17198536 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the [[blood-brain barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=175–200 |doi=10.1080/10409230903044914 |title=Reducing oxidative/nitrosative stress: A newly-discovered genre for melatonin |year=2009 |last1=Reiter |first1=Russel J. |last2=Paredes |first2=Sergio D. |last3=Manchester |first3=Lucien C. |last4=Tan |first4=Dan-Xian |journal=Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pmid=19635037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo [[redox cycling]], which is the ability of a molecule to undergo repeated [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] and [[oxidation]]. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as [[pro-oxidant]]s and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tan2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=137–59 |doi=10.1159/000014635 |title=Significance of Melatonin in Antioxidative Defense System: Reactions and Products |year=2000 |last1=Tan |first1=Dun-Xian |last2=Manchester |first2=Lucien C. |last3=Reiter |first3=Russel J. |last4=Qi |first4=Wen-Bo |last5=Karbownik |first5=Malgorzata |last6=Calvo |first6=Juan R. |journal=Neurosignals |volume=9 |issue=3–4 |pmid=10899700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tocopherols and tocotrienols (vitamin E) ===

[[Vitamin E]] is the collective name for a set of eight related [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s, which are [[fat-soluble]] vitamins with antioxidant properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrera&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=43–56 |doi=10.1007/BF03179812 |title=Vitamin E: Action, metabolism and perspectives |year=2001 |last1=Herrera |first1=E. |last2=Barbas |first2=C. |journal=Journal of Physiology and Biochemistry |volume=57 |pmid=11579997 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lester |last1=Packer |first2=Stefan U. |last2=Weber |first3=Gerald |last3=Rimbach |pmid=11160563 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11160563 |year=2001 |title=Molecular aspects of alpha-tocotrienol antioxidant action and cell signalling |volume=131 |issue=2 |pages=369S–73S |journal=The Journal of nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, α-tocopherol has been most studied as it has the highest [[bioavailability]], with the body preferentially absorbing and metabolising this form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brigelius&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Regina |last1=Brigelius-Flohé |first2=Maret G. |last2=Traber |pmid=10385606 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10385606 |year=1999 |title=Vitamin E: Function and metabolism |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1145–55 |journal=The FASEB journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that the α-tocopherol form is the most important lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrera&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=4–15 |doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.03.024 |title=Vitamin E, antioxidant and nothing more |year=2007 |last1=Traber |first1=Maret G. |last2=Atkinson |first2=Jeffrey |journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine |volume=43 |pmid=17561088 |issue=1 |pmc=2040110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=309–36 |doi=10.1016/S0163-7827(99)00008-9 |title=Vitamin E and its function in membranes |year=1999 |last1=Wang |first1=Xiaoyuan |journal=Progress in Lipid Research |volume=38 |issue=4 |pmid=10793887 |last2=Quinn |first2=Peter J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 ([[GPX4]])-deficient cells from cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=237–48 |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2008.07.005 |title=Glutathione Peroxidase 4 Senses and Translates Oxidative Stress into 12/15-Lipoxygenase Dependent- and AIF-Mediated Cell Death |year=2008 |last1=Seiler |first1=Alexander |last2=Schneider |first2=Manuela |last3=Förster |first3=Heidi |last4=Roth |first4=Stephan |last5=Wirth |first5=Eva K. |last6=Culmsee |first6=Carsten |last7=Plesnila |first7=Nikolaus |last8=Kremmer |first8=Elisabeth |last9=Rådmark |first9=Olof |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=8 |issue=3 |pmid=18762024}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.

== Pro-oxidant activities ==
{{Further|[[Pro-oxidant]]}}

Antioxidants that are reducing agents can also act as pro-oxidants.

The relative importance of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of antioxidants are an area of current research, but vitamin C, which exerts its effects as a vitamin by oxidizing polypeptides, appears to have a mostly antioxidant action in the human body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valko M, Morris H, Cronin MT |title=Metals, toxicity and oxidative stress |journal=Curr.

== Enzyme systems ==

[[Image:Antioxidant pathway.svg|thumb|right|Enzymatic pathway for detoxification of reactive oxygen species.]]

=== Overview ===

As with the chemical antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sies&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot; /&gt; Here, the superoxide released by processes such as [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway is the result of multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic mice]] lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.&lt;ref name=Magnenat&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ho YS, Magnenat JL, Gargano M, Cao J |title=The nature of antioxidant defense mechanisms: a lesson from transgenic studies |journal=Environ.

=== Superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxiredoxins ===

=== Physical exercise ===

During exercise, oxygen consumption can increase by a factor of more than 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dekkers J, van Doornen L, Kemper H |title=The role of antioxidant vitamins and enzymes in the prevention of exercise-induced muscle damage |journal=Sports Med |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=213–38 |year=1996 |pmid=8776010 |doi=10.2165/00007256-199621030-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a large increase in the production of oxidants and results in damage that contributes to muscular fatigue during and after exercise. The [[Delayed onset muscle soreness|inflammatory response]] that occurs after strenuous exercise is also associated with oxidative stress, especially in the 24 hours after an exercise session. The immune system response to the damage done by exercise peaks 2 to 7 days after exercise, which is the period during which most of the adaptation that leads to greater fitness occurs. During this process, free radicals are produced by [[neutrophil]]s to remove damaged tissue. As a result, excessive antioxidant levels may inhibit recovery and adaptation mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tiidus P |title=Radical species in inflammation and overtraining |url=http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=0008-4212&amp;volume=76&amp;issue=5&amp;startPage=533 |journal=[[Can J Physiol Pharmacol]] |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=533–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9839079 |doi=10.1139/cjpp-76-5-533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidant supplements may also prevent any of the health gains that normally come from exercise, such as increased [[insulin sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ristow M, Zarse K, Oberbach A |title=Antioxidants prevent health-promoting effects of physical exercise in humans |journal=Proc.

The evidence for benefits from antioxidant supplementation in vigorous exercise is mixed. There is strong evidence that one of the adaptations resulting from exercise is a strengthening of the body's antioxidant defenses, particularly the glutathione system, to regulate the increased oxidative stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leeuwenburgh C, Fiebig R, Chandwaney R, Ji L |title=Aging and exercise training in skeletal muscle: responses of glutathione and antioxidant enzyme systems |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/267/2/R439 |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=267 |issue=2 Pt 2 |pages=R439–45 |year=1994 |pmid=8067452}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect may be to some extent protective against diseases which are associated with oxidative stress, which would provide a partial explanation for the lower incidence of major diseases and better health of those who undertake regular exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leeuwenburgh C, Heinecke J |title=Oxidative stress and antioxidants in exercise |journal=Curr Med Chem |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=829–38 |year=2001 |pmid=11375753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nonpolar]] antioxidants such as [[eugenol]]—a major component of [[oil of cloves]]—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted [[essential oil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prashar A, Locke I, Evans C |title=Cytotoxicity of clove (Syzygium aromaticum) oil and its major components to human skin cells |journal=Cell Prolif |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=241–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16872360 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in [[urine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hornig D, Vuilleumier J, Hartmann D |title=Absorption of large, single, oral intakes of ascorbic acid |journal=Int J Vitam Nutr Res |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=309–14 |year=1980 |pmid=7429760}}&lt;/ref&gt; More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects.

These harmful effects may also be seen in non-smokers, as a recent [[meta-analysis]] including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bjelakovic&quot;/&gt; No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected only when the high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately.

While antioxidant supplementation is widely used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, it has been proposed that antioxidants may, paradoxically, interfere with cancer treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Schumacker P|title = Reactive oxygen species in cancer cells: Live by the sword, die by the sword|journal = Cancer Cell|volume = 10|issue = 3|pages = 175–6|year = 2006|pmid = 16959608|doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2006.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was thought to occur since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of oxidative stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further oxidative stress induced by treatments.

[[Image:Vegetarian diet.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are good sources of antioxidants.]]

Measurement of antioxidants is not a straightforward process, as this is a diverse group of compounds with different reactivities to different reactive oxygen species. In [[food science]], the [[oxygen radical absorbance capacity]] (ORAC) has become the current industry standard for assessing antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cao G, Alessio H, Cutler R |title=Oxygen-radical absorbance capacity assay for antioxidants |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=303–11 |year=1993 |pmid=8458588 |doi=10.1016/0891-5849(93)90027-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ou B, Hampsch-Woodill M, Prior R |title=Development and validation of an improved oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay using fluorescein as the fluorescent probe |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=4619–26 |year=2001 |pmid=11599998 |doi=10.1021/jf010586o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other measurement tests include the [[Folin-Ciocalteu reagent]], and the [[Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]] assay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prior R, Wu X, Schaich K |title=Standardized methods for the determination of antioxidant capacity and phenolics in foods and dietary supplements |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=53 |issue=10 |pages=4290–302 |year=2005 |pmid=15884874 |doi=10.1021/jf0502698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antioxidants are found in varying amounts in foods such as vegetables, fruits, grain cereals, eggs, meat, legumes and nuts. Some antioxidants such as [[lycopene]] and ascorbic acid can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Xianquan S, Shi J, Kakuda Y, Yueming J |title=Stability of lycopene during food processing and storage |journal=J Med Food |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=413–22 |year=2005 |pmid=16379550 |doi=10.1089/jmf.2005.8.413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rodriguez-Amaya D |title=Food carotenoids: analysis, composition and alterations during storage and processing of foods |journal=Forum Nutr |volume=56 |pages=35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=15806788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other antioxidant compounds are more stable, such as the polyphenolic antioxidants in foods such as whole-wheat cereals and tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baublis A, Lu C, Clydesdale F, Decker E |title=Potential of wheat-based breakfast cereals as a source of dietary antioxidants |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/content/full/19/suppl_3/308S |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=19 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=308S–311S |date=1 June 2000|pmid=10875602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rietveld A, Wiseman S |title=Antioxidant effects of tea: evidence from human clinical trials |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/133/10/3285S |journal=J Nutr |volume=133 |issue=10 |pages=3285S–3292S |date=1 October 2003|pmid=14519827 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of cooking and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the [[bioavailability]] of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maiani G, Periago Castón MJ, Catasta G |title=Carotenoids: Actual knowledge on food sources, intakes, stability and bioavailability and their protective role in humans |journal=Mol Nutr Food Res |volume=53 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=19035552 |doi=10.1002/mnfr.200800053 |pages=NA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, processed foods contain fewer antioxidants than fresh and uncooked foods, since the preparation processes may expose the food to oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry C, Heppell N |title=Nutritional losses and gains during processing: future problems and issues |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=804076 |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=145–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12002789 |doi=10.1079/PNS2001142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other antioxidants are not vitamins and are instead made in the body. For example, [[ubiquinol]] (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made in humans through the [[mevalonate pathway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turunen&quot; /&gt; Another example is [[glutathione]], which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, [[glycine]] and [[glutamic acid]] before being absorbed, even large oral doses have little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Witschi A, Reddy S, Stofer B, Lauterburg B |title=The systemic availability of oral glutathione |journal=Eur J Clin Pharmacol |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=667–9 |year=1992 |pmid=1362956 |doi=10.1007/BF02284971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flagg EW, Coates RJ, Eley JW |title=Dietary glutathione intake in humans and the relationship between intake and plasma total glutathione level |journal=Nutr Cancer |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=33–46 |year=1994 |pmid=8183721 |doi=10.1080/01635589409514302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as [[acetylcysteine]] can increase glutathione,&lt;ref name=Dodd&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dodd S, Dean O, Copolov DL, Malhi GS, Berk M |title=N-acetylcysteine for antioxidant therapy: pharmacology and clinical utility |journal=Expert Opin Biol Ther |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=1955–62 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18990082 |doi=10.1517/14728220802517901}}&lt;/ref&gt; no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van de Poll MC, Dejong CH, Soeters PB |title=Adequate range for sulfur-containing amino acids and biomarkers for their excess: lessons from enteral and parenteral nutrition |journal=J.

Other compounds in the diet can alter the levels of antioxidants by acting as [[pro-oxidant]]s. Here, consuming the compound causes oxidative stress, which the body responds to by inducing higher levels of antioxidant defenses such as antioxidant enzymes.&lt;ref name=Hail/&gt; Some of these compounds, such as [[isothiocyanate]]s and [[curcumin]], may be [[Chemoprophylaxis|chemopreventive]] agents that either block the transformation of abnormal cells into cancerous cells, or even kill existing cancer cells.&lt;ref name=Hail/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pan MH, Ho CT |title=Chemopreventive effects of natural dietary compounds on cancer development |journal=Chem Soc Rev |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=2558–74 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18949126 |doi=10.1039/b801558a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in technology ==
=== Food preservatives ===

Antioxidants are used as [[food additive]]s to help [[preservative|guard against food deterioration]]. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping in the dark and sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], storing plant materials in [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kader A, Zagory D, Kerbel E |title=Modified atmosphere packaging of fruits and vegetables |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=1–30 |year=1989 |pmid=2647417 |doi=10.1080/10408398909527490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike [[bacteria]]l or [[fungus|fungal]] spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zallen E, Hitchcock M, Goertz G |title=Chilled food systems. Effects of chilled holding on quality of beef loaves |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=552–7 |year=1975 |pmid=1184900}}&lt;/ref&gt; These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as [[propyl gallate]] (PG, E310), [[tert-Butylhydroquinone|tertiary butylhydroquinone]] (TBHQ), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA, E320) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT, E321).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iverson F |title=Phenolic antioxidants: Health Protection Branch studies on butylated hydroxyanisole |journal=Cancer Lett |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=49–54 |year=1995 |pmid=7600543 |doi=10.1016/0304-3835(95)03787-W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E number index |publisher=UK food guide|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm#antioxidants |accessdate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common molecules attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation causes them to turn [[rancidification|rancid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robards K, Kerr A, Patsalides E |title=Rancidity and its measurement in edible oils and snack foods. A review |journal=Analyst |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=213–24 |year=1988 |pmid=3288002 |doi=10.1039/an9881300213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or [[sulfur]]ous flavors, it is important to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoking]], [[salting (food)|salting]] or [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]]. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in [[aluminium foil]] or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Del Carlo M, Sacchetti G, Di Mattia C, Compagnone D, Mastrocola D, Liberatore L, Cichelli A |title=Contribution of the phenolic fraction to the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of olive oil |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=52 |issue=13 |pages=4072–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15212450 |doi=10.1021/jf049806z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat-based [[cosmetics]] such as [[lipstick]] and [[moisturizer]]s to prevent rancidity.

=== Industrial uses ===

Antioxidants are frequently added to industrial products. A common use is as [[Gasoline additive|stabilizers]] in [[fuel]]s and [[lubricant]]s to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines to prevent the polymerization that leads to the formation of engine-fouling residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=3233–7 |doi=10.1021/ja01617a026 |year=1955 |last1=Boozer |first1=Charles E. |last2=Hammond |first2=George S. |last3=Hamilton |first3=Chester E. |last4=Sen |first4=Jyotirindra N. |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=77 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the worldwide market for industrial antioxidants had a total volume of around 0.88 million tons. This created a revenue of circa 3.7 billion US-dollars (2.4 billion Euros).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Market Study: Antioxidants|publisher = [http://www.ceresana.com/en/ Ceresana Research]|url = http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/antioxidants/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are widely used to prevent the oxidative degradation of [[polymers]] such as [[rubbers]], [[plastic]]s and [[adhesive]]s that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why use Antioxidants? |publisher=SpecialChem Adhesives|url=http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id= |accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymers containing [[double bonds]] in their main chains, such as such as [[natural rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]], are especially susceptible to [[oxidation]] and [[ozonolysis]]. They can be protected by [[antiozonant]]s. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and [[ozone]] attack, the former causing a &quot;crazy paving&quot; effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned at right angles to the tensile strain in the product.  Oxidation and [[UV degradation]] are also frequently linked, mainly because [[UV radiation]] creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce [[peroxy]] radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a [[chain reaction]]. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include [[polypropylene]] and [[polyethylene]]. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of [[secondary carbon atom]]s present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a [[primary carbon atom]]. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in [[low density polyethylene]].

[[File:Brass.jpg|thumb|Brass [[Dice|die]]&lt;!-- This is correct. Please click on the link to see the proper singular/plural forms --&gt;, along with zinc and copper samples.]]

'''Brass''' is an [[alloy]] of [[copper]] and [[zinc]]; the proportions of zinc and copper can be varied to create a range of brasses with varying properties.&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Designer, v 30, n 3, May–June 2004, 6–9&lt;/ref&gt; 

In comparison, [[bronze]] is principally an alloy of copper and [[tin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Machinery Handbook'', Industrial Press Inc, New York, Edition 24, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze does not necessarily contain tin, and a variety of alloys of copper, including alloys with [[arsenic]], [[phosphorus]], [[aluminum]], [[manganese]], and [[silicon]], are commonly termed &quot;bronze&quot;. The term is applied to a variety of brasses and the distinction is largely historical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title = Bearings and bearing metals|publisher = The Industrial Press|year = 1921|page = 29|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=nopKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brass is a [[substitutional alloy]]. It is used for decoration for its bright gold-like appearance; for applications where low [[friction]] is required such as locks, gears, bearings, doorknobs, ammunition, and valves; for plumbing and electrical applications; and extensively in [[Brass instrument|musical instruments]] such as horns and bells for its acoustic properties. It is also used in [[zipper]]s. Because it is softer than most other metals in general use, brass is often used in situations where it is important that sparks not be struck, as in fittings and tools around explosive gases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/hand_tools/nonsparking.html OSH Answers: Non-sparking tools]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brass has a muted yellow color, which is somewhat similar to [[gold]]. It is relatively resistant to [[tarnish]]ing, and is often used as decoration and for coins. In antiquity, polished brass was often used as a mirror.

==Properties==
[[File:Macrostructure of rolled and annealed brass; magnification 400X.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microstructure]] of rolled and annealed brass (400X magnification)]]
The [[Ductility|malleability]] and [[acoustics|acoustic]] properties of brass have made it the metal of choice for brass [[musical instrument]]s such as the [[trombone]], [[tuba]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[euphonium]], [[tenor horn]], and the [[French horn]]. Even though the [[saxophone]] is classified as a [[woodwind instrument]] and the [[harmonica]] is a [[free reed aerophone]], both are also often made from brass. In [[Reed pipe|organ pipes]] of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the shallot (or beat &quot;through&quot; the shallot in the case of a &quot;free&quot; reed). 

Brass has higher malleability than bronze or zinc. The relatively low [[melting point]] of brass (900 to 940°C, depending on composition) and its flow characteristics make it a relatively easy material to cast. By varying the proportions of copper and zinc, the properties of the brass can be changed, allowing hard and soft brasses. The density of brass is approximately .303&amp;nbsp;lb/cubic inch, 8400 to 8730 kilograms per cubic metre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_metals.htm|title = Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Different Metals|accessdate = 2009-01-09|author = Roger Walker|last = Walker|first = Roger|work = Density of Materials|publisher = SImetric.co.uk|location = United Kingdom|quote = brass – casting, 8400–8700... brass – rolled and drawn, 8430–8730}}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to 8.4 to 8.73&amp;nbsp;grams per cubic centimetre). 

Today almost 90% of all brass alloys are recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. F. Ashby|author2=Kara Johnson|title=Materials and design: the art and science of material selection in product design|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-RN57euC7x8C&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=12 May 2011|year=2002|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780750655545|pages=223–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because brass is not [[ferromagnetic]], it can be separated from ferrous scrap by passing the scrap near a powerful magnet. Brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry where it is melted and recast into [[billet (semi-finished product)|billet]]s. Billets are heated and extruded into the desired form and size.

Aluminium makes brass stronger and more corrosion resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of [[aluminium oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self healing. Tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in [[Seawater|sea water]] applications (naval brasses). Combinations of iron, aluminium, silicon and manganese make brass [[wear and tear]] resistant.

==Lead content==
To enhance the machinability of brass, lead is often added in concentrations of around 2%. Since lead has a lower melting point than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the grain boundaries in the form of globules as it cools from casting. The pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. In addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. These effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stagnation Time, Composition, pH, and Orthophosphate Effects on Metal Leaching from Brass|publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency|date = September 1996|location = Washington DC|page = 7|id = EPA/600/R-96/103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon is an alternative to lead; however, when silicon is used in a brass alloy, the scrap must never be mixed with leaded brass scrap because of contamination and safety problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chasebrass.com/productline/index_greendot.jsp Chase Brass &amp; Copper Company, Inc]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999 the California State Attorney General sued 13 key manufacturers and distributors over lead content. In laboratory tests, state researchers found the average brass key, new or old, exceeded the [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]] limits by an average factor of 19, assuming handling twice a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ca_ag&quot;&gt;[http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/print_release.php?id=529 News &amp; Alerts – California Dept. of Justice – Office of the Attorney General], October 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2001 manufacturers agreed to reduce lead content to 1.5%, or face a requirement to warn consumers about lead content. Keys plated with other metals are not affected by the settlement, and may continue to use brass alloys with higher percentage of lead content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/print_release.php?id=1077 News &amp; Alerts – California Dept. of Justice – Office of the Attorney General], April 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Superior Court, People v. Ilco Unican Corp., et a. (No. 307102) and Mateel Environmental Justice Foundation v. Ilco Unican Corp., et al. (No. 305765)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in California, lead-free materials must be used for &quot;each component that comes into contact with the wetted surface of pipes and [[Piping and plumbing fittings|pipe fittings]], plumbing fittings and fixtures.&quot; On January 1, 2010, the maximum amount of lead in &quot;lead-free brass&quot; in California was reduced from 4% to 0.25% lead. The common practice of using pipes for electrical grounding is discouraged, as it accelerates lead corrosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;info.sen.ca.gov&quot;&gt;[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/asm/ab_1951-2000/ab_1953_cfa_20060818_134053_sen_floor.html AB 1953 Assembly Bill – Bill Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/upload/Lead-in-Plumbing-Fact-Sheet.pdf Requirements for Low Lead Plumbing Products in California], Fact Sheet, Department of Toxic Substances Control, State of California, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

[[File:00 BMA Automation Sampling cock.JPG|thumb|200px|Brass sampling cock with stainless steel handle.]]'''Harsh environments:''' The so called dezincification resistant ([[DZR]]) brasses are used where there is a large corrosion risk and where normal brasses do not meet the standards. Applications with high water temperatures, [[chloride]]s present or deviating water qualities ([[soft water]]) play a role. DZR-brass is excellent in water [[boiler]] systems. This brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures. 

'''Germicidal properties:''' The copper in brass makes brass [[Antiseptic|germicidal]], via the [[oligodynamic effect]]. For example, brass doorknobs disinfect themselves of many bacteria within eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.vol.at/schmiede/MsgverSSt.html Doorknobs: A Source of Nosocomial Infection?]&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is important in hospitals, and useful in many contexts.

==Season cracking==
[[File:BrassSCC1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cracking in brass caused by ammonia attack]]

Brass is susceptible to [[stress corrosion cracking]], especially from [[ammonia]] or substances containing or releasing ammonia. The problem is sometimes known as [[season cracking]] after it was first discovered in brass [[cartridge case]]s used for [[rifle]] [[ammunition]] during the 1920s in the [[Indian Army]]. The problem was caused by high [[residual stress]]es from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, so initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.

==Brass types==
*'''Admiralty brass''' contains 30% zinc, and 1% tin which inhibits [[Dezincification resistant brass|dezincification]] in many environments.
*'''Aich's alloy''' typically contains 60.66% copper, 36.58% zinc, 1.02% tin, and 1.74% iron. Designed for use in marine service owing to its corrosion resistance, hardness and toughness. A characteristic application is to the protection of ships' bottoms, but more modern methods of cathodic protection have rendered its use less common. Its appearance resembles that of gold.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Alloys'' by E.N. Simons.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Alpha brasses''' with less than 35% zinc, are malleable, can be worked cold, and are used in pressing, forging, or similar applications. They contain only one phase, with [[face-centered cubic]] [[crystal structure]]. '''Prince's metal''' or '''Prince Rupert's metal''' is a type of alpha brass containing 75% copper and 25% zinc. Due to its beautiful yellow color, it is used as an imitation of gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/27.html National Pollutant Inventory – Copper and compounds fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; The alloy was named after [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]].
*'''Alpha-beta brass''' ([[Muntz metal]]), also called '''duplex brass''', is 35–45% zinc and is suited for hot working. It contains both α and β' phase; the β'-phase is [[body-centered cubic]] and is harder and stronger than α. Alpha-beta brasses are usually worked hot.
*'''Aluminium brass''' contains [[aluminium]], which improves its corrosion resistance. It is used for seawater service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makeitfrom.com/data/?material=Aluminum_Brass Material Properties Data: Aluminum Brass]&lt;/ref&gt; and also in [[Euro coins]] ([[Nordic gold]]).
*'''Arsenical brass''' contains an addition of [[arsenic]] and frequently aluminium and is used for boiler [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]]es.
*'''Beta brasses''', with 45–50% zinc content, can only be worked hot, and are harder, stronger, and suitable for casting.
*'''Cartridge brass''' is a 30% zinc brass with good [[cold work]]ing properties. Used for ammunition cases.
*'''Common brass''', or '''rivet brass''', is a 37% zinc brass, cheap and standard for cold working.
*'''DZR brass''' is dezincification resistant brass with a small percentage of arsenic.
*'''[[Gilding metal]]''' is the softest type of brass commonly available. An alloy of 95% copper and 5% zinc, gilding metal is typically used for ammunition &quot;jackets&quot;, e.g. [[Full metal jacket bullet|full metal jacket]] bullets.
*'''High brass''' contains 65% copper and 35% zinc, has a high [[tensile strength]] and is used for [[spring (device)|springs]], [[screw]]s, and [[rivet]]s.
*'''Leaded brass''' is an alpha-beta brass with an addition of [[lead]]. It has excellent machinability.
*'''Lead-free brass''' as defined by California Assembly Bill AB 1953 contains &quot;not more than 0.25 percent lead content&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;info.sen.ca.gov&quot; /&gt;
*'''Low brass''' is a copper-zinc alloy containing 20% zinc with a light golden color and excellent ductility; it is used for flexible metal hoses and metal [[bellows]].
*'''Manganese brass''' is a brass most notably used in making [[Dollar coin (United States)|golden dollar]] coins in the United States. It contains roughly 70% copper, 29% zinc, and 1.3% [[manganese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/manganese-brass manganese brass: Definition from Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Muntz metal]]''' is about 60% copper, 40% zinc and a trace of iron, used as a lining on boats.
*'''Nickel brass''' is composed of 70% copper, 24.5% zinc and 5.5% nickel used to make pound coins in the pound sterling currency.
*'''Naval brass''', similar to admiralty brass, is 40% zinc and 1% tin.
*'''[[Nordic gold]]''', used in 10, 20 and 50 cts euro coins, contains 89% copper, 5% aluminium, 5% zinc, and 1% tin.
*'''Red brass''' is both an American term for the copper-zinc-tin alloy known as [[gunmetal]], and an alloy which is considered both a brass and a bronze. It typically contains 85% copper, 5% tin, 5% lead, and 5% zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Ammen| first = C.W.|title = Metalcasting|publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional|year = 2000|page = 133|isbn = 007134246X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=S5_Uu4eti5cC&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red brass is also an alternative name for ''copper alloy C23000'', which is composed of 14–16% zinc, 0.05% iron and lead, and the remainder copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = C23000 Copper Alloys [Red Brass, C230] Material Property Data Sheet|url = http://www.suppliersonline.com/propertypages/C23000.asp|accessdate = 2010-08-26|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5sHQvVhHl|archivedate= 2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also refer to [[ounce metal]], another copper-zinc-tin alloy.
*'''Rich low brass''' ([[Tombac]]) is 15% zinc. It is often used in jewelry applications.
*'''Tonval brass''' (also called CW617N or CZ122 or OT58) is a copper-lead-zinc alloy. It is not recommended for seawater use, being susceptible to dezincification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquafax.co.uk/aquafax_v2/html/images/aceimages/TechData.pdf Print Layout 1]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''White brass''' contains more than 50% zinc and is too brittle for general use. The term may also refer to certain types of [[nickel silver]] alloys as well as Cu-Zn-Sn alloys with high proportions (typically 40%+) of tin and/or zinc, as well as predominantly zinc casting alloys with copper additive.
*'''Yellow brass''' is an American term for 33% zinc brass.

==History==
Although forms of brass have been in use since [[prehistory]],&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, C. P. (2007) &quot;Of brass and bronze in prehistoric southwest Asia&quot; in La Niece, S. Hook, D. and Craddock, P.T. (eds.) ''Metals and mines: Studies in archaeometallurgy'' London: Archetype Publications. ISBN 1904982190&lt;/ref&gt; its true nature as a copper-zinc alloy was not understood until the post medieval period because the zinc [[vapor]] which reacted with copper to make brass was not recognised as a [[metal]].&lt;ref&gt;de Ruette, M. (1995) &quot;From Contrefei and Speauter to Zinc: The development of the understanding of the nature of zinc and brass in Post Medieval Europe&quot; in Hook, D.R. and Gaimster, D.R.M (eds) ''Trade and Discovery: The Scientific Study of Artefacts from Post Medieval Europe and Beyond'' London: British Museum Occasional Papers 109&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Bible]] makes many references to &quot;brass&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cruden's Complete Concordance p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shakespearean English]] form of the word 'brass' can mean any bronze alloy, or copper, rather than the strict modern definition of brass. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}} The earliest brasses may have been natural alloys made by [[smelting]] zinc-rich copper [[ores]].&lt;ref name=Craddock&gt;Craddock, P.T. and Eckstein, K (2003) &quot;Production of Brass in Antiquity by Direct Reduction&quot; in Craddock, P.T. and Lang, J. (eds) ''Mining and Metal Production Through the Ages'' London: British Museum p.226-7&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period brass was being deliberately produced from metallic copper and zinc minerals using the [[Calamine brass|cementation]] process and variations on this method continued until the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp.170–5&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually replaced by [[speltering]], the direct alloying of copper and zinc metal which was introduced to [[Europe]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Craddock/&gt;

In [[West Asia]] and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] early copper zinc alloys are now known in small numbers from a number of third Millennium BC sites in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Iraq]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kalmikia]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and from 2nd Millennium BC sites in [[West India]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], Iraq and [[Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornton 2007,189–201&lt;/ref&gt; However, isolated examples of copper-zinc [[alloys]] are known in [[China]] from as early as the 5th Millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Weirong, (2001) &quot;The Emergence and Development of Brass Smelting Techniques in China&quot; ''Bulletin of the Metals Museum of the Japan Institute of Metals 34''. p.87–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The compositions of these early &quot;brass&quot; objects are very variable and most have zinc contents of between 5% and 15% wt which is lower than in brass produced by cementation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craddock and Eckstein 2003 p.217&quot;&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003 p.217&lt;/ref&gt; These may be &quot;[[natural alloys]]&quot; manufactured by smelting zinc rich copper ores in [[reducing]] conditions. Many have similar tin contents to contemporary bronze [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] and it is possible that some copper-zinc alloys were accidental and perhaps not even distinguished from copper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craddock and Eckstein 2003 p.217&quot;/&gt; However the large number of copper-zinc alloys now known suggests that at least some were deliberately manufactured and many have zinc contents of more than 12% wt which would have resulted in a distinctive golden color.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003 p.217, Thornton, C.P and Ehlers, C.B. (2003) &quot;Early Brass in the ancient Near East&quot; in IAMS Newsletter 23 p.27-36&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 8th–7th century BC [[Assyria]]n [[cuneiform]] tablets mention the exploitation of the &quot;copper of the mountains&quot; and this may refer to &quot;natural&quot; brass.&lt;ref&gt;Bayley 1990, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Oreichalkos]]'', the [[Ancient Greek]] translation of this term, was later adapted to the [[Latin]] ''[[aurichalcum]]'' meaning &quot;golden copper&quot; which became the standard term for brass.&lt;ref&gt;Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century BC [[Plato]] knew ''oreichalkos'' as rare and nearly as valuable as gold&lt;ref&gt;Craddock, P.T. (1978) &quot;The Composition of Copper Alloys used by the Greek, Etruscan and Roman Civilisations: 3 The Origins and Early Use of Brass&quot; in ''Journal of Archaeological Science 5'' p.8&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes how ''aurichalcum'' had come from [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] ore deposits which had been exhausted by the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder ''Historia Naturalis'' XXXIV 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brass making in the Roman World===
During the later part of first Millennium BC the use of brass spread across a wide geographical area from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;Craddock, P.T., Cowell, M. and Stead, I. (2004) &quot;Britain's first brass&quot; in ''Antiquaries Journal 84'' p339–46.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;Montero-Ruis, I and Perea, A (2007) &quot;Brasses in the early metallurgy of the Iberian Peninsula&quot; in La Niece, S. Hook, D. and Craddock, P.T. (eds.) ''Metals and mines: Studies in archaeometallurgy'' London: Archetype:p.136-40&lt;/ref&gt; in the west to [[Iran]], and [[India]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p.216-7&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have been encouraged by exports and influence from the [[Middle-East]] and eastern Mediterranean where deliberate production of brass from metallic copper and zinc ores had been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 217&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th century BC writer [[Theopompus]], quoted by [[Strabo]], describes how heating earth from [[Andeira]] in [[Turkey]] produced &quot;droplets of false silver&quot;, probably metallic zinc, which could be used to turn copper into oreichalkos.&lt;ref&gt;Bayley 1990, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century BC the Greek [[Dioscorides]] seems to have recognised a link between zinc [[minerals]] and brass describing how [[Cadmia]] ([[zinc oxide]]) was found on the walls of [[furnaces]] used to heat either zinc ore or brass and explaining that it can then be used to make brass.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p.222-4. Bayley 1990, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the first century BC brass was available in sufficient supply to use as [[coin]]age in [[Phrygia]] and [[Bithynia]],&lt;ref&gt;Craddock, P.T. Burnett, A and Preston K. (1980) &quot;Hellenistic copper-based coinage and the origins of brass&quot; in Oddy, W.A. (ed) ''Scientific Studies in Numismatics'' British Museum Occasional Papers 18 p.53-64&lt;/ref&gt; and after the Augustan [[currency reform]] of 23 BC it was also used to make Roman ''[[dupondius|dupondii]]'' and ''[[sestertii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Caley, E.R. (1964) ''Orichalcum and Related Ancient Alloys'' New York; American Numismatic Society&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform use of brass for coinage and military equipment across the [[Roman world]] may indicate a degree of state involvement in the industry,&lt;ref&gt;Bayley 1990, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ponting, M |year=2002|title=Roman Military Copper Alloy Artefacts from Israel: Questions of Organisation and Ethnicity|doi=10.1111/1475-4754.t01-1-00086|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/sace/research/publications/Ponting_Archaeometry_MandG.pdf|journal=Archaeometry|volume=44|issue=4|pages=555–571}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brass even seems to have been deliberately boycotted by [[Jewish]] communities in Palestine because of its association with Roman authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ponting, M (2002) [http://www.liv.ac.uk/sace/research/publications/Ponting_IAMS_Galillee.pdf Keeping up with the Roman Romanisation and Copper Alloys in First Revolt Palestine], ''IAMS'' 22 p.3-6&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Brass was produced by the cementation process where copper and zinc ore are heated together until zinc vapor is produced which reacts with the copper. There is good archaeological evidence for this process and [[crucibles]] used to produce brass by cementation have been found on [[Roman period]] sites including [[Xanten]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0402|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/staff/profiles/rehren/Small%20Size%20Large%20Scale%201999.pdf|title=Small Size, Large Scale Roman Brass Production in Germania Inferior|year=1999|last1=Rehren|first1=T|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=26|issue=8|pages=1083–1087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nidda, Hesse|Nidda]]&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, H. (1976) &quot;Crucibles from a Roman Settlement in Germany&quot; in Journal of the Historical Metallurgy Society 10(1) p.34-5&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Germany]], [[Lyon]] in [[France]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp.170–1&lt;/ref&gt; and at a number of sites in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Bayley 1990&lt;/ref&gt; They vary in size from tiny acorn sized to large [[amphorae]] like vessels but all have elevated levels of zinc on the interior and are lidded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; They show no signs of [[slag]] or metal [[prills]] suggesting that zinc minerals were heated to produce zinc vapor which reacted with metallic copper in a [[solid state reaction]]. The fabric of these crucibles is porous, probably designed to prevent a build up of pressure, and many have small holes in the lids which may be designed to release pressure&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; or to add additional zinc minerals near the end of the process. Dioscorides mentioned that zinc minerals were used for both the working and finishing of brass, perhaps suggesting secondary additions.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brass made during the early Roman period seems to have varied between 20% to 28% wt zinc.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 224&lt;/ref&gt; The high content of zinc in coinage and brass objects declined after the first century AD and it has been suggested that this reflects zinc loss during [[recycling]] and thus an interruption in the production of new brass.&lt;ref&gt;Caley 1964&lt;/ref&gt; However it is now thought this was probably a deliberate change in composition&lt;ref&gt;Dungworth, D (1996) &quot;Caley's 'Zinc Decline' reconsidered&quot; in ''Numismatic Chronicle'' 156 p.228-234&lt;/ref&gt; and overall the use of brass increases over this period making up around 40% of all [[copper alloys]] used in the Roman world by the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock 1978, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brass making in the medieval period===
[[File:Renier de Huy JPG0.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Baptism of Christ]]'' on the 12th century Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, [[Liège]].]]
Little is known about the production of brass during the centuries immediately after the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]]. Disruption in the trade of tin for bronze from [[Western Europe]] may have contributed to the increasing popularity of brass in the east and by the 6th–7th centuries AD over 90% of [[copper alloy]] artefacts from [[Egypt]] were made of brass.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock, P.T. La Niece, S.C and Hook, D. (1990) &quot;Brass in the Medieval Islamic World&quot; in Craddock, P.T. (ed.) ''2000 Years of Zinc and Brass'' London: British Museum p.73&lt;/ref&gt; However other alloys such as low tin bronze were also used and they vary depending on local cultural attitudes, the purpose of the metal and access to zinc, especially between the [[Islamic]] and [[Byzantine]] world.&lt;ref&gt;Ponting, M. (1999) &quot;East Meets West in Post-Classical Bet’shan’ in ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 26 p.1311-21&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely the use of true brass seems to have declined in Western Europe during this period in favour of [[gunmetal]]s and other mixed alloys&lt;ref&gt;Bayley 1990, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the first Millennium AD brass artefacts are found in [[Scandinavians|Scandinavian]] graves in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;Eremin, K Graham-Campbell, J. and Wilthew, P. (2002) &quot;Analysis of Copper alloy artefacts from Pagan Norse Graves in Scotland&quot; in Biro, K.T and Eremin, K. (eds) Proceedings of the 31st International Symposium on Archaeometry Oxford: Archaeopress BAR pp.342–9&lt;/ref&gt; brass was being used in the manufacture of coins in [[Northumbria]]&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, G.R. and Metcalf, D.M (1980) &quot;The alloy of the Northumbrian coinage in the mid-ninth century&quot; in Metcalf, D and Oddy, W. ''Metallurgy in Numismatics'' 1 p.83-98&lt;/ref&gt; and there is archaeological and historical evidence for the production of brass in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Rehren 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Low Countries]]&lt;ref&gt;Day 1990, pp.123–150&lt;/ref&gt; areas rich in [[calamine]] ore which would remain important centres of brass making throughout the [[medieval]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Day 1990, pp.124–33&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[Dinant]] – brass objects are still collectively known as ''dinanterie'' in French. The [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]] in modern [[Belgium]] (before 1117) is an outstanding masterpiece of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] brass casting.

The cementation process continued to be used but literary sources from both Europe and the [[Islamic world]] seem to describe variants of a higher temperature liquid process which took places in open topped crucibles.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p.224-5&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic cementation seems to have used zinc oxide known as ''[[tutiya]]'' or [[tutty]] rather than zinc ores for brass making resulting in a metal with lower [[iron]] impurities.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock et al 1990, 78&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Islamic writers and the 13th century [[Italians|Italian]] [[Marco Polo]] describe how this was obtained by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] from zinc ores and [[Condensation|condensed]] onto [[clay]] or iron bars, archaeological examples of which have been identified at [[Hindu Kush|Kush]] in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock et al 1990, p.73-6&lt;/ref&gt; It could then be used for brass making or medicinal purposes. In 10th century [[Yemen]] [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī|al-Hamdani]] described how spreading [[al-iglimiya]], probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock et al 1990, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th century Iranian writer [[al-Kashani]] describes a more complex process whereby ''tutiya'' was mixed with [[raisins]] and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. A temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock et al 1990, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Europe a similar liquid process in open topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the Roman process and the use of the term tutty by [[Albertus Magnus]] in the 13th century suggests influence from Islamic technology.&lt;ref&gt;Rehren, T (1999) &quot;The same...but different: A juxtaposition of Roman and Medieval brass making in Europe&quot; in Young, S.M.M. (ed.) ''Metals in antiquity'' Oxford: Archaeopress pp.252–7&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th century [[Germans|German]] monk [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and [[charcoal]] then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. The final product was [[casting|cast]], then again melted with calamine. It has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]].&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226&lt;/ref&gt; Albertus Magnus noted that the &quot;power&quot; of both calamine and tutty could [[evaporate]] and described how the addition of powdered [[glass]] could create a film to bind it to the metal.&lt;ref&gt;Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp.176–8&lt;/ref&gt; 
German brass making crucibles are known from [[Dortmund]] dating to the 10th century AD and from [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] and [[Schwerte]] in [[Westphalia]] dating to around the 13th century confirm Theophilus' account as they are open topped, although [[ceramic]] discs from Soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc [[evaporation]], and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.&lt;ref&gt;Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp.173–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brass making in Renaissance and post medieval Europe===
The [[Renaissance]] saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in Europe. By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at [[Zwickau]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp.95–111&lt;/ref&gt; These large crucibles were capable of producing c.20&amp;nbsp;kg of brass.&lt;ref&gt;Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp.105–6&lt;/ref&gt; There are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. Their irregular composition suggesting that this was a lower temperature not entirely liquid process.&lt;ref&gt;Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in the final stages.&lt;ref&gt;Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for [[casting]].&lt;ref&gt;Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; 

16th century technical writers such as [[Biringuccio]], [[Ercker]] and [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]] described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added.&lt;ref&gt;Martinon Torres and Rehren 2008, 181–2, de Ruette 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace By 1513 metallic zinc [[ingots]] from India and China were arriving in [[London]] and pellets of zinc condensed in [[furnace]] flues at the [[Rammelsberg]] in Germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.&lt;ref&gt;de Ruette 1995, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be [[alloyed]] with copper to make brass; a process known as speltering&lt;ref name=&quot;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228&quot;&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1657 the German [[chemist]] [[Johann Glauber]] had recognised that calamine was &quot;nothing else but unmeltable zinc&quot; and that zinc was a &quot;half ripe metal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;de Ruette 1995, 198–9&lt;/ref&gt; However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] from [[England]] may have been made by alloying copper with ''zinc'' and include traces of [[cadmium]] similar those found in some zinc ingots from China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228&quot;/&gt;
 
However the cementation process was not abandoned and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid state]] cementation in a domed furnace at around 900–950 degrees Celsius and lasting up to 10 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The European brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the 16th century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of [[battery wares]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Day 1990, 131&quot;&gt;Day 1990, p.131&lt;/ref&gt; By 1559 the Germany city of [[Aachen]] alone was capable of producing 300,000 [[centum weight|cwt]] of brass per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Day 1990, 131&quot;/&gt; After several false starts during the 16th and 17th centuries the brass industry was also established in England taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper [[smelted]] in the new [[coal]] fired [[reverberatory furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;Day 1991, pp.135–44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1723 [[Bristol]] brass maker [[Nehemiah Champion]] patented the use of [[granulated]] copper, produced by pouring molten metal into cold water.&lt;ref&gt;Day 1990, 138&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the [[surface area]] of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to 33% wt were reported using this new technique.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 227&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1738 Nehemiah's son [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patented a technique for the first industrial scale [[distillation]] of metallic zinc known as ''distillation per descencum'' or &quot;the English process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Day 1991, pp.179–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dungworth, D and White, H (2007) &quot;Scientific examination of zinc-distillation remains from Warmley, Bristol&quot;. ''Historical Metallurgy'' 41, 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; This local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as [[scientific instruments]], [[clocks]], brass [[buttons]] and [[costume jewellery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Day 1991, 183&quot;&gt;Day 1991, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; However Champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower zinc brass &lt;ref name=&quot;Day 1991, 183&quot;/&gt; and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at [[Warmley]].&lt;ref&gt;Day, J. (1988) &quot;The Bristol Brass Industry: Furnaces and their associated remains&quot; in Journal of Historical Metallurgy 22(1) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as [[John-Jaques Dony]]'s horizontal furnaces in Belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc&lt;ref&gt;Day 1991, pp.186–9&lt;/ref&gt; as well as demand for [[corrosion]] resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Day 1991, pp.192–3, Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bonn''' is the 19th largest city in [[Germany]]. Located in the [[Cologne/Bonn Region]], about 25 kilometres south of [[Cologne]] on the river [[Rhine]] in the State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], it was the [[Capital of Germany|capital of]] [[West Germany]] from 1949 to 1990 and the official [[seat of government]] of united Germany from 1990 to 1999. Starting in 1998, many national government institutions were moved from Bonn to [[Berlin]]. Both houses of the German national parliament, the [[Bundestag]] and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], were moved along with the Chancellery and the residence of the [[President of Germany]].

Bonn remains a centre of politics and administration, however. Roughly half of all government jobs were retained as many government departments remained in Bonn and numerous sub-ministerial level government agencies relocated to the former capital from Berlin and other parts of Germany. In recognition of this, the former capital now holds the title of [[Federal City]] (&quot;Bundesstadt&quot;).

Bonn has developed into a hub of international cooperation in particular in the area of environment and sustainable development. In addition to a number of other international organizations and institutions, such as, for instance, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] Environmental Law Center (IUCN ELC) the City currently hosts 17 [[United Nations]] institutions. Among these are two of the so-called Rio Conventions, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ([[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]]) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification ([[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|UNCCD]]). The number of UN agencies in Bonn, most of which are based at the newly established United Nations Campus in the city's former parliamentary quarter on the banks of the Rhine, continues to grow. The most recent agency was started in 2007 in Bonn as the United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response ([[UN-SPIDER]]).

Bonn is the seat of some of Germany's largest corporate players, chiefly in the areas of telecommunications and logistics. Simultaneously, Bonn is establishing itself as an important national and international centre of meetings, conventions and conferences, many of which are directly related to the work of the United Nations. A new conference centre capable of hosting thousands of participants is currently under construction in the immediate vicinity of the UN Campus.

From 1597 to 1794, it was the residence of the [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishops and Prince-electors of Cologne]], and is the birthplace of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (born 1770).

The history of the city dates back to Roman times. In about 11 BC, the [[Roman army|Roman Army]] appears to have stationed a small unit in what is presently the historical centre of the town. Even earlier, the Army had resettled members of a Germanic tribal group allied with Rome, the [[Ubii]], in Bonn. The Latin name for that settlement, &quot;Bonna&quot;, may stem from the original population of this and many other settlements in the area, the [[Eburones|Eburoni]]. The Eburoni were members of a large tribal coalition effectively wiped out during the final phase of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars|War in Gaul]]. After several decades, the Army gave up the small camp linked to the Ubii-settlement. During the 1st century AD, the Army then chose a site to the North of the emerging town in what is now the section of Bonn-Castell to build a large military installation dubbed [[Castra]] Bonnensis, i.e., literally, &quot;Fort Bonn&quot;. Initially built from wood, the fort was eventually rebuilt in stone. With additions, changes and new construction, the fort remained in use by the Army into the waning days of the [[Western Roman Empire]], possibly the mid-5th century. The structures themselves remained standing well into the [[Middle Ages]], when they were called the Bonnburg. They were used by [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish kings]] until they fell in disuse. Eventually, much of the building materials seem to have been re-used in the construction of Bonn's 13th century [[Defensive wall|city wall]]. The Sterntor (''star gate'') in the town centre is a reconstruction using the last remnants of the medieval city wall.

To date, Bonn's Roman fort remains the largest fort of its type known from the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], i.e. a fort built for one full-size [[Roman legion|Imperial Legion]] and its auxiliaries. The fort covered an area of approximately {{convert|250000|m2|acre|lk=on}}. Between its walls it contained a dense grid of streets and a multitude of buildings, ranging from spacious headquarters and large officers' houses to [[barracks]], [[stable]]s and a [[Military prison|military jail]]. Among the legions stationed in Bonn, the &quot;1st&quot;, i.e. the [[Legio I Minervia|Prima Legio Minervia]], seems to have served here the longest. Units of the Bonn legion were deployed to theatres of war ranging from modern-day [[Algeria]] to what is now the Russian republic of [[Chechnya]].

The chief [[Roman roads|Roman road]] linking the provincial capitals of [[Cologne]] and [[Mainz]] cut right through the fort where it joined the fort's main road (now, Römerstraße). Once past the South Gate, the Cologne-Mainz road continued along what are now streets named Belderberg, Adenauerallee et al. On both sides of the road, the local settlement, Bonna, grew into a sizeable Roman town.

In late antiquity, much of the town seems to have been destroyed by marauding invaders. The remaining civilian population then holed up inside the fort along with the remnants of the troops stationed here. During the final decades of imperial rule, the troops were supplied by [[Germanic chieftain]]s employed by the Roman administration. When the end came, these troops simply shifted their allegiances to the new barbarian rulers. From the fort, the Bonnburg, as well as from a new medieval settlement to the South centred around what later became the [[Bonn Minster|minster]], grew the medieval city of Bonn.

Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style Bonn Minster was built, and in 1597 Bonn became the seat of the [[Diocese|Archdiocese]] of Cologne. The town gained more influence and grew considerably. The [[Electorate of Cologne|elector]] [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]] (ruled 1723-1761) ordered the construction of a series of [[Baroque]] buildings which still give the city its character. Another memorable ruler was Max Franz (ruled 1784-1794), who founded the university and the spa quarter of [[Bad Godesberg]]. In addition he was a patron of the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who was born in Bonn in 1770; the elector financed the composer's first journey to [[Vienna]].

In 1794, the town was seized by [[France|French]] troops, becoming a part of the [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Bonn became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Administered within the Prussian [[Rhine Province]], the town  became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]]. Bonn was of little relevance in these years.

===Modern history===
During [[World War II]], Bonn had some military significance due to its population.

Following World War II, Bonn was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] zone of occupation, and in 1949 became the capital of [[West Germany]]. The choice of Bonn was made mainly due to the advocacy of [[Konrad Adenauer]], a former [[Cologne]] Mayor and Chancellor of West Germany after World War II, who came from that area, despite the fact that [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] already had most of the required facilities and using Bonn was estimated to be 95 million DM more expensive than using Frankfurt. It was thought, however, that locating the capital in a major city like Frankfurt or [[Hamburg]] would imply a permanent capital.

Because of its relatively small size for a capital city, Bonn was sometimes referred to, jokingly, as the '''''B'''undeshauptstadt '''o'''hne '''n'''ennenswertes '''N'''achtleben'' ''(Federal capital without noteworthy night-life)'' ''or the'' ''''Bundesdorf'''' ''(Federal Village)''.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Friday, May. 29, 1964 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940432,00.html |title=C'est Si Bonn - TIME |publisher=TIME |date=1964-05-29 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point in the post-WWll/[[Cold War]] era, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Diplomatic mission|Embassy]] in Bonn was America's largest, &quot;comparable, with its thousands of staff, to the [U.S.] [[Baghdad]] embassy today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/opinion/26cohen.html?hp &quot;Remembering Germany&quot;] by [[Roger Cohen]], ''The New York Times'', &quot;Published 25 January 2009.&quot; Retrieved 1-26-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German reunification]] in 1990 made [[Berlin]] the nominal capital of Germany again. This decision did not mandate that the republic's political institutions would also move. There was heated debate about whether the capital of the newly reconstituted Germany should be in Berlin, Bonn, or another city. Berlin's history as Germany's capital was strongly connected with [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]], and more ominously with [[Nazi Germany]]. It was felt that a new peacefully united Germany should not be governed from a city connected to such overtones of war. The debate was concluded by the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Germany's parliament) only on 20 June 1991, concluding that Berlin should be the capital city of the reunified republic. While the government and parliament moved, as a compromise, some of the ministries largely remained in Bonn, with only the top officials in Berlin. There was no plan to move these departments, and so Bonn remained a second, unofficial capital with the new title &quot;Federal City&quot; (Bundesstadt). Because of the necessary construction work, the move took until 1999 to complete.

At present, the private sector plays a major role in Bonn's economy. With 5 stock listed companies, Bonn has the 4th highest market capitalisation amongst German towns. With headquarters of DHL, T-Mobile and other renowned companies, managers have replaced the public sector.

Beethoven's birth place is located in Bonngasse near the market place. Next to the market place is the Old Town Hall, built in 1737 in [[Rococo]] style, under the rule of [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]. It is used for receptions of guests of the town, and as an office for the mayor. Nearby is the ''Kurfürstliches Schloss'', built as a residence for the prince-elector and now the main building of the [[University of Bonn]].  

The ''Poppelsdorfer Allee'' is an alley flanked by [[Chestnut|chestnut trees]] which had the first [[horsecar]] of the town. It connects the ''Kurfürstliches Schloss'' with the ''Poppelsdorfer Schloss'', a palace that was built as a resort for the prince-electors in the first half of the 18th century, and whose grounds are now a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Bonn]]). This axis is interrupted by a railway line and [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], a building erected in 1883/84.

The [[Beethoven Monument, Bonn|Beethoven Monument]] stands on the Münsterplatz, which is flanked by the [[Bonn Minster]], one of Germany's oldest churches. 

The three highest buildings in the city are the [[Radio masts and towers|radio mast]] of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] in Bonn-Venusberg (180&amp;nbsp;m), the headquarters of the [[Deutsche Post]] called ''[[Post Tower]]'' (162.5&amp;nbsp;m) and the former building for the German members of parliament ''[[Langer Eugen]]'' (114.7&amp;nbsp;m) now the new location of the [[United Nations|UN]]-Campus.

In 1969, the independent towns of [[Bad Godesberg]] and [[Beuel]] as well as several villages were incorporated into Bonn, resulting in a city more than twice as large as before. Bad Godesberg and Beuel became districts (''Stadtbezirke'') of Bonn with some independence and populations of about 70,000 each.

Each district has its own quarters:
* '''[[Bad Godesberg]]''': Alt-Godesberg, Friesdorf, Godesberg-Nord, Godesberg-Villenviertel, Heiderhof, Hochkreuz, Lannesdorf, Mehlem, Muffendorf, Pennenfeld, Plittersdorf, Rüngsdorf, Schweinheim

==International relations==
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}
Since 1983, the City of Bonn has established friendship relations with the City of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], and since 1988 Bonn, in former times the residence of the Princes Electors of Cologne, and [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], the formerly most important residential city of the Prussian rulers, have established a city-to-city partnership.

Central Bonn is surrounded by a number of traditional towns and villages which were independent up to several decades ago. As many of those communities had already established their own contacts and partnerships before the regional and local reorganisation in 1969, the Federal City of Bonn now has a dense network of city district partnerships with European partner towns.

The city district of Bonn is a partner of the English university city of [[Oxford]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (since 1947), of [[Budafok]], District XXII of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (since 1991) and of [[Opole]], [[Poland]] (officially since 1997; contacts were established 1954).

The district of Bad Godesberg has established partnerships with [[Saint-Cloud]] in [[France]], [[Frascati]] in [[Italy]], [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead|Windsor and Maidenhead]] in [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Kortrijk]] in [[Belgium]]; a friendship agreement has been signed with the town of [[Yalova]], [[Turkey]].

The district of Beuel on the right bank of the Rhine and the city district of Hardtberg foster partnerships with towns in [[France]]: [[Mirecourt]] and [[Villemomble]].

Moreover, the city of Bonn has developed a concept of international co-operation and maintains sustainability oriented project partnerships in addition to traditional city twinning, among others with [[Minsk]] in [[Belarus]], [[Ulan Bator|Ulan Baatar]] in [[Mongolia]], [[Bukhara]] in [[Uzbekistan|Usbekistan]], [[Chengdu]] in [[China]] and [[La Paz]] in [[Bolivia]].

'''Ballroom dance''' refers to a set of [[partner dance]]s, which are enjoyed both [[social dance|socially]] and [[ballroom dance#Competitive dancing|competitively]] around the world. Because of its [[performance dance|performance]] and [[entertainment]] aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on [[Theater|stage]], [[film]], and [[television]]. 

''Ballroom dance'' may refer, at its widest, to almost any type of social dancing as recreation. However, with the emergence of [[dancesport]] in modern times, the term has become narrower in scope. It usually refers to the International Standard and International Latin style dances (see dance [[Ballroom dance#Dances|categories]] below). These styles were developed in England,&lt;ref name=Franks&gt;Franks A.H. 1963. ''Social dance: a short history''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and are now regulated by the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC). In the United States, two additional variations are popular: ''American Smooth'' and ''American Rhythm''. 

There are also a number of historical dances, and local or national dances, which may be danced in ballrooms or salons. Sequence dancing, in pairs or other formations, is still a popular style of ballroom dance.&lt;ref&gt;Silvester, Victor 1980. ''Old Time and sequence dancing''. Barrie and Jenkins, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions and history ==
The term 'ballroom dancing' is derived from the word ''[[Ball (dance)|ball]]'', which in turn originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''ballare'' which means 'to dance' (a ballroom being a large room specially designed for such dances). In times past, ballroom dancing was [[Social dance|social dancing]] for the privileged, leaving [[folk dancing]] for the lower classes. These boundaries have since become blurred, and it should be noted even in times long gone, many ballroom dances were really elevated folk dances. The definition of ballroom dance also depends on the era: balls have featured popular dances of the day such as the [[Minuet]], [[Quadrille]], [[Polonaise]], [[Polka]], [[Mazurka]], and others, which are now considered to be [[historical dance]]s.

=== Renaissance Period ===
The first authoritative knowledge of the earliest ballroom dances were recorded toward the end of the 16th century, when Jehan Tabourot, under the pen name &quot;[[Thoinot Arbeau|Thoinot-Arbeau]]&quot;, published in 1588 his ''Orchésographie'', a study of late 16th-century French Renaissance social dance. Among the dances described were the solemn [[basse danse]], the livelier [[branle]], [[pavane]], and the [[galliarde]] which [[Shakespeare]] called the &quot;cinq pace&quot; as it was made of five steps.&lt;ref name=silvester&gt;Silvester, Victor 1993. ''Modern Ballroom Dancing''. Tralfalgar Square, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Galliard.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Galliard in [[Siena]], Italy, 15th century]]

In 1650 the [[Minuet]], originally a peasant dance of [[Poitou]], was introduced into Paris and set to music by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and danced by the King [[Louis XIV]] in public, and would continue to dominate ballroom from that time until the close of the 18th century.

Toward the latter half of the 17th century, Louis XIV founded his '[[Académie Royale de Musique|Académie Royale de Musique et de Danse]]', where specific rules for the execution of every dance and the &quot;[[Positions of the feet in ballet|five positions]]&quot; of the feet were formulated for the first time by members of the Académie. Eventually, the first definite cleavage between [[ballet]] and ballroom came when professional dancers appeared in the ballets, and the ballets left the Court and went to the stage. Ballet technique such as the [[Turnout (ballet)|turned out]] positions of the feet, however, lingered for over two centuries and past the end of the Victoria era.&lt;ref name=silvester /&gt;

=== Victorian Era ===
[[File:fredginger.jpg|thumb|right|An RKO publicity still of Astaire and Rogers dancing to &quot;[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]&quot; in ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935)]]
The waltz with its modern hold took root in England in about 1812; in 1819 [[Carl Maria von Weber]] wrote ''[[Invitation to the Dance (Weber)|Invitation to the Dance]]'', which marked the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. The dance was initially met with tremendous opposition due to the semblance of impropriety associated with the closed hold, though the stance gradually softened.&lt;ref name=silvester&gt;Silvester, Victor 1993. ''Modern Ballroom Dancing''; rev. ed. London: Stanley Paul. (1st edition: London: H. Jenkins, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s several new dances made their appearance in the ballroom, including the [[Polka]], [[Mazurka]], and the [[Schottische]]. In the meantime a strong tendency emerged to drop all 'decorative' steps such as ''entrechats'' and ''ronds de jambes'' that had found a place in the Quadrilles and other dances.

=== Early 20th century ===
Modern ballroom dance has its roots early in the 20th century, when several different things happened more or less at the same time. The first was a movement away from the sequence dances towards dances where the couples moved independently. This had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. The second was a wave of popular music, such as [[jazz]], much of which was based on the ideas of black musicians in the USA. Since dance is to a large extent tied to music, this led to a burst of newly invented dances. There were many dance crazes in the period 1910&amp;ndash;1930. 
[[Image:Vernon and Irene Castle2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Vernon and Irene Castle]], early ballroom dance pioneers, c. 1910-1918.]]

The third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the dance crazes into dances which could be taught to a wider dance public in the USA and Europe. Here [[Vernon and Irene Castle]] were important, and so was a generation of English dancers in the 1920s, including [[Josephine Bradley]] and [[Victor Silvester]]. These professionals analysed, codified, published and taught a number of standard dances. It was essential, if popular dance was to flourish, for dancers to have some basic movements they could confidently perform with any partner they might meet. Here the huge [[Arthur Murray]] organisation in America, and the dance societies in England, such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], were highly influential. Finally, much of this happened during and after a period of World War, and the effect of such a conflict in dissolving older social customs was considerable.&lt;ref name=Franks&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson P.J S. 1948. ''The history of English ballroom dancing (1900&amp;ndash;1945)''. London: Jenkins&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the 1930s, the on-screen dance pairing of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] influenced all forms of dance in the USA and elsewhere. Although both [[actor]]s had separate careers, their filmed dance sequences together, which included portrayals of the Castles, have reached iconic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicals101.com/1930film3.htm |title=History of Musical Film, by John Kenrick |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |publisher=Musicals101.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Astaire and Rogers' work portrayed social dancing, although the performances were highly choreographed (often by Astaire or [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]]), and meticulously staged and rehearsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980215/REVIEWS08/401010363/1023 |title=Review of &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936) |date=1998-02-15 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |publisher=[[Roger Ebert|rogerebert.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitive dancing==

Competitions, sometimes referred to as [[DanceSport]], range from world championships, regulated by the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC), to less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels. Most competitions are divided into professional and amateur, though in the USA [[pro-am]] competitions typically accompany professional competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedstatesdancechampionships.com/ USDC]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Olympic Committee]] now recognizes [[competitive dance|competitive]] ballroom dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 Certificate of Olympic recognition of IDSF]&lt;/ref&gt; It has recognized another body, the [[International DanceSport Federation]] (IDSF), as the sole representative body for dancesport in the [[Olympic Games]]. However, it seems doubtful that dance will be included in the Olympic Games, especially in light of efforts to reduce the number of participating sports.

Ballroom dance competitions are regulated by each country in its own way. There are about 30 countries which compete regularly in international competitions. There are another 20 or so countries which have membership of the WDC and/or the IDSF, but whose dancers rarely appear in international competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Complete listings of affiliations are given in the programmes of the major competitions.&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain there is the [[British Dance Council]], which grants national and regional championship titles, such as the British Ballroom Championships, the [[British Sequence Championships]] and the United Kingdom Championships. In the United States, amateur dance proficiency levels are defined by [[USA Dance]] (formerly United States Amateur Ballroom Dance Association, USABDA).

Ballroom dancing competitions in the former USSR also included the [[Soviet Ballroom dances]], or ''Soviet Programme''. Australian [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]] is danced both competitively and socially. In competition there are 15 recognised New Vogue dances, which are performed by the competitors in sequence. These dance forms are not recognised internationally, neither are the US variations such as American Smooth, and Rhythm. Such variations in dance and competition methods are attempts to meets perceived needs in the local market-place.

Internationally, the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]], hosted annually at [[Blackpool]], [[England]], is considered the most prestigious event a dancesport competitor can attend.

[[Formation dance]] is another style of competitive dance recognised by the IDSF.

=== Elements of competition ===
[[Image:MIT 2006 Latin Intermediate.jpg|thumb|Intermediate level international style Latin dancing at the 2006 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] ballroom dance competition. A judge stands in the foreground.]]

In competition ballroom, dancers are judged by diverse criteria such as poise, the hold or frame, posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, floor craft, foot and leg action, and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dancesportireland.org/idsf_news/judging.html | title=What Judges Look For| accessdate=2006-12-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070205105054/http://www.dancesportireland.org/idsf_news/judging.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon. The scorekeepers&amp;mdash;called scrutineers&amp;mdash;will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals, when the [[Skating system]] is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1-6, though the number of couples in the final may vary.

=== Medal tests ===
Medal examinations for amateurs enable dancers' individual abilities to be recognized according to conventional standards. In medal exams, which are run by bodies such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]] (ISTD), each dancer performs two or more dances in a certain genre in front of a judge. Genres such as Modern Ballroom or Latin are the most popular. Societies such as the ISTD also offer medal tests on other dance styles (such as Country &amp; Western, Rock 'n Roll or Tap). In some North American examinations, levels include Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Championship; each level may be further subdivided into either two or four separate sections.

== Dances ==

&quot;Ballroom dance&quot; refers most often to the ten dances of '''International Ballroom''' (or Standard) and '''International Latin''', though the term is also often used interchangeably with the five International Ballroom dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/%7Edon/pubs/modern.html | title=History of Modern Ballroom Dancing| accessdate=2007-02-20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sequence dancing]], which is danced predominantly in the [[United Kingdom]], is also sometimes included as a type of Ballroom dancing. 

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the '''American Style''' ('''American Smooth''' and '''American Rhythm''') also exists. The dance technique used for both International and American styles is similar, but International Ballroom allows only [[Ballroom glossary#Closed position|closed dance positions]], whereas American Smooth allows closed, open and separated dance movements. In addition, different sets of dance figures are usually taught for the two styles.  International Latin and American Rhythm have different styling, and have different dance figures in their respective syllabi.

Others dances sometimes placed under the umbrella &quot;ballroom dance&quot; include [[Nightclub Dance]]s such as [[Lindy Hop]], [[West Coast Swing]], [[Nightclub Two Step]], [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]], [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], and [[merengue (dance)|Merengue]]. 
The categorization of dances as &quot;ballroom dances&quot; has always been fluid, with new dances or folk dances being added to/removed from to the ballroom repertoire from time to time, so no list of subcategories or dances is any more than a description of current practices. There are other dances historically accepted as ballroom dances, and are revived via the [[Vintage dance]] movement.

In Europe, [[Latin Swing]] dances include [[Argentine Tango]], [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]], [[Lindy Hop]], [[Swing Boogie]] (sometimes also known as [[Nostalgic Boogie]]), and [[Disco Fox]]. One example of this is the subcategory of [[Cajun dance]]s that originated in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], with branches reaching both coasts of the [[United States]].

Ballroom/Smooth dances are normally danced to Western music (often from the mid-twentieth century), and couples dance counter-clockwise around a rectangular floor following the [[Ballroom glossary#Line of dance|line of dance]]. In competitions, competitors are costumed as would be appropriate for a [[white tie]] affair, with full gowns for the ladies and [[bow tie]] and [[tail coat]]s for the men; though in American Smooth it is now conventional for the men to abandon the tailsuit in favor of shorter [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]]s, vests, and other creative outfits. 

Latin/Rhythm dances are commonly danced to contemporary Latin American music, and, with the exception of a few traveling dances (for example,, [[Samba (ballroom)|Samba]] and [[Paso Doble]]), couples do not follow the line of dance but perform their routines more or less in one spot.  In competitions, the women are often dressed in short-skirted [[latin]] outfits while the men are outfitted in tight-fitting shirts and pants, the goal being to emphasize the dancers' leg action and body movements.

'''''The Birth of a Nation''''' (originally called ''The Clansman'') is a 1915 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[Silent film|silent]] [[Motion picture|film]] co-written (with [[Frank E. Woods]]), co-[[Movie producer|produced]] (with Harry Aitken), and [[Film director|directed]] by [[D. W. Griffith]] and based on the [[novel]] and [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[The Clansman]]'', both by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]]  It was originally released on February 8, 1915.  The film was originally presented in two parts, separated by an intermission.

The film chronicles the relationship of two families in [[Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era America: the pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Northern United States|northern]] Stonemans and the pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] [[Southern United States|southern]] Camerons over the course of several years.  The [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]] is dramatized.

According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', ''The Birth of a Nation'', which was filmed on a budget of an estimated [[United States dollar|$]]110,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|110000|1915}}}} today), is the highest-grossing film of the silent film era, with earnings of approximately $10 million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000000|1915}}}} today),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = ''Variety'' | first =  | authorlink = Variety (magazine) | title = Biggest Money Pictures | journal = Variety | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 1 | date = 1932-06-21 | publisher = | url = http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/7_v_32_4.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been praised for its technical innovations.

However, the film was, and remains, highly controversial due to its portrayal of [[African American]] men (played by [[White people|white]] actors in [[blackface]]) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women, and the portrayal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (whose original founding is dramatized) as a heroic force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&amp;db_id=4&amp;item_id=27 MJ Movie Reviews - Birth of a Nation, The (1915) by Dan DeVore&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themovingarts.com/revered-and-reviled-d-w-griffiths-the-birth-of-a-nation/|first=Eric M.|last=Armstrong|title=Revered and Reviled: D.W. Griffith’s ‘The Birth of a Nation’|work=The Moving Arts Film Journal |date=February 26, 2010|accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were widespread protests&lt;ref&gt;[http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=125 Mass Moments: “The Birth of a Nation” Sparks Protest]&lt;/ref&gt; against ''The Birth of a Nation'', and it was banned in several cities. The outcry of [[racism]] was so great that D.W. Griffith was inspired to produce ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativereel.com/includes/top-ten/display_review.php?id=00091 Top Ten - Top 10 Banned Films of the 20th Century - Top 10 - Top 10 List - Top 10 Banned Movies - Censored Movies - Censored Films]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is also credited as one of the events which inspired the formation of the &quot;second era&quot; Ku Klux Klan at [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the same year.  Indeed, ''The Birth of a Nation'' was used as a recruiting tool for the KKK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megaessays.com/viewpaper/72334.html A Birth of a Nation essays]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first motion picture to be shown at the [[White House]].  President [[Woodrow Wilson]] supposedly said the film was &quot;... like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true&quot;.  The attribution is disputed.

==Plot==
===Part 1: Pre-Civil War America===
The film follows two juxtaposed families: the Northern Stonemans, consisting of [[abolitionist]] Congressman Austin Stoneman (based on real-life Reconstruction-era Congressman [[Thaddeus Stevens]]), his two sons, and his daughter, Elsie, against the Southern Camerons, a family including two daughters (Margaret and Flora) and three sons, most notably Ben.

The Stoneman brothers visit the Camerons at their [[South Carolina]] estate, representing the [[Old South]]. The elder of the two Stonemans falls in love with Margaret Cameron, while Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. When the Civil War begins, all the young men join their respective armies. 

A black [[militia]] (with a white leader) ransacks the Cameron house. The Cameron women are rescued when Confederate soldiers rout the militia. Meanwhile, the younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war.

Ben Cameron is wounded after a heroic charge at the [[Siege of Petersburg]], in which he gains the nickname &quot;the Little Colonel&quot;. He is taken to a Northern hospital where he finally meets Elsie, who is working there as a nurse. While recovering, Cameron is told that he will be hanged for being a guerrilla. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who has traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Mrs. Cameron persuades Lincoln to issue a pardon.

[[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln is assassinated]] at Ford's Theater, and with him dies his conciliatory postwar policy. Austin Stoneman and other radical congressmen are determined to punish the South for its [[secession]], using harsh measures Griffith depicts as typical of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffith followed the then-dominant [[Dunning School]] or &quot;Tragic Era&quot; view of Reconstruction presented by early 20th century historians such as [[William Archibald Dunning]] and [[Claude G. Bowers]]. Stokes 2007, pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 2: Reconstruction===
[[File:The Birth of a Nation war scene.jpg|thumb|left|Battle scene from ''The Birth of a Nation'']]
Stoneman and his [[mulatto]] protégé, Silas Lynch, go to South Carolina in 1871 to observe the situation first hand. Black soldiers parade through the streets. During the election, whites are turned away while blacks stuff the ballot boxes. Lynch is elected Lieutenant Governor. The newly elected mostly black legislature is shown at their desks, with one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up, and others eating and drinking liquor. They pass laws requiring white civilians to salute black officers and allowing mixed-race marriages.

Meanwhile, Ben, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare off black children, fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie breaks off their relationship out of loyalty to her father.

Then Gus, a former slave and soldier, follows Flora when she goes to fetch water by herself. He tells her he is looking to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Ben finds his sister and holds her as she lies dying. The Klan hunts Gus down, tries him, and finds him guilty. The clansmen leave his corpse on Lynch's doorstep. 

In retaliation, Lynch orders a crackdown on the Klan. Dr. Cameron, Ben's father, is arrested for having Ben's Klan costume, a crime punishable by death. Ben and their faithful servants rescue him, and the Camerons flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way to a small hut, home to two former Union soldiers, who agree to hide them.  As an intertitle states, &quot;The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright.&quot;

Meanwhile, Austin Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch tries to force Elsie to marry him. Stoneman returns, and is happy at first when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is angered when Lynch tells him which one. Disguised Klansmen spies discover Elsie's plight and leave to get help. 

The Klan, gathered together at full strength and with Ben leading them, rides in to regain control of the town. When news reaches Ben about Elsie, he and others go to her rescue. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the clansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The clansmen, with Ben at their head, race to save them just in time.  

The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting. The film concludes with a double honeymoon of Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of [[Christ]]. The penultimate title rhetorically asks: &quot;Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more? But instead-the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace.&quot;

''The Birth of a Nation'' began filming in 1914 and pioneered such camera techniques as [[deep focus]], [[jump-cut]], [[Cross-cutting|cross-cut]] and facial [[close-up]], which are now considered integral to the industry. It also contains many new cinematic innovations, special effects, and artistic techniques.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} At the time, it shattered both box office and film-length records, running three hours and ten minutes.  It was voted one of the &quot;[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|Top 100 American Films]]&quot; (#44) by the American Film Institute in 1998.

The film was based on [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.|Thomas Dixon's]] novels ''[[The Clansman]]'' and ''[[The Leopard's Spots]]''.  Griffith, whose father served as a colonel in the [[Confederate Army]], agreed to pay Thomas Dixon $10,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1914}}}} today) for the rights to his play ''The Clansman''.  Since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed. The film's unprecedented success made him rich. Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Griffith's budget started at US$40,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1914}}}} today), but the film finally cost $112,000&lt;ref&gt;William K. Everson, ''American Silent Film''. New York: Da Capo Press, 1978, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; (the equivalent of $2.41 million in 2010).&lt;ref name=CPIndex&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/data/us/calc/ Consumer Price Index calculator] at Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis website&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Griffith had to seek new sources of capital for his film.  A ticket to the film cost a record $2 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2|1915|r=2}}}} today).&lt;ref name=CPIndex /&gt;  It was the most profitable film in history until ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937.

[[United States Military Academy|West Point]] engineers provided technical advice on the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battle scenes. They provided Griffith with the artillery used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Seelye, Katharine Q. &quot;When Hollywood's Big Guns Come Right From the Source&quot;, ''The New York Times'', 10 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered on February 8, 1915, at [[Clune's Auditorium]] in downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. At its premiere the film was entitled ''The Clansman'' but the title was later changed to ''The Birth of a Nation'' to reflect Griffith's belief that the [[United States]] emerged out of the [[American Civil War]] and Reconstruction as a unified nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/birt.html  Dirks, Tim, ''The Birth of a Nation'', filmsite.org] Retrieved May 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is currently in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/dw_griffith_birth_of_a_nation &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; at the Internet Archive] Retrieved August 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
