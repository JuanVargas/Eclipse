The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List is a list of rulers of Wessex, including the lengths of their reigns.  It survives in several forms, including as a preface to the [B] manuscript of the ''Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=Swanton_xxiii&gt;The Regnal List is now separated from the main body of the Chronicle, and as result the manuscripts are recorded separately in the [[British Library]], as MS Cotton Tiberius Aii, f. 178 (for the Regnal List), and MS Cotton Tiberius Avi, ff. 1–34 (the [B] manuscript of the ''Chronicle'').  See Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. xxii.  See also Lapidge, ''Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;  As with ''Chronicle'', The List was compiled during the reign of Alfred the Great, and both the List and the ''Chronicle'' are influenced by the desire of their writers to use a single line of descent to trace the lineage of the Kings of Wessex through Cerdic to [[Gewis]], a descendant of [[Woden]] and the legendary ancestor of the West Saxons.  The result served the political purposes of the scribe, but is riddled with contradictions for historians.&lt;ref name=Kirby_49&gt;D.P. Kirby (''Earliest English Kings'', p. 49) refers to the combination of the Chronicle and the Regnal List as a &quot;political fiction&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contradictions may be seen clearly by calculating dates by different methods from the various sources.  The first event in West Saxon history, the date of which can be regarded as reasonably certain, is the baptism of [[Cynegils]], which occurred in the late 630s, perhaps as late as 640. The ''Chronicle'' dates Cerdic's arrival to 495, but adding up the lengths of the reigns as given in the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, leads to the conclusion that Cerdic's reign might have started in 532, a difference of 37 years.  Neither 495 nor 532 may be treated as reliable, however, the latter date relies on the presumption that the Regnal List is correct in presenting the kings of Wessex as having succeeded one another, with no omitted kings, no joint kingships, and that the durations of the reigns are correct as given. None of these presumptions may be made safely.&lt;ref name=Kirby_50 /&gt;

The sources also are inconsistent on the length of Ceawlin's reign.  The ''Chronicle'' gives it as thirty-two years, from 560 to 592, but the Regnal Lists disagree: different versions give it as seven or seventeen years.  A recent detailed study of the Regnal List dates the arrival of the West Saxons in England to 538, and favours seven years as the most likely length of Ceawlin's reign, with dates of 581&amp;ndash;588 proposed.&lt;ref name=Kirby_50 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke_133&gt;D.N. Dumville, &quot;The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List and the chronology of Wessex&quot;, 1985, cited in Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sources do agree that Ceawlin is the son of Cynric and he usually is named as the father of Cuthwine.&lt;ref name=Swanton_GT&gt;See the &quot;Genealogical Tables&quot; in the appendices to Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is one discrepancy to be noted in this case: the entry for 685 in the [A] version of the Chronicle assigns Ceawlin a son, Cutha, but in the 855 entry in the same manuscript, Cutha is listed as the son of Cuthwine.  Cutha also is named as Ceawlin's brother in the [E] and [F] versions of the Chronicle, in the 571 and 568 entries, respectively.&lt;ref name=Swanton_18&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 18–19. For tables showing the variations in the Wessex genealogy, see also figures 3 and 4 in Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether Ceawlin is a descendant of Cerdic is a matter of debate.  Subgroupings of different West Saxon lineages give the impression of separate groups, of which Ceawlin's line is one.  Some of the problems in the Wessex genealogies may have come about because of efforts to integrate Ceawlin's line with the other lineages: it was very important to the West Saxons to be able to trace their ancestors back to Cerdic.&lt;ref name=Yorke_142&gt;Yorke (''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 133) gives this argument in some detail.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reason for doubting the literal nature of these early genealogies is that the etymology of the names of several early members of the dynasty do not appear to be Germanic, which is the origin of these peoples.  The name, Ceawlin, is one of the names that does not have a convincing Anglo-Saxon origin; it seems more likely to be from the native Britons.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Records of the West Saxon dynasties survive in versions which have been subject to later manipulation, which may make it all the more significant that some of the founding 'Saxon' fathers have British names: Cerdic, Ceawlin, Cenwalh.&quot; in: Hills, C., ''Origins of the English,'' Duckworth (2003), p. 105. Also &quot;The names Cerdic, Ceawlin and Caedwalla, all in the genealogy of the West Saxon kings, are apparently British.&quot; in: Ward-Perkins, B., ''Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?'' ''The English Historical Review'' 115.462 (June 2000): p513.&lt;/ref&gt;

It also should be noted that the earliest sources do not use the term &quot;West Saxon&quot;.  According to [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', the term is interchangeable with the [[Gewisse]], meaning the descendants of Gewis.  The term &quot;West Saxon&quot; only appears in the late seventh century, after the reign of [[Cædwalla of Wessex|Cædwalla]].&lt;ref name=Kirby_48&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 48, 223&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Saxon expansion==
[[Image:Ceawlin map.png|thumb|right|A map of places mentioned by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' in annals relating to Ceawlin; modern versions of the place names are given here, rather than the Anglo-Saxon names used in the chronicle.|alt=A map showing places in central southern England, including Gloucester, Cirencester, Bath, and Aylesbury]]

Ultimately, the kingdom of Wessex occupied the southwest of England, but the initial stages in this expansion are not apparent from the sources.&lt;ref name=Kirby_49/&gt;  Cerdic's landing, whenever it is to be dated, seems to have been near the [[Isle of Wight]], and the annals record the conquest of the island in 530.  In 534, according to the ''Chronicle'', Cerdic died and his son Cynric took the throne; the ''Chronicle'' adds that &quot;they gave the Isle of Wight to their nephews, Stuf and Wihtgar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the name &quot;Wight&quot; is derived from the Romano-British &quot;Vectis', not from &quot;Wihtgar&quot;; see Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  These records are in direct conflict with [[Bede]], who states that the Isle of Wight was settled by Jutes, not Saxons; the [[archaeological record]] is somewhat in favour of Bede on this.&lt;ref name=Swanton_14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stenton_22&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent entries in the ''Chronicle'' give details of some of the battles by which the West Saxons won their kingdom.  Ceawlin's campaigns are not given as near the coast.  They range along the [[Thames Valley|Thames valley]] and beyond, as far as [[Surrey]] in the east and the mouth of the [[Severn]] in the west.  Ceawlin clearly is part of the West Saxon expansion, but the military history of the period is difficult to understand.&lt;ref name=Kirby_49 /&gt;  In what follows the dates are as given in the Chronicle, although as noted above, these are earlier than now thought accurate.

&lt;big&gt;'''556: Beran byrg'''&lt;/big&gt;

The first record of a battle fought by Ceawlin is in 556, when he and his father, Cynric, fought the native Britons at &quot;Beran byrg&quot;, or Bera's Stronghold.  This now is identified as [[Barbury Castle]], an Iron Age hill fort in Wiltshire, near Swindon.  Cynric would have been king of Wessex at this time.&lt;ref name=Swanton_14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stenton_26&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 26–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''568: Wibbandun'''&lt;/big&gt;

The first battle Ceawlin fought as king is dated by the ''Chronicle'' to 568, when he and Cutha fought with [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]], the king of Kent.  The entry says &quot;Here Ceawlin and Cutha fought against Aethelberht and drove him into Kent; and they killed two [[Ealdorman|ealdormen]], Oslaf and Cnebba, on Wibbandun.&quot;  The location of &quot;Wibbandun&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;Wibba's Mount&quot;, has not been identified definitely; it was at one time thought to be Wimbledon, but this now is known to be incorrect.&lt;ref name=Plummer_2_16&gt;Plummer, ''Two Saxon Chronicles'', vol. 2 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodgkins_188&gt;English Place-Name Society (1926), p. xiv, cited in Hodgkins, ''A History'', p. 188 n. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  This battle is notable as the first recorded conflict between the invading peoples: previous battles recorded in the ''Chronicle'' are between the Anglo-Saxons and the native Britons.&lt;ref name=Swanton_14 /&gt;

There are multiple examples of joint kingship in Anglo-Saxon history, and this may be another: it is not clear what Cutha's relationship to Ceawlin is, but it certainly is possible he was also a king.  The annal for 577, below, is another possible example.&lt;ref name=Yorke_143_2&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp. 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''571: Bedcanford'''&lt;/big&gt;

The annal for 571 reads: &quot;Here Cuthwulf fought against the Britons at Bedcanford, and took four settlements: [[Limbury]] and [[Aylesbury]], [[Benson, Oxfordshire|Benson]] and [[Eynsham]]; and in the same year he passed away.&quot;  Cuthwulf's relationship with Ceawlin is unknown, but the alliteration common to Anglo-Saxon royal families suggests Cuthwulf may be part of the West Saxon royal line.  The location of the battle itself is unidentified.  It has been suggested that it was [[Bedford]], but what is known of the early history of Bedford's names, does not support this.  This battle is of interest because it is surprising that an area so far east should still be in Briton hands this late: there is ample archaeological evidence of early Saxon and Anglian presence in the Midlands, and historians generally have interpreted Gildas's ''De Excidio'' as implying that the Britons had lost control of this area by the mid-sixth century.  One possible explanation is, that this annal records a reconquest of land that was lost to the Britons in the campaigns ending in the battle of Mons Badonicus.&lt;ref name=Stenton_26 /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''577: The lower Severn'''&lt;/big&gt;

The annal for 577 reads &quot;Here Cuthwine and Ceawlin fought against the Britons, and they killed three kings, Coinmail and Condidan and Farinmail, in the place which is called [[Dyrham]], and took three cities: [[Gloucester]] and [[Cirencester]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Swanton_18_2&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;  This entry is all that is known of these Briton kings; their names are in an archaic form that makes it very likely that this annal derives from a much older written source.  The battle itself has long been regarded as a key moment in the Saxon advance, since in reaching the [[Bristol Channel]], the West Saxons divided the Britons west of the Severn from land communication with those in the peninsula to the south of the Channel.&lt;ref name=Stenton_29&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wessex almost certainly lost this territory to [[Penda of Mercia]] in 628, when the Chronicle records that &quot;Cynegils and Cwichelm fought against Penda at Cirencester and then came to an agreement.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stenton_45&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swanton_24&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that when Ceawlin and Cuthwine took Bath, they found the Roman baths still operating to some extent.  [[Nennius]], a ninth-century historian, mentions a &quot;Hot Lake&quot; in the land of the [[Hwicce]], which was along the Severn, and adds &quot;It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes.  If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot&quot;.  Bede also describes hot baths in the geographical introduction to the ''Ecclesiastical History'' in terms very similar to those of Nennius.&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_40&gt;Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wansdyke (earthwork)|Wansdyke]], an early medieval defensive linear earthwork, runs from south of [[Bristol]] to near [[Marlborough]], passing not far from Bath.  It probably was built in the fifth or sixth centuries, perhaps by Ceawlin.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_25&gt;Fletcher, ''Who's Who'', pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''584: Fethan leag'''&lt;/big&gt;

Ceawlin's last recorded victory is in 584.  The entry reads &quot;Here Ceawlin and Cutha fought against the Britons at the place which is named Fethan leag, and Cutha was killed; and Ceawlin took many towns and countless war-loot, and in anger he turned back to his own [territory].&quot;&lt;ref name=Swanton_14 /&gt;  There is a wood named &quot;Fethelée&quot; mentioned in a twelfth century document that relates to [[Stoke Lyne]], in [[Oxfordshire]], and it now is thought that the battle of Fethan leag must have been fought in this area.&lt;ref name=Stenton_29 /&gt;

The phrase &quot;in anger he turned back to his own&quot; probably indicates that this annal is drawn from saga material, as perhaps are all of the early Wessex annals.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_25/&gt;   It also has been used to argue that perhaps, Ceawlin did not win the battle and that the chronicler chose not to record the outcome fully – a king does not usually come home &quot;in anger&quot; after taking &quot;many towns and countless war-loot&quot;.  It may be that Ceawlin's overlordship of the southern Britons came to an end with this battle.&lt;ref name=Stenton_30 /&gt;

==Bretwaldaship==
[[Image:ASC C 827.gif|thumb|right|350px|The entry for 827 in the [C] manuscript of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,'' listing the eight ''bretwaldas'', Ceawlin's name can be seen in the fifth line, spelled &quot;Ceaulin&quot;|alt=Part of a manuscript page showing eleven lines of lettering in an old style, with a Roman numeral in reddish ink at the start of the first line]]

About 731, Bede, a [[Northumbria]]n monk and chronicler, wrote a work called the ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''.  The work was not primarily a secular history, but Bede provides much information about the history of the Anglo-Saxons, including a list early in the history of seven kings who, he said, held &quot;imperium&quot; over the other kingdoms south of the [[Humber]].  The usual translation for &quot;imperium&quot; is &quot;overlordship&quot;.   Bede names Ceawlin as the second on the list, although he spells it &quot;Caelin&quot;, and adds that he was &quot;known in the speech of his own people as Ceaulin&quot;. Bede also makes it clear that Ceawlin was not a Christian&amp;mdash;Bede mentions a later king, Æthelberht of Kent, as &quot;the first to enter the kingdom of heaven&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bede_111&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', II 5, quoted from Sherley-Price's translation, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,'' in an entry for the year 827, repeats Bede's list, adds [[Egbert of Wessex]], and also mentions that they were known as &quot;bretwalda&quot;, or &quot;Britain-ruler&quot;.&lt;ref name=Swanton_60 /&gt;   A great deal of scholarly attention has been given to the meaning of this word.  It has been described as a term &quot;of encomiastic poetry&quot;,&lt;ref name=Stenton_34&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; but there also is evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership.&lt;ref name=Kirby_17&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede says that these kings had authority &quot;south of the [[Humber]]&quot;, but no doubt the span of control, at least of the earlier bretwaldas, likely was less than this.&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_53&gt;Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ceawlin's case the range of control is hard to determine accurately, but Bede's inclusion of Ceawlin in the list of kings who held ''imperium'', and the list of battles he is recorded as having won, indicate an energetic and successful leader who, from a base in the upper Thames valley, dominated much of the surrounding area and held overlordship over the southern Britons for some period.&lt;ref name=Kirby_55 /&gt;  Despite Ceawlin's military successes, the northern conquests he made could not always be retained: [[Mercia]] took much of the upper Thames valley, and the north-eastern towns won in 571 were among territory subsequently under the control of Kent and Mercia at different times.&lt;ref name=Stenton_29 /&gt;

Bede's concept of the power of these overlords also must be regarded as the product of his eighth-century viewpoint.  When the ''Ecclesiastical History'' was written, [[Æthelbald of Mercia]] dominated the English south of the Humber, and Bede's view of the earlier kings was doubtless strongly coloured by the state of England at that time.  For the earlier ''bretwaldas'', such as Ælle and Ceawlin, there must be some element of anachronism in Bede's description.&lt;ref name=Kirby_17/&gt;  It also is possible that Bede only meant to refer to power over Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, not the native Britons.&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_53/&gt;

Ceawlin is the second king in Bede's list.  All the subsequent bretwaldas followed more or less consecutively, but there is a long gap, perhaps fifty years, between [[Ælle of Sussex]], the first bretwalda, and Ceawlin.  The lack of gaps between the overlordships of the later bretwaldas has been used to make an argument for Ceawlin's dates matching the later entries in the Chronicle with reasonable accuracy.  According to this analysis, the next bretwalda, [[Æthelberht of Kent]], must have been already a dominant king by the time Pope [[Gregory the Great]] wrote to him in 601, since Gregory would have not written to an underking.  Ceawlin defeated Æthelberht in 568 according to the ''Chronicle''.  Æthelberht's dates are a matter of debate, but recent scholarly consensus has his reign starting no earlier than 580.  The 568 date for the battle at Wibbandun is thought to be unlikely because of the assertion in various versions of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List that Ceawlin's reign lasted either seven or seventeen years.  If this battle is placed near the year 590, before Æthelberht has established himself as a powerful king, then the subsequent annals relating to Ceawlin's defeat and death may be reasonably close to the correct date.  In any case, the battle with Æthelberht is unlikely to have been more than a few years on either side of 590.&lt;ref name=Kirby_56_2&gt;The argument is made in more detail in Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 56. See also pp. 50–51 for a review of the evidence concerning the length of Ceawlin's reign.&lt;/ref&gt;  The gap between Ælle and Ceawlin, on the other hand, has been taken as supporting evidence for the story told by Gildas in ''De Excidio'' of a peace lasting a generation or more following a Briton victory at Mons Badonicus.&lt;ref name=Stenton_19&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Æthelberht of Kent succeeds Ceawlin on the list of bretwaldas, but the reigns may overlap somewhat: recent evaluations give Ceawlin a likely reign of 581&amp;ndash;588, and place Æthelberht's accession near to the year 589, but these analyses are no more than scholarly guesses.&lt;ref name=Yorke_133 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby_31&gt;Kirby (''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 31–34) provides a very detailed analysis of the chronology of Æthelberht's reign.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ceawlin's eclipse in 592, probably by Ceol, may have been the occasion for Æthelberht to rise to prominence; Æthelberht very likely was the dominant Anglo-Saxon king by 597.&lt;ref name=Kirby_56&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Æthelberht's rise may have been earlier: the 584 annal, even if it records a victory, is the last victory of Ceawlin's in the Chronicle, and the period after that may have been one of Æthelberht's ascent and Ceawlin's decline.&lt;ref name=Stenton_30 /&gt;

==Wessex at Ceawlin's death==
[[Image:English kingdoms 600.gif|thumb|150px|right|The state of Anglo-Saxon England at Ceawlin's death|alt=A map showing England and Wales, with the locations of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms marked, and some towns]]

Ceawlin lost the throne of Wessex in 592.  The annal for that year reads, in part: &quot;Here there was great slaughter at Woden's Barrow, and Ceawlin was driven out.&quot;  Woden's Barrow is a tumulus, now called Adam's Grave, at [[Alton, Wiltshire|Alton Priors]], [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref name=Swanton_14 /&gt;  No details of his opponent are given.  The medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in about 1120, says that it was &quot;the Angles and the British conspiring together&quot;,&lt;ref name=Plummer_2_17&gt;Quoted in Plummer, ''Two Saxon Chronicles'', vol. 2 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it may have been Ceol, who is supposed to have been the next king of Wessex, ruling for six years according to the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List.&lt;ref name=Kirby_56 /&gt;  According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', Ceawlin died the following year.  The relevant part of the annal reads: &quot;Here Ceawlin and Cwichelm and Crida perished.&quot;&lt;ref name=Swanton_14 /&gt;  Nothing more is known of Cwichelm and Crida, although they may have been members of the Wessex royal house – their names fit the alliterative pattern common to royal houses of the time.&lt;ref name=Stenton_30 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke_143&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Regnal List, Ceol was a son of Cutha, who was a son of Cynric; and Ceolwulf, his brother, reigned for seventeen years after him.  It is possible that some fragmentation of control among the West Saxons occurred at Ceawlin's death: Ceol and Ceolwulf may have been based in Wiltshire, as opposed to the upper Thames valley.  This split also may have contributed to Æthelberht's ability to rise to dominance in southern England.  The West Saxons remained influential in military terms, however: the ''Chronicle'' and Bede record continued military activity against Essex and Sussex within twenty or thirty years of Ceawlin's death.&lt;ref name=Kirby_17/&gt;

{{Optical disc authoring}}

A '''CD-R''' (''Compact Disc-Recordable'') is a variation of the [[Compact Disc]] invented by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]]. CD-R is a [[Write Once Read Many]] (WORM) optical medium, though the whole disk does not have to be entirely written in the same session.

CD-R retains a high level of compatibility with standard CD readers, unlike [[CD-RW]] – which can be re-written, but is not capable of playing on many readers, and also uses more expensive media.

==History==
[[Image:CD-R.jpg|left|thumb|Assorted CD-Rs]]
The CD-R, originally named CD '''W'''rite-'''O'''nce (WO), specification was first published in 1988 by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] in the 'Orange Book'. The Orange Book consists of several parts, furnishing details of the CD-WO, CD-MO ('''M'''agneto-'''O'''ptic), and CD-RW ('''R'''e'''W'''ritable). The latest editions have abandoned the use of the term &quot;CD-WO&quot; in favor of &quot;CD-R&quot;, while &quot;[[CD-MO]]&quot; were very little used. Written CD-Rs and CD-RWs are, from a technical standpoint, fully compatible with the Audio CD ([[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]]) and CD-ROM ([[Yellow Book (CD-ROM standards)|Yellow Book]]) standards, although some hardware compatible with Red Book CDs may have difficulty reading CD-Rs and especially CD-RWs. They use [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation]], [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]] error correction plus the third error correction layer defined for [[CD-ROM]].

CD-R recording systems available in 1990 were similar to the washing machine-sized Meridian CD Publisher, based on the two-piece rack mount [[Yamaha]] PDS audio recorder costing $35,000, not including the required external [[Error correction code|ECC]] circuitry for data encoding, [[SCSI]] hard drive subsystem, and [[MS-DOS]] control computer. By 1992 the cost of typical recorders was down to $10–12,000, and in September 1995 [[Hewlett-Packard]] introduced its model 4020i manufactured by Philips, which at $995 was the first recorder to cost less than $1000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030202233907/http://www.roxio.com/en/support/cdr/historycdr.html Roxio history of CD-R] from Roxio Newsletter 17 January 2000. Retrieved 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The dye materials developed by [[Taiyo Yuden]] made it possible for CD-R discs to be compatible with Audio CD and CD-ROM discs.

Initially in the [[United States]], there was a market separation between &quot;music&quot; CD-Rs and &quot;data&quot; CD-Rs, the former being several times more expensive than the latter due to industry [[copyright]] arrangements with the [[RIAA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988955,00.html A New Spin], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', August 24, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, there is no difference between the discs save for the Disc Application Flag that identifies their type: standalone audio recorders will only accept &quot;music&quot; CD-Rs to enforce the RIAA arrangement, while computer CD-R drives can use either type of media to burn either type of content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq07.html#S7-17 What's the difference between &quot;data&quot; and &quot;music&quot; blanks?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
A standard CD-R is a 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.047&amp;nbsp;in) thick disc made of [[polycarbonate]] with a 120&amp;nbsp;mm (4.7&amp;nbsp;in) or 80&amp;nbsp;mm (3.150&amp;nbsp;in) diameter. The 120&amp;nbsp;mm disc has a storage capacity of 74 minutes of audio or 650 [[MiB]] of data. CD-R/RWs are available with capacities of 80 minutes of audio or 737,280,000 bytes (703 MiB), which they achieve by molding the disc at the tightest allowable tolerances specified in the [[Orange Book (CD standard)|Orange Book]] CD-R/CD-RW standards. The engineering margin that was reserved for manufacturing tolerance has been used for data capacity instead, leaving no tolerance for manufacturing; for these discs to be truly compliant with the Orange Book standard, the manufacturing process must be perfect.

Most CD-Rs on the market have an 80 minute capacity. There are also 90 minute/790 MiB and 99 minute/870 MiB discs, although they are less common (and violate the Orange Book standard; note that nothing in the Red, Yellow or Orange Book standards says that disc reading/writing devices may not have the capacity to read discs beyond the standard.) Some drives use special techniques, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN to write more data onto a given disc; these techniques inherently are deviations from the Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group and will not be archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2 GB with GigaRec or 1.8 GB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). Also, due to the limitations of the data structures in the ATIP (see below), 90 and 99 minute blanks will identify as 80 minute ones and have to be burned using &quot;[[Overburn#Overburning|overburn]]&quot; options in the CD recording software. (Overburning itself is so named because it is outside the written standards, but it has become a de facto standard function in most CD writing drives and software for them.)

(Note: While disc players and drives may have capabilities beyond the standards such that they are able to use nonstandard discs, there is no assurance, in the absence of explicit additional manufacturer specifications beyond normal Compact Disc logo certification, that any particular player or drive will perform beyond the standards at all or consistently. Furthermore, if the same device with no explicit performance specs beyond the Compact Disc logo initially handles nonstandard discs reliably but later stops doing so, there is no assurance that it can be fixed to do so again. Therefore, discs with capacities larger than 650 MiB and especially larger than 800 MiB are less interchangeable among players/drives and are not very suitable for archival use, as their readability on future equipment is not assured.)

[[Image:CDgroove.jpg|thumb|left|Photomicrograph of the groove in a CD-R disc]]
The polycarbonate disc contains a spiral groove, called the &quot;pregroove&quot; (because it is molded in before data are written to the disc), to guide the [[laser]] beam upon writing and reading information. The pregroove is molded into the top side of the polycarbonate disc, where the pits and lands would be molded if it were a pressed (nonrecordable) Red Book CD; the bottom side, which faces the laser beam in the player or drive, is flat and smooth. The polycarbonate disc is coated on the pregroove side with a very thin layer of organic dye. Then, on top of the dye is coated a thin, reflecting layer of [[silver]], a silver [[alloy]], or [[gold]]. Finally, a protective coating of a photo-polymerizable lacquer is applied on top of the metal reflector and cured with [[ultraviolet|UV]]-light.

A blank CD-R is not &quot;empty&quot;; the pregroove has a wobble (the [[Absolute Time in Pregroove|ATIP]]), which helps the writing laser to stay on track and to write the data to the disc at a constant rate. Maintaining a constant rate is essential to ensure proper size and spacing of the pits and lands burned into the dye layer. As well as providing timing information, the ATIP (absolute time in pregroove) is also a data track containing information about the CD-R manufacturer, the dye used and media information (disc length and so on). The pregroove is not destroyed when the data are written to the CD-R, a point which some [[copy protection]] schemes use to distinguish copies from an original CD.

There are three basic formulations of dye used in CD-Rs:
# [[Cyanine]] dye CD-Rs were the earliest ones developed, and their formulation is [[patent]]ed by [[Taiyo Yuden]]. CD-Rs based on this dye are mostly green in color. The earlier models were very chemically unstable and this made cyanine based discs unsuitable for archival use; they could fade and become unreadable in a few years. Many manufacturers like Taiyo Yuden use proprietary chemical additives to make more stable cyanine discs (&quot;metal stabilized Cyanine&quot;, &quot;Super Cyanine&quot;). Older cyanine dye based CD-Rs, as well as all the hybrid dyes based on cyanine, were very sensitive to UV-rays and could have become unreadable after only a few days if they were exposed to direct sunlight. Although the additives used have made cyanine more stable, it is still the most sensitive of the dyes in UV rays (showing signs of degradation within a week of direct sunlight exposure). A common mistake users make is to leave the CD-Rs with the &quot;clear&quot; (recording) surface upwards, in order to protect it from scratches, as this lets the sun hit the recording surface directly.
# [[Phthalocyanine]] dye CD-Rs are usually silver, gold or light green. The patents on phthalocyanine CD-Rs are held by [[Mitsui]] and [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals]]. Phthalocyanine is a natively stable dye (has no need for stabilizers) and CD-Rs based on this are often given a rated lifetime of hundreds of years. Unlike [[cyanine]], phthalocyanine is more resistant to UV rays and CD-Rs based on this dye show signs of degradation only after two weeks of direct sunlight exposure. However, phthalocyanine is more sensitive than cyanine to writing laser power calibration, meaning that the power level used by the writing laser has to be more accurately adjusted for the disc in order to get a good recording; this may erode the benefits of dye stability, as marginally written discs (with higher correctable error rates) will lose data (i.e. have uncorrectable errors) after less dye degradation than well written discs (with lower correctable error rates).
# [[Azo compound|Azo]] dye CD-Rs are dark blue in color, and their formulation is patented by [[Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation]]. Azo dye is also chemically stable, and Azo CD-Rs are typically rated with a lifetime of decades. Azo is the most resistant dye against UV rays and begins to degrade only after the third or fourth week of direct sunlight exposure. More modern implementations of this kind of dye include Super Azo which is not as deep blue as the earlier Metal Azo. This change of composition was necessary in order to achieve faster writing speeds.

There are many hybrid variations of the dye formulations, such as [[Formazan]] by [[Kodak]] (a hybrid of cyanine and phthalocyanine).

Unfortunately, many manufacturers have added additional coloring to disguise their unstable cyanine CD-Rs in the past, so the formulation of a disc cannot be determined based purely on its color. Similarly, a gold reflective layer does not guarantee use of phthalocyanine dye. The quality of the disc is also not only dependent on the dye used, it is also influenced by sealing, the top layer, the reflective layer, and the polycarbonate. Simply choosing a disc based on its dye type may be problematic. Furthermore, correct power calibration of the laser in the writer, as well as correct timing of the laser pulses, stable disc speed, and so on., is critical to not only the immediate readability but the longevity of the recorded disc, so for archiving it is important to have not only a high quality disc but a high quality writer. In fact, a high quality writer may produce adequate results with medium quality media, but high quality media cannot compensate for a mediocre writer, and discs written by such a writer cannot achieve their maximum potential archival lifetime.

At higher write speeds, more time is used for overhead processes, such as organizing the files and tracks, which adds to the theoretical minimum.

Also, above 20X speed, drives use a [[Constant linear velocity#Zoned Constant Linear Velocity|Zoned-CLV]] or CAV strategy, where the advertised maximum speed is only reached near the outer rim of the disc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdspeed2000.com/faq.html#4 Explanation of CLV, CAV, P-CAV and Z-CLV with diagrams]&lt;/ref&gt; This is not taken into account by the above table.

==Writing methods==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

The blank disc has a pre-groove track onto which the data are written. The pre-groove track, which also contains timing information, ensures that the recorder follows the same spiral
path as a conventional CD. A [[CD recorder]] writes data to a CD-R disc by pulsing its laser to heat areas of the organic dye layer. The writing process does not produce indentations (pits); instead, the heat permanently changes the optical properties of the dye, changing the reflectivity of those areas. Using a low laser power, so as not to further alter the dye, the disc is read back in the same way as a CD-ROM. However, the reflected light is modulated not by pits, but by the alternating regions of heated and unaltered dye. The change of the intensity of the reflected laser radiation is transformed into an electrical signal, from which the digital information is recovered (&quot;decoded&quot;). Once a section of a CD-R is written, it cannot be erased or rewritten, unlike a [[CD-RW]]. A CD-R can be recorded in multiple sessions.
A [[CD recorder]] can write to a CD-R using several methods including:
# [[Disc At Once]] – the whole CD-R is written in one session with no gaps and the disc is &quot;closed&quot; meaning no more data can be added and the CD-R effectively becomes a standard read-only CD. With no gaps between the tracks the Disc At Once format is useful for &quot;live&quot; audio recordings.
# [[Track At Once]] – data are written to the CD-R one track at a time but the CD is left &quot;open&quot; for further recording at a later stage. It also allows data and audio to reside on the same CD-R.
# [[Packet Writing]] – used to record data to a CD-R in &quot;packets&quot;, allowing extra information to be appended to a disc at a later time, or for information on the disc to be made &quot;invisible&quot;. In this way, CD-R can emulate CD-RW; however, each time information on the disc is altered, more data has to be written to the disc. There can be compatibility issues with this format and some CD drives.

With careful examination, the written and unwritten areas can be distinguished by the naked eye. CD-Rs are written from the center outwards, so the written area appears as an inner band with slightly different shading.

==Expected lifespan==
Real-life (not accelerated aging) tests have revealed that some CD-Rs degrade quickly even if stored normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=myce.com| url=http://www.myce.com/news/cd-recordable-discs-unreadable-in-less-than-two-years-6450

According to research conducted by J. Perdereau, CD-R are expected to have an average life expectancy of 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ina.fr/video/3571726001/20-heures-emission-du-3-mars-2008.fr.html |title= Journal de 20 Heures |accessdate=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, branding isn't a reliable guide to quality, because many brands (major as well as no name) do not actually manufacture their own discs. Instead they are sourced from different manufacturers of varying quality. For best results, the actual manufacturer and material components should be verified of each batch of discs.

[[Image:Cdr.jpg|thumb|225px|An example of a CD-R burned in 2000 showing dye degradation in 2008. Part of the data on it has been lost.]]Burned CD-Rs suffer from material degradation, just like most writable media. CD-R media have an internal layer of dye used to store data. In a [[CD-RW]] disc, the recording layer is made of an alloy of silver and other metals—indium, antimony, and tellurium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.imation.com/products/cd-r_media/la_cdrw_technology.html | title=CD-R &amp; CD-RW Media Technology Primer| work=imation.com| accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In CD-R media, the dye itself can degrade, causing data to become unreadable.

As well as degradation of the [[dye]], failure of a CD-R can be due to the reflective surface. While [[silver]] is less expensive and more widely used, it is more prone to [[oxidation]] resulting in a non-reflecting surface. [[Gold]] on the other hand, although more expensive and no longer widely used, is an inactive material and so, gold-based CD-Rs do not suffer from this problem.

==Labeling==
It is recommended if using adhesive-backed paper labels that the labels be specially made for CD-Rs. An unlabeled CD is well balanced, so that it vibrates only slightly when rotated at high speed. Bad or improperly made labels, or labels applied off-center, unbalance the CD and can cause it to vibrate seriously when it spins, which causes read errors and even risks damaging the drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpfwiw.com/cd-r.htm CD-R Labeling]&lt;/ref&gt;

A professional alternative to CD labels is pre-printed CDs using a 5-color silkscreen or offset press. Many large CD replicators now offer this type of service for .03 per impression.

Using a permanent marker pen is also a common practice. However, solvents from such pens can affect the dye layer.

==Disposal==
===Security risk===
Since CD-Rs in general cannot be logically erased to any degree, the disposal of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Many office paper shredders are also designed to shred CDs. Such would be found specified on the equipment, its box, operations manual, and so on. Check before attempting this or damage may be incurred. CD-R discs can otherwise be made unreadable by making a visible scratch on the label, or &quot;paint side&quot; radially with a nail or other sharp object.

Some recent burners do support erase operations on -R media '''(Plextor, LiteOn)''', by &quot;overwriting&quot; the stored data with strong laser power, although the erased area cannot be overwritten with new data.

===Recycling===
The polycarbonate material and possible gold or silver in the reflective layer would make CD-Rs highly recyclable. However, the polycarbonate is of very little value and the quantity of precious metals is so small that it isn't profitable to recover them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obviously.com/recycle/guides/hard.html The Consumer Recycling Guide: Recycling More Obscure Materials (toxics, batteries, mercury, computers, eyeglasses, foam peanuts)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, recyclers that accept CD-Rs typically do not offer compensation for donating or transporting the materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdrecyclingcenter.com/pages/suggested_programs CD Recycling Center – Suggested_programs – CD and DVD Recycling&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greendisk.com/gdsite/pack-ITservices.aspx GreenDisk [Technotrash Pack-IT&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sci. |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=203–6 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=1891800 |doi=10.1016/0968-0004(91)90083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''cytosol''' or '''intracellular fluid''' (or '''cytoplasmic matrix''') is the liquid found inside [[cell (biology)|cells]]. It is the liquid of a cell, that is parted from other parts of the cell by cell walls, such as the [[mitochondrial matrix]] inside the [[mitochondrion]]. The entire contents of a eukaryotic cell within [[cell membrane]], minus the contents of the [[cell nucleus]], are referred to as the [[cytoplasm]]. In [[prokaryotes]], most of the chemical reactions of [[metabolism]] take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the [[periplasmic space]]. In eukaryotes, while many [[metabolic pathway]]s still occur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles.

The cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water. Although water forms the large majority of the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the [[extracellular fluid]]; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as [[osmoregulation]] and [[cell signaling]]. The cytosol also contains large amounts of [[macromolecule]]s, which can alter how molecules behave, through [[macromolecular crowding]].

Although once thought to be a simple solution of molecules, multiple levels of organization exist in the cytosol. These include [[diffusion|concentration gradient]]s of small molecules such as [[calcium]], large complexes of [[enzyme]]s that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as [[proteasome]]s and [[carboxysome]]s that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.

==Definition==

The term cytosol was first introduced in 1965 by H.A. Lardy, and initially referred to the liquid that was produced by breaking  cells apart and pelleting all the insoluble components by [[Ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifugation]].&lt;ref name=Clegg1984/&gt; Such a soluble cell extract is not identical to the soluble part of the cell cytoplasm and is usually called a cytoplasmic fraction.&lt;ref name=Cammack/&gt; The term ''cytosol'' is now used to refer to the liquid phase of the cytoplasm in an intact cell,&lt;ref name=Cammack&gt;{{cite book |author=Cammack, Richard; Teresa Atwood; Attwood, Teresa K.; Campbell, Peter Scott; Parish, Howard I.; Smith, Tony; Vella, Frank; Stirling, John |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-852917-1 |oclc=225587597}}&lt;/ref&gt; this excludes any part of the cytoplasm that is contained within organelles.&lt;ref name=Lodish/&gt; Due to the possibility of confusion between the use of the word &quot;cytosol&quot; to refer to both extracts of cells and the soluble part of the cytoplasm in intact cells, the phrase &quot;aqueous cytoplasm&quot; has been used to describe the liquid contents of the cytoplasm of living cells.&lt;ref name=Clegg1984/&gt;

==Properties and composition==
The proportion of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms the bulk of cell structure in bacteria,&lt;ref name=Hoppert/&gt; in plant cells the main compartment is the large central [[vacuole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bowsher CG, Tobin AK |title=Compartmentation of metabolism within mitochondria and plastids |journal=J.

The majority of these non-protein molecules have a [[molecular mass]] of less than 300&amp;nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|Da]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodacre R, Vaidyanathan S, Dunn WB, Harrigan GG, Kell DB |title=Metabolomics by numbers: acquiring and understanding global metabolite data |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=245–52 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15109811 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.03.007 |url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/roy.goodacre/learning/metabprof/Goodacre-TibTech2004.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules that are involved in metabolism (the [[metabolite]]s) is immense.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[viscosity]] of cytoplasm is roughly the same as pure water, although [[diffusion]] of small molecules through this liquid is about fourfold slower than in pure water, due mostly to collisions with the large numbers of [[macromolecule]]s in the cytosol.&lt;ref name=Verkman&gt;{{cite journal |author=Verkman AS |title=Solute and macromolecule diffusion in cellular aqueous compartments |journal=Trends Biochem.

Although water is vital for life, the structure of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due to the ability of water to form structures such as [[water cluster]]s through [[hydrogen bond]]s.&lt;ref name=Wiggins/&gt;

The classic view of water in cells is that about 5% of this water is strongly bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of [[solvation]], while the majority has the same structure as pure water.&lt;ref name=Clegg1984/&gt; This water of solvation is not active in [[osmosis]] and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fulton AB |title=How crowded is the cytoplasm? |journal=Cell |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=345–7 |year=1982 |month=September |pmid=6754085 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90231-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garlid KD |title=The state of water in biological systems |journal=Int.

===Ions===
The concentrations of the other ions in cytosol are quite different from those in [[extracellular fluid]] and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than the outside of the cell.

In contrast to extracellular fluid, cytosol has a high concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lang F |title=Mechanisms and significance of cell volume regulation |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=26 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=613S–623S |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17921474 |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17921474}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in ion concentrations is critical for [[osmoregulation]], since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by [[osmosis]] - since the levels of [[macromolecule]]s inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the [[Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase]], potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative [[membrane potential]]. To balance this [[potential difference]], negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt;

Cells can deal with even larger osmotic changes by accumulating [[osmoprotectant]]s such as [[betaines]] or [[trehalose]] in their cytosol.&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt; Some of these molecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and allow an organism to enter a state of suspended animation called [[cryptobiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sussich F, Skopec C, Brady J, Cesàro A |title=Reversible dehydration of trehalose and anhydrobiosis: from solution state to an exotic crystal? |journal=Carbohydr.

The low concentration of [[calcium]] in the cytosol allows this ion to function as a [[second messenger]] in [[calcium signaling]]. Here, a signal such as a [[hormone]] or an [[action potential]] opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the cytosol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berridge MJ |title=Elementary and global aspects of calcium signalling |journal=J.

===Macromolecules===
Protein molecules that do not bind to [[cell membrane]]s or the [[cytoskeleton]] are dissolved in the cytosol. The amount of protein in cells is extremely high, and approaches 200&amp;nbsp;mg/ml, occupying about 20-30% of the volume of the cytosol.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Macromolecular crowding: obvious but underappreciated |journal=Trends Biochem. Sci. |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=597–604 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11590012 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(01)01938-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, measuring precisely how much protein is dissolved in cytosol in intact cells is difficult, since some proteins appear to be weakly-associated with membranes or organelles in whole cells and are released into solution upon cell lysis.&lt;ref name=Clegg1984/&gt;  Indeed, in experiments where the plasma membrane of cells were carefully disrupted using [[saponin]], without damaging the other cell membranes, only about one quarter of cell protein was released. These cells were also able to synthesize proteins if given ATP and amino acids, implying that many of the enzymes in cytosol are bound to the cytoskeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hudder A, Nathanson L, Deutscher MP |title=Organization of mammalian cytoplasm |journal=Mol. Cell. Biol. |volume=23 |issue=24 |pages=9318–26 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14645541 |pmc=309675 |url=http://mcb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14645541 |doi=10.1128/MCB.23.24.9318-9326.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the idea that the majority of the proteins in cells are tightly bound in a network called the [[microtrabecular lattice]] is now seen as unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heuser J |title=Whatever happened to the 'microtrabecular concept'? |journal=Biol Cell |year=2002 |volume=94 |issue=9| pages=561–96  |doi=10.1016/S0248-4900(02)00013-8 |pmid=12732437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prokaryotes the cytosol contains the cell's [[genome]], within a structure known as a [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L |title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure |journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=506–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15988757 |doi=10.1002/jcb.20519}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an irregular mass of [[DNA]] and associated proteins that control the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication|replication]] of the bacterial [[chromosome]] and [[plasmid]]s. In eukaryotes the genome is held within the [[cell nucleus]], which is separated from the cytosol by [[nuclear pore]]s that block the free diffusion of any molecule larger than about 10&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peters R |title=Introduction to nucleocytoplasmic transport: molecules and mechanisms |journal=Methods Mol. Biol. |volume=322 |pages=235–58 |year=2006 |pmid=16739728 |doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-000-3_17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This high concentration of macromolecules in cytosol causes an effect called [[macromolecular crowding]], which is when the [[activity (chemistry)|effective concentration]] of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the [[reaction rate|rates]] and the position of [[chemical equilibrium]] of reactions in the cytosol.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; It is particularly important in its ability to alter [[dissociation constant]]s by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form [[protein complex]]es, or when [[DNA-binding protein]]s bind to their targets in the [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou HX, Rivas G, Minton AP |title=Macromolecular crowding and confinement: biochemical, biophysical, and potential physiological consequences |journal=Annu Rev Biophys |volume=37 |issue= |pages=375–97 |year=2008 |pmid=18573087 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125817 |pmc=2826134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Although the components of the cytosol are not separated into regions by cell membranes, these components do not always mix randomly and several levels of organization can localize specific molecules to defined sites within the cytosol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Norris V, den Blaauwen T, Cabin-Flaman A |title=Functional taxonomy of bacterial hyperstructures |journal=Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=230–53 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17347523 |pmc=1847379 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00035-06 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17347523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration gradients===
Although small molecules [[diffusion|diffuse]] rapidly in the cytosol, concentration gradients can still be produced within this compartment. A well-studied example of these are the &quot;calcium sparks&quot; that are produced for a short period in the region around an open [[calcium channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wang SQ, Wei C, Zhao G |title=Imaging microdomain Ca2+ in muscle cells |journal=Circ.

===Protein complexes===
Proteins can associate to form [[protein complex]]es, these often contain a set of proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Srere PA |title=Complexes of sequential metabolic enzymes |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=56 |pages=89–124 |year=1987 |pmid=2441660 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.56.070187.000513}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization can allow [[substrate channeling]], which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perham RN |title=Swinging arms and swinging domains in multifunctional enzymes: catalytic machines for multistep reactions |journal=Annu.

===Protein compartments===
Some protein complexes contain a large central cavity that is isolated from the remainder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the [[proteasome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Groll M, Clausen T |title=Molecular shredders: how proteasomes fulfill their role |journal=Curr.

===Cytoskeletal sieving===
Although the [[cytoskeleton]] is not part of the cytosol, the presence of this network of filaments restricts the diffusion of large particles in the cell. For example, in several studies tracer particles larger than about 25&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s (about the size of a [[ribosome]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cate JH |title=Construction of low-resolution x-ray crystallographic electron density maps of the ribosome |journal=Methods |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=303–8 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11860284 |doi=10.1006/meth.2001.1242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were excluded from parts of the cytosol around the edges of the cell and next to the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Provance DW, McDowall A, Marko M, Luby-Phelps K |title=Cytoarchitecture of size-excluding compartments in living cells |journal=J.

==Function==
The cytosol has no single function and is instead the site of multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include [[signal transduction]] from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the [[cell nucleus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kholodenko BN |title=Four-dimensional organization of protein kinase signaling cascades: the roles of diffusion, endocytosis and molecular motors |journal=J.

{{legal status}}

'''Citizenship''' is the state of being a '''citizen''' of a particular social, political, national, or human resource community.
Citizenship status, under [[social contract theory]], carries with it both rights and responsibilities. &quot;[[Active citizenship]]&quot; is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their [[community]] through economic participation, public, [[volunteer]] work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, [[school]]s in some countries provide [[citizenship education]]. Citizenship was equated by Virginia Leary (1999) as connoting &quot;a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations.&quot;&lt;ref name=twsJun16&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editors=Alan C. Cairns, John C. Courtney, Peter MacKinnon, Hans J. Michelmann, David E. Smith|title=Citizenship, Diversity, and Pluralism: Canadian and Comparative Perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HIKz0oJxGSgC|year=2000|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=9780773518933|pages=247–264|chapter=Citizenship.

The concept of 'citizenship' has long acquired the connotation of a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community - as well as obligations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of all citizens is the '''citizenry'''.

==National citizenship==

Generally citizenship is seen as the relationship between an individual and a particular nation. In [[ancient Greece]], the main political entity was the city-state, and citizens were members of particular city-states. In the past five hundred years, with the rise of the nation-state, citizenship is most closely identified with being a member of a particular nation. To some extent, certain entities cross national boundaries such as trade organizations, [[non-governmental organizations]] as well as multi-national corporations, and sometimes the term &quot;[[World citizen|citizen of the world]]&quot; applies in the sense of people having less ties to a particular nation and more of a sense of belonging to the world in general.

In modern times, citizenship policy is divided between ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (&quot;right of blood&quot;) and ''[[jus soli]]'' (&quot;right of soil&quot;) nations. A ''jus sanguinis'' policy grants citizenship based on ancestry or [[ethnicity]], and is related to the concept of a [[nation state]] common in Europe. A ''jus soli'' policy grants citizenship to anyone born on the territory of the state, a policy practiced by many countries in the Americas, including the United States. Many countries have a hybrid birthright requirement of local nativity and citizenship of at least one parent.

Citizenship can also commonly be obtained through marriage to a person holding the citizenship (''[[jure matrimonii]]''), or through [[naturalization]] .

{{further|[[Nationality law]]}}

==International citizenship==
In recent years, some [[intergovernmental organization]]s have extended the concept and terminology associated with citizenship to the international level,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''&quot;The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy&quot;''], [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where it is applied to the totality of the citizens of their constituent countries combined. Citizenship at this level is a secondary concept, with rights deriving from national citizenship.

===Commonwealth citizenship===
The concept of &quot;[[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth Citizenship]]&quot; has been in place ever since the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As with the EU, one holds Commonwealth citizenship only by being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. This form of citizenship offers certain privileges within some Commonwealth countries:
* Some such countries do not require tourist [[visa (document)|visas]] of citizens of other Commonwealth countries.
* In some Commonwealth countries [[permanent resident|resident]] citizens of other Commonwealth countries are entitled to political rights, e.g., the [[right to vote]] in local and national elections and in some cases even the right to stand for election.
* In some instances the right to work in any position (including the [[civil service]]) is granted, except for certain specific positions (e.g. defense, [[Governor-General]] or [[President]], [[Prime Minister]]).

Although [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] left the Commonwealth in 1949, it is often treated as if it were a member, with references being made in legal documents to 'the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland', and its citizens are not classified as foreign nationals, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]].

Canada departed from the principle of nationality being defined in terms of allegiance in 1921. In 1935 the [[Irish Free State]] was the first to introduce its own citizenship (However, [[Irish citizen]]s were still treated as [[British subject|subjects of the Crown]], and they are still not regarded as foreign, even though Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth; ''Murray v Parkes'' [1942] All ER 123). The [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] which came into effect on January 1, 1947 provided for a distinct Canadian Citizenship, automatically conferred upon most individuals born in Canada (with certain exceptions) and defined the conditions under which one could become a naturalized citizen. The concept of Commonwealth citizenship was introduced in 1948 in the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]. Other [[Dominion]]s adopted this principle, in [[New Zealand]], in the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948. Citizenship has replaced allegiance, a more than symbolic change.

Citizenship most usually relates to membership of the nation state, but the term can also apply at subnational level. Subnational entities may impose requirements, of residency or otherwise, which permit citizens to participate in the political life of that entity, or to enjoy benefits provided by the government of that entity. But in such cases, those eligible are also sometimes seen as &quot;citizens&quot; of the relevant state, province, or region. An example of this is how the fundamental basis of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship is citizenship of an individual commune, from which follows citizenship of a canton and of the Confederation. Another example is [[Åland]] where the residents enjoy a special provincial citizenship within [[Finland]], ''hembygdsrätt''.

The United States has a system of dual citizenship where one is a citizen of the state of residence as well as a citizen of the United States. State constitutions may grant certain rights above and beyond what are granted under the US Constitution and may impose their own obligations including the sovereign right of taxation and military service (each state maintains at least one military force subject to national militia transfer service, the state's national guard, while some maintain a second military force not subject to nationalization).

===European Union (EU) citizenship===
{{Main|Citizenship of the European Union }}
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]]. Article 17 (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on European Union]] (consolidated version) states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rome&quot;&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The amended [[EC Treaty]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rome&quot; /&gt; establishes certain minimal rights for EU citizens. Article 12 of the amended EC Treaty guarantees a general right of non-discrimination within the scope of the Treaty. Article 18 provides a limited right to free movement and residence in Member States other than that of which the EU citizen is a national. Articles 18-21 and 225 provide certain political rights.

Union citizens have also extensive [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|rights to move in order to exercise economic activity]] in any of the Member States (Articles 39, 43, 49 EC), which predate the introduction of Union citizenship.

==History==
The concept of citizenship arose with the first [[law]]s.

===Polis citizenship===
{{Main|Polis}}
The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. In those days citizenship was not seen as a public matter, separated from the private life of the individual person. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one’s everyday life in the polis. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: “To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!” This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.

However, an important aspect of polis citizenship was exclusivity. Citizenship in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as [[Medieval]] cities that practiced polis citizenship, was exclusive and inequality of status was widely accepted. Citizens had a much higher status than non-citizens: Women, slaves or ‘barbarians’. For example, women were seen to be irrational and incapable of political participation (although some, most notably [[Plato]], disagreed). Methods used to determine whether someone could be a citizen or not could be based on wealth (the amount of taxes one paid), political participation, or heritage (both parents had to be born in the polis).

In the [[Roman Empire]], polis citizenship changed form: Citizenship was expanded from small scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realised that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas.  Citizenship in the Roman era was no longer a status of political agency; it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law. (See [[Civis romanus sum]].)

===Medieval and early modern citizenship===
During European Middle Ages, citizenship was usually associated with cities, see [[bourgeoisie|burgher]], [[Great Burgher]] and [[Bourgeoisie]]. [[Nobility]] used to have [[privilege]]s above [[commoner]]s (see [[aristocracy]]), but the [[French Revolution]] and other revolutions revoked these privileges and made citizens.

==Honorary citizenship==
Some countries extend &quot;honorary citizenship&quot; to those whom they consider to be especially admirable or worthy of the distinction.

By [[Act of Congress|act of United States Congress]] and presidential assent, [[Honorary citizen of the United States|honorary United States citizenship]] has been awarded to only seven individuals.
Honorary Canadian  citizenship requires the unanimous approval of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]].  The only people to ever receive [[honorary Canadian citizenship]] are [[Raoul Wallenberg]] posthumously in 1985, [[Nelson Mandela]] in 2001, the [[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso in 2006, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] in 2007 and [[Aga Khan IV|Prince Karim Aga Khan]] in 2009.

In 2002 [[South Korea]] awarded honorary citizenship to Dutch football (soccer) coach [[Guus Hiddink]] who successfully and unexpectedly took the national team to the semi-finals of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. Honorary citizenship was also awarded to [[Hines Ward]], a black [[Korean American]] football player, in 2006 for his efforts to minimize discrimination in Korea against half-Koreans.

American actress [[Angelina Jolie]] received an honorary [[Cambodia]]n citizenship in 2005 due to her humanitarian efforts.
Cricketers [[Matthew Hayden]] and [[Herschelle Gibbs]] were awarded honorary citizenship of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] in March 2007 due to their record-breaking innings in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].

In [[Germany]] the honorary citizenship is awarded by cities, towns and sometimes federal states. The honorary citizenship ends with the death of the honoured, or, in exceptional cases, when it is taken away by the council or parliament of the city, town, or state. In the case of war criminals, all such honours were taken away by &quot;Article VIII, section II, letter i of the directive 38 of the Allied Control Council for Germany&quot; on October 12, 1946. In some cases, honorary citizenship was taken away from members of the former [[GDR]] regime, e.g. [[Erich Honecker]], after the collapse of the GDR in 1989/90. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In Ireland, &quot;honorary citizenship&quot; bestowed on a foreigner is in fact full legal citizenship including the right to reside in Ireland, to vote etc.

According to the Chapter II, Article 29, Paragraph 'e)' of the Cuban Constitution, Cuban citizens by birth are those foreigners who, by virtue of their exceptional merits won in the struggles for Cuba’s liberation, were considered Cuban citizens by birth.&lt;ref name=dfes&gt;{{cite web

Historically, many states limited citizenship to only a proportion of their population, thereby creating a citizen class with political rights superior to other sections of the population, but equal with each other.  The classical example of a limited citizenry was [[Athenian democracy|Athens]] where slaves, women, and resident foreigners (called [[metic]]s) were excluded from political rights. The [[Roman Republic]] forms another example (see [[Roman citizenship]]), and, more recently, the [[szlachta|nobility]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] had some of the same characteristics.

==School subject==
{{globalize|date=September 2010}}
{{Main|Citizenship education }}
Citizenship is a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state schools in [[England]] for all pupils aged 11–16. Some schools offer a qualification in this subject at GCSE and A level. All state schools have a statutory requirement to teach the subject, assess pupil attainment and report student's progress in Citizenship to parents.&lt;ref name=dfes&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.dfes.gov.uk/citizenship/
|title=National curriculum
|publisher=British Government, Department for Children, Schools and Families
|accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizenship is offered as a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) course in many schools. As well as teaching knowledge about democracy, parliament, government, the justice system, human rights and the UKs relations with the wider world, students participate in active citizenship, often involving a social action or social enterprise in their local community.

In Wales the model used is [[Personal and Social Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizenship is not taught as a subject in Scottish schools, however they do teach a subject called &quot;Modern Studies&quot; which covers the social, political and economic study of local, national and international issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.msa-scotland.co.uk/
|title=Modern Studies Association
|accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is taught in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as an exam subject for the Junior Certificate. It is known as Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE).

Citizenship is taught as a unit as part of the curriculum in Grade 8 Social Studies in Nova Scotia.

'''Chiapas''' ({{IPA-es|ˈtʃjapas}}) officially ''Estado Libre y Soberano de Chiapas'' ({{lang-en|Free and Sovereign State of Chiapas}}) is one of the 31 states which, with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided in [[Municipalities of Chiapas|118 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Tuxtla Gutierrez]]. Other important cites in Chiapas include [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], [[Comitán]], and [[Tapachula]]. Located in [[Southwestern Mexico]], it is the southernmost State of Mexico. It is bordered by the states of [[Tabasco]] to the north, [[Veracruz]] to the northwest and [[Oaxaca]] to the west. To the east Chiapas borders [[Guatemala]], and to the south the [[Pacific Ocean]].

In general Chiapas has a humid, tropical climate. In the north, in the area bordering Tabasco, near Teapa, rainfall can average more than {{convert|3000|mm|in|-1|abbr=on}} per year. In the past, natural vegetation at this region was lowland, tall perennial [[rainforest]], but this vegetation has been destroyed almost completely to give way to agriculture and ranching. Rainfall decreases moving towards the [[Pacific Ocean]], but it is still abundant enough to allow the farming of bananas and many other tropical crops near [[Tapachula]]. On the several parallel &quot;sierras&quot; or mountain ranges running along the center of Chiapas, climate can be quite temperate and foggy, allowing the development of [[cloud forests]] like those of the [[Reserva de la Biosfera el Triunfo]], home to a handful of [[Resplendent Quetzal]]s and [[Horned Guan]]s. 

Chiapas is home to the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n ruins of [[Palenque]], [[Yaxchilán]], [[Bonampak]], [[Chinkultic]]. It is also home to one of the largest indigenous populations in the country with twelve federally recognized ethnicities. Much of the state’s history is centered on the subjugation of these peoples with occasional rebellions. The last of these rebellions was the 1994 Zapatista uprising, which succeeded in obtaining new rights for indigenous people but also divided much of the indigenous peoples of the state.

==Geography==
===Political geography===
Chiapas is located in the south east of Mexico, bordering the states of [[Tabasco]], [[Veracruz]] and [[Oaxaca]] with the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south and [[Guatemala]] to the east. It has a territory of 74,415km2, the eighth largest state in Mexico. The state consists of 118 municipalities organized into nine political regions called Center, Altos, Fronteriza, Frailesca, Norte, Selva, Sierra, Soconusco and Istmo-Costa. There are 18 cities, twelve towns (villas) and 111 pueblos (villages).&lt;ref name=&quot;pimienta&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimienta Lastra |first=Rodrigo |year=1994 |month=March–April |title=Chiapas:Sus characterísticas Demográficas |trans_title=Chiapas: Its demographic characteristics |journal=Papeles de Población |volume= |issue=2 |pages=44–49 |location=Toluca, Mexico |publisher=Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México |language=Spanish |issn=1405-7425 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |url= http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/src/inicio/ArtPdfRed.jsp?iCve=11200205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ubicagob&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chiapas.gob.mx/ubicacion |title= Ubicación |publisher= State of Chiapas |location=Chiapas, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Location |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major cities include [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]], [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], [[Tapachula]], [[Palenque, Chiapas|Palenque]], [[Comitán, Chiapas|Comitán]], and [[Chiapas de Corzo]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;ubicagob&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.com/topics/chiapas |title= Chiapas |year=2011 |publisher=History Channel |location=USA |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical regions===
[[File:Sumideroclouds.jpg|thumb|View of the Sumidero Canyon with clouds]]
[[File:Montebello 02.jpg|thumb|Lake at the Parque Nacional Lagunas de Montebello]]
The state has a complex geography with seven distinct regions according to the [[Mullerried classification system]]. These include the Pacific Coast Plains, the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Central Depression, the Central Highlands, the Eastern Mountains, the Northern Mountains and the Gulf Coast Plains. The Pacific Coast Plains is a strip of land parallel to the ocean which is mostly sediment from the mountains that border it on the northern side. It is a uniformly flat area which stretches from the Bernal Mountain south to [[Tonalá, Chiapas|Tonalá]]. It has deep salty soils due to its proximity to the sea. It has mostly deciduous rainforest although most has been converted to pasture for cattle and fields for crops. It has numerous [[estuary|estuaries]] with [[mangroves]] and other aquatic vegetation.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |title= Medio Físico  |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México

The [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] runs parallel to the Pacific coastline of the state, northwest to southeast as a continuation of the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]]. This area has the highest altitudes in Chiapas including the [[Volcán Tacaná|Tacaná Volcano]] which rises 4,093 meters above sea level. Most of these mountains are volcanic in origin although the nucleus is metamorphic rock. It has a wide range of climates but little arable land. It is mostly covered in middle altitude rainforest, high altitude rainforest, and forests of oaks and pines.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; The mountains partially block rain clouds from the Pacific, a process known as [[Orographic lift]], which creates a particularly rich coastal region called the [[Soconusco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CFE&quot;&gt;[http://www.cfe.gob.mx/ Comisión Federal de Electricidad]&lt;/ref&gt; The main commercial center of the sierra is the town of [[Motozintla]], also near the Guatemalan border.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Martinez-Torres |first1=Rosalva Maria Elena |title= Organic Coffee : Sustainable Development by Mayan Farmers. |year=2006 |publisher= Center for International Studies, Ohio University |location= Athens, OH, USA |isbn= 9780896802476 |pages=62–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Depression is in the center of the state. It is an extensive semi flat area bordered by the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Central Highlands and the Northern Mountains. Within the depression there are a number of distinct valleys. The climate here can be very hot and humid in the summer, especially due to the large volume of rain received in July and August. The original vegetation was lowland deciduous rainforest with some rainforest of middle altitudes and some oaks above 1500masl.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The Central Highlands, also referred to as Los Altos, are mountains oriented from northwest to southeast with altitudes ranging from twelve to sixteen hundred meters above sea level. The western highlands are displaced faults, while the eastern highlands are mainly folds of sedimentary formations— mainly [[limestone]], [[shale]], and [[sandstone]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt; These mountains, along the Sierra Madre of Chiapas become the [[Cuchumatanes]] where they extend over the border into Guatemala. Its topography is mountainous with many narrow valleys and [[karst]] formations called uvalas or poljés, depending on the size. Most of the rock is [[limestone]] allowing for a number of formations such as caves and sinkholes. There are also some isolated pockets of volcanic rock with the tallest peaks being the Tzontehuitz and Huitepec volcanos. There are no significant surface water systems as they are almost all underground. The original vegetation was forest of oak and pine but these have been heavily damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; The highlands climate in the [[Köppen climate classification|Koeppen modified classification]] system for Mexico is humid temperate C(m) and subhumid temperate C(w 2 )(w). This climate exhibits a summer rainy season and a dry winter, with possibilities of frost from December to March.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt; The Central Highlands have been the population center of Chiapas since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]]. European [[epidemics]] were hindered by the [[tierra fría]] climate, allowing the indigenous peoples in the highlands to retain their large numbers&lt;ref name=&quot;ben1&quot;&gt;Benjamin, Thomas. ''A Rich Land, a Poor People: Politics and Society in Modern Chiapas''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Mountains (Montañas del Oriente) are in the east of the state, formed by various parallel mountain chains mostly made of limestone and sandstone. Its altitude varies from 500 to 1500 masl. This area receives moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with abundant rainfall and exhuberant vegetation, which creates the [[Lacandon Jungle]], one of the most important rainforests in Mexico. The Northern Mountains (Montañas del Norte) are in the north of the state. They separate the flatlands of the Gulf Coast Plains from the Central Depression. Its rock is mostly limestone. These mountains also receive large amounts of rainfall with moisture from the Gulf of Mexico giving it a mostly hot and humid climate with rains year round. In the highest elevations around 1800 masl, temperatures are somewhat cooler and do experience a winter. The terrain is rugged with small valleys whose natural vegetation is high altitude rainforest.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The Gulf Coast Plains (Llanura Costera del Golfo) stretch into Chiapas from the state of Tabasco, which gives it the alternate name of the Tabasqueña Plains. These plains are found only in the exteme north of the state. The terrain is flat and prone to flooding during the rainy season as it was built by sediments deposited by rivers and streams heading to the Gulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

===Lacandon Jungle ===
[[File:GroupCPalenque11.JPG|thumb|300px|Jungle area near Group C at the Palenque archeological site]]
The Lacandon Jungle is situated in north eastern Chiapas, centered on a series of canyonlike valleys called the Cañadas, between smaller mountain ridges oriented from northwest to southeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;manejo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Felipe Ruan–Soto |coauthors= Joaquín Cifuentes, Ramón Mariaca, Fernando Limón, Lilia Pérez–Ramírez and Sigfrido Sierra |year=2009 |month=June |title= Uso y manejo de hongos silvestres en dos comunidades de la Selva Lacandona, Chiapas, México |trans_title= Use and handling of wild fungi in two communities of the Lacandona Rainforest, Chiapas, Mexico |journal= Revista mexicana de micología |volume=29 |location=Xalapa |publisher=Scielo |language=Spanish |issn=0187-3180 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |url= http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?pid=S0187-31802009000100009&amp;script=sci_arttext }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecosystem covers and area of approximately 1.9 million hectares extending from Chiapas into northern Guatemala and southern [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and into [[Belize]].

There is a short dry season from March to May. The predominate wild vegetation is perennial high rainforest.&lt;ref name=&quot;manejo&quot;/&gt; The Lacandon comprises a biosphere reserve (Montes Azules); four natural protected areas ([[Bonampak]], [[Yaxchilan]], Chan Kin, and Lacantum); and the communal reserve (La Cojolita), which functions as a biological corridor with the area of [[Petén Basin|Petén]] in Guatemala. Flowing within the Rainforest is the [[Usumacinta River]], considered to be one of the largest rivers in Mexico and seventh largest in the world based on volume of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldwildlife.org/what/wherewework/mexico/thestateofchiapas.html |title= The State of Chiapas |year=2011 |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, the Lacandon has had a dramatic increase in population and along with it, severe [[deforestation]].  The population of municipalities in this area, [[Altamirano, Chiapas|Altamirano]], [[Las Margaritas, Chiapas|Las Margaritas]], [[Ocosingo]] and [[Palenque, Chiapas|Palenque]] have risen from 11,000 in 1920 to over 376,000 in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo106&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants incude [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]], [[Tzeltal]], [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]], [[Tojolabal]] indigenous peoples along with mestizos, Guatemalan refugees and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/18/AR2007111800962.html ''Washington Post'' Nov. 19, 2007: A12]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these migrants are peasant farmers, who cut forest to plant crops.

===Soconusco===
The [[Soconusco]] region encompasses a coastal plain and a mountain range with elevations of up to 2000 meters above sea levels paralleling the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;atoussaint&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Toussaint |first=Alejandro |year=2010 |month=February |title= Café del Soconusco |trans_title=Coffee of Soconusco |journal=Mexicanísimo |volume=24 |pages=6–8 |location=Mexico City |publisher= [[CONACULTA]] |language=Spanish |issn=2007-0055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest peak in Chiapas is the [[Volcán Tacaná|Tacaná Volcano]] at 4,800 meters above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonainflu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.puertochiapas.com.mx/acerca-zona-de-influencia |title= Zona de Influencia |publisher= Administración Portuaria Integral de Puerto Madero, SA de CV |date= July 18, 2010 |location=Chiapas |language=Spanish |trans_title=Zone of influence |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with an 1882 treaty, the dividing line between Mexico and Guatemala goes right over the summit of this volcano.&lt;ref name=&quot;abianco&quot;/&gt; The climate is tropical, with a number of rivers and evergreen forests in the mountains. This is Chiapas’ major coffee producing area, as it has the best soils and climate for coffee.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt;
Before the arrival of the Spanish, this area was the principal source of [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] seeds in the Aztec empire, which they used as currency, and for the highly prized [[quetzal]] feathers used by the nobility. It would become the first area to produce coffee, introduced by an Italian entrepreneur on the La Chacara farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt; Coffee is cultivated on the slopes of these mountains mostly between 600 and 1200 masl. Mexico produces about 4 million sacks of green coffee each year, fifth in the world behind [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Vietnam]]. Most producers are small with plots of land under five hectares. From November to January, the annual crop is harvested and processed employing thousands of seasonal workers. Lately, a number of coffee haciendas have been developing tourism infrastructure as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoussaint&quot;/&gt;

==Environment and protected areas==
[[File:Agua azul Chiapas.JPG|thumb|View of the waterfalls at Agua Azul]]
[[File:UsumacintaYaxchilan18.JPG|thumb|Usumacinta River and Lacandon Jungle on Chiapas side]]
Chiapas is located in the tropical belt of the planet, but the climate is moderated in many areas by altitude. For this reason there are hot, semi hot, temperate and even cold climates. There are areas with abundant rainfall year round along with those which receive most of their rain from May to October with a dry season from November to April. The mountains areas affect wind and moisture flow over the state concentrating moisture in certain areas of the state. They also are responsible for some cloud covered rainforest areas in the Sierra Madre.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Chiapas’ rainforests are home to thousands of unique animals and plants, some of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt; Natural vegetation varies from lowland to highland tropical forest, pine and oak forests in the highest altitudes and plains area with some grassland. Chiapas is ranked second in forest resources in Mexico with valued woods such as pine, [[cypress]], [[sweetgum]], [[oak]], [[cedar wood|cedar]], [[mahogany]] and more. The [[Lacandon Jungle]] is one of the last major tropical rainforests in the northern hemisphere with an extension of 600,000 hectares. It contsina about sixty percent of Mexico’s tropical tree species, 3,500 species of plants, 1,157 species of invertebrates and over 500 of vertebrate species. Chiapas has one of the greatest diversities in wildlife in the Americas. There are more than 100 species of amphibians, 700 species of birds, fifty of mammals and just over 200 species of reptiles. In the hot lowlands, there are [[armadillo]]s, [[monkey]]s, [[pelican]]s, [[wild boar]], [[jaguar]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[iguana]]s and many others. In the temperate regions there are species such as [[bobcat]]s, [[salamander]]s, a large red lizard [[Abronia lythrochila]], [[weasel]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[deer]], [[ocelot]]s and bats. The coastal areas have large quantities of fish, turtles, and [[crustacean]]s, with many species in danger of extinction or endangered as they are endemic only to this area. The total biodiversity of the state is estimated at over 50,000 species of plants and animals. The diversity of species is not limited to the hot lowlands but in the higher altitudes as well with [[mesophile]] forests, oak/pine forests in the Los Altos, Northern Mountains and Sierra Madre and the extensive [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[mangrove]] wetlands along the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Chiapas has about thirty percent of Mexico’s fresh water resources. These are divided by the Sierra Madre into those which flow to the Pacific and those which flow to the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the first are short rivers and streams with longer ones flowing to the Gulf. Most Pacific side rivers do not drain directly into this ocean but rather into [[lagoon]]s and estuaries. The two largest rivers are the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and the [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]], with both part of the same system. The Grijalva has four dams built on it the Belisario Dominguez (La Angostura); Manuel Moreno Torres (Chicoasén); Nezahualcóyotl (Malpaso); and Angel Albino Corzo (Peñitas). The Usumacinta divides the state from Guatemala and is the longest river in [[Central America]]. In total, the state has 110,000 hectares of surface waters, 260&amp;nbsp;km of coastline, control of 96,000 km2 of ocean, 75,230 hectares of estuaries and ten lake systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Laguna Miramar is a lake in the Montes Azules reserve and the largest in the Lacandon Jungle at 40&amp;nbsp;km in diameter. The color of its waters vary from [[indigo]] to [[emerald]] green and in ancient times, there were settlements on its islands and its caves on the shoreline. The Catazajá Lake is 28&amp;nbsp;km north of the city of [[Palenque, Chiapas|Palenque]]. It is formed by rainwater which is captured as it makes it way to the Usumacinta River. It contains wildlife such as [[manatee]]s and [[iguana]]s and it is surrounded by rainforest. Fishing on this lake is an ancient tradition and the lake has an annual bass fishing tournament. The Welib Já Waterfall is located on the road between Palenque and Bonampak.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonasarq&quot;/&gt;

The state has thirty six protected areas at the state and federal levels along with 67 areas protected by various municipalities. The [[Sumidero Canyon National Park]] was decreed in 1980 with an extension of 21,789 hectares. It extends over two of the regions of the state, the Central Depression and the Central Highlands over the municipalities of [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]], [[Nuevo Usumacinta]], [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[San Fernando, Chiapas|San Fernando]]. The [[Sumidero Canyon|canyon]] has steep and vertical sides which rise to up to 1000 meters from the river below with mostly tropical rainforest but some areas with [[xerophile]] vegetation such as cactus can be found. The river below is called the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] which has cut the canyon over the course of twelve million years. The canyon is emblematic for the state as it is featured in the state seal.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;canoninsolito&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=2009 |month=March |title= El Cañon de Sumidero |trans_title=Sumidero Canyon |journal=Insolito – Maravillas Naturales de México |page=34 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Corporativeo Mina SA de CV |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumidero Canyon was once the site of an epic battle between the Spainiards and [[Chiapanecan]] Indians. Many Chiapanecans chose to throw themselves from the high edges of the canyon rather than be defeated by Spanish forces. Today, the canyon is a popular destination for [[ecotourism]]. Visitors often take boat trips down the river that runs through the canyon and enjoy the area's natural beauty including the many birds and abundant vegetation.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt; 

The [[Montes Azules Integral Biosphere Reserve]] was decreed in 1978. It is located in the northeast of the state in the [[Lacandon Jungle]]. It covers 331,200 hectares in the municipalities of [[Maravilla Tenejapa]], [[Ocosingo]] and [[Las Margaritas, Chiapas|Las Margaritas]]. It conserves highland perennial rainforest. The Jungle is in the Usumacinta River basin east of the Chiapas Highlands. It is recognized by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] for its global biological and cultural significance. In 1992 the 61,874-hectare Lacantun Reserve, which includes the Classic Maya archeological sites of [[Yaxchilan]] and [[Bonampak]], was added to the biosphere reserve.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weinberg&quot;/&gt;

[[Agua Azul|Agua Azul Waterfall Protection Area]] is in the Northern Mountains in the municipality of [[Tumbalá]]. It covers an area of 2,580 hectares of rainforest and pine –oak forest, centered on the waterfalls it is named after.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; It is located in the area which is locally called the “Mountains of Water” as many rivers flow through here on their way to the Gulf of Mexico. The terrain is rugged which makes for conditions condusive to water falls with large pools at the bottom, carved by the falling water into the sedimentary rock and limestone. Agua Azul is one of the best known in the state, with the waters of the Agua Azul River emerging from a cave that forms a natural bridge of thirty meters and five small waterfalls in succession, all with pools of water at the bottom. In addition to Agua Azul the area has other attractions such as the Shumuljá River which contains rapids and waterfalls, the Misol Há Waterfall with a thirty meter drop, the Bolón Ajau Waterfall with a fourteen meter drop, the Gallito Copetón rapids, the Blacquiazules Waterfalls and the Agua Clara, which is a section of calm water.&lt;ref name=&quot;azulinsolito&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=2009 |month=March |title= Cascadas de Agua Azul |trans_title=Waterfalls of Agua Azul |journal=Insolito – Maravillas Naturales de México |page=33 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Corporativeo Mina SA de CV |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[El Ocote Biosphere Reserve]] was decreed in 1982 located in the Northern Mountains at the boundary with the Sierra Madre del Sur in the municipalities of [[Ocozocoautla de Espinoza|Ocozocoautla]], [[Cintalapa]] and [[Tecpatán]]. It has a surface area of 101288.15 hectares and preserves a rainforest area with karst formations. The [[Lagunas de Montebello National Park]] was decreed in 1959 and consists of 7371 hectares near the Guatemalan border in the municipalities of [[La Independencia, Chiapas|La Independencia]] and [[La Trinitaria, Mexico|La Trinitaria]]. It contains two of the most threated ecosystems in Mexico the “cloud rainforest” and the [[Soconusco]] rainforest. The [[El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve]], decreed in 1990, is located in the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] in the municipalities of [[Acacoyagua]], [[Ángel Albino Corzo]], [[Monte Cristo de Guerrero]], [[La Concordia, Chiapas|La Concordia]], [[Mapastepec]], [[Pijijiapan]], [[Siltepec]] and [[Villa Corzo]] near the Pacific Ocean with 119,177.29 hectares. It conserves areas of tropical rainforest and many freshwater systems endemic to [[Central America]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; It is home to around 400 species of birds including several rare species such as the [[horned guan]], the [[quetzal]] and the [[azure-rumped tanager]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt; The [[Palenque|Palenque National Forest]] is centered on the archeological site of the same name and was decreed in 1981. It is located in the municipality of Palenque where the Northern Mountains meet the Gulf Coast Plain. It extends over 1,381 hectares of tropical rainforest. The The [[Laguna Bélgica Conservation Zone]] is located in the north west of the state in the municipality of Ocozocoautla. It covers forty two hectares centered on the Bélgica Lake. The El [[Zapotal Ecological Center]] was established in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Nahá – Metzabok is an area in the [[Lacandon Jungle]] whose name means “place of the black lord” in [[Nahuatl]]. It extends oer 617.49km2 and in 2010, it was included in the [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves]]. There are two main communities in the area called Nahá and Metzabok which were established in the 1940s, but the oldest communities in the area belong to the [[Lacandon people]]. The area has large numbers of wildlife including endangered species such as eagles, quetzals and jaguars.&lt;ref name=&quot;aventuragob&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chiapas.gob.mx/turismo-de-aventura  |title= Turismo de aventura |publisher= State of Chiapas |location=Chiapas, Mexico |language=Spanish |date= March 2, 2011 |trans_title=Adventure tourism |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these rates still mean significant population growth in raw numbers. About half of the state’s population is under age 20, with an average age of 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |title= Perfil Sociodemográfico  |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México

More migrate out of Chiapas than migrate in, with emigrants leaving for [[Tabasco]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]], [[State of Mexico]] and the [[Mexico City|Federal District]] primarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

While Catholics remain the majority, their numbers has dropped as many have converted to Protestant sects in recent decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

There are a number of people in the state with [[Afro-Mexican|African features]]. These are the descendents of slaves brought to the state in the 16th century. There are also those with predominantly European features who are the descendents of the original Spanish colonizers as well as later immigrants to Mexico. The latter mostly came at the end of the 19th and early 20th century under the [[Porfirio Díaz]] regime to start plantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous population===
====Numbers and influence====
Over the history of Chiapas, there have been three main indigenous groups: the [[Mixe people|Mixes]]-[[Zoque people|Zoques]], the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]] and the [[Chiapa people|Chiapa]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;  Today, there are an estimated fifty six linguistic groups. As of the 2005 Census, there were 957,255 people who spoke an indigenous language out of a total population of about 3.5 million. Of this one million, one third do not speak Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett18&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of Chiapas' 111 municipios, ninety-nine have significant indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/chiapas.html |title=Chiapas-Forever Indigenous |author= John P. Schmal |year=2004 |publisher=Houston Institute for Culture |location=Texas |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty two municipalities have indigenous populations over 90 percent, and 36 municipalities have native populations exceeding 50 percent. However, despite population growth in indigenous villages, the percentage of indigenous to non indigenous continues to fall with less than 35% indigenous. Indian populations are concentrated in a few areas, with the largest concentration of indigenous-language-speaking individuals is living in five of Chiapas’s nine economic regions: Los Altos, Selva, Norte, Fronteriza, and Sierra. The remaining four regions, Centro, Frailesca, Soconusco, and Costa, have populations that are considered to be dominantly [[mestizo]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rodríguez |first1= Jeanette  |last2=Fortier |first2=Ted |title= Cultural Memory : Resistance, Faith and Identity. |year=2007 |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX, USA |isbn= 9780292716636 |pages=107–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has about 13.5% of all of Mexico’s indigenous population,&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;  and it has been ranked among the ten “most indianized” states, with only [[Campeche]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Quintana Roo]] and [[Yucatán]] having been ranked above it between 1930 and the present.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo109&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; These indigenous peoples have been historically resisting to assimilation into the broader Mexican society, with is best seen in the retention rates of indigenous languages and the historic demands for autonomy over geographic areas as well as culture domains. Much of the latter has been prominent since the Zapatista uprising in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo119&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of Chiapas’ indigenous groups are descended from the Mayans, speaking languages that are closely related to one another, belonging to the [[Mayan languages|Western Maya language group]]. The state was part of a large region dominated by the Mayans during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;  The most numerous of these Mayan groups include the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]], [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]], [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]], [[Zoque people|Zoque]], [[Tojolabal people|Tojolabal]], [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]] and [[Mam people|Mam]], which have traits in commons such as syncretic religious practices, and tribal structure based on kinship.&lt;ref name=&quot;costumbresdes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/costumbres-fiestas-y-tradiciones-chiapas.html |title= Costumbres, fiestas y tradiciones (Chiapas)  |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Customs, festivals and traditions (Chiapas) |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common Western Maya languages are [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]] and [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]] along with [[Chontal Maya language|Chontal]], Ch’ol, Tojolabal, Chuj, Kanjobal, Acatec, Jacaltec and Motozintlec.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;

Twelve of Mexico’s officially recognized native peoples live in the state who have conserved their language, customs, history dress and traditions to a significant degree. The primary groups include the Tzeltal, Tzotzil, [[Ch'ol language|Ch'ol]], [[Tojolab'al language|Tojolabal]], [[Zoque language|Zoque]], [[Chuj language|Chuj]], [[Kanjobal]], [[Mam language|Mam]], [[Jacalteco]], [[Mochó Cakchiquel]] and [[Lacandon language|Lacandon]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;ubicagob&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones18&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Most indigenous communities are found in the municipalites of the Centro, Altos, Norte and Selva regions, with many having indigenous populations of over fifty percent. These include [[Bochil]], [[Sitalá]], [[Pantepec]], [[Simojovel]] to those with over ninety percent indigenous such as [[San Juan Cancuc]], [[Huixtán]], [[Tenejapa]], [[Tila, Chiapas|Tila]], [[Oxchuc]], [[Tapalapa]], [[Zinacantán]], [[Mitontic]], [[Ocotepec, Chiapas|Ocotepec]], [[Chamula]], and [[Chalchihuitán]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; The most numerous indigenous communities are the Tzeltal and Tzotzil peoples which number about 300,000 each, together accounting for about half of the state indigenous population. The next most numerous are the Ch’ol with about 150,000 people and the Tojolabal and Zoques which number about 45,000 each.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;/&gt; 

Although most indigenous language speakers are bilingual, especially in the younger generations, many of these languages have shown resilience. Four of Chiapas’ indigenous languages Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal and Chol are high vitality languages, meaning that the highest percentages of these ethnicities speak the language and there is a high rate of monolingualism in it. It is used in over 80% of homes. Zoque is considered to be of medium vitality with a rate of bilingualism of over 70% and home use somewhere between 65% and 80%. Maya is considered to be of low vitality with almost all of its speakers bilingual with Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo19&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The most spoken indigenous languages as of 2010 are Tzeltal with 461,236 speakers, Tzotzil with 417,462, Ch’ol with 191,947 and Zoque with 53,839. In total, there are 1,141,499 who speak an indigenous language or 27% of the total population. Of these 14% do not speak Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;inegidiv&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/chis/poblacion/diversidad.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=07|title= Diversidad |publisher=[[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Diversity |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done between 1930 and 2000 have indicated that Spanish is not dramatically displacing these languages. In raw number, speakers of these languages are increasing, especially among groups with a long history of resistance to Spanish/Mexican domination.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo109&quot;/&gt; Language maintenance has been strongest in areas related to where the Zapatista uprising took plaza such as the municipalities of Altamirano, Chamula, [[Chanal]], [[Larráinzar]], Las Margaritas, Ocosingo, Palenque, [[Sabanilla]], San Cristóbal de Las Casas and Simojovel.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo117&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state’s rich indigenous tradition along with its associated political uprisings, especially that of 1994, has great interest in it from other parts of Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; It has been especially appealing to a variety of academics including many anthropologists, archeologists, historians, psychologists and sociologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;/&gt; The concept of “[[mestizo]]” or mixed indigenous European heritage became important to Mexico’s identity by the time of Independence, but Chiapas has kept its indigenous identity to the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; Since the 1970s, this has been supported by the Mexican government has it has shifted from cultural policies that favor a “multicultural” identity for the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosalva&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hernández Castilla |first1=Rosalva Aída Marie |author2=Renato Rosaldo |title= Histories and Stories from Chiapas : Border Identities in Southern Mexico. |year=2001 |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX, USA |isbn= 978-0-292-73149-3 |pages=1 and 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One major exception to the separatist, indigenous identity has been the case of the Chiapa people, from whom the state’s name comes, who have mostly been assimilated and intermarried into the mestizo population.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;/&gt;

Indigenous communities have economies based on traditional agriculture, producing corn and beans for auto consumption and coffee as a cash crop. They also raise a certain amount of livestock. Tourism has provided a number of a these communities with markets for their handcrafts and folk art.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; Two areas which maintain a strong indigenous identity are San Cristóbal de las Casas and San Juan Chamula. On market day, many indigenous from rural areas come into San Cristóbal to sell and buy mostly items for everyday use such as fruit, vegetables, animals, cloth, and tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;costumbresdes&quot;/&gt;  San Juan Chamula is considered to be a center of indigenous culture, especially its elaborate festivals of [[Carnival]] and Day of Saint John.  It was common for politicians, especially during [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]’s dominance to visit here during election campaigns and dress in indigenous clothing and carry a walking stick, a traditional sign of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kovic |first1=Christine Marie |title= Mayan Voices for Human Rights : Displaced Catholics in Highland Chiapas |year=2005 |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX, USA |isbn= 978-0292706408 |pages=2–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the indigenous ethnic groups is complicated. While there have been inter ethnic political activism such as that promoted by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de Las Casas|Diocese of Chiapas]] in the 1970s and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]] in the 1990s, there has also been inter-indigenous conflict as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;stevenson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt; Much of this has been based on religion, pitting those of the traditional Catholic/indigenous beliefs who support the traditional power structure against Protestants, Evangelicals and Word of God Catholics (directly allied with the Diocese) who tend to oppose it. This is particularly significant problem among the Tzeltals and Tzotzils. Starting in the 1970s, traditional leaders in San Juan Chamula began expelling dissidents from their homes and land, amounting to about 20,000 indigenous forced to leave over a thirty year period. It continues to be a serious social problem although authorities downplay it.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo105&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothing, especially women’s clothing, varies by indigenous group. For example, women in Ocosingo tend to wear a blouse with a round collar embroidered with flowers and a black skirt decorated with ribbons and tied with a cloth belt. The Lacandon people tend to wear a simple white tunic. They also make a ceremonial tunic from [[amate|bark]], decorated with astronomy symbols. In Tenejapa, women wear a [[huipil]] embroidered with Mayan fretwork along with a black wool [[rebozo]]. Men wear short pants, embroidered at the bottom.&lt;ref name=&quot;artepopdes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-arte-popular-en-chiapas-maravillosas-manos-artesanas.html |title= El arte popular en Chiapas, maravillosas manos artesanas |first= Georgina |last= Luna Parra |month=Winter |year=2002 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans_title=Popular Art in Chiapas, marvelous artisan hands |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tzeltals====
[[File:Tseltal Ocosingo.jpg|thumb|Tzeltal woman in Ocosingo]]
The Tzeltals call themselves Winik atel, which means “working men.” This is the largest ethnicity in the state, mostly living southeast of San Cristóbal with the largest number in [[Amatenango del Valle|Amatenango]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;/&gt; Today, there are about 500,000 Tzeltal Indians in Chiapas. Tzeltal Mayan, part of the Mayan language family, today is spoken by about 375,000 people making it the fourth-largest language group in Mexico. There are two main dialects; highland (or Oxchuc) and lowland (or Bachajonteco) .&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;/&gt; This language, along with Tzotzil, is from the Tzeltalan subdivision of the Mayan language family. Lexico-statistical studies indicate that these two languages probably became differentiated from one another around 1200&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; Most children are bilingual in the language and Spanish although many of their grandparents are monolingual Tzeltal speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;/&gt;
Each Tzeltal community constitutes a distinct social and cultural unit with its own well-defined lands, wearing apparel, kinship system, politico-religious organization, economic resources, crafts, and other cultural features.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;/&gt;  Women are distinguished by black skirt with a wool belt and an undyed cotton bloused embroidered with flowers. Their hair is tied with ribbons and covered with a cloth. Most men do not use traditional attire.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;/&gt; Agriculture is the basic economic activity of the Tzeltal people. Traditional [[Mesoamerica]]n crops such as maize, beans, squash, and [[chili pepper]]s  are the most important, but a variety of other crops, including wheat, [[manioc]], [[sweet potato]]es, cotton, [[chayote]], some fruits, other vegetables, and coffee.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;/&gt;

====Tzotzils====
[[File:San Cristobal - Indianische Straßenhändlerinnen.jpg|thumb|Tzotzil women in San Cristobal]]
Tzotzil speakers number just slightly less than theTzeltals at 226,000, although those of the ethnicity are probably higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones20&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Tzotzils are found in the highlands or Los Altos and spread out towards the northeast near the border with Tabasco. However, Tzotzil communities can be found in almost every municipality of the state. They are concentrated in Chamula, Zinacantán, [[Chenalhó]], and Simojovel. Their language is closely related to Tzeltal and distantly related to [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Mayan]] and Lacandon.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo108&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Men dress in short pants tied with a red cotton belt and a shirt that hangs down to their knees. They also wear leather huaraches and a hat decorated with ribbons. The women wear a red or blue skirt a short huipil as a blouse and use a chal or [[rebozo]] to carry babies and bundles. Tzotzil communities are governed by a katinab who is selected for life by the leaders of each neighborhood. The Tzotzils are also known for their continued use of the [[temazcal]] for hygene and medicinal purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones20&quot;/&gt;

====Ch’ols====
[[File:IndigenousWomanPalenque2.JPG|thumb|Ch'ol woman in Palenque]]
The [[Ch'ol people|Ch’ols of Chiapas]] migrated to the northwest of the state starting about 2,000 years ago, when they were concentrated in Guatemala and [[Honduras]]. Those Ch’ols who remained in the south are distinguished by the name [[Ch'orti' people|Chortís]]. Chiapas Ch’ols are closely related to the Chontal in Tabasco as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; Choles are found in Tila, Tumbalá, Sabanilla, Palenque, and [[Salto de Agua]], with an estimated population of about 115,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones20&quot;/&gt; The Ch’ol language belongs to the Maya family and is related to Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Lacandon, Tojolabal, and Yucatec Mayan. There are three varieties of Chol (spoken in Tila, Tumbalá and Sabanilla) which are mutually intelligible.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo108&quot;/&gt; Over half of speakers are monolingual in the Chol language. Women wear a long navy blue or black skirt with a white blouse heavily embroidered with bright colors and a sash with a red ribbon. The men only occasionally use traditional dress for events such as the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This dress usually includes pants, shirts and huipils made of undyed cotton, with leather [[huarache (shoe)|huarache]]s, a carrying sack and a hat.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones20&quot;/&gt; The fundamental economic activity of the Ch’ols is agriculture. They primarily cultivate corn and beans, as well as sugar cane, rice, coffee, and some fruits.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; The have Catholic beliefs strongly influenced by native ones. Harvests are celebrated on the Feast of Saint Rose on 30 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones20&quot;/&gt;

====Tojolabals====
The Totolabals are estimated at 35,000 in the highlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones21&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to oral tradition, the Tojolabales came north from Guatemala.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; The largest community is Ingeniero González de León in the La Cañada region, an hour outside the municipal seat of Las Margaritas.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones21&quot;/&gt; Tojolabales are also found in Comitán, Trinitaria, Altamirano and La Independencia.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo109&quot;/&gt; This area is filled with rolling hills with a temperate and moist climate. There are fast moving rivers and jungle vegetation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones21&quot;/&gt; Tojolabal is related to Kanjobal, but also to Tzeltal and Tzotzil.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo109&quot;/&gt; However, most of the youngest of this ethnicity speak Spanish. Women dress traditionally since childhood with brightly colored skirts decorated with lace or ribbons and a blouse decorated with small ribbons and they cover their heads with kerchiefs. They embroider many of their own clothes but do not sell them. Married women arrange their hair in two braids and single women wear it loose decorated with ribbons. Men no longer wear traditional garb daily as it is considered too expensive to make.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones21&quot;/&gt;

====Zoques====
The Zoques are found in 3,000 square kilometers the center and west of the state scattered among hundreds of communities. These were one of the first native peoples of Chiapas, with archeological ruins tied to them dating back as far as 3500 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones20&quot;/&gt; Their language is not Mayan but rather relted to [[Mixe languages|Mixe]], which is found in [[Oaxaca]] and [[Veracruz]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo109&quot;/&gt; By the time the Spanish arrived, they had been reduced in number and territory. Their ancient capital was Quechula which was covered by the creation of the Malpaso Dam along with the ruins of Guelegas, which had been first buried by an eruption of the [[El Chichón|Chichonal volcano]]. There are still Zoque ruins at Janepaguay, the Ocozocuautla and La Ciénega valleys.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones20&quot;/&gt;

====Lacandons====
The Lacandons are one of the smallest native indigenous groups of the state with a population estimated between 600 and 1000.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1921&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly located in the communities of Lacanjá, Chansayab and Mensabak in the [[Lacandon Jungle]]. They live near the ruins of [[Bonampak]] and [[Yaxchilan]] and local lore states that the gods resided here when they lived on Earth. They inhabit about a million hectares of rainforest but from the 16th century to the present, migrants have taken over the area, most of which are indigenous from other areas of Chiapas. This dramatically altered their lifestyle and worldview. Traditional Lacandon shelters are huts made with fonds and wood with a earthern floor, but this has mostly given way to modern structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones20&quot;/&gt;

====Mochós====
The Mochós or Motozintlecos are concentrated in the municipality of [[Motozintla]] on the Guatemalan border. According to anthropologists, these people are an “urban” ethnicity as they are mostly found in the neighborhoods of the municipal seat. Other communities can be found near the [[Volcán Tacaná|Tacaná volcano]], and in the municipalities of [[Tuzantán]] and Belisario Dominguez. The name “Mochó” comes from a response many gave the Spanish who they could not understand and means “I don´t know.” This community is in the process of disappearing as their numbers shrink.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones22&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mams====
The Mams are a Mayan ethnicity which is numbered at about 20,000 found in thirty municipalities, especially [[Tapachula]], Motozintla, El Porvenir, [[Cacahoatán]] and Amatenango in the southeastern Sierra Madre of Chiapas.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosalva&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones22&quot;/&gt; The Mame language is one of the most ancient Mayan languages with 5,450 Mame speakers were tallied in Chiapas in the 2000 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; These people first migrated to the border region between Chiapas and Guatemala at the end of the nineteenth century, establishing scattered settlements. In the 1960s, several hundred migrated to the Lacandon rain forest near the confluence of the Santo Domingo and Jataté Rivers. Those who live in Chiapas are referred to localled as the “Mexican Mam (or Mame)” to differientiate them from those in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosalva&quot;/&gt; Most live around the Tacaná volcano, which the Mams call “our mother” as it is considered to be the source of the fertility of the area’s fields. The masculine deity is the Tajumulco volcano which is in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosalva&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones22&quot;/&gt;

====Guatemalan migrant groups====
In the last decades of the 20th century, Chiapas received a large number of indigenous refugees, especially from Guatemala, many of whom remain in the state. These have added ethnicities such as the [[Q'eqchi' people|Kekchi]], Chuj, [[Ixil people|Ixil]], Kanjobal, [[K'iche' people|Quiché]] and [[Cakchikel]] to the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones19&quot;/&gt; The Kanjobal mainly live along the border between Chiapas and Guatemala, with almost 5,800 speakers of the language tallied in the 2000 census. It is believed that a significant number of these Kanjobal-speakers may have been born in Guatemala and immigrated to Chiapas, maintaining strong cultural ties to the neighboring nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The official name of the state is Chiapas. The name derives from “Chiapan” or “Tepechiapan” the name of [[Chiapa people|an indigenous population]]. The term is from [[Nahuatl]] and has been translated to mean “sage seed hill” and “water below the hill.” After the Spanish arrived, they established two cities called Chiapas de los Indios and Chiapas de los Españoles, with the name of Provincia de Chiapas for the area around the cities. The first coat of arms for the state was created in 1535 as that of the Ciudad Real (San Cristobal de las Casas). The modern coat of arms was created by Chiapas painter [[Javier Vargas Ballinas]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclatura&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |title= Nomenclatura  |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México

Hunter gatherers began to occupy the central valley of the state around 7000 BCE, but little is known about their lives. The oldest archeological remains in the seat are located at the Santa Elena Ranch in [[Ocozocoautla]] whose finds include tools and weapons made of stone and bone.

Recent excavations in the [[Soconusco]] region of the state indicate that the oldest civilization to appear in what is now modern Chiapas is that of the [[Mokaya]], which were cultivating corn and living in houses as early as 1500 BCE, making them one of the oldest in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones35&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that these were the forefathers of the [[Olmec]], migrating across the Grijalva Valley and onto the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico to the north, which Olmec territory.One of these people’s ancient cities is now the archeological site of [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]], in which was found the oldest calendar known on a piece of ceramic with a date of 36 BCE. This is three hundred years before the [[Mayan peoples|Mayans]] developed their calendar. The descendents of Mokaya are the Mixtec-Zoque.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; During the pre Classic, it is known that most of Chiapas was not Olmec, but had close relations with them, especially the Olmecs of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Olmec influenced sculpture can be found in Chiapas and products from the state including [[amber]], [[magnetite]] and [[ilmenite]] were exported to Olmec lands. The Olmecs came to what is now the northwest of th state looking for amber with one of the main evidences for this called the Simojovel Ax.&lt;ref name=&quot;olmecasarq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nChiapas87.html |title= Los olmecas en Chiapas |author= Thomas A.

Mayan civilization began in the pre Classic period as well but did not come into prominence until the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]] (300-900 CE). Development of this culture was agricultural villages during the pre Classic period with city building during the Classic as social stratification became more complex. The Mayans built cities on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and west into [[Guatemala]]. In Chiapas, Mayas sites are concentrated along the state’s borders with [[Tabasco]] and Guatemala, near Mayan sites in those entities. Most of this area belongs to the [[Lacandon Jungle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones2930&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayan civilization in the Lacandon is marked by rising exploitation of rainforest resources, rigid social stratification, feverent nationalism and waging war against neighboring peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; At its height, it had large cities, writing and of sciences such as mathematics and astronomy. Cities were centered on large political and ceremonial structures which were elaborated decorated with murals and inscriptions. Among these cities are [[Palenque]], [[Bonampak]], [[Yaxchilan]], [[Chinkultic]], [[Toniná]] and Tenón. The Mayan civilization had vast trade networks and large markets trading in goods such as animal skins, [[indigo]], [[amber]], [[vanilla]] and [[quetzal]] feathers.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones2930&quot;/&gt;  It is not known what ended the civilization but theories range from over population, natural disasters, disease and loss of natural resources through over exploitation or climate change. However, nearly all Mayan cities collapsed around the same time, 900 CE. From then until 1500 CE, social organization of the region fragmented into much smaller units and social structure became much less complex. There was some influence from the rising powers of central Mexico but two main indigenous groups emerged during this time, the Zoques and the various Mayan descendents. The Chiapans, for whom the state is named, migrated into the center of the state during this time and settled around Chiapa de Corzo, the old Mixe-Zoque stronghold.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; There is evidence that the [[Aztec]]s appeared in the center of the state around Chiapa de Corza in the 15th century, but were unable to displace the native Chiapa tribe. However, they had enough influence so that the name of this area and of the state would come from [[Nahuatl]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt;

===Colonial period===
[[File:FacadeSanCrisCathedral.JPG|thumb|Facade of the cathedral of San Cristóbal de las Casas]]
When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the found the indigenous peoples divided into Mayan and non-Mayan, with the latter dominated by the [[Zoque people|Zoques]] and [[Chiapa people|Chiapa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; The first contact between Spaniards and the people of Chiapas came in 1522, when [[Hernán Cortés]] sent tax collectors to the area after Aztec Empire was subdued. The first military incursion was headed by Luis Marín, who arrived in 1523. For three years, Marín was able to subjugate a number of the local peoples, but met with fierce resistance from the [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzils]] in the highlands. The Spanish colonial government then sent a new expedition under [[Diego de Mazariegos]]. Mazariegos had more success than his predecessor, but many indigenous preferred to commit suicide rather than submit to the Spanish. One famous example of this is the [[Battle of Tepetchia]], where many jumped to their deaths in the [[Sumidero Canyon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;/&gt;

Indigenous resistance was weakened by continual warfare with the Spaniards as well as disease, and by 1530, almost all of the indigenous peoples of the area had been subdued with the exception of the [[Lacandon people|Lacandons]] in the deep jungles who actively resisted until 1695.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; However, the main two groups, the Tzotzils and [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltals]] of the central highlands were subdued enough to establish the first Spanish city, today called [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], in 1528. It was one of two settlements initially called Villa Real de Chiapa de los Españoles and the other called Chiapa de los Indios.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;/&gt; 

Soon after, the [[encomienda]] system was introduced, which reduced most of the indigenous population to serfs and many even as slaves, paid as a form of tribute. The [[conquistador]]s brought diseases which were previously unknown. This and over work on plantations dramatically decreased the indigenous population.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; The Spanish also established missions, mostly under the [[Dominicans]], with the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de Las Casas|Diocese of Chiapas]] established in 1538 by [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;/&gt; The Dominican evangelizers became early advocates of the indigenous’ plight, with [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] winning a battle with the passing of a law in 1542 for their protection. This order also worked to make sure that communities would keep their indigenous name with a saint’s prefix leading to names such as [[Chamula|San Juan Chamula]] and [[Zinacantán|San Lorenzo Zinacantán]]. He also advocated adapting the teaching of Christianity to indigenous language and culture. The encomienda system which had perpetrated much of the abuse of the native peoples fell away be the end of the 16th century to be replaced by [[hacienda]]s; however, the use and misuse of Indian labor would remain a large part of Chiapas politics from then until modern times.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; This treatment and tribute payments would create an undercurrent of resentment in the indigenous population that passed on from generation to generation. One uprising against high tribute payments occurs in the Tzeltal communities in the Los Alto region in 1712.  Soon, the Tzoltzils and Ch’ols joined the Tzeltales in rebellion, but within a year, the government was able to extinguish the rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; 

The Spanish introduced new crops such as [[sugar cane]], wheat, [[barley]] and [[indigo]] as main economic staples along native ones such as corn, cotton, [[cacao bean|cacao]] and beans. Livestock such as cattle, horses and sheep were introduced as well. Regions would specialize in certain crops and animals depending on local conditions and for many of these regions, communication and travel were difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; Most Europeans and their descendents tended to concentrate in cities such as [[San Cristóbal de las Casas|Ciudad Real]], [[Comitán]], [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa]] and [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez|Tuxtla]]. Intermixing of the races was prohibited by colonial law but by the end of the 17th century there was a significant [[mestizo]] population. Added to this was a population of [[Afro-Mexican|African slaves brought in by the Spanish]] in the middle of the 16th century due to the loss of native workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones3031&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, “Chiapas” referred to the first two cities established by the Spanish in what is now the center of the state and the area surrounding them. Two other regions were also established, the [[Soconusco]] and Tuxtla, all under the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|regional colonial government of Guatemala]]. Chiapas, Soconusco and Tuxla regions were united to the first time as an “intendencia” in 1790 as an administrative region under the name of Chiapas. However, within this intendencia, the division between Chiapas and Soconusco regions would remain strong and have consequences at the end of the colonial period.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones35&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
Since the colonial period, Chiapas had been relatively isolated from colonial authorities in Mexico City and regional authorities in Guatemala. One reason for this was the rugged terrain but the other was that much of Chiapas was not attractive to the Spanish for its lack of mineral wealth or large areas of arable land.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; This isolation spared it from battles related to Independence. [[José María Morelos y Pavón]] did enter the city of [[Tonalá, Chiapas|Tonalá]] but incurred no resistance. The only other insurgent activity was the publication of a newspaper called “El Pararrayos” by Matías de Córdova in San Cristóbal de las Casas.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones31&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, this isolation, along with strong internal divisions in the intendencia would cause political crisis after insurgents captured Mexico City in 1821 to end the [[Mexican War of Independence]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;  During this war, a group of influential merchants and ranchers sought the establishment of the Free State of Chiapas. This group became known as the “La Familia Chiapaneca.” However, this alliance did not last with the lowlands preferring inclusion among the new republics of [[Central America]] and the highlands annexation to Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens81&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821,  a number of cities in Chiapas, starting in Comitán declared the state’s separation from the Spanish empire. In 1823, Guatemala became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]], which united to form a federal republic that would last from 1823 to 1839. With the exception of the pro-Mexican Ciudad Real (San Cristóbal) and some others, many Chiapanecan towns and villages favored a Chiapas independent of Mexico and some favored unification with Guatemala. However, the elite in the highland cities pushed for incorporation into Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; In 1822, then Emperor [[Agustín de Iturbide]] decreed that Chiapas was part of Mexico. In 1823, the Junta General de Gobierno was held and Chiapas declared independence again.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; In July 1824, the Soconusco District of southwestern Chiapas split off from Chiapas, announcing that it would join the Central American Federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; In September of the same year, a referendum was held on whether the intendencia would join Central America or Mexico, with many of the elite endorsing union with Mexico. This referendum ended in favor of incorporation with Mexico (allegedly through manipulation of the elite in the highlands), but the Soconusco region maintained a neutral status until 1842, when Oaxacans under General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] occupied the area, and declared it reincorporated into Mexico. The elites of the area would not accept this until 1844.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens81&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones32&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemala would not recognize Mexico’s annexation of the Soconusco region until 1895 even though a final border between Chiapas and the country was finalized until 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones32&quot;/&gt; The State of Chiapas was officially declared in 1824, with its first constitution in 1826.  Ciudad Real was renamed San Cristóbal de las Casas in 1828.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones35&quot;/&gt;

In the decades after the official end of the war, the Chiapas and Soconusco provinces became united with power concentrating into San Cristóbal de las Casas. The state’s society evolved into three distinct spheres: indigenous peoples, mestizos from the farms and haciendas and the Spanish colonial cities. Most of the political struggles were between the latter two groups especially over who would control the indigenous labor force. Economically, the state lost one of its main crops, indigo, to synthetic dyes. There was a small experiment with democracy in the form of “open city councils” but it was short lived because voting was heavily rigged.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

The Universidad Pontificia y Literaria de Chiapas was founded in 1826, with Mexico’s second teacher’s college founded in the state in 1828.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

The [[Reform War|Mexico-wide struggles between Liberals, who favored federalism and Conservatives, who favored centralized autocratic government]] did not lead to any military battles in the state but it strongly affected the local politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; In Chiapas, the Liberal-Conservative division had its own twist. Much of the division between the highland and lowland ruling families was for whom the Indians should work for and for how long as the main shortage was of labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens84&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; These families split into Liberals in the lowlands, who wanted further reform and Conservatives in the highlands who still wanted to keep some of the traditional colonial and church privileges.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens85&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the early and mid 19th century, Conservatives held most of the power and were concentrated in the larges cites of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapa (de Corzo), Tuxtla and Comitán. As Liberals gained the upper hand nationally in the mid 19th century, one Liberal politician Ángel Albino Corzo gained control of the state. Corzo became the primary exponent of Liberal ideas in the southeast of Mexico and defended the Palenque and [[Pichucalco]] areas from annexation by Tabasco. However, Corzo’s rule would end in 1875, when he opposed the regine of [[Porfirio Díaz]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

Liberal land reforms would have negative effects on the state’s indigenous population unlike in other areas of the country. Liberal governments expropriated lands that were previously held by the [[Spanish Crown]] and [[Catholic Church]] in order to sell them into private hands. This was not only motivated by ideology, but also due to the need to raise money. However, many of these lands had been in a kind of “trust” with the local indigenous populations, who worked them. Liberal reforms took away this arrangement and  many of these lands fell into the hands of large landholders who when made the local Indian population work for three to five days a week just for the right to continue to cultivate the lands. This requirement caused many to leave and look for employment elsewhere. Most became “free” workers on other farms, but they were often paid only with food and basic necessities from the farm shop. If this was not enough, these workers became indebted to these same shops and then unable to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens8283&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening up of these lands also allowed many whites and mestizos (often called Ladinos in Chiapas) to encroach on what had been exclusively indigenous communities in the state. These communities had had almost no contact with the Ladino world, except for a priest. The new Ladino landowners occupied their acquired lands as well as others, such as shopkeepers, opened up businesses in the center of Indian communities. In 1848, a group of [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltals]] plotted to kill the new mestizos in their midst, but this plan was discovered, and was punished by th removal of  large number of the community’s male members. The changing social order had severe negative effects on the indigenous population with alcoholism spreadings, leading to more debts as it was expensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens84&quot;/&gt; The struggles between Conservatives and Liberals nationally disrupted commerce and confused power relations between Indian communities and Ladino authorities. It also resulted in some brief respites for Indians during times when the instability led to uncollected taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens86&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

One other effect that Liberal land reforms had was the start of coffee plantations, especially in the [[Soconusco]] region. One reason for this push in this area was that Mexico was still working to strengthen its claim on the area against Guatemala’s claims on the region. The land reforms brought colonists from other areas of the country as well as foreigners from England, the United States and France. These forieign immigrants would introduce coffee production to the areas, as well as modern machineray and professional administration of coffee plantations.Eventually, this production of coffee would become the state’s most important crop.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt;

Although the Liberals had mostly triumphed in the state and the rest of the country by the 1860s, Conservatives still held considerable power in Chiapas. Liberal politicians sought to solidify their power among the indigenous groups by weakening the Church. The more radical of these even allowed indigenous groups the religious freedoms to return to a number of native rituals and beliefs such as pilgrimages to natural shrines such as mountains and waterfalls.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens8788&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

This culminated in the Chiapas “caste war” which was an uprising the [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzils]] beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens88&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the uprising was the establishment of the “three stones cult” in Tzajahemal.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens88&quot;/&gt; [[Agustina Gómez Checheb]] was a girl tending her father’s sheep when three stones fell from the sky. Collecting them, she put them on her father’s altar and soon claimed that the stone communicated with her. Word of this soon spread and the “talking stones” of Tzajahemel soon became a local indigenous pilgrimage site. The cult was taken over by one pilgrim, [[Pedro Díaz Cuzcat]], who also claimed to be able to communicate with the stones, and had knowledge of Catholic ritual, becoming a kind of priest. However, this challenged the traditional Catholic faith and non Indians began to denounce the cult.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens80&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Stories about the cult include embellishments such as the [[crucifixion]] of a young Indian boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens81&quot;/&gt; 

This led to the arrest of Checheb and Cuzcat in December 1868. This caused resentment among the Tzotzils. Although the Liberals had earlier supported the cult, Liberal landowners had also lost control of much of their Indian labor and Liberal politicians were having a harder time collecting taxes from indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens8990&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian army gathered at Zontehuitz then attacked various villages and haciendas.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones32&quot;/&gt; By the following June the city of San Cristóbal was surrounded by several thousand Indians, who offered the exchanged of several Ladino captives for their religious leaders and stones.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens90&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiapas governor Dominguéz come to San Cristóbal with about three hundred heavily armed men, who then attacked the Indian force armed only with sticks and [[machete]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens91&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous force was quickly dispersed and routed with government troops pursuing pockets of guerrilla resistance in the mountains until 1870. The event effectively returned control of the indigenous workforce back to the highland elite.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones32&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens9192&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Porfirio Díaz]] era at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th was initially thwarted by regional bosses called [[cacique]]s, bolstered by  a wave of Spanish and mestizo farners who migrated to the state  and added to the elite group of wealthy landowning families.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; There was some technological progress such as a highway from San Cristóbal to the Oaxaca border and the first telephone line in the 1880s, but Porfirian era economic reforms would not begin until 1891 with Governor [[Emilio Rabasa]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones32&quot;/&gt; This governor took on the local and regional caciques and centralized power into the state capital, which he moved from San Cristóbal de las Casas to Tuxtla in 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones32&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens98&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  He modernized public administration, transportation and promoted education.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; Rabasa also introduced [[telegraph]], limited public schooling, sanitation and road construction, including a route from San Cristóbal to Tuxtla then Oaxaca, which signaled the beginning of favoritism of development in the central valley over the highlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens99&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; He also changed state policies to favor foreign investment, favored large land mass consolidation for the production of cash crops such as henequen, rubber, guayule, cochineal and coffee.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens96&quot;&gt;Higgens, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural production boomed, especially coffee which induced the construction of port facilities in [[Tonalá, Chiapas|Tonalá]]. The economic expanstion and investment in roads also increased access to tropical commodities such as hardwoods, rubber and [[chicle]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens99&quot;/&gt; 

These still required cheap and steady labor to be provided by the indigenous population.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens99&quot;/&gt; By the end of the 19th century, the four main indigenous groups, Tzeltals, Tzotzils, Tojolabals and Ch’ols were living in “reducciones” or reservations, isolated from one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo105&quot;/&gt; Conditions on the farms of the Porfirian era was serfdom, as bad if not worse than for other indigenous and mestizo populations leading to the [[Mexican Revolution]]. While this coming event would affect the state, Chiapas did not follow the uprisings in other areas that would end the Porfirian era.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones3233&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to the present===
In the early 20th century and into the [[Mexican Revolution]], the production of coffee was particularly important but labor intensive. This would lead to a practice called “enganche” (hook) where recruiter would lure workers with advanced pay and other incentives such as alcohol and then trap them with debts for travel and other items to be worked off. This practice would led to a kind of indentured servitude and uprisings in areas of the state, although they never led to large rebel armies as in other parts of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt;

A small war broke out between [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez|Tuxtla]] and San Cristobal in 1911. San Cristóbal, allied with San Juan Chamula, tried to regain the state’s capital but the effort failed. There were three years of peace after that until troops allied with [[Venustiano Carranza]] entered in 1914 taking over the government, with the aim of imposing the Ley de Obreros to address wrongs done to the state’s mostly indigenous workers. Conservatives responded violently months later as they were certain the Carrranza forces would take their lands. This was mostly in the way of guerrilla actions headed by farm owners who called themselves the Mapaches, which continued for six years, until Carranza was assassinated and [[Álvaro Obregón]] became president of Mexico. This allowed the Mapaches to gain political power in the state and effectively stop many of the social reforms happening in other parts of Mexico. However, these Mapaches would continue to fight against socialists and communists in Mexico from 1920 to 1936 to maintain their control over the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones35&quot;/&gt; In general, the elite landowners also allied with the nationally dominant [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI)  so that they could block land reforms in this way as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt; The Mapaches were first defeated in 1925 when an alliance of socialists and former Carranza loyalists had Carlos A. Vidal selected as governor, although he was assassinated two years later. The last of the Mapache resistance was over come in the early 1930s by Governor Victorico Grajales, who pursued President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]]’ social and economic policies including persecution of the Church. These policies would have some success in redistributing lands and organizing indigenous workers but the state would remain relatively isolated fro the rest of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones35&quot;/&gt; 
The territory was reorganized into municipalities in 1916. The current state constitution was written in 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;

There was political stability from the 1940s to the early 1970s; however, regionalism regained with people thinking of themselves as from their local city or municipality over the state. This regionalism impeded the economy as local authorities restrained outside goods. For this reason, construction of highways and communications were pushed to help with economic development. Most of the work was done around Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Tapachula. This included the Sureste railroad connecting northern municipalities such as Pichucalco, Salto de Agua, Palenque, [[Catazajá]] and [[La Libertad, Chiapas|La Libertad]]. The Cristobal Colon highway linked Tuxtla to the Guatemalan border. Other highways included El Escopetazo to Pichucalco, a highway between San Cristóbal and Palenque with branches to Cuxtepeques and La Frailesca. This helped to integrate the state’s economy, but it also permitted the political rise of communal land owners called ejidatarios.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Lacanja burn crop.JPG|thumb|Area of the Lacandon Jungle burned to plant crops]]
In the mid 20th century, the state experienced a significant rise in population, which outstripped local resources, especially land in the highland areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;sspeed&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Shannon |editor1-last=Speed |others=Aida Hernandez Castillo and Lynne Stephen |title= Dissident Women : Gender and Cultural Politics in Chiapas |year=2006 |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX, USA |isbn= 0292714173 |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1930s, many indigenous and mestizos have migrated from the highland areas into the [[Lacandon Jungle]] with the populations of Altamirano, Las Margaritas, Ocosingo and Palenque rising from less thatn 11,000 in 1920 to over 376,000 in 2000. These migrants came to the jungle area to clear forest and grow crops and raise livestock, especially cattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo106&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; Economic development in general raised the output of the state, especially in agriculture, but it had the effect of deforesting many areas, especially the Lacandon. Added to this was there was still serf like conditions for many workers and insufficient educational infrastructure. Population continued to increase faster than the economy could absorb.(enhis) There were some attempts to resettle peasant farmers onto non cultivated lands, but they were met with resistance. President [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] awarded a land grant to the town of Venustiano Carranza in 1967, but that land was already being used by cattle-ranchers which refused to leave. The peasants tried to take over the land anyway, but when violence broke out, they were forcibly removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett264&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events began to lead to political crises in the 1970s, with more frequent land invasions and takeovers of municipal halls.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett264&quot;/&gt; This was the beginning of a process that would lead to the emergence of the [[EZLN|Zapatista movement]] in the 1990s. Another important factor to this movement would be the role of the Catholic Church from the 1960s to the 1980s. In 1960, [[Samuel Ruiz]] became the bishop of the Diocese of Chiapas, centered in San Cristóbal. He supported and worked with [[Marist Brothers|Marist priests and nuns]] following an ideology called [[liberation theology]].  In 1974, he organized a state wide “Indian Congress” with representatives from the Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal and Ch’ol peoples from 327 communities as well as Marists and the [[Maoist People’s Union]]. This congress was the first of its kind with the goal of uniting the indigenous peoples politically. These efforts were also supported by leftist organizations from outside Mexico, especially to form unions of [[ejido]] organizations. These unions would later form the base of the [[EZLN]] organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;sspeed&quot;/&gt; One reason for the Church’s efforts to reach out to the indigenous population was that starting in the 1970s, a shift began from traditional Catholic affiliation to Protestant, Evangelical and other Christian sects.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo108&quot;/&gt;

The 1980s saw a large wave of refugees coming into the state from [[Central America]] as a number of these countries, especially [[Guatemala]], were in the midst of violent political turmoil. The Chiapas/Guatemala border had been relatively porous with people traveling back and forth easily in the 19th and 20th centuries, much like the Mexico/U.S. border around the same time. This is in spite of tensions caused by Mexico’s annexation of the [[Soconusco]] region in the 19th century. The border between Mexico and Guatemala had been traditionally poorly guarded, due to diplomatic considerations, lack of resources and pressure from landowners who need cheap labor sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia46&quot;&gt;García, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of thousands of refugees from Central American stressed Mexico’s relationship with Guatemala, at one point coming close to war as well as a politically destabilized Chiapas. Although Mexico is not a signatory to the UN [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], international pressure forced the government to grant official protection to at least some of the refugees. Camps were established in Chiapas and other southern states, and mostly housed [[Mayan peoples]]. However, most Central American refugees from that time never received any official status, estimated by church and charity groups at about half a million from [[El Salvador]] alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia9&quot;&gt;García, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government resisted direct international intervention in the camps, but eventually relented somewhat because of finances.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia50&quot;&gt;García, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984, there were 92 camps with 46,000 refugees in Chiapas, concentrated in three areas, mostly near the Guatemalan border.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia52&quot;&gt;García, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; To make matters worse, the Guatemalan army conducted raids into camps on Mexican territories with significant casualties, terrifying the refugees and local populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia53&quot;&gt;García, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; From within Mexico, refugees faced threats by local governments who threatened to deport them, legally or not, and local paramilitary groups funded by those worried about the political situation in Central American spilling over into the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia54&quot;&gt;García, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The official government response was to militarize the areas around the camps, which limited international access and migration into Mexico from Central America was restricted.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia56&quot;&gt;García, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, it was estimated that there were over 200,000 Guatemalans and half a million from El Salvador, almost all peasant farmers and most under age twenty.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia45&quot;&gt;García, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the politization of the indigenous and rural populations of the state began in the 1960s and 1970s continued.  In 1980, several ejido (communal land organizations) joined to form the Union of Ejidal Unions and United Peasants of Chiapas, generally called the Union of Unions or UU. It had a membership of 12,000 families from over 180 communities. By 1988, this organization joined with other to form the ARIC-Union of Unions (ARIC-UU) and took over much of the Lacandon Jungle portion of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;sspeed&quot;/&gt; Most of the members of these organization were from Protestant and Evangelical sects as well as “Word of God” Catholics affliliated with the political movements of the Diocese of Chiapas. What they held in common was indigenous identity vis-à-vis the non-indigenous, using the old 19th century “caste war” word “Ladino” for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo108&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens81&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sspeed&quot;/&gt; 

The adoption of [[neoliberalism]] by the Mexican federal government clashed with the leftist political ideals of these groups, especially as the reforms began to have negative economic effects on poor farmers, especially small-scale indigenous coffee growers. This would coalese into the [[EZLN|Zapatista movement]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;sspeed&quot;/&gt; Although the Zapatista movement couched its demands and cast is role in response to contemporary issues, especially in its opposition to neoliberalism, it is one of a long line of peasant and indigenous uprisings that have occurred in the state since the colonial era. This is reflected in its indigenous vs. Ladino character.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgens81&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett296&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the movement was an economic one as well. Although rich in resources, much of the local population of the state, especially in rural areas, did not benefit from this. In the 1990s, two thirds of the states residents did not have sewage service, only a third had electricity and half did not have potable water. Over half of the schools offered eduction only to the third grade and most dropped out by the end of first grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia54&quot;/&gt; These grievances, which were strongest in the San Cristóbal and Lacandon Jungle areas, were taken up by a small leftist guerrilla band led by a man called only “[[Subcomandante Marcos]].”&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett297&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SubMarcosHorseFromAfarEdited.jpg|thumb|Image of Subcomandante Marcos]]
This small band, called the [[EZLN|Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, EZLN)]], came to the world’s attention when on January 1, 1994, the day the [[NAFTA]] treaty went into effect. On this day, EZLN forces occupied and took over the towns of [[San Cristobal de las Casas]], [[Las Margaritas, Chiapas|Las Margaritas]], [[Altamirano, Chiapas|Altamirano]], [[Ocosingo]] and three others. They read their proclamation of revolt to the world and then laid siege to a nearby military base, capturing weapons and releasing many prisoners from the jails.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; This action followed previous protests in the state in opposition to neoliberal economic policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt; 

Although it has been estimated at having no more than 300 armed guerrilla members, the EZLN paralyzed the Mexican government as it could not afford the political risks of direct confrontation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett296&quot;/&gt; The major reason for this was that the rebellion caught the attention of the national and world press, as Marcos made full use of the then new Internet to get the groups’ message out, putting the spotlight on indigenous issues in Mexico in general. It was also actively supported by opposition press in Mexico City, especially [[La Jornada]]. However, these elements did provoke the rebellion to go national.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett296297&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 296-297.&lt;/ref&gt; Many blamed the unrest on infiltration of leftists among the large Central American refugee population in Chiapas,&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia55&quot;&gt;García, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rebellion opened up splits in the countryside with those supporting and opposing EZLN.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett296&quot;/&gt; Zapatista sympathizers have included mostly Protestants and Word of God Catholics, versus those “traditionalist” Catholics who practiced a syncretic form of Catholicism and indigenous beliefs. This split had existed in Chiapas since the 1970s, with the latter group supported by the [[cacique]]s and others in the traditional power structure. Protestants and Word of God Catholics (allied directly with the bisphoric in San Cristóbal) tended to oppose traditional power structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt; 

The reaction of the Bishop [[Samuel Ruiz]] and the Diocese of Chiapas was to offer to mediate between the rebels and authorities. However, because of this diocese’s activism since the 1960s, authorities accused the clergy of being involved with the rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo112&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was some ambiguity about the relationship between Ruiz and Marcos and it was a constant feature of news coverage, with many in official circles using such to discredit Ruiz. Eventually, the activities of the Zapatistas began to worry the Roman Catholic Church in general and upstage the diocese’s attempts to re establish itself among Chiapan indigenous communities against Protestant evangelization. This would lead to a breach between the Church and the Zapatistas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett296298&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 296-298.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zapatista story remained in headlines for a number of years. One reason for this was the December 1997 massacure of forty-five Tzotzil pesants, mostly women and children in the Zapatista controlled village of [[Acteal]] in the [[Chenhaló]] municipality just north of San Cristóbal. This allowed many media outlets in Mexico to step up their criticisms of the government. However, the massacre was not done by the government but by other civilians, which shows how the Zapatista movement had divided indigenous groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett299300&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the armed conflict was brief, mostly because the Zapatistas did not try to gain traditional political power like many other guerilla movements. Its focus was more on trying to manipulate public opinion in order to obtain concessions from the government. This has linked the Zapatistas to other indigenous and identity-politics movements which arose in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo113&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The main concession that the group received was the [[San Andrés Accords]], also known as the Law on Indian Rights and Culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;jrodriguez&quot;/&gt; The Accords appear to grant certain indigenous zones autonomy, but this is against the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican constitution]], so its legitimacy has been questioned. Zapatista declarations since the mid 1990s have called for a new constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett21&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; To the present, the government has not found a solution to this problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett296&quot;/&gt; The revolt also pressed the government to institute anti poverty programs such as “Progresa” later called “Oportunidades” and the “Puebla-Panama Plan” aimed to increase trade between southern Mexico and Central America.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultwomen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schuster |first1=Monica |title=The Effects of Adult Women Education – Impact Evaluation of a Program in Chiapas |url= http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=gJZqyTdiLIUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=chiapas+economy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yfF4KYj1y3&amp;sig=3AsdqcbV2UK-mQ-z-tjjnIeG5d4&amp;hl=es-419&amp;ei=C2enTYvfH8Xo0gGY8PH5CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=chiapas%20economy&amp;f=false |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=Druck and Bindung:Books on Demand GmbH |location=Norderstedt, Germany |isbn=978 3 640 23874 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the late 2000s the Zapatista movement remains popular in many indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultwomen&quot;/&gt; The uprising gave indigenous peoples a more active role in the state’s politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; However, it did not solve the economic issues that many peasant farmers face, especially the lack of land to cultivate. This problem has been at crisis proportions since the 1970s and the government’s reaction was to encourage peasant farmers, mostly indigenous, to migrate into the sparsely populated Lacandon Jungle, a trend which had been occurring since earlier in the century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett296&quot;/&gt;

From the 1970s on, some 100,000 people set up homes in this rainforest area, with many being recognized as ejidos, or communal land holding organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett296&quot;/&gt; These migrants included Tzeltals, Tojolabals, Ch’ols and mestizos, mostly farming corn and beans and raising livestock. However, the government changed policies in the late 1980s with establishment of the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]] as much of the Lacandon Jungle had been destroyed or severely damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stevenson&quot;/&gt; While armed resistance had wound down, the Zapatistas have remained a strong political force, especially around San Cristóbal and the Lacandon Jungle, its traditional bases. Since the Accords, they have shifted focus in gaining autonomy for the communities they control.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww4report.com/node/3232|title=Chiapas: paramilitary resurgence seen|publisher=World War 4 Report|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the 1994 uprising, migration into the Lacandon Jungle has significantly increased including illegal settlements and cutting in the protected biosphere reserve. These actions are supported by the Zapatistas as part of indigenous rights, but it has put them in conflict with international environmental groups and the indigenous inhabitants of the rainforest area, the [[Lacandon people|Lacandons]]. Environmental groups state that the settlements pose grave risks to what remains of the Lacandon, while the Zapatistas accuse them of being fronts for the government, who want to open the rainforest up to multinational corporations.&lt;ref name=&quot;stevenson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weinberg&quot;/&gt; Added to this is the possibililty that there are significant oil and gas deposits under this area as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt;

The Zapatista movement has had some successes. The agricultural sector of the economy now favors ejidos and other commonly owned land.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchis&quot;/&gt; There have been some other gains economically as well. In the last decades of the 20th century, Chiapas’ traditional agricultural economy has diversified somewhat with the construction of more roads and better infrastructure by the federal and state governments. At this time, tourism has become important in some areas of the state, especially in San Cristóbal de las Casas and Palenque.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones34&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Its economy is important to Mexico as a whole as well, producing coffee, corn, cacao, tobacco, sugar, fruit, vegetable and honey for export. It is also a key state for the nation’s petrochemical and hydroelectric industries. A significant percentage of PEMEX’s drilling and refining is based in Chiapas and Tabasco, and fifty five percent of the nations hydroelectric energy is produced in Chiapas.&lt;ref name=&quot;mgarcia54&quot;/&gt;

However, Chiapas remains the poorest state in Mexico. Ninety-four of its 111 municipalities live on the poverty line. In areas such as Ocosingo, Altamirano and Las Margaritas, the towns where the Zapatistas first came into prominence in 1994, 48% of the adults are illiterate. Eighty percent of the families earn less than $245 USD a month and seventy percent have no electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; Chiapas is still considered isolated and distant from the rest of Mexico, both culturally and geographically. It has significantly underdeveloped infrastructure compared to the rest of the country and its significant indigenous population with isolationist tendencies keep the state distinct culturally.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones34&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
===Socioeconomic indicators===
Chiapas accounts for 1.73% of the Mexico’s [[GDP]]. The primary sector produces 15.2% of the states GDP. The secondary sector 21.8%, mostly energy production and the rest by commerce, services and tourism. The percentage of the GDP by commerce is services is rising while that of agriculture is falling.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |title= Actividad Econónica |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México

These regions were established in the 1980s in order to facilitate statewide economic planning. Many of these regions are based on state and federal highway systems. These include Centro, Altos, Fronteriza, Frailesca, Norte, Selva, Sierra , Soconusco and Istmo-Costa.&lt;ref name=&quot;regionalizacion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |title= Regionalización |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México

Despite being rich in resources, Chiapas, along with [[Oaxaca]] and [[Guerrero]], lags behind the rest of the country in almost all socioeconomic indicators.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultwomen&quot;/&gt; As of 2005, there were 889,420 residential units, with 71% having running water, 77.3% having sewerage, and 93.6% having electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;inegiviv&quot;/&gt; Construction of these units is varied from modern construction of block and concrete to those constructed of wood and laminate.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |title= Infraestructura Social y de Comunicaciones |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México

Most of its socioeconomic indicators are the lowest in the country including income, education, health and housing. It has a significantly higher percentage of illiteracy then the rest of the country although that situation has improved since the 1970s when over 45% were illiterate and in the 1980s when about 32% were. The tropical climate presents health challenges, with most illnesses related to the gastro-intestinal tract and [[parasite]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pimienta&quot;/&gt; As of 2005, the state has 1,138 medical facilities: 1098 outpatient and 40 inpatient. Most are run by IMSS and ISSSTE and other government agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt; The implementation of [[NAFTA]] has had negative effects on the economy, often by lowering prices for agricultural products. It has also worked to make the southern states of Mexico poorer in comparison to those in the north with over 90% of the poorest municipalities in the south of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultwomen&quot;/&gt; As of 2006, 31.8% work in communal services, social services and personal services. 18.4% work in financial services, insurance and real estate, 10.7% work in comerce, restaurants and hotels, 9.8% work in construction, 8.9% in utilities,  7.8% in transportation, 3.4% in industry (excluding [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts]]),  and 8.4% in agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;inegiactecon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/chis/economia/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=07 |title= Actividades económicas |publisher=[[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Economic activities |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although until the 1960s, many indigenous communities were considered by scholars to be autonomous and economically isolated, this was never the case. Economic conditions began forcing many to migrate to work, especially in agriculture for non- indigenous. However, unlike many other migrant workers, most indigenous in Chiapas have remained strongly tied to their home communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt; A study as early as the 1970s showed that 77 percent of heads of household migrated outside of the [[Chamula]] municipality as local land did not produce sufficiently to support families. In the 1970s, cuts in the price of corn forced many large landowners to convert their fields into pasture for cattle, displacing many hired laborers as cattle required less work. These agricultural laborers began to work for the government on infrastructure projects financed by oil revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt; It is estimated that in the 1980s to 1990s as many as 100,000 indigenous people moved from the mountain areas into cities in Chiapas, with some moving out of the state to [[Mexico City]], [[Cancún]] and [[Villahermosa]] in search of employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt;

===Agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishing===
[[File:RanchPalenqueChiapas.JPG|thumb|Ranch near Palenque]]
Agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishing employ over 53% of the state’s population; however, its productivity is considered to be low. Agriculture includes both seasonal and perennial plants. Major crops include corn, beans, [[sorghum]], [[soybean]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[sesame seed]]s, coffee, [[cacao bean|cacao]], [[sugar cane]], [[mango]]s, bananas, and [[palm oil]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt;  These crops take up 95% of the cultivated land int the state and 90% of the agricultural production. Only four percent of fields are irrigated with the rest dependent on rainfall either seasonally or year round.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt;  Chiapas ranks second among the Mexican states in the production of cacao, the product used to make chocolate, and is responsible for about 60 percent of Mexico's total coffee output.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cafeorganico&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title= El café orgánico de Chiapas crece a contracorriente y sin incentivo  |publisher= El Colegio de la Frontera Sur |date=March 22, 2011 |url= http://www.ecosur.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1184:el-cafe-organico-de-chiapas-crece-a-contracorriente-y-sin-incentivo&amp;catid=154:ecomedios&amp;Itemid=1138&amp;lang=tze |language=Spanish |trans_title=Organic coffee from Chiapas grows counter to trends and without incentive |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production of bananas, cacao and corn make Chiapas Mexico's second largest agricultural producer overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;

Coffee is the state’s most important cash crop which has a history going back to the 19th century. The crop was introduced in 1846 by Jeronimo Manchinelli who brought 1,500 seedlings from Guatemala on his farm La Chacara. This was followed by a number of other farms as well. Coffee production intensified during the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]] and the Europeans who came to own many of the large farms in the area. By 1892, there were 22 coffee farms in the region, among them Nueva Alemania, Hamburgo, Chiripa, Irlanda, Argovia, San Francisco, and Linda Vista in the [[Soconusco]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;abianco&quot;/&gt; Since then coffee production has grown and diversified to include large plantations, the use and free and forced labor and a significant sector of small producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt; While most coffee is grown in the Soconusco, there are other areas which grow it including the municipalities of [[Oxchuc]], [[Pantheló]], [[El Bosque, Chiapas|El Bosque]], [[Tenejapa]], [[Chenalhó]], [[Larráinzar]], and [[Chalchihuitán]], with some six thousand producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;martineztorres&quot;/&gt; It also includes organic coffee producers with 18 million tons grown annually 60,000 producers. One third of these producers are indigenous women and other peasant farmers who grow the coffee under the shade of native trees without the use of agro chemicals. Some of this coffee is even grown in environmentally protected areas such as the El Triunfo reserve, where ejidos with 14,000 peple grow the coffee and sell it to cooperativers who sell it to companies such as [[Starbucks]], but the main market is Europe. Some growers have created cooperatives of their own to cut out the middleman.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cafeorganico&quot;/&gt;

Ranching occupies about three million hectares of natural and induced pasture, with about 52% of all pasture induced. Most livestock is done by families using traditional methods. Most important are meat and dairy cattle, followed by pigs and domestic fowl. These three account for 93% of the value of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt; Annual milk production in Chiapas totals about 180 million liters per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt; The state’s cattle production, along with timber from the Lacandon Jungle and energy output gives it a certain amount of economic clouts compared to other states in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt;

Forestry is mostly based on conifers and common tropical species producing 186,858 m3 per year at a value of 54,511,000 pesos. Exploited non-wood speces include the Camedor palm tree for its fronds. The fishing industry is underdeveloped but includes the capture of wild species as well as fish farming. Fish production is generated both from the ocean as well as the many freshwater rivers and lakes. In 2002, 28,582 tons of fish valued at 441.2 million pesos was produced. Species include [[tuna]], shark, shrimp, [[mojarra]] and crab.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt;

===Industry and energy===
The state’s abundant rivers and streams have been dammed to provide about fifty five percent of the country’s hydroelectric energy. Much of this is sent to other states accounting for over six percent of all of Mexico’s energy output.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo112113&quot;&gt;Hidalgo, p. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt; Main power stations are located at Malpaso, La Angostura, Chicoasén and Peñitas which produce about eight percent of Mexico’s hydroelectric energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; [[Chicoasén Dam|Manuel Moreno Torres plant]] on the Grijalva River the most productive in Mexico. All of the hydroelectric plants are owned and operated by the Federal Electricity Commission ([[Comisión Federal de Electricidad]], CFE),.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFE&quot; /&gt;

Chiapas is rich in petroleum reserves. Oil production began during the 1980s and Chiapas has become the fourth largest producer of crude oil and natural gas among the Mexican states.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; Many reserves are as of yet untapped, but between 1984 and 1992, PEMEX drilled nineteen oil wells in the Lacandona Jungle.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo112113&quot;/&gt; Currently, petroleum reserves are found in the municipalities of Juárez, [[Ostuacán]], [[Pichucalco]] and Reforma in the north of the state with 116 wells accounting for about 6.5% of the country’s oil production. It also provides about a quarter of the country’s natural gas. This production equals 222,964.000,000 cubic feet of natural gas and 17,565,000 barrels of oil per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt;

Industry is limted to small and micro enterprises and include auto parts, bottling, fruit packing, coffee and chocolate processing, production of [[lime (material)|lime]], bricks and other construction materials, sugar mills, furniture making, textiles, printing and the production of handcrafts. The two largest enterprises is the [[Comisión Federal de Electricidad]] and a [[Petróleos Mexicanos]] refinery.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt; Chiapas opened its first assembly plant in 2002, a fact that highlights the historical lack of industry in this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt;

===Handcrafts===
[[File:TextileStallSantoDomingoSanCris02.JPG|thumb|Textiles for sale at Santo Domingo in San Cristóbal]]
Chiapas is one the states that produces a wide variety of [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts and folk art in Mexico]]. One reason for this is its many indigenous ethnicities who produce traditional items out of identity as well as commercial reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones42&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; One commercial reason is the market for crafts provided by the tourism industry. Another is that most indigenous communities can no longer provide for their own needs through agriculture. The need to generate outside income has led to many indigenous women producing crafts communially, which has not only had economic benefits, it has also involved them in the political process as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt; Unlike many other states, Chiapas has a wide variety of wood resources such as [[cedar wood|cedar]] and [[mahogany]] as well as plant species such as reeds, [[ixtle]] and palm. It also has minerals such as [[obsidian]], [[amber]], [[jade]] and several types of clay and animals for the production of leather, dyes from various insects used to create the colors associated with the region. Items include various types of handcrafted clothing, dishes, jars, furniture, roof tiles, toys, musical instruments, tools and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones42&quot;/&gt;

Chiapas’ most important handcraft is [[Textiles of Mexico|textiles]], most of which is cloth weaved on a backstrap loom.&lt;ref name=&quot;artepopdes&quot;/&gt; Indigenous girls learn how to sew and embroider often before they learn how to speak Spanish. They are also taught how to make natural dyes from insects and weaving techniques. Many of the items produced are still for day to day use, often dyed in bright colors with intricate embroidery. They include skirts, belts, [[rebozo]]s, blouses, [[huipil]]s and shoulder wraps called chals. Designs are in red, yellow, turquoise blue, purple, pink, green and various pastels and decorated with designs such as flowers, butterflies, and birds, all based on local flora and fauna. Commercially, indigenous textiles are most often found in San Cristóbal de las Casas, San Juan Chamula and Zinacantán. The best textiles are considered to be from Magdalenas, Larráinzar, Venustiano Carranza and Sibaca.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones43&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PolishedAmberMuseumAmberSanCris03.JPG|thumb|Display of polished amber at the Museum of Amber]]
One of the main minerals of the state is [[amber]], much of which is 25 million years old, with quality comparable to that found in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Chiapan amber has a number of unique qualities, including much of which is clear all the way through and some with fossilized insects and plants. Most Chiapan amber is worked into jewelry including [[pendant]]s, rings and necklaces. Colors vary from white to yellow/orange to a deep red, but there are also some found with green and pink tones as well. Since pre Hispanic times, native peoples have believed amber to have healing and protective qualities. The largest amber mine is in Simojovel, a small village 130&amp;nbsp;km from Tuxtla Gutiérrez which produces 95% of Chiapas’ amber. Other mines are found in Huitiupán, Totolapa, El Bosque, Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán, Pantelhó and San Andrés Duraznal. According to the Museum of Amber in San Cristóbal, almost 300&amp;nbsp;kg of amber is extracted per month from the state. Prices vary depending on quality and color.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones43&quot;/&gt;

The major center for ceramics in the state is the city of [[Amatenango del Valle]], with its barro blanco (white clay) pottery.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones44&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The most traditional ceramic in Amatenango and Aguacatenango is a type of large jar called a [[cantaro]] used to transport water and other liquids.&lt;ref name=&quot;artepopdes&quot;/&gt; Many pieces created from this clay are ornamental as well as traditional pieces for everyday use such as comals, dishes, storage containers and flowerpots. All pieces here are made by hand using techniques that go back centuries. Other communities which produce ceramics include [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]], [[Tonalá, Chiapas|Tonalá]], [[Ocuilpa]], [[Suchiapa]] and San Cristóbal de las Casas.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones44&quot;/&gt;

Wood crafts in the state center on furniture, brightly painted sculptures and toys. The Tzotzils of San Juan de Chamula are known for their sculptures as well as for their study furniture. Sculptures are made from woods such as [[cedar wood|cedar]], [[mahogany]] and [[strawberry tree]]{{dn}}. Another town noted for their sculptures is [[Tecpatán]] . The making [[lacquer]] to use in the  decoration of wooden and other items goes back to the colonial period. The best known area for this type of work, called “laca” is Chiapa de Corzo, which has a museum dedicated to it. One reason this type of decoration became popular in the state was that it protected items from the constant humidity of the climate.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones44&quot;/&gt; Much of the laca in Chiapa de Corzo is made in the traditional way with natural pigments and sands to cover gourds, dipping spoons, chests, niches and furniture. It is also used to create the Parachicos masks.&lt;ref name=&quot;artepopdes&quot;/&gt;

Traditional Mexican toys, which have all but disappeared in the rest of Mexico are still readily found here and include the [[cajita de la serpiente]], [[yo yos]], [[ball in cup]] and more. Other wooden items include masks, cooking utensils, and tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones44&quot;/&gt; One famous toy is the “muñecos zapatistas” (Zapatista dolls) which are based on the revolutionary group that emerged in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;artepopdes&quot;/&gt;

===Tourism and general commerce/services===
[[File:LanchaBoatFronteraCorozal02.JPG|thumb|Lancha boats at the docks of Frontera Corozal, which mostly serves the nearby Yaxchilan archeological site]]
Ninety four percent of the state’s commercial outlets are small retail stores with about 6% wholesalers.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt; There are 111 [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal markets]], 55 [[tianguis]], three wholesale food markets and 173 large vendors of basic staple products.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt; The service sector is the most important to the economy, with mostly commerce, warehousing and tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt;

Tourism brings large numbers of visitors to the state each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt; Most of Chiapas’ tourism is based on its culture, colonial cities and ecology. The state has a total of 491 ranked hotels with 12,122 rooms. There are also 780 other establishments catering primarily to tourism, such as services and restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt; 

There are three main tourist routes, the Maya Route, the Colonial Route and the Coffee Route. The Maya Route runs along the border with [[Guatemala]] in the [[Lacandon Jungle]] and includes the sites of [[Palenque]], [[Bonampak]], [[Yaxchilan]] along with the natural attractions of [[Agua Azul|Agua Azul Waterfalls]], Misol-Há Waterfall, and the Catazajá Lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt; Palenque is the most important of these sites, and one of the most important tourist destinations in the state. Yaxchilan was a Mayan city along the [[Usumacinta River]] which developed between 350 and 810 CE and Bonampak is known for its well preserved murals. These Mayan sites have made the state an attraction for international tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonasarq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hisschmal&quot;/&gt; These sites contain a large number of structures, most of when back back thousands of years, especially to the sixth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonasarq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones12&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the sites on the Mayan Route, there are others within the state away from the border such as [[Toniná]], near the city of [[Ocosingo]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;zonasarq&quot;/&gt;
[[File:RealdeGuadalupeEastSanCris.JPG|thumb|Real de Guadalupe Street in San Cristobal de las Casas]]
The Colonial Route is mostly in the central highlands of the state with a significant number of churches, monasteries and other structures from the colonial period along with some from later, such as the 19th century and even into the early 20th.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones12&quot;/&gt; The most important city on this route is [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], located in the Los Altos region in the Jovel Valley. The historic center of the city is filled with tiled roofs, patios with flowers, balconies, [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] facades along with [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] designs. It is centered on a main plaza surrouned by the cathedral, the municipal palace, the Portales commercial area and the San Nicolás church. In addition, it has museums dedicated to the state’s indigenous cultures, one to amber and one to jade, both of which have been mined in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciudadescol&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chiapas.gob.mx/ciudades-coloniales |title= Ciudades coloniales |publisher= State of Chiapas |location=Chiapas, Mexico |language=Spanish |date= March 2, 2011 |trans_title=Location |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attractions along this route include [[Comitán de Dominguéz]] and [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]], along with small indigenous communities such as [[Chamula|San Juan Chamula]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones12&quot;/&gt; The state capital of [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]] does not have many colonial era structures left, but it lies near the areas most famous natural attraction of the [[Sumidero Canyon]]. This canyon is popular with tourists who take boat tours into it on the [[Grijalva River]] to see such features such as caves (La Cueva del Hombre, La Cueva del Silencio) and the Christmas Tree, which is a rock and plant formation on the side of one of the canyon walls created by a seasonal waterfall.&lt;ref name=&quot;aventuragob&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccultur&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_chiapas |title= Atractivos Culturales y Turísticos |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México

The Coffee Route begins in [[Tapachula]] and follows a mountainous road into the Suconusco regopm. The route passes through [[Port of Chiapas|Puerto Chiapas]], a port with modern infrastructure for shipping exports and receiving international cruises.&lt;ref name=&quot;abianco&quot;/&gt;  The route visits a number of coffee plantations, such as Hamburgo, Chiripa, Violetas, Santa Rita, Lindavista, Perú-París, San Antonio Chicarras and Rancho Alegre. These haciendas provide visitors with the opportunity to see how coffee is grown and initually processed on these farms. They also offer a number of ecotourism activities such as mountain climbing, rafting, rapelling and mountain biking.  There are also tours into the jungle vegetation and the [[Volcán Tacaná|Tacaná Volcano]]. In addition to coffee, the region also produces most of Chiapas’ soybeans, bananas and cacao.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoussaint&quot;/&gt;

The state has a large number of ecological attractions most of which are connected to water. The main beaches on the coastline include [[Puerto Arista]], [[Boca del Cielo]], Playa Linda, Playa Aventuras, Playa Azul and Santa Brigida.&lt;ref name=&quot;acteconom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;solplaya&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chiapas.gob.mx/sol-y-playa |title= Sol y playa |publisher= State of Chiapas |location=Chiapas, Mexico |language=Spanish |date= March 2, 2011 |trans_title=Sun and beach |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are based on the states lakes and rivers. Laguna Verde is a lake in the Coapilla municipality. The lake is generally green but its tones constantly change through the day depending on how the sun strikes it. In the early morning and evening hours there can also be blue and ochre tones as well. The El Chiflón Waterfall is part of a ecotourism center located in a valley with reeds, sugarcane, mountains and rainforest. It is formed by the San Vicente River and has pools of water at the botton which allow for swimming. The Las Nubes Ecotourism center is located in the Las Margaritas municipality near the Guatemalan border. The area features a number of turquoise blue waterfalls with bridges and lookout points set up to see them up close.&lt;ref name=&quot;aventuragob&quot;/&gt;

Still others are based on conservation, local culture and other features.The Las Guacamayas Ecotourism Center is located in the [[Lacandon Jungle]] on the edge of the Montes Azules reserve. It is centered on the conservation of the red [[macaw]] which is in danger of extinction. The Tziscao Ecotourism Center is centered on a lake with various tones. It is located inside the Lagos de Montebello National Park, with kayaking, mountain biking and archery. [[Lacanjá Chansayab]] is located in the interior of the Lacandon Jungle and a major Lacandon people community. It has some activities associated with ecotourism such as mountain biking, hiking and cabins. The Grutas de Rancho Nuevo Ecotourism Center is centered on a set of caves in which appear capricious forms of stalagmite and stalactites.  There is also horseback riding as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;aventuragob&quot;/&gt;

==Culture==
===Architecture===
Architecture in the state begins with the archeological sites of the Mayans and other groups which would establish color schemes and other details which would find their way into later structures. After the Spanish subdued the area, the building of Spanish style cities began, especially in the highland areas. Many of the colonial era buildings area related to [[Dominicans]] who came from Seville. This Spanish city had much [[Moorish architecture|Arabic influence in its architecture]]. This Arabic influence was transferred to form part of the colonial architecture in Chiapas, especially for structures dating from the 16th to 18th centuries. However, there are a number of architectural styles and influences present in Chiapas colonial structures, including colors and patterns from [[Oaxaca]] and [[Central America]] along with indigenous ones from Chiapas. The main colonial structures are the cathedral and Santo Domingo church of San Cristóbal, the Santo Domingo monastery and La Pila in Chiapa de Corzo. The San Cristóbal cathedral has a Baroque facade which was begun in the 16th century but by the time it was finished in the 17th, it had a mix of Spanish, Arabic, and indigenous influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones13&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most elaborately decorated in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones14&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The churches and former monasteries of Santo Domingo, La Merced and San Francisco have ornamentation similar to that of the cathedral. The main structures in Chiapa de Corzo are the Santo Domingo monastery and the La Pila fountain. Santo Domingo has indigenous decorative details such as double headed eagles as well as a statue of the founding monk. In San Cristóbal, the Diego de Mazariegos house has a [[Plateresque]] facade, while that of Francisco de Montejo, built later in the 18th century has a mix of Baroque and Neoclassical. [[Art Deco]] structures can be found in San Cristóbal and Tapachula in public buildings as well as a number of rural coffee plantations from the [[Porfirio Díaz]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones14&quot;/&gt;

===Art and literature===
[[File:Jaime-sabines-2.jpg|thumb|Jaime Sabines]]
Art in Chiapas is based on the use of color and has strong indigenous influence. This dates back to cave paintings such as those found in La Sima de las Cotorras near [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]] and the caverns of Rancho Nuevo where human remains and offerings were also found. The best known pre Hispanic artwork is the Maya murals of Bonampak, which are the only [[Mesoamerica]]n murals to have been preserved for over 1500 years. In general, Mayan artwork stands out for its precise depiction of faces and its narrative form. Indigenous forms derive from this background and continue into the colonial period with the use of indigenous color schemes in churches and into modern structrures such as the municipal palace in [[Tapachula]]. Since the colonial period, the state has produced a large number of painter and sculptures. Those which stand out from the 20th century include [[Lázaro Gómez]], [[Ramiro Jiménez Chacón]], [[Héctor Ventura Cruz]], [[Máximo Prado Pozo]] and [[Gabriel Gallegos Ramos]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1416&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two best known poets from the state include [[Jaime Sabines]] and [[Rosario Castellanos]], both from prominent Chiapan families. The first was a merchant and diplomat and the second was a teacher, diplomat, theatre director and the director of the Instituto Nacional Indigenista.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones16&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Jaime Sabines is widely regarded as Mexico’s most influential contemporary poet. His work celebrates everyday people in common settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt;

===Music===
The most important instrument in the state is the [[marimba]]. In the pre Hispanic period, indigenous peoples had already been producing music with wooden instruments. The marimba was introduced by African slaves brought to Chiapas by the Spanish. However, it achieved its widespread popularity in the early 20th century due to the formation of the Cuarteto Marimbistico de los Hermanos Gómez in 1918, who popularized the instrument and the popular music they play not only in Chiapas but in various parts of Mexico and into the United States. Along with Cuban Juan Arozamena, they composed the piece “Las chiapanecas” considered to be the unofficial anthem of the state. In the 1940s, they were also featured in a number of Mexican films.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones18&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Marimbas are constructed in Venustiano Carranza, Chiapas de Corzo and Tuxtla Gutiérrez.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccultur&quot;/&gt;

===Cuisine===
Like the rest of [[Mesoamerica]], the basic diet has been based on corn and Chiapas cooking retains strong indigenous influence. One important ingrediatnt is [[Crotalaria|chipilin]], a fragrant and strongly flavored herb and [[hoja santa]], the large anise-scented leaves used in much of southern Mexican cuisine.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsantos&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Santos Pruneda |first=Beatriz |year=2008 |month=October |title= Chiapas, el sueño de los trotamundos de buen apetito |trans_title=Chiapas, the dream of globetrotters with good appetite |journal=Mexico Desconocido |volume=380 |pages=58–66 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Grupo Editorial Impresiones Aereas |language=Spanish |issn=1870-9397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2081-the-cuisine-of-chiapas-dining-in-mexico-s-last-frontier |title= The Cuisine of Chiapas: Dining in Mexico's Last Frontier |first= Karen  |last=Hursh Graber |year=2008 |publisher=MexConnect newsletter  |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chiapan dishes do not incorporate many chili peppers as part of their dishes. Rather, chili peppers are most often found in the condiments. One reason for that is that a local chili pepper, called the simojovel, is far too hot to use except very sparingly. Chiapan cuisine tends to rely more on slightly sweet seasonings in their main dishes such as cinnamon, [[plantain]]s, prunes and pineapple are often found in meat and poultry dishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt;

[[Tamale]]s are a major part of the diet and often include chipilín mixed into the dough and hoja santa which can be within the tamale itself or used to wrap it. One tamale native to the state is the “picte,” a fresh sweet corn tamale.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsantos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt; Tamales juacanes are filled with a mixture of black beans, dried shrimp and pumpkin seeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt;

Meats are centered on the European introduced beef, pork and chicken as many native game animals are in danger of extinction. Meat dishes are frequently accompanied by vegetables such as squash, [[chayote]] and carrots. Black beans are the favored type. Beef is favored, especially a thin cut called [[tasajo]] usually served in a sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt; Pepita con tasajo is a common dish at festivals especially in Chiapa de Corzo. It consists of a squash seed based sauced over reconstituted and shredded dried beef.  As a cattle raising area, beef dishes in Palenque are particularly good. Pux-Xaxé is a stew with beef organ meats and [[Mole (sauce)|mole sauce]] made with tomato, chili bolita and corn flour.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsantos&quot;/&gt;  Tzispolá is a beef broth with chunks of meat, chickpeas, cabbage and various types of chili peppers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt; Pork dishes include cochito, which is pork in an [[adobo]] sauce. In Chiapa de Corzo, their vesion is cochito horneado, which is a roast suckling pig flavored with adobo.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsantos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt;  Seafood is a strong component in many dishes along the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt;  Turula is dried shrimp with tomatoes. Sausages, ham and other cold cuts are most often made and consumed in the highlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsantos&quot;/&gt;
[[File:TaxcalatePalenque.JPG|thumb|175px|Drink called taxcalate]]
In addition to meat dishes, there is chirmol, a cooked tomato sauced flavored with chili pepper, onion and cilantro and zats, a butterfly caterpillar found in the Altos de Chiapas which are boiled in salted water, then sautéed in [[lard]] and eaten with tortillas, limes and green chili pepper. Sopa de pan consists of layers of bread and vegetables covered with a broth seasoned with saffron and other flavorings.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsantos&quot;/&gt; In Comitán, one speciality is [[hearts of palm]] salad in [[vinaigrette]] and Palenque is known for many versions of fried plaintains, including filled with black beans or cheese.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt;

Cheese making is important especially in the municipalities of Ocosingo, Rayon and Pijijiapan. Ocosingo has its own self-named variety, which is shipped to restaurants and gourmet shops in various parts of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt; Regional sweets include crystallized fruit, coconut candies, flan and [[compote]]s. San Cristobal is noted for its sweets, as well as chocolates, coffee and baked goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt;

While Chiapas is known for good coffee, there are a number of other local beverages. The oldest is [[pozol]], originally the name for a fermented corn dough. This dough has its origins in the pre Hispanic period. To make the beverage, the dough is dissolved in water and usually flavored with cocoa and sugar, but sometimes it is left to ferment further. It is then served very cold with lots of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsantos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chicuisine&quot;/&gt; Taxcalate is a drink made from a powder of toasted corn, [[achiote]], cinnamon and sugar prepared with milk or water. Pumbo is a beverage made with pineapple, club soda, vodka, sugar syrup and lots of ice. Posh is a drink distilled from sugar cane.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsantos&quot;/&gt;

==Religion==
Like in the rest of Mexico, Christianity was imposed on the native population by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s. Catholic beliefs were mixed with indigenous ones to form what is now called “traditionalist” Catholic belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;relmix&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Chiapas, Mexico Offers Ancient, Modern Religion Mix |url= http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-08-03-voa12-68756032.html |newspaper=Voice of America |date=August 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de Las Casas|Diocese of Chiapas]] comprises almost the entire state, and centered on San Cristobal de las Casas. It was founded in 1538 by [[Pope Paul III]] to evangelize the area with its most famous bishop of that time [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]. Evangelization focused on grouping indigenous peoples into communities centered on a church. This bishop not only had these people evangelized in their own language, he worked to introduced many of the crafts still practiced today.&lt;ref name=&quot;cathenc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03652b.htm |title= Chiapas |author=Kevin Knight |year=2009 |work=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While still a majority, only fifty eight percent of Chiapas residents profess the Catholic faith as of 2010, comparted to 83% of the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;inegidiv&quot;/&gt;  

Many indigenous people mix Christianity with Indian beliefs.  One particular area where this is strong is the central highlands in small communities such as San Juan Chamula. In one church in San Cristobal, Mayan rites including the sacrifice of animals is permitted inside the church to ask for good health or to “ward off the evil eye.”&lt;ref name=&quot;relmix&quot;/&gt;

Starting in the 1970s, there has been a shift away from traditional Catholic affiliation to Protestant, Evangelical and other Christian sects. [[Presbyterians]] and [[Pentacostals]] attracted a large number of converts, with percentages of Protestants in the state rising from five percent in 1970 to twenty one percent in 2000. This shift has had a political component as well, with those making the switch tending to identify across ethnic boundaries, especially across indigenus ethnic boundaries and being against the traditional power structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mhidalgo108&quot;/&gt;

To counter this, the Diocese of Chiapas began to actively re-evangelize among the indigenous populations, and working on their behalf politically as well, following an ideology called [[liberation theology]]. Those attracted by this movement call themselves “Word of God” Catholics and identify directly with the Diocese, rather than with local Catholic authorities. Both Protestants and Word of God Catholics tend to oppose traditional cacique leadership and often worked to prohibit the sale of alcohol. The latter had the effect of attracting many women to both movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt;

The growing number of Protestants, Evangelicals and Word of God Catholics challenging traditional authority has caused religious strife in a number of indigenous communities. Tensions have been strong, at times, especially in rural areas such as San Juan Chamula.   Tensions among the groups reached its peak in the 1990s with a large number of people injured during open clashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;relmix&quot;/&gt; In the 1970s, caciques began to expel dissidents from their communities for challenging their power, initially with the use of violence. By 2000, more than 20,000 people had been displaced, but state and federal authorities did not act to stop the expulsions.&lt;ref name=&quot;kovic&quot;/&gt; Today, the situation has quieted but the tension remains, especially in very isolated communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;relmix&quot;/&gt;

==Archeology==
The largest and best known archeological sites in Chiapas belong to the Mayan civilization. Apart from a few works by [[Franciscan]] friars, knowledge of Maya civilisation largely disappeared after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]]. In the mid 19th century, [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] traveled though the sites in Chiapas and other Mayan areas and published their writings and illustrations. This led to serious work on the culture including the deciphering of its hieroglyphic writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett32&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chiapas, principle Mayan sites include [[Palenque]], [[Toniná]], [[Bonampak]], [[Chinkoltic]] and [[Tenam Puentes]], all or near in the [[Lacandon Jungle]]. They are technically more advanced than earlier [[Olmec]] sites, which can best be seen in the detailed sculping and novel construction techniques, including structures of four stories in height. Mayan sites not only noted for their large number of structures but also for glyphs, other inscriptions and artwork which has allowed for a relatively complete history of many of the sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones13&quot;/&gt;

The most important Mayan and archeological site is Palenque. Although much smaller than the huge sites at [[Tikal]] or [[Copán]], Palenque contains some of the finest architecture, sculpture and [[stucco]] reliefs the Mayans ever produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt; The history of the Palenque site begins in 431 with its height under Pakal I (615-683), Chan-Bahlum II (684-702) and Kan-Xul who reigned between 702 and 721. However, the power of Palenque would be lost by the end of the century. Pakal’s tomb was not discovered inside the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] until 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett36&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Palenque is a [[World Heritage Site]] and one of the best known sites in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonasarq&quot;/&gt;

Yaxchilan flourished in the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett34&quot;&gt;Hamnett, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The site contains impressive ruins, with palaces and temples bordering a large plaza upon a terrace above the Usumacinta River.&lt;ref name=ST435 /&gt; The architectural remains extend across the higher terraces and the hills to the south of the river, overlooking both the river itself and the lowlands beyond.&lt;ref name=&quot;ST435&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author={{aut|Sharer, Robert J.}} |authorlink=Robert Sharer|coauthors=with {{aut|Loa P.

The city of Bonampak features some of the finest remaining Maya murals. The realistically rendered paintings depict human sacrifices, musicians and scenes of the royal court.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycom&quot;/&gt; In fact the name means “painted murals.” It is centered on a large plaza and has a stairway that leads to the Acropolis. There are also a number of notable steles.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonasarq&quot;/&gt;

Toniná is near the city of [[Ocosingo]] with its main features being the Casa de Piedra (House of Stone) and Acropolis. The latter is a series of seven platforms with various temples and steles. This site was a ceremonial center which flourished between 600 and 900 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonasarq&quot;/&gt;

While the Mayan sites are the best known, there are a number of other important sites in the state, including many which are older than the Maya civilization. These sites include [[Tapachula]] and [[Tepactan]], [[Pijijiapan]]a nd [[Izapa]] found in the [[Soconusco]] region. These sites contain numerous embankments and foundations on which rested pyramids and other buildings. Some of these buildings have disappeared and others have been covered by jungle for about 3,000 years, unexplored. Pijijiapan and Izapa are on the Pacific coast and were the most important pre Hispanic cities for about 1,000 years, as the most important commercial centers between the [[Mexican Plateau]] and Central America.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1213&quot;&gt;Jiménez González, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Sima de las Cotorras is a cave ninety metera deep with a diameter of 160 meters in the municipality of [[Ocozocoautla]]. It contains cave paintings depicting warriors, animals and more. It is best known as a breeding area for parrots, thousands of which leave the area at once at sunrise and sunset.&lt;ref name=&quot;aventuragob&quot;/&gt; The state as its Museo Regional de Antropologia e Historia located in Tuxtla Gutiérrez focusing on the pre Hispanic peoples of the state with a room dedicated to its history from the colonial period.&lt;ref name=&quot;atraccultur&quot;/&gt;

==Education==
The average number of years of schooling is 6.7, which is the beginning of middle school, compared to the Mexico average of 8.6. 16.5% have no schooling at all, 59.6% have only primary school/secondary school, 13.7% finish high school or technical school and 9.8 go to university. Eighteen out of every 100 people cannot read or write, compared to 8/10 nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;inegiedu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/chis/poblacion/educacion.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=07|title= Educación |publisher=[[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Education |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Chiapas’ illiterate population are indigenous women, who are often prevented from going to school. School absenteeism and dropout rates are highest among indigenous girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultwomen&quot;/&gt;

There are an estimated 1.4 million students in the state from preschool on up. The state has about 61,000 teachers and just over 17,000 centers of educations. Preschool and primary schools are divided into modalities called general, indigenous, private and community educations sponsored by CONAFE. Middle school is divided into technical, telesecundaria (distance education) and classes for working adults. About 98% of the student population of the state is in state schools. Higher levels of education include “professional medio” (vocational training), general high school  and technology-focused high school. At this level 89% of students are in public schools. There are 105 universities and similar institutions with 58 public and 47 private serving over 60,500 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt;

The state university is the [[Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas]] (UNACH). It was begun when an organization to establish a state level institution was formed in 1965, with the university itself opening its doors ten years later in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones35&quot;/&gt; The university project was partially supported by [[UNESCO]] in Mexico. It integrated older schools such as the Escuela de Derecho (Law School) which has its origins from 1679 as well as the Escuela de Ingeniería Civil (School of Civil Engineering) founded in 1966 and the Escuela de Commerico y Administración which was located in Tuxtla Gutiérrez.&lt;ref name=&quot;hisuchiapas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unach.mx/antecedentes.html |title= La creación de la UNACH |publisher= Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas |location=Chiapas |language=Spanish |trans_title=The creation of UNACH |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Puertochis1.JPG|thumb|View of Puerto Chiapas]]
The state has approximately 22,517&amp;nbsp;km of highway with 10,857 federally maintained and 11,660 maintained by the state. Almost all of these kilometers are paved. Major highways include the Las Choapas-Raudales-Ocozocoautla, which links the state to Oaxaca, Veracruz, Puebla and Mexico City. Major airports include Llano San Juan in Ocozocoautla, Francisco Sarabia in Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Corazón de María in San Cristóbal. These are used for domestic flights with the airports in Palenque and Tapachula providing international service into Guatemala. There are 22 other airfields in twelve other municipalities. Rail lines extend over 547.8&amp;nbsp;km. There are two major lines, one in the north of the state linking the center and southeast of the country and the Costa Panamericana route which runs from Oaxaca to the Guatemalan border.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt;

There are thirty six AM radio stations and sixteen FM stations. There are thirty seven local television stations and sixty six repeaters.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt;

Chiapas’ main port is just outside the city of Tapachula called the [[Port of Chiapas|Puerto Chiapas]]. It faces 3,361 meters of ocean, with 3,060m2 of warehouse space. Next to it, there is an industrial park which covers a surface area of 2,340,000m2.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt; Puerto Chiapas has 60,000 m2 of area with a capacity to receive 1,800 containers as well as refrigerated containers.&lt;ref name=&quot;exportacion&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title= Puerto Chiapas realiza operaciones de exportación |publisher= Administración Portuaria Integral de Puerto Madero, SA de CV |date=February 18, 2011 |url= http://www.puertochiapas.com.mx/noticias/12-noticias/186  |language=Spanish |trans_title=Puerto Chiapas realizes export operations |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The port serves the state of Chiapas and northern Guatemala.&lt;ref name=&quot;hinterland&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.puertochiapas.com.mx/acerca-hinterland-y-foreland |title= Hinterland y Foreland |publisher= Administración Portuaria Integral de Puerto Madero, SA de CV |date= August 3, 2010 |location=Chiapas |language=Spanish |trans_title=Hinterland and foreland |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Chiapas serves to import and export products across the Pacific to Asia, the United States, Canada and [[South America]].

Principle exports through the port include banana and banana trees, corn, fertilizer and tuna.&lt;ref name=&quot;seconsolida&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title= Puerto Chiapas se consolida en el sector turístico y carga |publisher= Administración Portuaria Integral de Puerto Madero, SA de CV |date=March 29, 2011 |url= http://www.puertochiapas.com.mx/noticias/12-noticias/187 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Puerto Chiapas consolidates its tourism and cargo sectors |accessdate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The state has a professional soccer team called the [[Jaguares de Chiapas|Jaguars]]. This team made Mexico’s primary division in 2002. The team changed its symbol and colors to orange and black in 2010. It participated in the [[Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores de América]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;clubhis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.soyjaguar.com/pagina.php?sec=club&amp;sub=historia |title= Historia  |publisher= Club de Futbol de Chiapas  |location=Chiapas |language=Spanish |trans_title=History |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler Building''' is an [[Art Deco]] [[skyscraper]] in [[New York City]], located on the east side of [[Manhattan]] in the [[Turtle Bay, Manhattan|Turtle Bay]] area at the intersection of [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]]. Standing at {{Convert|319|m|ft|0|sp=us}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Map&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.turtlebay-nyc.org/map.html Map].&quot; ''[[Turtle Bay, Manhattan|Turtle Bay Association]]''.

After the [[September 11 attacks|destruction]] of the [[World Trade Center]], it was again the second-tallest building in New York City until December 2007, when the [[spire]] was raised on the {{Convert|365.8|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Bank of America Tower (New York)|Bank of America Tower]], pushing the Chrysler Building into third position. In addition, [[The New York Times Building]], which opened in 2007, is exactly level with the Chrysler Building in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/?id=101028 |title=Emporis Data – See Tallest buildings Ranking |publisher=Emporis.com |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chrysler Building is a classic example of Art Deco architecture and considered by many contemporary architects to be [[#Recognition and appeal|one of the finest buildings in New York City]]. In 2007, it was ranked ninth on the ''[[List of America's Favorite Architecture according to the AIA|List of America's Favorite Architecture]]'' by the [[American Institute of Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://favoritearchitecture.org/afa150.php |title=FavoriteArchitecture.org |publisher=FavoriteArchitecture.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the headquarters of the [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] from 1930 until the mid-1950s, but, although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for the construction of it and never owned it, as [[Walter P. Chrysler]] decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.&lt;ref name=&quot;jayebee.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayebee.com/discoveries/criticism/silver_spire.htm|title=How two men's dreams changed the skyline of New York}}  - Article in The New Yorker November 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Chrysler Building Midtown Manhattan New York City 1932.jpg|thumb|left|The Chrysler Building in 1932]]

[[File:ChryslerBuildingMidtownManhattanNewYorkCity.jpg|thumb|left|Chrysler Building and eastern Midtown Manhattan]]

The Chrysler Building was designed by architect [[William Van Alen]] for a project of [[Walter P. Chrysler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jayebee.com&quot;/&gt; When the ground breaking occurred on September 19, 1928, there was an intense competition in [[New York City]] to build the world's tallest skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emporis GmbH |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=115941 |title=Emporis Data &quot;...a celebrated three-way race to become the tallest building in the world.&quot; |publisher=Emporis.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscraper.org/TALLEST_TOWERS/t_manco.htm |title=The Manhattan Company – Skyscraper.org; &quot;...'race' to erect the tallest tower in the world.&quot; |publisher=Skyscraper.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a frantic pace (the building was built at an average rate of four floors per week), no workers died during the construction of this skyscraper.&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt;

=== Design beginnings ===

Van Alen's original design for the skyscraper called for a decorative jewel-like glass crown. It also featured a base in which the showroom windows were tripled in height and topped by 12 stories with glass-wrapped corners, creating an impression that the tower appeared physically and visually light as if floating in mid-air.&lt;ref name=&quot;jayebee.com&quot;/&gt; The height of the skyscraper was also originally designed to be {{Convert|246|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=Chrysler123&gt;[http://ecow.engr.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/getbig/cee/340/davidcamac/studentsbu/chryslerbuilding.ppt University of Wisconsin–Madison; School of Engineering – The Chrysler Building]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the design proved to be too advanced and costly for building contractor William H. Reynolds, who disapproved of Van Alen's original plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emporis GmbH |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=114867 |title=– Chrysler Building |publisher=Emporis.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and lease were then sold to [[Walter P. Chrysler]], who worked with Van Alen and redesigned the skyscraper for additional stories; it was eventually revised to be {{Convert|282|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt; As Walter Chrysler was the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation and intended to make the building into Chrysler's headquarters,&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt; various architectural details and especially the building's gargoyles were modeled after Chrysler automobile products like the hood ornaments of the Plymouth; they exemplify the machine age in the 1920s (''[[Chrysler Building#Architecture|see below]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler Building|url=http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail.php?ID=436|publisher=glasssteelandstone.com|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emporis Data&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===

Construction commenced on September 19, 1928.&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt; In total, almost 400,000 rivets were used&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt; and approximately 3,826,000 bricks were manually laid, to create the non-loadbearing walls of the skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;The Chrysler Building, Creating a New York icon, day by day. Pages 54, 158, image caption no.39 ISBN 1-56898-354-9&lt;/ref&gt; Contractors, builders and engineers were joined by other building-services experts to coordinate construction.

Prior to its completion, the building stood about even with a rival project at [[40 Wall Street]], designed by [[H. Craig Severance]]. Severance increased the height of his project and then publicly claimed the title of the world's tallest building&lt;ref&gt;Emporis Data – See source no.4 line 4; &quot;Briefly held the world's tallest title until it was eclipsed by the spire of Chrysler Building.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (this distinction excluded structures that were not fully habitable, such as the [[Eiffel Tower]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctbuh.org/Default.aspx?tabid=93 CTBUH – Criteria of World's Tallest Building]&lt;/ref&gt;). In response, Van Alen obtained permission for a {{Convert|38|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} long spire&lt;ref&gt;The Chrysler Building, Creating a New York icon, day by day. Page 161. Image caption no.39 – ISBN 1-56898-354-9&lt;/ref&gt; and had it secretly constructed inside the frame of the building. The spire was delivered to the site in four different sections.&lt;ref&gt;The Chrysler Building, Creating a New York icon, day by day. Page 161, image caption no.54 ISBN 1-56898-354-9&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 1929, the bottom section of the spire was hoisted onto the top of the building's dome and lowered into the 66th floor of the building. The other remaining sections of the spire were hoisted and riveted to the first one in sequential order in just 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;The Chrysler Building, Creating a New York icon, day by day. Pages xiii (Paragraph 10) and 161. Image caption no.39 – ISBN 1-56898-354-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Completion ===

Upon completion, May 20, 1930,&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt; the added height of the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass [[40 Wall Street]] as the tallest building in the world and the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure. It was the first man-made structure to stand taller than {{Convert|1000|ft|m|0}}. Van Alen's satisfaction in these accomplishments was likely muted by [[Walter Chrysler]]'s later refusal to pay the balance of his architectural fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;jayebee.com&quot;/&gt; Less than a year after it opened to the public on May 27, 1931, the Chrysler Building was surpassed in height by the [[Empire State Building]], but the Chrysler Building is still the world's tallest steel-supported brick building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:SRQKFAkVG70J:www.skyscraperpicture.com/chryslerbuilding.htm+%22tallest+brick+building%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6 |title=The World's Tallest Brick Building – SkyscraperPicture.com |publisher=72.14.235.104 |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:sy5pqYA6GSEJ:www.tqnyc.com/NYC062905/chrysler_index.html+%22tallest+brick+building%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=7 |title=A view from Above – The Chrysler Building |publisher=72.14.235.104 |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property ===
The east building wall of the base out of which the tower rises runs at a slant to the Manhattan street grid, following a property line that predated the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Kevin Walsh, ''Forgotten New York: The Ultimate Urban Explorer's Guide to All Five Boroughs'', 2006:171.&lt;/ref&gt; The land on which the Chrysler Building stands was donated to [[Cooper Union|The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art]],&lt;ref name=CooperUnion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooper.edu/cubuilds/news_20040818.html |title=Cooper Union and Chrysler Building |publisher=Cooper.edu |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a private college that offers every admitted student a full tuition scholarship, in 1902. The land was originally leased to William H. Reynolds, but, when he was unable to raise money for the project, the building and the rights to the land were acquired by Walter P. Chrysler in 1928.&lt;ref name=CooperUnion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Smart Land Deals as a Cornerstone of Free Tuition |first=Alison |last=Gregor |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/business/13cooper.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the Chrysler Corporation was never involved in the construction or ownership of the Chrysler Building, although it was built and designed for the corporation and served as its headquarters until the mid-1950s. It was a project of Walter P. Chrysler for his children.&lt;ref name=&quot;jayebee.com&quot;/&gt;

The ownership of the building has changed several times. The Chrysler family sold the building in 1947, and in 1957 it was purchased by real-estate moguls Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo, and owned by [[Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company]]. The lobby was refurbished and the facade renovated in 1978–1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050619/news_mz1h19chrysl.html|title=An enduring hood ornament}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was owned by [[Jack Kent Cooke]], a [[Washington, D.C.]] investor, in 1979. The spire underwent a restoration that was completed in 1995. In 1998, [[Tishman Speyer Properties]] and the [[Travelers Companies|Travelers Insurance Group]] bought the Chrysler Building, at 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue, and the adjoining Kent Building in 1997 for about $220 million from a consortium of banks and the estate of Jack Kent Cooke. Tishman Speyer Properties had negotiated a 150 year lease on the land from Cooper Union and the college owns both the land under the Chrysler Building and the building itself. Cooper Union's name is on the deed.

In 2001, a 75% stake in the building was sold, for US$ 300 million, to TMW, the German arm of an [[Atlanta]]-based investment fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E7DB133BF936A35750C0A9679C8B63 |title=German Group Buys Stake In Skyscraper |work=The New York Times |first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |date=March 5, 2001 |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 2008 it was reported that the [[Abu Dhabi]] Investment Council was in negotiations to buy TMW's 75% economic interest, and a 15% interest from Tishman Speyer Properties in the building, and a share of the Trylons retail structure next door for US$ 800 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06112008/business/chrysler_bldg__on_the_block_115016.html|title=CHRYSLER BUILDING ON THE BLOCK - SOVEREIGN ARAB FUND TO PAY $800M}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2008 it was announced that the transaction had been completed, and that the [[Abu Dhabi Investment Council]] was now the 90% owner of the building.&lt;ref name = &quot;NYT-Bagley-2008-07-10&quot;&gt;

== Architecture ==

[[Image:Chrysler Building detail.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the Art Deco ornamentation at the crown]]

The Chrysler Building is considered a masterpiece of [[Art Deco]] architecture. The distinctive ornamentation of the building is based on features that were then being used on Chrysler automobiles. The corners of the 61st floor are graced with eagles, replicas of the 1929 Chrysler hood ornaments;&lt;ref&gt;[http://altura.speedera.net/ccimg.catalogcity.com/220000/225900/225955/Products/9481499.jpg Unaccredited image]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the 31st floor, the corner ornamentation are replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1926/building/Cap.htm |title=1926 Chrysler Radiator Cap Used On The Chrysler Building |publisher=Imperialclub.com |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is constructed of masonry, with a steel frame, and metal cladding. In total, the building currently contains 3,862 windows on its facade and 4 banks of 8 elevators designed by the [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis Elevator Corporation]].&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt; The building was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhlsum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/76001237.pdf|format=PDF|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Chrysler Building|author=Carolyn Pitts|date=August, 1976|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-05-03|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} and {{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Photos/76001237.pdf ''Accompanying 1 photo, exterior, undated'']|164&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crown ornamentation ===

The Chrysler Building is also well renowned and recognized for its terraced crown. Composed of seven radiating terraced arches, Van Alen's design of the crown is a cruciform [[groin vault]] constructed into seven concentric members with transitioning setbacks, mounted up one behind another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityreview.com/chryslerb.html |title=The City Review.com – Chrysler Building by AIA Carter B. Horsley |publisher=Thecityreview.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stainless-steel cladding is ribbed and riveted in a radiating [[sunburst]] pattern with many triangular vaulted windows, transitioning into smaller segments of the seven narrow setbacks of the facade of the terraced crown. The entire crown is clad with silvery &quot;Enduro KA-2&quot; metal, an [[austenitic]] [[stainless steel]] developed in [[Germany]] by [[Krupp]] and marketed under the [[trade name]] &quot;Nirosta&quot; (a German [[acronym]] for '''''ni'''cht'''ro'''stender '''Sta'''hl'', meaning &quot;non-rusting steel&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;jayebee.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bssa.org.uk/topics.php?article=82 |title=Article: Trade names associated with stainless steels |publisher=Bssa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crown usage ===

When the building first opened, it contained a public [[Observation deck|viewing gallery]] on the 71st floor, which was closed to the public in 1945. This floor is now the highest-occupied floor, most recently{{when|date=January 2011}} occupied by an office space management firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michaelis |first=David |url=http://www.mrbellersneighborhood.com/story.php?storyid=114 |title=Inside the Needle: The Chrysler Building Gets Lit by David Michaelis |publisher=MrBellersNeighborhood |date=2002-03-31 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private [[Cloud Club]] occupied a three-floor high space from the 66th–68th floors, but closed in the late 1970s. Above the 71st floor, the stories of the building are designed mostly for exterior appearance, functioning mainly as landings for the stairway to the spire. Very narrow with low, sloped ceilings, these top stories are useful only for holding radio-broadcasting and other mechanical and electrical equipment.&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt;
Television station [[WCBS-TV]] (Channel 2) originally transmitted from the top of the Chrysler in the 1940s and early 1950s, before moving to the Empire State Building.&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt; For many years, [[WPAT-FM]] and [[WKTU|WTFM (now WKTU)]] also used the Chrysler Building as a transmission site, but they also moved to the Empire by the 1970s. There are currently no commercial broadcast stations located at the Chrysler Building.

=== Lighting ===

There are two sets of lighting in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows the top of the building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. This lighting was installed by electrician Charles Londner and crew during construction.&lt;ref name=Chrysler123/&gt;

=== Recognition and appeal ===

In more recent years, the Chrysler Building has continued to be a favorite among New Yorkers. In the summer of 2005, New York's own [[Skyscraper Museum]] asked one hundred architects, builders, critics, engineers, historians, and scholars, among others, to choose their 10 favorites among 25 New York towers. The Chrysler Building came in first place as 90% of them placed the building in their top-10 favorite buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In a City of Skyscrapers, Which Is the Mightiest of the High?

== Quotations ==

{{Wikiquote}}

::&quot;Art Deco in France found its American equivalent in the design of the New York skyscrapers of the 1920s. The Chrysler Building ... was one of the most accomplished essays in the style.&quot;
:::–[[John Julius Norwich]], in The World Atlas of Architecture

::&quot;The design, originally drawn up for building contractor William H. Reynolds, was finally sold to Walter P. Chrysler, who wanted a provocative building that would not merely scrape the sky but positively pierce it. Its 77 floors briefly making it the highest building in the world — at least until the Empire State Building was completed — it became the star of the New York skyline, thanks above all to its crowning peak. In a deliberate strategy of myth generation, Van Alen planned a dramatic moment of revelation: the entire seven-storey pinnacle, complete with special-steel facing, was first assembled inside the building, and then hoisted into position through the roof opening and anchored on top in just one and a half hours. All of a sudden it was there—a sensational fait accompli.&quot;
:::–[[Peter Gossel]] and [[Gabriele Leuthauser]], in Architecture in the Twentieth Century

::&quot;One of the first uses of stainless steel over a large exposed building surface. The decorative treatment of the masonry walls below changes with every set-back and includes story-high basket-weave designs, radiator-cap gargoyles, and a band of abstract automobiles. The lobby is a modernistic composition of African marble and chrome steel.&quot;
:::–[[Elliot Willensky]] and [[Norval White]], in AIA Guide to New York

{{Anti-nuclear movement}}
The '''Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament''' (CND) is an [[anti-nuclear]] organisation that advocates unilateral [[nuclear disarmament]] by the [[United Kingdom]], international nuclear disarmament and tighter international arms regulation through agreements such as the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. It opposes military action that may result in the use of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[Biological warfare|biological weapons]] and the building of [[nuclear power]] stations in the UK.

CND was formed in 1957 and since that time has periodically been at the forefront of the [[peace movement]] in the UK. It claims to be [[Europe]]'s largest [[Single-issue politics|single-issue peace campaign]]. Since 1958, it has organised the [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]], which is held over the [[Easter]] weekend from [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] near [[Aldermaston]].

The Campaign's [[General Secretary]] is [[Kate Hudson (activist)|Kate Hudson]].

==The First Wave 1958-1963==
On 2 November 1957, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine published an article by [[J. B. Priestley]] on &quot;Britain and the Nuclear Bombs&quot;, which was critical of [[Aneurin Bevan]] for changing his mind about nuclear weapons and ceasing to advocate [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]] by Britain. The journal received many letters of support, reflecting the growth in opposition to nuclear weapons following Britain's recent [[Operation Grapple|H-bomb tests]].  At the end of November, a meeting was held in the rooms of [[Canon John Collins]], chaired by the editor of the ''New Statesman'', [[Kingsley Martin]], to launch the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Collins was chosen as its Chairman, [[Bertrand Russell]] as its President and [[Peggy Duff]] as its organising secretary. The other members of its executive committee were [[Peter Ritchie Calder|Ritchie Calder]], journalist [[James Cameron (journalist)|James Cameron]], Howard Davies, [[Michael Foot]], [[Arthur Goss]], [[Kingsley Martin]], [[J. B. Priestley]] and [[Joseph Rotblat]].

CND held an inaugural public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=Minnion&gt;John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds.)

Notable supporters of the Irish CND included [[Peadar O'Donnell]], [[Owen Sheehy-Skeffington]] and [[Hubert Butler]].

CND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention.  In the meantime, Britain should halt the flight of planes armed with nuclear weapons, end nuclear testing, not proceed with missile bases and not provide nuclear weapons to any other country.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;

The symbol adopted by CND was designed in 1958 by [[Gerald Holtom]]&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; and in the following decade became an international [[peace symbol]]. It is based on the [[flag semaphore|semaphore]] symbols for &quot;N&quot; and &quot;D&quot; (for Nuclear Disarmament) within a circle. Holtom later said that it also represented &quot;an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of [[The Third of May 1808|Goya's peasant before the firing squad]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/ed/cnd_sym.html CND website]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Easter 1958, a 52-mile [[Aldermaston marches|march]] from London to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]] was organised by the Direct Action Committee, supported by CND after some initial reluctance. The march was the subject of a documentary by [[Lindsay Anderson]], [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/533592/ ''March to Aldermaston'']. Thereafter, CND organised annual Easter marches starting at Aldermaston and ending in London. 60,000 people participated in the 1959 march and 150,000 in the 1961 and 1962 marches.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', Continuum International Publishing, 2005.

CND supporters were generally left of centre in politics.  About three-quarters of CND supporters were Labour voters&lt;ref name=Parkin&gt;Frank Parkin, ''Middle Class Radicalism: The Social Bases of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament'', Manchester University Press, 1968, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the early executive committee were Labour Party members.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;  Its founders envisaged CND as a campaign by eminent individuals who would work through the Labour Party and lobby government for a change in defence policy.  The Labour Party voted at its 1960 Conference for unilateral nuclear disarmament, representing CND's greatest influence on national politics and coinciding with the highest level of public support for its policy of unilateralism.&lt;ref name=carter&gt;April Carter, ''Direct Action and Liberal Democracy'', London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hugh Gaitskell]], the Labour Party leader, received the vote with a promise to &quot;fight, fight, and fight again&quot; against the decision and it was overturned at the 1961 Conference.  Labour's failure to win the [[General election of 1959]] and its rejection of unilateralism in 1961 upset the plans of the CND leadership and, although CND retained the support of a significant minority of the population, from this point onwards its prospects of success began to fade.

As it did not have a national membership until 1966, the strength of CND's support can be estimated only from the numbers of those attending demonstrations or expressing approval in opinion polls. Between 1955 and 1962, between 19% to 33% of people in Britain expressed disapproval of the manufacture of nuclear weapons (though it has been claimed that many of those also disapproved of CND's mass protests).&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;W.P.Snyder, ''The Politics of British Defense Policy, 1945-1962'', Ohio University Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  Public support for unilateralism has remained at around 25% ever since.&lt;ref name=carter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andy Byrom, &quot;British attitudes on nuclear weapons&quot;, ''Journal of Public Affairs'', 7: 71-77, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

CND rapidly became a mass movement and attendance at CND demonstrations increased until about 1963.  A network of autonomous branches and specialist groups (such as [[Christian CND]]) sprang up{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The Aldermaston march, the CND symbol and its slogan &quot;Ban the Bomb&quot; became icons and part of the youth culture of the [[sixties]].  The different conceptions of CND - campaign by eminent individuals or mass movement - caused friction between leaders and supporters. Until the formation of a national council in 1961, supporters and local groups had no formal voice in the national organisation, which until then had been led by the self-appointed executive committee.

In 1960 Bertrand Russell resigned from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in order to form the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], which became, in effect, the direct action wing of CND. Russell argued that direct action was necessary because the press was losing interest in CND and because the danger of nuclear war was so great that it was necessary to obstruct government preparations for it.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B., &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;, ''New Statesman'', 17 February 1961&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958 CND had cautiously accepted direct action as a possible method of campaigning,&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; but, largely under the influence of [[Canon John Collins]], the CND chairman, the CND leadership opposed any sort of unlawful protest. The Committee of 100 was created as a separate organisation partly for that reason and partly because of personal animosity between Collins and Russell.  Although the Committee was supported by many in CND, it has been suggested&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, R., ''Against the Bomb'', Oxford University Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; that the campaign against nuclear weapons was weakened by the friction between the two organisations. The Committee organised large sit-down demonstrations in London and at military bases. It later became involved in other political campaigns, including [[Biafra]], the [[Vietnam war]] and housing in the UK. It was dissolved in 1968. When direct action came to the fore again in the 1980s, it was generally accepted by the peace movement as a normal part of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html |title=A brief history of CND |publisher=Cnduk.org |date=1945-08-06 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 1963 Aldermaston march, a clandestine group calling itself [[Spies for Peace]] distributed leaflets about a secret government establishment, [[Regional Seat of Government|RSG 6]], that the march was passing. The leaflet said that RSG 6 was to be the local HQ for a military dictatorship after nuclear war. A large group left the march, much against the wishes of the CND leadership, to demonstrate at RSG 6.  Later, when the march reached London, there were disorderly demonstrations in which [[anarchism|anarchists]] were prominent, quickly deprecated in the press and in parliament.&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt;  In 1964 there was only a one-day march, partly because of the events of 1963 and partly because the logistics of the march, which had grown beyond all expectation, had exhausted the organisers.&lt;ref name=Minnion/&gt;  The Aldermaston March was resumed in 1965.

The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in the Autumn of 1962, in which the United States blockaded a Soviet attempt to put nuclear missiles on Cuba, created some anxiety about the possibility of imminent nuclear war and CND organised demonstrations on the issue. But six months after the crisis, a [[Gallup Poll]] found that public worry about nuclear weapons had fallen back to its lowest point since 1957,&lt;ref name=Driver/&gt; and there was a view, disputed by CND supporters,&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Young, &quot;Cuba '62&quot;, in Minnion and Bolsover, p61&lt;/ref&gt; that U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s success in facing down Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] turned the British public away from CND.

John Collins helped to form the [[International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/the-oxford-conference-of-non-aligned-peace-organizations Oxford Conference of Non-aligned Peace Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt; and resigned as chairman of CND in 1964. He had been unpopular with many CND supporters and he found himself out of sympathy with the direction the movement was taking.

Support for CND dwindled after the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Test Ban Treaty]]. From the mid-sixties, the anti-war movement's preoccupation with the [[Vietnam War]] tended to eclipse concern about nuclear weapons but CND continued to campaign against them.

==The Second Wave 1980-89==
In the 1980s, CND underwent a major revival, its membership increasing from 4,000 to 100,000 between 1979 and 1984.  This was a response to increasing tension between the superpowers following the deployment of American [[Pershing II|Pershing]] [[medium-range ballistic missile|missiles]] in Western Europe, [[RT-21M Pioner|SS20s]] in the Soviet Bloc countries and Britain's replacement of the [[UGM-27 Polaris#British Polaris|Polaris]] armed [[submarine]] fleet with [[Trident missile]]s in 1982. The [[NATO]] exercise [[Able Archer 83]] also added to international tension. CND attracted supporters who opposed the Government’s civil defence plans as outlined in an official booklet, ''[[Protect and Survive]]''. This publication was ridiculed in a popular pamphlet, ''Protest and Survive'', by [[E.P.Thompson]], a leading anti-nuclear campaigner of the period. Public support for unilateralism reached its highest level since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Caedel&gt;Caedel, Martin, &quot;Britain's Nuclear Disarmers&quot;, in Laqueur, W., ''European Peace Movements and the Future of the Western Alliance'', Transaction Publishers, 1985, p.233 ISBN 0-88-738-0352&lt;/ref&gt;  More women than men supported it.&lt;ref name=Minnion/&gt;

The British anti-nuclear movement at this time differed from the movement of the 1960s. Many groups sprang up independently of CND, some affiliating later. CND's previous objection to civil disobedience was dropped and it became a normal part of anti-nuclear protest. The women's movement had a strong influence, much of it emanating from the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]].&lt;ref name=Minnion/&gt; The Labour Party adopted unilateralism in the 1970s, though it dropped it after 1983.

New CND sections were formed, including Ex-services CND, Green CND, Student CND, Trade Union CND, and Youth CND. A network of protesters, calling itself Cruise Watch, tracked and harassed [[Cruise missile]]s whenever they were carried on public roads. After a while, the missiles traveled only at night under police escort. The peace movement of early 80s was the largest in modern history. In October 1981, 250,000 people joined an anti-nuclear demonstration in London. In October 1983, three million people took part in simultaneous demonstrations across Europe, 300,000 of them in London.&lt;ref name=Cortright&gt;David Cortright, ''Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas'', Cambridge University Press, 2008 ISBN 0521854024&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organised opposition to CND==
CND's growing support in the 1980s provoked opposition from several sources, notably [[Peace Through Nato]], the [[British Atlantic Committee]] (which received government funding),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1981/dec/17/british-atlantic-committee-grant |title=Lords Hansard |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=1981-12-17 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women and Families for Defence]] (set up by right-wing journalist [[Lady Olga Maitland]]) and the [[Coalition for Peace through Security]] (CPS), in which the future Conservative MP [[Julian Lewis]] was involved. The government also took direct steps to counter the influence of CND, [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Michael Heseltine]] setting up Defence Secretariat 19 &quot;to explain to the public the facts about the Government's policy on deterrence and multilateral disarmament&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1986/jul/21/section-ds19#S6CV0102P0_19860721_CWA_399 |title=Commons Hansard |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=1986-07-21 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald Vaughan]], a government minister, tried to halve government funding for the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], apparently because [[Joan Ruddock]], CND's chair, was employed part-time at his local bureau. [[Bruce Kent]], the general secretary of CND and a Roman Catholic priest, was warned by Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] not to become too involved in politics.

The activities of anti-CND organisations included publication, debate, counter-demonstrations against CND, and, it is claimed,&lt;ref name=Kent/&gt; untruthful personal attacks on CND members. A draft CPS leaflet alleged that Bruce Kent had links with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. Kent claimed that the CPS placed a [[spy]] in CND (in fact MI5 had done so - see below). 

The CPS attracted criticism for refusing to reveal the source of its funds whilst alleging that the anti-nuclear movement was funded by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Kent&gt;Bruce Kent, ''Undiscovered Ends''.&lt;/ref&gt; CND's opponents tried to expose CND as a [[Soviet-run peace movements in the West|Communist or Soviet-dominated organisation]]. Communists have played an active role in the organisation, and John Cox, its chairman from 1971 to 1977, was a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=dmail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1229940/Cathy-Ashton-EUs-new-Foreign-Minister-Treasurer-CND.html |title=EU's new 'Foreign Minister' Cathy Ashton was Treasurer of CND |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2009-11-22 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, it was discovered in the archive of the [[Stasi]] (the state security service of the former [[German Democratic Republic]]) that one member of CND's governing council, [[Vic Allen]], had passed information to them about CND. This discovery was made public in a BBC TV programme in 1999, reviving debate about Soviet links to CND. Allen stood against [[Joan Ruddock]] for the leadership of CND in 1985, but was defeated. Ruddock responded to the Stasi revelations with &quot;[Allen] certainly had no influence on national CND, and as a pro-Soviet could never have succeeded to the chair. CND was as opposed to Soviet nuclear weapons as Western ones.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo991221/halltext/91221h04.htm#91221h04_head0 |title=Commons Hansard |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/09/99/britain_betrayed/451366.stm |title=I regret nothing, says Stasi spy  |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-09-20 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls in 1982 and 1983 showed that public support for unilateralism had fallen from 31% in September 1982 to 21% in January 1983 and 19% in May 1983, though it is hard to say whether this was a result of the propaganda campaign against CND or not.&lt;ref name=Caedel/&gt;

==State surveillance of CND==
The security service ([[MI5]]) has carried out surveillance of CND members it considered to be subversive. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, MI5 designated CND as subversive by virtue of its being &quot;communist controlled&quot;. From the late 1970s, it was downgraded to &quot;communist-penetrated&quot;. MI5 says it has no current investigations in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/myths-and-misunderstandings.html#8 |title=Myths and Misunderstandings |publisher=Mi5.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Cathy Massiter, an MI5 officer who had been responsible for the surveillance of CND from 1981 to 1983, resigned and made disclosures to  a [[Channel 4]] ''20/20 Vision'' programme, &quot;MI5's Official Secrets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/true_spies/2336987.stm |title=Secret State: Timeline |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-10-17 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1986/jul/24/business-of-the-house-1 |title=Dale Campbell-Savours, MP, in '&amp;#39;Hansard'&amp;#39;, 24 July 1986 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She said that her work was determined more by the political importance of CND than by any security threat posed by subversive elements within it.  In 1983, she analysed telephone intercepts on John Cox that gave her access to conversations with Joan Ruddock and Bruce Kent. MI5 also placed a spy, Harry Newton, in the CND office. On the basis of Ruddock's contacts, MI5 suspected her of being a communist sympathiser and it was suggested that Bruce Kent might be a crypto-communist. MI5 also suspected its treasurer, [[Cathy Ashton]], of being a communist sympathiser.&lt;ref name=dmail/&gt; When Michael Heseltine became Secretary of State for Defence, Massiter prepared a report on CND for him. She was asked to provide information for Defence Secretariat 19 about leading CND personnel but was instructed to include only information from published sources. Ruddock claims that DS19 released distorted information regarding her political party affiliations to the media and Conservative Party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030127mi5.pdf |title=Center for Democracy and Technology, '&amp;#39;Domestic Intelligence Agencies: The Mixed Record of the UK’s MI5'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current CND==
Support for CND fell after the end of the Cold war. It had not succeeded in converting the British public to unilateralism and even after the collapse of the Soviet Union British nuclear weapons still have majority support. CND's policy of opposing American nuclear bases, however, was and is more in tune with public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;James Hinton &quot;Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&quot;, in Roger S.Powers, ''Protest, Power and Change'',  Taylor and Francis, 1997. ISBN 0815309139&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 CND launched a campaign against nuclear power which proved popular. Its membership, which had fallen to 32,000, increased threefold after Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] made a commitment to nuclear energy.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cnd-membership-booms-after-nuclear-uturn-408265.html |title=&quot;CND membership booms after nuclear U-turn&quot;, '&amp;#39;The Independent'&amp;#39;, 17 July 2006 |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2006-07-17 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years it has extended its campaigns to include opposition to U.S. and British policy in the [[Middle East]], rather as it broadened its anti-nuclear campaigns in the 1960s to include opposition to the Vietnam War. In collaboration with the [[Stop the War Coalition]] and the [[Muslim Association of Britain]], CND has organised [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|anti-war marches]] under the slogan &quot;[[Don't Attack Iraq]]&quot;, including protests on September 28, 2002 and [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]]. It also  organised a vigil for the victims of the [[2005 London bombings]].

CND campaigns against the [[Trident missile]]. In March 2007 it organised a rally in Parliament Square to coincide with the Commons motion to renew the weapons system. The rally was attended by over 1,000 people. It was addressed by Labour MPs [[Jon Trickett]], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53ZdD_WL6g [[Emily Thornberry]]], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqiOmkWTCmw [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]]], [[Michael Meacher]], [[Diane Abbott]] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRMHcp4zkGU [[Jeremy Corbyn]]], and [[Elfyn Llwyd]] of [[Plaid Cymru]] and [[Angus MacNeil]] of the [[Scottish National Party]]. In the House of Commons, 161 MPs (88 of them Labour) voted against the renewal of Trident and the Government motion was carried only with the support of Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03038.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

CND's current strategic objectives are:
* The elimination of British nuclear weapons and global abolition of nuclear weapons. It campaigns for the cancellation of Trident by the British government and against the deployment of nuclear weapons in Britain.
* The abolition of [[weapons of mass destruction]], in particular chemical and biological weapons. CND wants a ban on the manufacture, testing and use of depleted [[uranium]] weapons
* A nuclear-free, less militarised and more secure Europe. It supports the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). It opposes US military bases and nuclear weapons in Europe and British membership of NATO.
* The closure of the [[nuclear power]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/index.php/about/general/about-cnd.html |title=CND aims and policies |publisher=Cnduk.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
CND has a national organisation based in London, national groups in Wales, Ireland and [[Scottish CND|Scotland]], regional groups in Cambridgeshire, Cumbria, the East Midlands, Kent, London, Manchester, Merseyside, Mid Somerset, Norwich, South Cheshire and North Staffordshire, Southern England, South West England, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex, Tyne and Wear, the West Midlands and [http://www.yorkshirecnd.org.uk Yorkshire], and local branches.

There are four &quot;specialist sections&quot;: Trade Union CND, [[Christian CND]], [[Labour CND]] and Ex-Services CND,&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnduk.org/images/stories/cnd_docs/cnd_constitution.pdf |title=CND Constitution |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have rights of representation on the governing council. There are also parliamentary, youth and student groups.

The Council is made up of the chair of CND, the treasurer, 3 vice-chairs, 15 directly elected members, a representative of each of the specialist sections, 1 from Student CND, 3 from Youth CND and 27 from the regional groups. Employees sit on the Council but do not vote.&lt;ref name=constitution/&gt;

'''Comet Shoemaker–Levy&amp;nbsp;9''' ([[Astronomical naming conventions#Comets|formally designated]] '''D/1993&amp;nbsp;F2''', nicknamed '''String of Pearls'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040724.html|title=Astronomy Picture of the Day |accessdate=2010-07-18 |work= |publisher=[[NASA]] |month=July 24 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its appearance) was a [[comet]] that broke apart and collided with [[Jupiter]] in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of [[solar system]] objects.&lt;ref name=NASA2005&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/comet.html |title=Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 Collision with Jupiter |accessdate=2008-08-26 |work= |publisher=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |month=February |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generated a large amount of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by [[astronomy|astronomers]] worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its role in reducing [[space debris]] in the [[Solar_system#Inner_planets|inner solar system]].

The comet was discovered by astronomers [[Carolyn S. Shoemaker|Carolyn]] and [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker|Eugene M. Shoemaker]], [[David H. Levy|David Levy]] and Philippe Bendjoya from France. Shoemaker–Levy 9, at the time captured by and orbiting Jupiter, was located on the night of March 24, 1993, in a photograph taken with the {{convert|40|cm|ftin}} [[Schmidt camera|Schmidt telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] in [[California]]. It was the first comet observed to be orbiting a planet, and had probably been captured by the planet around 20 – 30 years earlier.

Calculations showed that its unusual fragmented form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992. At that time, the orbit of Shoemaker–Levy 9 passed within Jupiter's [[Roche limit]], and Jupiter's [[tidal force]]s had acted to pull the comet apart. The comet was later observed as a series of fragments ranging up to {{Convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter. These fragments collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere between July&amp;nbsp;16 and July 22, 1994, at a speed of approximately {{Convert|60|km/s|0|abbr=on}}. The prominent scars from the impacts were more easily visible than the [[Great Red Spot]] and persisted for many months.

== Discovery ==
While conducting a program of observations designed to uncover [[near-Earth object]]s, the Shoemakers and Levy and in company of a young French post-doc student Bendjoya discovered Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 on the night of March 24, 1993 in a photograph taken with the {{Convert|0.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Schmidt camera|Schmidt telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] in [[California]]. The comet was thus a [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery, but one that quickly overshadowed the results from their main observing program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsden1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/news81.html |title=Eugene Shoemaker (1928–1997) |accessdate=2008-08-24 |last=Marsden |first=Brian G. |date=1997-07-18 |publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was the ninth periodic comet (a comet whose orbital period is 200 years or less) discovered by the Shoemakers and Levy, hence its name. It was their eleventh comet discovery overall including their discovery of two non-periodic comets, which use a different nomenclature. The discovery was announced in [[IAU Circular]] 5725 &lt;ref name=&quot;IAU 5725&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iauc/05700/05725.html#Item1 |title=IAU 5725 circular |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 27, 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;D1993&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/1993f2.html |title=D/1993 F2 Shoemaker–Levy 9 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |year=1994 |work=Gary W. Kronk's Cometography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery image gave the first hint that comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was an unusual comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s long and 10&amp;nbsp;arcseconds wide. [[Brian Marsden]] of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4&amp;nbsp;[[degree (angle)|degrees]] from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that while this could of course be a line of sight effect, its [[improper motion|apparent motion]] suggested that it was physically close to the giant planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marsden2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/05700/05725.html |title=Comet Shoemaker–Levy (1993e) |accessdate=2008-08-08 |last=Marsden |first=Brian G. |date=1993-03-26 |publisher=[[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered the fragments of a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's [[gravity]].

== Jupiter-orbiting comet ==
Orbital studies of the new comet soon revealed that it was orbiting [[Jupiter]] rather than the [[Sun]], unlike all other comets known at the time. Its orbit around Jupiter was very loosely bound, with a period of about 2 years and an [[apojove]] (furthest distance from Jupiter) of {{convert|0.33|AU|Gm|abbr=off|lk=on}}. Its orbit around the planet was highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (''e'' = 0.9986).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton1.4&quot;/&gt;

Tracing back the comet's orbital motion revealed that it had been orbiting Jupiter for some time. It seems most likely that it was captured from a solar orbit in the early 1970s, although the capture may have occurred as early as the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seds.org/sl9/landis.html |title=Comet P/Shoemaker–Levy's Collision with Jupiter: Covering HST's Planned Observations from Your Planetarium |accessdate=2008-08-08 |last=Landis |first=R.R. |year=1994 |work=Proceedings of the International Planetarium Society Conference held at the Astronaut Memorial Planetarium &amp; Observatory, Cocoa, Florida, July 10–16, 1994 |publisher=[[Students for the Exploration and Development of Space]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080521020421/http://www.seds.org/sl9/landis.html |archivedate = May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other observers found images of the comet in [[precovery]] images obtained before March&amp;nbsp;24, including [[Kin Endate]] from a photograph exposed on March&amp;nbsp;15, [[Satoru Otomo|S. Otomo]] on March&amp;nbsp;17, and a team led by [[Eleanor Helin]] from images on March&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;ref name=&quot;D1993&quot; /&gt; No precovery images dating back to earlier than March 1993 have been found. Before the comet was captured by Jupiter, it was probably a short-period comet with an [[aphelion]] just inside Jupiter's orbit, and a [[perihelion]] interior to the [[asteroid belt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Benner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benner |first=L.A. |year=1994 |month=March |title=Pre-Impact Orbital Evolution of P/Shoemaker–Levy 9 |journal=Abstracts of the 25th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, held in Houston, TX, March 14–18, 1994 |volume=25 |pages=93 |bibcode=1994LPI....25...93B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volume of space within which an object can be said to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's [[Hill sphere]] (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it happened to be near its aphelion, and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricity{{ndash}} that is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=Clark R. |year=1993 |month=June |title=Comet on target for Jupiter |journal=Nature |accessdate=2008-08-25 |volume=363 |issue=6429 |pages=492–493 |doi=10.1038/363492a0|bibcode = 1993Natur.363..492C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comet had apparently passed extremely close to Jupiter on July&amp;nbsp;7, 1992, just over {{convert|40000|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the planet's cloud tops{{ndash}} a smaller distance than Jupiter's radius of {{convert|70000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and well within the orbit of Jupiter's innermost moon [[Metis (moon)|Metis]] and the planet's [[Roche limit]], inside which [[tidal force]]s are strong enough to disrupt a body held together only by gravity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman&quot; /&gt; Although the comet had approached Jupiter closely before, the July&amp;nbsp;7 encounter seemed to be by far the closest, and the fragmentation of the comet is thought to have occurred at this time. Each fragment of the comet was denoted by a letter of the [[alphabet]], from &quot;fragment A&quot; through to &quot;fragment W&quot;, a practice already established from previously observed broken-up comets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boehnhardt&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=H. |last=Boehnhardt |year=2004 |month=November |chapter=Split comets |title=Comets II |editor=Michel C. Festou, H. Uwe Keller and Harold A. Weaver |publisher=University of Arizona Press |page=301 |isbn=978-0-8165-2450-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More exciting for planetary astronomers was that the best orbital solutions suggested that the comet would pass within {{convert|45000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the center of Jupiter, a distance smaller than the planet's radius, meaning that there was an extremely high probability that SL9 would collide with Jupiter in July 1994. Studies suggested that the train of nuclei would plow into Jupiter's atmosphere over a period of about five days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman&quot; /&gt;

== Predictions for the collision ==
The discovery that the comet was likely to collide with Jupiter caused great excitement within the astronomical community and beyond, as astronomers had never before seen two significant solar system bodies collide. Intense studies of the comet were undertaken, and as its orbit became more accurately established, the possibility of a collision became a certainty. The collision would provide a unique opportunity for scientists to look inside Jupiter's atmosphere, as the collisions were expected to cause eruptions of material from the layers normally hidden beneath the clouds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton1.4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Burton |url=http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/sl9/cometfaq.html#Q1.4 |title=What will be the effect of the collision? |work=Freqently Asked Questions about the Collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter |publisher=[[Stephen F. Austin State University]] |month=July | year=1994 |accessdate=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers estimated that the visible fragments of SL9 ranged in size from a few hundred metres to at most a couple of kilometres across, suggesting that the original comet may have had a nucleus up to {{Convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} across{{ndash}} somewhat larger than [[Comet Hyakutake]], which became very bright when it passed close to the Earth in 1996. One of the great debates in advance of the impact was whether the effects of the impact of such small bodies would be noticeable from Earth, apart from a flash as they disintegrated like giant [[meteor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton1.5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Burton |url=http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/sl9/cometfaq.html#Q1.5 |title=Can I see the effects with my telescope? |work=Freqently Asked Questions about the Collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter |publisher=[[Stephen F. Austin State University]] |month=July | year=1994 |accessdate=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other suggested effects of the impacts were [[seismic]] waves travelling across the planet, an increase in [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] haze on the planet due to dust from the impacts, and an increase in the mass of the [[Rings of Jupiter|Jovian ring system]]. However, given that observing such a collision was completely unprecedented, astronomers were cautious with their predictions of what the event might reveal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton1.4&quot;/&gt;

== Impacts ==
[[File:SL9 BDGLNQ12R hst19.jpg|thumb|left|Jupiter in Ultraviolet (about 2.5 hours after R's impact). The black dot near the top is a Galilean moon transiting Jupiter.]]

Anticipation grew as the predicted date for the collisions approached, and astronomers trained terrestrial telescopes on Jupiter. Several space observatories did the same, including the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[ROSAT]] [[X-ray]] observing [[satellite]], and significantly the [[Galileo spacecraft]], then on its way to a rendezvous with Jupiter scheduled for 1995. While the impacts took place on the side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6&amp;nbsp;AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Jupiter's rapid rotation brought the impact sites into view for terrestrial observers a few minutes after the collisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chodas&quot;&gt;

Two other satellites made observations at the time of the impact: the [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses spacecraft]], primarily designed for [[Sun|solar]] observations, was pointed towards Jupiter from its location 2.6&amp;nbsp;AU away, and the distant [[Voyager 2]] probe, some 44&amp;nbsp;AU from Jupiter and on its way out of the solar system following its encounter with [[Neptune]] in 1989, was programmed to look for radio emission in the 1–390&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/others.html |last=Williams|first=David R.|title=Ulysses and Voyager 2 |accessdate=2008-08-25 |work=Lunar and Planetary Science |publisher=[[National Space Science Data Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Impact fireball appears over the limb of Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|150px|HST images of a fireball from the first impact appearing over the limb of the planet]]

The first impact occurred at 20:13&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on July 16, 1994, when fragment A of the nucleus slammed into Jupiter's southern hemisphere at a speed of about 60&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name=NASA2005/&gt; Instruments on Galileo detected a fireball which reached a peak temperature of about 24,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130&amp;nbsp;K, before expanding and cooling rapidly to about 1500&amp;nbsp;K after 40&amp;nbsp;s. The plume from the fireball quickly reached a height of over 3,000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Terry Z. |year=1996 |month=September |title=Shoemaker–Levy 9: Temperature, Diameter and Energy of Fireballs |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |volume=28 |pages=1085 |bibcode=1996DPS....28.0814M}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few minutes after the impact fireball was detected, Galileo measured renewed heating, probably due to ejected material falling back onto the planet. Earth-based observers detected the fireball rising over the limb of the planet shortly after the initial impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weissman |first=P.R. |year=1995 |month=March |title=Galileo NIMS Direct Observation of the Shoemaker–Levy 9 Fireballs and Fall Back |journal=Abstracts of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference |volume=26 |pages=1483 |bibcode=1995LPI....26.1483W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers had expected to see the fireballs from the impacts, but did not have any idea in advance how visible the atmospheric effects of the impacts would be from Earth. Observers soon saw a huge dark spot after the first impact. The spot was visible even in very small telescopes, and was about {{Convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on}} (one Earth radius) across. This and subsequent dark spots were thought to have been caused by debris from the impacts, and were markedly asymmetric, forming crescent shapes in front of the direction of impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hammel&quot;&gt;{{Cite conference |last=Hammel |first=H.B. |year=1994 |month=December |title=The Spectacular Swan Song of Shoemaker–Levy 9 |conference=185th AAS Meeting |publisher=American Astronomical Society |volume=26 |pages=1425 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994AAS...185.7201H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 6&amp;nbsp;days, 21 distinct impacts were observed, with the largest coming on July&amp;nbsp;18 at 07:33 UTC when fragment G struck Jupiter. This impact created a giant dark spot over 12,000&amp;nbsp;km across, and was estimated to have released an energy equivalent to 6,000,000&amp;nbsp;[[megaton|megatons of TNT]] (600 times the world's nuclear arsenal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan|last=Bruton|url=http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~astro/sl9/cometfaq2.html#Q3.1 |title=What were some of the effects of the collisions? |accessdate=2008-08-20 |work=Frequently Asked Questions about the Collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |month=February | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two impacts 12&amp;nbsp;hours apart on July&amp;nbsp;19 created impact marks of similar size to that caused by fragment G, and impacts continued until July&amp;nbsp;22, when fragment W struck the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Don |last=Yeomans |coauthors=Chodas, Paul

Observers hoped that the impacts would give them a first glimpse of Jupiter beneath the cloud tops, as lower material was exposed by the comet fragments punching through the upper atmosphere. [[Astronomical spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] studies revealed [[absorption line]]s in the Jovian spectrum due to diatomic [[sulfur]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon disulfide]] (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in any [[astronomical object]]. Other molecules detected included [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). The amount of sulfur implied by the quantities of these compounds was much greater than the amount that would be expected in a small cometary nucleus, showing that material from within Jupiter was being revealed. [[Oxygen]]-bearing molecules such as [[sulfur dioxide]] were not detected, to the surprise of astronomers.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noll |first=K.S. |authorlink= |year=1995 |month=March |title=HST Spectroscopic Observations of Jupiter Following the Impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 |journal=Science |volume=267 |issue=5202 |pages=1307–1313 |doi=10.1126/science.7871428 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/267/5202/1307 |accessdate=2008-08-24 |pmid=7871428 |last2=McGrath |first2=MA |last3=Trafton |first3=LM |last4=Atreya |first4=SK |last5=Caldwell |first5=JJ |last6=Weaver |first6=HA |last7=Yelle |first7=RV |last8=Barnet |first8=C |last9=Edgington |first9=S|bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1307N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as these [[molecule]]s, emission from heavy [[atom]]s such as [[iron]], [[magnesium]] and [[silicon]] was detected, with abundances consistent with what would be found in a cometary nucleus. While substantial water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hu&quot; /&gt; The relatively low levels of water were later confirmed by Galileo's atmospheric probe, which explored Jupiter's atmosphere directly.

=== Seismic waves ===
As predicted beforehand, the collisions generated enormous [[seismic wave]]s which swept across the planet at speeds of {{Convert|450|km/s|0|abbr=on}} and were observed for over two hours after the largest impacts. The waves were thought to be travelling within a stable layer acting as a [[waveguide]], and some scientists believed the stable layer must lie within the hypothesised [[troposphere|tropospheric]] water cloud. However, other evidence seemed to indicate that the cometary fragments had not reached the water layer, and the waves were instead propagating within the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingersoll&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ingersoll |first=A. P. |authorlink= |year=1995 |month=April |title=Waves from the collisions of comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter |journal=Nature |volume=374 |issue= 6524|pages=706–708 |doi=10.1038/374706a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v374/n6524/abs/374706a0.html |accessdate=2008-08-21 |pmid=7715724 |last2=Kanamori |first2=H|bibcode = 1995Natur.374..706I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other observations ===
[[File:SL9ImpactGalileo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A sequence of [[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]] images, taken several seconds apart, showing the appearance of the fireball of fragment G on the dark side of Jupiter]]

Radio observations revealed a sharp increase in [[Black body|continuum]] emission at a wavelength of 21&amp;nbsp;cm after the largest impacts, which peaked at 120% of the normal emission from the planet. This was thought to be due to [[synchrotron radiation]], caused by the injection of [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[electron]]s{{ndash}} electrons with velocities near the speed of light{{ndash}} into the Jovian [[magnetosphere]] by the impacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olano&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olano |first=C. A. |year=1999 |month=August |title= Jupiter's Synchrotron Emission Induced by the Collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 |journal=[[Astrophysics and Space Science]] |volume=266 |issue=3 |pages=347–369 |doi=10.1023/A:1002020013936 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t07q22w438p75864/ |accessdate=2008-08-21|bibcode = 1999Ap&amp;SS.266..347O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About an hour after fragment K entered Jupiter, observers recorded [[Aurora (phenomenon)|auroral]] emission near the impact region, as well as at the [[antipodal point|antipode]] of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong [[magnetic field]]. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal [[magnetic field]] and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating [[shock wave]]s from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving [[solar wind]] particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bauske&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bauske |first=Rainer |year=1999 |month=November |title=Analysis of Midlatitude Auroral Emissions Observed during the Impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=106–115 |doi=10.1006/icar.1999.6198 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WGF-45GMF9Y-19&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=127ddc17d4270f1197e041727ed54af5 |accessdate=2008-08-20 |bibcode=1999Icar..142..106B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some astronomers had suggested that the impacts might have a noticeable effect on the [[Io (moon)#Interaction with Jupiter.27s magnetosphere|Io torus]], a [[torus]] of high-energy particles connecting Jupiter with the highly [[volcano|volcanic]] moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]. High resolution spectroscopic studies found that variations in the ion [[density]], [[rotational velocity]], and temperatures at the time of impact and afterwards were within the normal limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Michael E. |authorlink=Michael E.

== Post-impact analysis ==
[[File:Impact site of fragment G.gif|thumb|left|250px|A reddish, asymmetric ejecta pattern]]

One of the surprises of the impacts was the small amount of water revealed compared to prior predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Planetary Scientist's Companion |last=Loders |first=Katharina |coauthors=Fegley, Bruce |year=1998 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-511694-1 |page=200 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qTZAyOF8J4wC&amp;dq=Comet+Shoemaker-Levy+9,+water,+impact,+small+amount |chapter=Jupiter, Rings and Satellites}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the impact, models of Jupiter's atmosphere had indicated that the break-up of the largest fragments would occur at atmospheric pressures of anywhere from 30 [[kilopascal]]s to a few tens of [[megapascal]]s (from 0.3 to a few hundred [[bar (unit)|bar]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hu&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hu |first=Zhong-Wei |year=1996 |month=May |title=On Penetration Depth of the Shoemaker–Levy 9 Fragments into the Jovian Atmosphere |journal=Earth, Moon and Planets |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=147–155 |bibcode=1996EM&amp;P...73..147H |doi=10.1007/BF00114146 |last2=Chu |first2=Yi |last3=Zhang |first3=Kai-Jun}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some predictions that the comet would penetrate a layer of water and create a bluish shroud over that region of Jupiter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton1.5&quot; /&gt;

Astronomers did not observe large amounts of water following the collisions, and later impact studies found that fragmentation and destruction of the cometary fragments in an 'airburst' probably occurred at much higher altitudes than previously expected, with even the largest fragments being destroyed when the pressure reached {{Convert|250|kPa|0|abbr=on}}, well above the expected depth of the water layer. The smaller fragments were probably destroyed before they even reached the cloud layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hu&quot;/&gt;

== Longer-term effects ==
The visible scars from the impacts could be seen on Jupiter for many months. They were extremely prominent, and observers described them as more easily visible even than the [[Great Red Spot]]. A search of historical observations revealed that the spots were probably the most prominent transient features ever seen on the planet, and that while the Great Red Spot is notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and darkness of those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hockey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hockey |first=T.A. |year=1994 |title=The Shoemaker–Levy 9 Spots on Jupiter: Their Place in History |journal= Earth, Moon and Planets |doi=10.1007/BF00612878 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |bibcode=1994EM&amp;P...66....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectroscopic observers found that ammonia and [[carbon sulfide]] persisted in the atmosphere for at least fourteen months after the collisions, with a considerable amount of ammonia being present in the stratosphere as opposed to its normal location in the troposphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath 2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=McGrath |first=M.A. |year= 1996 |month= September |title=Long-term Chemical Evolution of the Jupiter Stratosphere Following the SL9 Impacts |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |volume=28 |pages=1149 |bibcode=1996DPS....28.2241M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterintuitively, the atmospheric temperature dropped to normal levels much more quickly at the larger impact sites than at the smaller sites: at the larger impact sites, temperatures were elevated over a region {{Convert|15000|to|20000|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, but dropped back to normal levels within a week of the impact. At smaller sites, temperatures 10&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] higher than the surroundings persisted for almost two weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bézard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bézard |first=B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |month=October |title=Long-term Response of Jupiter's Thermal Structure to the SL9 Impacts |journal=Planetary and Space Science |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=1251–1271 |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(97)00068-8 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/00320633/1997/00000045/00000010/art00068 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |bibcode=1997P&amp;SS...45.1251B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global stratospheric temperatures rose immediately after the impacts, then fell to below pre-impact temperatures 2–3&amp;nbsp;weeks afterwards, before rising slowly to normal temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moreno&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Moreno|first=R.|year=2001|month=June |title= Jovian Stratospheric Temperature during the Two Months Following the Impacts of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9|journal=Planetary and Space Science |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=473–486 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/00320633/2001/00000049/00000005/art00139 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00139-2 |bibcode=2001P&amp;SS...49..473M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frequency of impacts ==

SL9 is not unique in having orbited Jupiter for a time; five comets, (including [[82P/Gehrels]], [[147P/Kushida–Muramatsu]], and [[111P/Helin–Roman–Crockett]]) are known to have been temporarily captured by the planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohtsukaetal2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Cometary orbits around Jupiter are unstable, as they will be highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] and likely to be strongly perturbed by the Sun's gravity at [[apojove]] (the furthest point on the orbit from the planet).

By far the most massive planet in the [[solar system]], Jupiter can capture objects relatively frequently, but the size of SL9 makes it a rarity: one post-impact study estimated that comets 0.3&amp;nbsp;km in diameter impact the planet once in approximately 500 years and those {{Convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter do so just once in every 6000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roulston |first=M.S. |year=1997 |month=March |title=Impact Mechanics and Frequency of SL9-Type Events on Jupiter |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=138–147 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/is/1997/00000126/00000001/art05636 |accessdate=2008-08-26 |doi=10.1006/icar.1996.5636 |last2=Ahrens |first2=T |bibcode=1997Icar..126..138R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very strong evidence that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 [[crater chain]]s on [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] and three on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], the origin of which was initially a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schenk |first=Paul M. |year=1996 |month=June |title= Cometary Nuclei and Tidal Disruption: The Geologic Record of Crater Chains on Callisto and Ganymede |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=249–24 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WGF-45MH0V4-39&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=c4d68cb03502bc7bb34491b532c564c3 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |doi=10.1006/icar.1996.0084 |bibcode=1996Icar..121..249S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crater chains seen on the [[Moon]] often radiate from large craters, and are thought to be caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the [[Jovian planet|Jovian]] moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that the chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments crashing into the satellites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greeley 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greeley |first=R. |title=Galileo views of the geology of Callisto |journal=Planetary and Space Science |year=2000 |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=829–853 |bibcode=2000P&amp;SS...48..829G |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00050-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of July 19, 2009 ===
{{Main|2009 Jupiter impact event}}
On July 19, 2009, a new black spot about the size of the Pacific Ocean appeared in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Thermal infrared measurements showed the impact site was warm and spectroscopic analysis detected the production of excess hot ammonia and silica-rich dust in the upper regions of Jupiter's atmosphere. Scientists have concluded that another impact event had occurred, but this time a more compact and strong object, probably a small undiscovered asteroid, was the cause.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/07/21/jupiter.nasa.meteor.scar/index.html Mystery impact leaves Earth-sized mark on Jupiter&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jupiter as a &quot;cosmic vacuum cleaner&quot; ==
The impact of SL9 highlighted Jupiter's role as a kind of &quot;cosmic vacuum cleaner&quot; (or in deference to the ancients' planetary correspondences to the major organs in the human body, a kind of &quot;cosmic liver&quot;) for the inner solar system. The planet's strong gravitational influence leads to many small comets and [[asteroid]]s colliding with the planet, and the rate of cometary impacts on Jupiter is thought to be between two thousand and eight thousand times higher than the rate on Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nakamura&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nakamura |first=T. |year=1998 |month=February |title=Collisional Probability of Periodic Comets with the Terrestrial Planets{{ndash}} an Invalid Case of Analytic Formulation |journal=Astronomical Journal |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=848 |bibcode=1998AJ....115..848N |quote=For Jupiter-interacting comets of greater than 1 km diameter, a Jupiter impact takes place every 500–1000 yr, and an Earth impact every 2–4 Myr. |doi=10.1086/300206 |last2=Kurahashi |first2=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Jupiter were not present, the probability of asteroid impacts with the Solar System's inner planets would be greater.

The extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period is generally believed to have been caused by the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|impact event]] which created the [[Chicxulub crater]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicxulub&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=2005-08-22 |title=Images of Chicxulub Crater |publisher=NASA/JPL Near-Earth Object Program Office |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/yucatan.html |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wetherill&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=George W. |last=Wetherill |authorlink=George Wetherill |title=Possible consequences of absence of &quot;Jupiters&quot; in planetary systems |journal=[[Astrophysics and Space Science]] |volume=212 |issue=1–2 |pages=23–32 |year=1994 |month=February |pmid=11539457 |doi=10.1007/BF00984505 |accessdate=2009-03-06 |bibcode=1994Ap&amp;SS.212...23W}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of the argument used in the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]].

Recently, however, it has been shown that the presence of a smaller planet at Jupiter's position in the solar system may in fact increase the impact rate of comets on the Earth significantly. A planet of Jupiter's mass still seems to provide increased protection against asteroids, but the total effect on all orbital bodies within the solar system is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Jupiter – friend or foe?

'''Ceres Brewery''' is a [[brewery]] located in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]]. Today, it is part of [[Royal Unibrew]].

==History==
Ceres Brewery was founded by a [[grocer]] named Malthe Conrad Lottrup, with help from the [[chemist]]s A. S. Aagard and Knud Redelien, as the city's seventh brewery. It was named after the [[Rome|Roman]] goddess [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], and its opening was announced in the local newspaper, ''Stiftstidende'', in 1856.

The brewery was successful, and Lottrup became one of the most prominent people of Aarhus. After ten years, he extended the brewery, adding a grand building as his own private residence, where he entertained other local figures.

Lottrup's son-in-law, Laurits Christian Meulengracht, took over the running of the brewery after that, and was in charge for nearly thirty years, expanding it further. He then sold it to another brewery, [[Østjyske Bryggerier A/S]].

The brewery gained more esteem in 1914 when it was made &quot;Purveyor to the Royal Danish Court&quot;.

'''COBOL''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|oʊ|b|ɒ|l}})  is one of the oldest [[programming language]]s. Its name is an [[acronym]] for '''CO'''mmon '''B'''usiness-'''O'''riented '''L'''anguage, defining its primary domain in [[business]], finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments.

The COBOL 2002 standard includes support for [[object-oriented programming]] and other modern language features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Oliveira | first = Rui | title = The Power of Cobol | publisher = BookSurge Publishing | location = City | year = 2006 | isbn = 0620346523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and specification==
The ''COBOL'' specification was created by a committee of researchers from private industry, universities, and government during the second half of 1959. The specifications were to a great extent inspired by the [[FLOW-MATIC]] language invented by [[Grace Hopper]] - commonly referred to as &quot;the mother of the COBOL language.&quot; The IBM [[COMTRAN]] language invented by [[Bob Bemer]] was also drawn upon, but the [[FACT computer language|FACT]] language specification from [[Honeywell]] was not distributed to committee members until late in the process and had relatively little impact. [[FLOW-MATIC]]'s status as the only language of the bunch to have actually been implemented made it particularly attractive to the committee.&lt;ref name=cisn&gt;{{cite journal

The scene was set on April 8, 1959 at a meeting of computer manufacturers, users, and university people at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Computing Center. The [[United States Department of Defense]] subsequently agreed to sponsor and oversee the next activities. A meeting chaired by Charles A. Phillips was held at [[the Pentagon]] on May 28 and 29 of 1959 (exactly one year after the [[Zürich]] [[ALGOL 58]] meeting); there it was decided to set up three committees: short, intermediate and long range (the last one was never actually formed). It was the Short Range Committee, chaired by Joseph Wegstein of the US National Bureau of Standards, that during the following months created a description of the first version of COBOL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garfunkel | first = Jerome | title = The Cobol 85 Example Book | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1987 | isbn = 0471804614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was formed to recommend a short range approach to a common business language. The committee was made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were [[Burroughs Corporation]], [[IBM]], Minneapolis-[[Honeywell]] (Honeywell Labs), [[RCA]], [[Sperry Rand]], and [[Sylvania Electric Products]]. The three government agencies were the [[US Air Force]], the [[David Taylor Model Basin]], and the [[National Bureau of Standards]] (now [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]). The intermediate-range committee was formed but never became operational. In the end a sub-committee of the Short Range Committee developed the specifications of the COBOL language. This sub-committee was made up of six individuals:

* William Selden and Gertrude Tierney of [[IBM]]
* Howard Bromberg and Howard Discount of [[RCA]]
* Vernon Reeves and [[Jean E. Sammet]] of [[Sylvania Electric Products]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wexelblat | first = Richard | title = History of Programming Languages | publisher = Academic Press | location = Boston | year = 1981 | isbn = 0127450408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to use the name &quot;COBOL&quot; was made at a meeting of the committee held on 18 September 1959. The subcommittee completed the specifications for COBOL in December 1959.

The first compilers for COBOL were subsequently implemented during the year 1960 and on 6 and 7 December essentially the same COBOL program was run on two different makes of computers, an RCA computer and a Remington-Rand [[Univac]] computer, demonstrating that compatibility could be achieved.

=== ANS COBOL 1968 ===
After 1959 COBOL underwent several modifications and improvements. In an attempt to overcome the problem of incompatibility between different versions of COBOL, the American National Standards Institute ([[ANSI]]) developed a standard form of the language in 1968. This version was known as American National Standard (ANS) COBOL.

=== COBOL 1974 ===
In 1974, ANSI published a revised version of (ANS) COBOL, containing a number of features that were not in the 1968 version.

=== COBOL 1985 ===
In 1985, ANSI published still another revised version that had new features not in the 1974 standard, most notably structured language constructs (&quot;scope terminators&quot;), including &lt;code&gt;END-IF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;END-PERFORM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;END-READ&lt;/code&gt;, etc.

===COBOL 2002 and object-oriented COBOL===
The language continues to evolve today.  In the early 1990s it was decided to add object-orientation in the next full revision of COBOL.  The initial estimate was to have this revision completed by 1997 and an ISO CD (Committee Draft) was available by 1997.  Some implementers (including [[Micro Focus International|Micro Focus]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Veryant]], and [[IBM]]) introduced object-oriented syntax based on the 1997 or other drafts of the full revision.  The final approved ISO Standard (adopted as an ANSI standard by INCITS) was approved and made available in 2002.

Like the [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming languages, object-oriented COBOL compilers are available even as the language moves toward standardization. [[Fujitsu]] and [[Micro Focus]] currently support object-oriented COBOL compilers targeting the .NET framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adtools.com/products/windows/netcobol.html NetCOBOL for .NET supports COBOL migration and software development in the .NET environment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 (4th revision) of COBOL included many other features beyond object-orientation. These included (but are not limited to):

* National Language support (including but not limited to Unicode support)
* Locale-based processing
* User-defined functions
* CALL (and function) [[function prototype|prototypes]] (for compile-time parameter checking)
* Pointers and syntax for getting and freeing storage
* Calling conventions to and from non-COBOL languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]]
* Support for execution within framework environments such as Microsoft's [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (including COBOL instantiated as [[Enterprise JavaBean]]s)
* Bit and Boolean support
* “True” binary support (up until this enhancement, binary items were truncated based on the (base-10) specification within the Data Division)
* [[Floating-point]] support
* Standard (or portable) arithmetic results
* [[XML]] generation and parsing

===History of COBOL standards===
The specifications approved by the full Short Range Committee were approved by the Executive Committee on January 3, 1960, and sent to the government printing office, which edited and printed these specifications as ''[[Cobol 60]]''.

The [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) produced several revisions of the COBOL standard, including:

* [[COBOL-68]]
* [[COBOL-74]]
* [[COBOL-85]]
* [[Intrinsic Functions Amendment - 1989]]
* [[Corrections Amendment - 1991]]

After the Amendments to the 1985 ANSI Standard (which were adopted by ISO), primary development and ownership was taken over by ISO.  The following editions and TRs (Technical Reports) have been issued by ISO (and adopted as ANSI) Standards:

* [[COBOL 2002]]
* [[Finalizer Technical Report - 2003]]
* [[Native XML syntax Technical Report - 2006]]
* [[Object Oriented Collection Class Libraries - pending final approval]]...

From 2002, the [[ISO]] standard is also available to the public coded as [[ISO/IEC 1989]].

Work is progressing on the next full revision of the COBOL Standard. It is expected to be approved and available in the early 2010s.  For information on this revision, to see the latest draft of this revision, or to see what other works is happening with the COBOL Standard, see [http://www.cobolstandards.com the COBOL Standards Website].

===Legacy===
COBOL programs are in use globally in governmental and military agencies and in commercial enterprises, and are running on operating systems such as IBM's [[z/OS]], the [[POSIX]] families ([[Unix]]/[[Linux]] etc.), and Microsoft's [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] as well as [[International Computers Limited|ICL]]'s [[ICL VME|VME]] operating system and [[Unisys]]' [[Unisys OS 2200 operating system|OS 2200]].  In 1997, the [[Gartner Group]] reported that 80% of the world's business ran on COBOL with over 200 billion lines of code in existence and with an estimated 5 billion lines of new code annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobolportal.com/developer/future.asp?bhcp=1 | title=What Professionals think of the Future of COBOL? | publisher=Micro Focus | accessdate=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the twentieth century the [[year 2000 problem]] was the focus of significant COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before.  The particular level of effort required for COBOL code has been attributed both to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as COBOL is by design a business language and business applications use dates heavily, and to constructs of the COBOL language such as the PICTURE clause, which can be used to define fixed-length numeric fields, including two-digit fields for years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Features==
COBOL as defined in the original specification included a [[picture clause|PICTURE clause]] for detailed field specification.  It did not support local variables, recursion, dynamic memory allocation, or [[structured programming]] constructs.  Support for some or all of these features has been added in later editions of the COBOL standard. COBOL has many [[reserved word]]s (over 400), called [[keyword (computing)|keyword]]s.

===Self-modifying code===
The original COBOL specification supported [[self-modifying code]] via the infamous &quot;ALTER X TO PROCEED TO Y&quot; statement. X and Y are paragraph labels, and any &quot;GOTO X&quot; statements executed after such an ALTER statement have the meaning &quot;GOTO Y&quot; instead. Most{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} compilers still support it, but it should not be used in new programs.

===Syntactic features===
COBOL provides an update-in-place syntax, for example

&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
      ADD YEARS TO AGE
&lt;/source&gt;

The equivalent construct in many procedural languages would be

&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
age = age + years
&lt;/source&gt;

This syntax is similar to the compound assignment operator later adopted by C:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
age += years
&lt;/source&gt;

The abbreviated conditional expression

&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
      IF SALARY &gt; 9000 OR SUPERVISOR-SALARY OR = PREV-SALARY
&lt;/source&gt;

is equivalent to

&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
      IF SALARY &gt; 9000
          OR SALARY &gt; SUPERVISOR-SALARY
          OR SALARY == PREV-SALARY
&lt;/source&gt;

COBOL provides &quot;named conditions&quot; (so-called 88-levels). These are declared as sub-items of another item (the conditional variable). The named condition can be used in an IF statement, and tests whether the conditional variable is equal to any of the values given in the named condition's VALUE clause. The SET statement can be used to make a named condition TRUE (by assigning the first of its values to the conditional variable).

COBOL allows identifiers to be up to 30 characters long.  When COBOL was introduced, much shorter lengths (e.g., 6 characters for FORTRAN) were prevalent.

The concept of ''[[copybook (programming)|copybooks]]'' was introduced by COBOL; these are chunks of code which can be inserted into a program's code. This is done with the COPY statement, which also allows parts of the copybook's code to be replaced with other code (using the REPLACING ... BY ... clause).

===Data types===
Standard COBOL provides the following [[data type]]s:

===Hello, world===
An example of the &quot;[[Hello, world]]&quot; program in COBOL:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
      PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-WORLD.
      PROCEDURE DIVISION.
          DISPLAY 'Hello, world'.
          STOP RUN.
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;!-- I haven't tested this reformatted version, as my COBOL compiler doesn't seem to handle the &quot;EXIT PROGRAM&quot;/&quot;END PROGRAM...&quot; syntax, but I'm pretty damn sure that if it worked before, it'll still work now. If you copy and paste this example then be careful to preserve the indentation, as indentation is relevant to (at least) older COBOL compilers.  If you're trying to compile this example on an older compiler and it fails to compile or produces no output when run, you may want to try a [http://www.cuillin.demon.co.uk/nazz/trivia/hw/hw_cobol.html more simple example].

COBOL has various version of dialects: In some of them
&lt;pre&gt;
      DISPLAY &quot;Hello, world&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
produces a syntax error, because they don't like the double quote (&quot;), use
&lt;pre&gt;
      DISPLAY 'Hello, world.'.
&lt;/pre&gt;
instead. (Single quotes are standard, so should be acceptable to all compilers.)

If you use Mainframe press ALT+F7, there you can change the dialect of the cobol ('COBOL for MVS' is recommended) --&gt;

==Criticism and defense==
===Lack of structurability===
In his letter to an editor in 1975 titled &quot;How do we tell truths that might hurt?&quot;, which was critical of several programming languages contemporaneous with COBOL, computer scientist and [[Turing Award]] recipient [[Edsger Dijkstra]] remarked that &quot;The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dijkstra1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD498.html|title=E. W. Dijkstra Archive: How do we tell truths that might hurt? (EWD498)|accessdate=August 29, 2007|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|year=2006|author=Dijkstra }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his dissenting response to Dijkstra's article and the above &quot;offensive statement&quot;, computer scientist Howard E. Tompkins defended structured COBOL: &quot;COBOL programs with convoluted control flow indeed tend to 'cripple the mind'&quot;, but this was because &quot;there are too many such business application programs written by programmers that have never had the benefit of structured COBOL taught well...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''In Defense of Teaching Structured COBOL as Computer Science''&quot;, Howard E. Tompkins, ACM SIGPLAN Notices, Vol. 18, Issue 4, April 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the introduction of OO-COBOL has added support for [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] code as well as user-defined functions and user-defined data types to COBOL's repertoire.

===Verbose syntax===
COBOL 85 was not fully compatible with earlier versions, resulting in the &quot;cesarean birth of COBOL 85&quot;.  Joseph T. Brophy, [[Chief Information Officer|CIO]], [[St. Paul Travelers|Travelers Insurance]], spearheaded an effort to inform users of COBOL of the heavy reprogramming costs of implementing the new standard.  As a result the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI COBOL Committee]] received more than 3,200 letters from the public, mostly negative, requiring the committee to make changes.  On the other hand, conversion to COBOL 85 was thought to increase productivity in future years, thus justifying the conversion costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The COBOL 85 example book|first = Jerome|last = Garfunkel|publisher = Wiley|location = New York|year = 1987|isbn = 0471804614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBOL syntax has often been criticized for its verbosity. However, proponents are quick to note that this was an intentional part of the language design and considered by many to be one of the COBOL's strengths. One of the design goals of COBOL was for COBOL code to be readable and understandable to non-programmers such as managers, supervisors and users. This is why COBOL has a very English-like syntax and structural elements&amp;mdash;including: nouns, verbs, clauses, sentences, sections, and divisions. Consequently, COBOL is considered by at least one source to be &quot;the most readable, understandable and self-documenting programming language in use today. [...] Not only does this readability generally assist the maintenance process but the older a program gets the more valuable this readability becomes.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cobol-intro&quot;&gt;[http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/Course/COBOLIntro.htm#part1 COBOL Tutorial - Introduction to COBOL]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the mere ability to read and understand a few lines of COBOL code does not grant to an executive or end user the experience and knowledge needed to design, build, and maintain large software systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Other defenses===

Additionally, traditional COBOL is a simple language with a limited scope of function (with no pointers, no user-defined types, and no user-defined functions), encouraging a straightforward coding style.  This has made it well-suited to its primary domain of business computing&amp;mdash;where the program complexity lies in the business rules that need to be encoded rather than sophisticated algorithms or data structures. And because the standard does not belong to any particular vendor, programs written in COBOL are highly portable.  The language can be used on a wide variety of hardware platforms and operating systems.  And the rigid hierarchical structure restricts the definition of external references to the Environment Division, which simplifies platform changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cobol-intro&quot; /&gt;

[[File:STS-112 crew.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Crew of a [[spacecraft]].]]
A '''crew''' is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization. A location in which a crew works is called a '''crewyard''' or a '''workyard'''. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a [[chain of command]]. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes [[Commissioned officer|officer]]s from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company. Members of a crew are often referred to by the title &quot;[[Crewman]]&quot;.

&quot;Crew&quot; also refers to the sport of [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], where teams row competitively in racing shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speedrower.com/index.htm |title=Speed Rower, Competive Rowing |accessdate=2009-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Crew&quot; is used colloquially to refer to a small, tight-knit group of friends or associates engaged in criminal activity.  Also used in reference to the traditional &quot;unit&quot; of criminals under the supervision of a [[caporegime]] in the American Mafia.  However, the term is not specific to (Mafia-affiliated) [[organized crime]].

Crew can refer simply to a group of friends, unrelated to crime or violence. Many of these &quot;crews&quot; exist through [[MySpace]], and the crew's initials were often placed in square brackets in a person's MySpace name. This was a common trend around 2007-early 2008.

[[Image:CCD.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A specially developed CCD used for [[ultraviolet]] imaging in a wire bonded package.]]

A '''charge-coupled device''' ('''CCD''') is a device for the movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value. This is achieved by &quot;shifting&quot; the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive ''bins'' in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins.

Often the device is integrated with an [[image sensor]], such as a [[photoelectric]] device to produce the charge that is being read, thus making the CCD a major technology for [[digital imaging]]. Although CCDs are not the only technology to allow for light detection, CCDs are widely used in professional, medical, and scientific applications where high-quality image data is required.

==History==
The charge-coupled device was invented in 1969 at [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] [[Bell Labs]] by [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]]. The lab was working on [[semiconductor]] [[bubble memory]] when Boyle and Smith conceived of the design of what they termed, in their notebook, &quot;Charge 'Bubble' Devices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A description of how the device could be used as a [[shift register]] and as a linear and area imaging devices was described in this first entry. The essence of the design was the ability to transfer charge along the surface of a semiconductor from one storage capacitor to the next. The concept was similar in principle to the [[bucket-brigade device]] (BBD), which was developed at Philips Research Labs during the late 1960's.

Several companies, including [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], [[RCA]] and [[Texas Instruments]], picked up on the invention and began development programs. Fairchild's effort, led by ex-Bell researcher [[Gil Amelio]], was the first with commercial devices, and by 1974 had a linear 500-element device and a 2-D 100 x 100 pixel device. The first [[KH-11 KENNAN]] reconnaissance satellite equipped with charge-coupled device array technology for imaging was launched in December 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRO review and redaction guide (2006 ed.)| url=http://www.fas.org/irp/nro/declass.pdf |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the leadership of [[Kazuo Iwama]], [[Sony]] also started a big development effort on CCDs involving a significant investment. Eventually, Sony managed to mass produce CCDs for their camcorders. Before this happened, Iwama died in August 1982; subsequently, a CCD chip was placed on his tombstone to acknowledge his contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Johnstone |first=B. |title=We Were Burning: Japanese Entrepreneurs and the Forging of the Electronic Age |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=0465091172 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basics of operation==
[[File:CCD charge transfer animation.gif|thumb|250px|right|The charge packets (electrons, blue) are collected in potential wells (yellow) created by applying positive voltage at the gate electrodes (G). Applying positive voltage to the gate electrode in the correct sequence transfers the charge packets.]]

In a CCD for capturing images, there is a photoactive region (an [[Epitaxy|epitaxial]] layer of silicon), and a transmission region made out of a shift register (the CCD, properly speaking).

An image is projected through a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] onto the capacitor array (the photoactive region), causing each capacitor to accumulate an electric charge proportional to the [[light]] intensity at that location. A one-dimensional array, used in line-scan cameras, captures a single slice of the image, while a two-dimensional array, used in video and still cameras, captures a two-dimensional picture corresponding to the scene projected onto the focal plane of the sensor. Once the array has been exposed to the image, a control circuit causes each capacitor to transfer its contents to its neighbor (operating as a shift register). The last capacitor in the array dumps its charge into a [[charge amplifier]], which converts the charge into a [[voltage]]. By repeating this process, the controlling circuit converts the entire contents of the array in the semiconductor to a sequence of voltages.  In a digital device, these voltages are then sampled, digitized, and usually stored in memory; in an analog device (such as an analog video camera), they are processed into a continuous analog signal (e.g. by feeding the output of the charge amplifier into a low-pass filter) which is then processed and fed out to other circuits for transmission, recording, or other processing.

[[Image:CCD line sensor.JPG|thumb|right|&quot;One-dimensional&quot; CCD [[image sensor]] from a [[fax machine]].]]

==Detailed physics of operation==
The photoactive region of the CCD is, generally, an [[epitaxial]] layer of [[silicon]]. It has a doping of p+ ([[Boron]]) and is grown upon a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] material, often p++. In buried channel devices, the type of design utilized in most modern CCDs, certain areas of the surface of the silicon are [[ion implantation|ion implanted]] with [[phosphorus]], giving them an n-doped designation. This region defines the channel in which the photogenerated charge packets will travel. The gate oxide, i.e. the [[capacitor]] [[dielectric]], is grown on top of the epitaxial layer and substrate.

Later on in the process [[polysilicon]] gates are deposited by [[chemical vapor deposition]], patterned with [[photolithography]], and etched in such a way that the separately phased gates lie perpendicular to the channels. The channels are further defined by utilization of the [[LOCOS]] process to produce the [[channel stop]] region.

Channel stops are thermally grown [[oxide]]s that serve to isolate the charge packets in one column from those in another. These channel stops are produced before the polysilicon gates are, as the LOCOS process utilizes a high temperature step that would destroy the gate material. The channels stops are parallel to, and exclusive of, the channel, or &quot;charge carrying&quot;, regions.

Channel stops often have a p+ doped region underlying them, providing a further barrier to the electrons in the charge packets (this discussion of the physics of CCD devices assumes an [[electron]] transfer device, though hole transfer is possible).

The clocking of the gates, alternately high and low, will forward and reverse bias to the diode that is provided by the buried channel (n-doped) and the epitaxial layer (p-doped). This will cause the CCD to deplete, near the [[p-n junction]] and will collect and move the charge packets beneath the gates—and within the channels—of the device.

CCD manufacturing and operation can be optimized for different uses. The above process describes a frame transfer CCD. While CCDs may be manufactured on a heavily doped p++ wafer it is also possible to manufacture a device inside p-wells that have been placed on an n-wafer. This second method, reportedly, reduces smear, [[Dark current (physics)|dark current]], and [[infrared]] and red response. This method of manufacture is used in the construction of interline transfer devices.

Another version of CCD is called a peristaltic CCD. In a peristaltic charge-coupled device, the charge packet transfer operation is analogous to the peristaltic contraction and dilation of the [[digestive system]]. The peristaltic CCD has an additional implant that keeps the charge away from the silicon/[[silicon dioxide]] interface and generates a large lateral electric field from one gate to the next. This provides an additional driving force to aid in transfer of the charge packets.

==Architecture==
The CCD image sensors can be implemented in several different architectures. The most common are full-frame, frame-transfer, and interline. The distinguishing characteristic of each of these architectures is their approach to the problem of shuttering.

In a full-frame device, all of the image area is active, and there is no electronic shutter. A mechanical shutter must be added to this type of sensor or the image smears as the device is clocked or read out.

With a [[frame-transfer CCD]], half of the silicon area is covered by an opaque mask (typically aluminum). The image can be quickly transferred from the image area to the opaque area or storage region with acceptable smear of a few percent. That image can then be read out slowly from the storage region while a new image is integrating or exposing in the active area. Frame-transfer devices typically do not require a mechanical shutter and were a common architecture for early solid-state broadcast cameras. The downside to the frame-transfer architecture is that it requires twice the silicon real estate of an equivalent full-frame device; hence, it costs roughly twice as much.

The interline architecture extends this concept one step further and masks every other column of the image sensor for storage. In this device, only one pixel shift has to occur to transfer from image area to storage area; thus, shutter times can be less than a microsecond and smear is essentially eliminated. The advantage is not free, however, as the imaging area is now covered by opaque strips dropping the [[fill factor]] to approximately 50 percent and the effective [[quantum efficiency]] by an equivalent amount. Modern designs have addressed this deleterious characteristic by adding microlenses on the surface of the device to direct light away from the opaque regions and on the active area. Microlenses can bring the fill factor back up to 90 percent or more depending on pixel size and the overall system's optical design.

The choice of architecture comes down to one of utility. If the application cannot tolerate an expensive, failure-prone, power-intensive mechanical shutter, an interline device is the right choice. Consumer snap-shot cameras have used interline devices. On the other hand, for those applications that require the best possible light collection and issues of money, power and time are less important, the full-frame device is the right choice. Astronomers tend to prefer full-frame devices. The frame-transfer falls in between and was a common choice before the fill-factor issue of interline devices was addressed. Today, frame-transfer is usually chosen when an interline architecture is not available, such as in a back-illuminated device.

CCDs containing grids of [[pixel]]s are used in [[digital camera]]s, [[image scanner|optical scanners]], and video cameras as light-sensing devices. They commonly respond to 70 percent of the [[wiktionary:incident|incident]] light (meaning a quantum efficiency of about 70 percent) making them far more efficient than [[photographic film]], which captures only about 2 percent of the incident light.

[[Image:2.1 MP CCD Close Up.JPG|thumb|right|CCD from a 2.1 [[megapixel]] [[Hewlett-Packard]] digital camera.]]

Most common types of CCDs are sensitive to near-infrared light, which allows [[infrared photography]], [[night-vision]] devices, and zero [[lux]] (or near zero lux) video-recording/photography. For normal silicon-based detectors, the sensitivity is limited to 1.1&amp;nbsp;μm. One other consequence of their sensitivity to infrared is that infrared from [[remote control]]s often appears on CCD-based digital cameras or camcorders if they do not have infrared blockers.

Cooling reduces the array's [[Dark current (physics)|dark current]], improving the sensitivity of the CCD to low light intensities, even for ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. Professional observatories often cool their detectors with [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce the dark current, and therefore the [[thermal noise]], to negligible levels.

==Use in astronomy==
Due to the high quantum efficiencies of CCDs, linearity of their outputs (one count for one photon of light), ease of use compared to photographic plates, and a variety of other reasons, CCDs were very rapidly adopted by astronomers for nearly all UV-to-infrared applications.

Thermal noise and [[cosmic ray]]s may alter the pixels in the CCD array. To counter such effects, astronomers take several exposures with the CCD shutter closed and opened. The average of images taken with the shutter closed is necessary to lower the random noise. Once developed, the [[dark frame subtraction|''dark frame'' average image is then subtracted]] from the open-shutter image to remove the dark current and other systematic defects ([[dead pixel]]s, hot pixels, etc.) in the CCD.

The [[Hubble Space Telescope]], in particular, has a highly developed series of steps (“data reduction pipeline”) to convert the raw CCD data to useful images. See the references for a more in-depth description of the steps in astronomical CCD image-data correction and processing.&lt;ref name = &quot;ESO-Hainaut-CCD image processing&quot;&gt;

CCD cameras used in [[astrophotography]] often require sturdy mounts to cope with vibrations from wind and other sources, along with the tremendous weight of most imaging platforms. To take long exposures of galaxies and nebulae, many astronomers use a technique known as [[autoguider|auto-guiding]]. Most autoguiders use a second CCD chip to monitor deviations during imaging. This chip can rapidly detect errors in tracking and command the mount motors to correct for them.

[[Image:SDSSFaceplate.gif|thumb|right|Array of 30 CCDs used on [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] telescope imaging camera, an example of &quot;drift-scanning.&quot;]]

An interesting unusual astronomical application of CCDs, called ''drift-scanning'', uses a CCD to make a fixed telescope behave like a tracking telescope and follow the motion of the sky. The charges in the CCD are transferred and read in a direction parallel to the motion of the sky, and at the same speed. In this way, the telescope can image a larger region of the sky than its normal field of view. The [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] is the most famous example of this, using the technique to produce the largest uniform survey of the sky yet accomplished.

In addition to astronomy, CCDs are also used in laboratory analytical instrumentation such as [[monocromator|monochromators]], [[spectrometer]]s, and [[N-Slit interferometer|N-slit laser interferometers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]], ''Tunable Laser Optics'' (Elsevier Academic, New York, 2003) Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color cameras==
[[Image:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|A [[Bayer filter]] on a CCD]]
[[Image:Ccd-sensor.jpg|thumb|CCD color sensor]]
Digital color cameras generally use a [[Bayer filter|Bayer mask]] over the CCD. Each square of four pixels has one filtered red, one blue, and two green (the [[human eye]] is more sensitive to green than either red or blue). The result of this is that [[luminance]] information is collected at every pixel, but the color resolution is lower than the luminance resolution.

Better color separation can be reached by three-CCD devices ([[3CCD]]) and a [[Dichroic prism|dichroic beam splitter prism]], that splits the [[image]] into [[red]], [[green]] and [[blue]] components. Each of the three CCDs is arranged to respond to a particular color. Most [[Professional video camera|professional video]] camcorders, and some semi-professional camcorders, use this technique. Another advantage of 3CCD over a Bayer mask device is higher [[quantum efficiency]] (and therefore higher light sensitivity for a given aperture size). This is because in a 3CCD device most of the light entering the aperture is captured by a sensor, while a Bayer mask absorbs a high proportion (about 2/3) of the light falling on each CCD pixel.

For still scenes, for instance in microscopy, the resolution of a Bayer mask device can be enhanced by  [[Microscanning]] technology. During the process of [[Co-site sampling|color co-site sampling]], several frames of the scene are produced. Between acquisitions, the sensor is moved in pixel dimensions, so that each point in the visual field is acquired consecutively by elements of the mask that are sensitive to the red, green and blue components of its color. Eventually every pixel in the image has been scanned at least once in each color and the resolution of the three channels become equivalent (the resolutions of red and blue channels are quadrupled while the green channel is doubled).

===Sensor sizes===
Sensors (CCD / CMOS) are often referred to with an inch fraction designation such as 1/1.8&quot; or 2/3&quot; called the [[optical format]]. This measurement actually originates back in the 1950s and the time of [[Video camera tube|Vidicon tubes]]. Compact digital cameras and Digicams typically have much smaller sensors than a digital SLR and are thus less sensitive to light and inherently more prone to noise. Some examples of the CCDs found in modern cameras can be found in [http://www.dpreview.com/news/0210/02100402sensorsizes.asp#bottom this table] in a Digital Photography Review article

==Electron-multiplying CCD==
[[Image:EMCCD2 color en.svg|thumb|Electrons are transferred serially through the gain stages making up the multiplication register of an EMCCD. The high voltages used in these serial transfers induce the creation of additional charge carriers through impact ionisation.]]
[[Image:Output vs input electrons.png|thumb|There is a dispersion (variation) in the number of electrons output by the multiplication register for a given (fixed) number of input electrons (shown in the legend on the right). The probability distribution for the number of output electrons is plotted [[logarithm]]ically on the vertical axis for a simulation of a multiplication register. Also shown are results from the [[Empiricism|empirical]] fit equation shown on this page.]]

An '''electron-multiplying CCD''' (EMCCD, also known as an L3Vision CCD, L3CCD or Impactron CCD) is a charge-coupled device in which a gain register is placed between the shift register and the output amplifier. The gain register is split up into a large number of stages. In each stage the electrons are multiplied by [[impact ionization]] in a similar way to an [[avalanche diode]]. The gain probability at every stage of the register is small (''P'' &lt; 2%) but as the number of elements is large (N &gt; 500), the overall gain can be very high (&lt;math&gt;g = (1 + P)^N&lt;/math&gt;), with single input electrons giving many thousands of output electrons. Reading a signal from a CCD gives a noise background, typically a few electrons. In an EMCCD this noise is superimposed on many thousands of electrons rather than a single electron; the devices thus have negligible readout noise.

EMCCDs show a similar sensitivity to [[Charge-coupled device#Intensified charge-coupled device|Intensified CCDs]] (ICCDs). However, as with ICCDs, the gain that is applied in the gain register is stochastic and the ''exact'' gain that has been applied to a pixel's charge is impossible to know. At high gains (&gt; 30), this uncertainty has the same effect on the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) as halving the [[quantum efficiency]] with respect to operation with a gain of unity. However, at very low light levels (where the quantum efficiency is most important) it can be assumed that a pixel either contains an electron - or not. This removes the noise associated with the stochastic multiplication at the cost of counting multiple electrons in the same pixel as a single electron. The dispersion in the gain is shown in the graph on the right. For multiplication registers with many elements and large gains it is well modelled by the equation:

&lt;math&gt;P\left (n \right )  = \frac{\left
   (n-m+1\right )^{m-1}}{\left (m-1 \right )!\left
   (g-1+\frac{1}{m}\right )^{m}}\exp \left ( -
   \frac{n-m+1}{g-1+\frac{1}{m}}\right )&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n \ge m &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the probability of getting ''n'' output electrons given ''m'' input electrons and a total mean multiplication register gain of ''g''.

Because of the lower costs and the somewhat better resolution EMCCDs are capable of replacing ICCDs in many applications. ICCDs still have the advantage that they can be gated very fast and thus are useful in applications like [[range-gated imaging]]. EMCCD cameras indispensably need a cooling system to cool the chip down to temperatures around 170 [[Kelvin|K]]. This cooling system unfortunately adds additional costs to the EMCCD imaging system and often yields heavy condensation problems in the application.

The low-light capabilities of L3CCDs are starting to find use in astronomy. In particular their low noise at high readout speeds makes them very useful for [[lucky imaging]] of faint stars, and high speed photon counting photometry.

Commercial EMCCD cameras typically have clock-induced charge  and dark current (dependent on the extent of cooling) that leads to an effective readout noise ranging from 0.01 to 1 electrons per pixel read.  Custom-built deep-cooled non-inverting mode EMCCD cameras have provided effective readout noise lower than 0.1 electrons per pixel read [http://www.ing.iac.es/~smt/LLLCCD/L3Poster.pdf] for [[lucky imaging]] observations.

==Frame transfer CCD==
[[Image:Frame Transfer CCD.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A frame transfer CCD for startracker applications.]]
[[Image:Vertical smear.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vertical smear.]]

A '''frame transfer CCD''' is a specialized CCD, often used in [[astronomy]] and some [[professional video camera]]s, designed for high exposure efficiency and correctness.

The normal functioning of a CCD, astronomical or otherwise, can be divided into two phases: exposure and readout. During the first phase, the CCD passively collects incoming [[photon]]s, storing [[electron]]s in its cells. After the exposure time is passed, the cells are read out one line at a time.

During the readout phase, cells are shifted down the entire area of the CCD. While they are shifted, they continue to collect light. Thus, if the shifting is not fast enough, errors can result from light that falls on a cell holding charge during the transfer.  These errors are referred to as &quot;vertical smear&quot; and cause a strong light source to create a vertical line above and below its exact location. In addition, the CCD cannot be used to collect light while it is being read out. Unfortunately, a faster shifting requires a faster readout, and a faster readout can introduce errors in the cell charge measurement, leading to a higher noise level.

A frame transfer CCD solves both problems: it has a hidden, not normally used, area containing as many cells as the area exposed to light. Typically, this area is covered by a reflective material such as aluminium. When the exposure time is up, the cells are transferred very rapidly to the hidden area. Here, safe from any incoming light, cells can be read out at any speed one deems necessary to correctly measure the cells' charge. At the same time, the exposed part of the CCD is collecting light again, so no delay occurs between successive exposures.

The disadvantage of such a CCD is the higher cost: the cell area is basically doubled, and more complex control electronics are needed.

==Intensified charge-coupled device==
An intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) is a CCD that is optically connected to an image intensifier that is mounted in front of the CCD.

An image intensifier includes three functional elements: a [[photocathode]], a [[micro-channel plate]] (MCP) and a [[phosphor]] screen. These three elements are mounted one close behind the other in the mentioned sequence. The photons which are coming from the light source fall onto the photocathode, thereby generating photoelectrons. The photoelectrons are accelerated towards the MCP by an electrical control voltage, applied between photocathode and MCP. The electrons are multiplied inside of the MCP and thereafter accelerated towards the phosphor screen. The phosphor screen finally converts the multiplied electrons back to photons which are guided to the CCD by a fiber optic or a lens.

An image intensifier inherently includes a [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] functionality: If the control voltage between the photocathode and the MCP is reversed, the emitted photoelectrons are not accelerated towards the MCP but return to the photocathode. Thus, no electrons are multiplied and emitted by the MCP, no electrons are going to the phosphor screen and no light is emitted from the image intensifier. In this case no light falls onto the CCD, which means that the shutter is closed. The process of reversing the control voltage at the photocathode is called [[gating]] and therefore ICCDs are also called gateable CCD cameras.

Beside of the extremely high sensitivity of ICCD cameras, which enable single photon detection, the gateability is one of the major advantages of the ICCD over the [[Charge-coupled device#Electron-multiplying CCD|EMCCD]] cameras. The highest performing ICCD cameras enable shutter times as short as 200 [[picosecond]]s.

ICCD cameras are in general somewhat higher in price than EMCCD cameras because they need the expensive image intensifier. On the other hand EMCCD cameras need a cooling system to cool the EMCCD chip down to temperatures around 170 [[Kelvin|K]]. This cooling system adds additional costs to the EMCCD camera and often yields heavy condensation problems in the application.

ICCDs are used in [[night vision devices]] and in a large variety of scientific applications.

{{Memory types}}

In [[computing]], '''memory''' refers to the [[state (computer science)|state information]] of a computing system, as it is kept active in some physical structure. The term &quot;memory&quot; is used for the information in physical systems which are fast (i.e. [[RAM]]), as a distinction from physical systems which are slow to access (i.e. [[Computer data storage|data storage]]). By design, the term &quot;memory&quot; refers to temporary state devices, whereas the term &quot;storage&quot; is reserved for permanent data. Advances in storage technology have blurred the distinction a bit —memory kept on what is conventionally a storage system is called &quot;[[virtual memory]]&quot;. 

Colloquially, '''computer memory''' refers to the physical devices used to store data or programs (sequences of instructions) on a temporary or permanent basis for use in an electronic digital [[computer]]. Computers represent information in [[binary code]], written as sequences of 0s and 1s. Each binary digit (or &quot;bit&quot;) may be stored by any physical system that can be in either of two stable states, to represent 0 and 1. Such a system is called bistable. This could be an on-off switch, an electrical capacitor that can store or lose a charge, a magnet with its polarity up or down, or a surface that can have a pit or not. Today, capacitors and transistors, functioning as tiny electrical switches, are used for temporary storage, and either disks or tape with a magnetic coating, or plastic discs with patterns of pits are used for long-term storage.

Computer memory is usually meant to refer to the [[semiconductor]] technology that is used to store information in [[Electronics|electronic]] devices.  Current primary computer memory makes use of [[integrated circuits]] consisting of [[silicon]]-based [[transistors]]. There are two main types of memory: [[volatile memory|volatile]] and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]].

==History==
[[Image:ENIAC Penn2.jpg|left|thumbnail|200px|thumb|Detail of the back of a section of ENIAC, showing vacuum tubes]]
In the early 1940s, memory technology mostly permitted a capacity of a few bytes.  The first programmable [[digital computer]], the [[ENIAC]], using thousands of octal-base radio [[vacuum tube]]s, could perform simple calculations involving 20 numbers of ten decimal digits which were held in the vacuum tube [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]s.  

The next significant advance in computer memory was with acoustic [[delay line memory]] developed by [[J. Presper Eckert]] in the early 1940s.  Through the construction of a glass tube filled with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and plugged at each end with a quartz crystal, delay lines could store bits of information within the quartz and transfer it through sound waves propagating through mercury.  [[Delay line memory]] would be limited to a capacity of up to a few hundred thousand bits to remain efficient.  

Two alternatives to the delay line, the [[Williams tube]] and [[Selectron tube]], were developed in 1946, both using electron beams in glass tubes as means of storage.  Using [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[Fred Williams]] would invent the Williams tube, which would be the first [[random access memory|random access computer memory]].  The Williams tube would prove to be advantageous to the Selectron tube because of its greater capacity (the Selectron was limited to 256 bits, while the Williams tube could store thousands) and being less expensive.  The Williams tube would nevertheless prove to be frustratingly sensitive to environmental disturbances.

Efforts began in the late 1940s to find [[non-volatile memory]].  [[Jay Forrester]], [[Jan A. Rajchman]] and [[An Wang]] would be credited with the development of [[magnetic core memory]], which would allow for recall of memory after power loss.  Magnetic core memory would become the dominant form of memory until the development of [[transistor]] based memory in the late 1960s.

==Volatile memory==
[[Volatile memory]] is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information.  Most modern [[semiconductor]] volatile memory is either Static RAM (see [[Static random access memory|SRAM]]) or dynamic RAM (see [[DRAM]]). SRAM retains its contents as long as the power is connected and is easy to interface to but uses six transistors per bit. Dynamic RAM is more complicated to interface to and control and needs regular refresh cycles to prevent its contents being lost.  However, DRAM uses only one transistor and a capacitor per bit, allowing it to reach much higher densities and, with more bits on a memory chip, be much cheaper per bit. SRAM is not worthwhile for desktop system memory, where DRAM dominates, but is used for their cache memories.  SRAM is commonplace in small embedded systems, which might only need tens of kilobytes or less. Upcoming volatile memory technologies that hope to replace or compete with SRAM and DRAM include [[Z-RAM]], [[TTRAM]], [[A-RAM]] and [[ETA RAM]].

==Non-volatile memory==
[[Non-volatile memory]] is computer memory that can retain the stored information even when not powered. Examples of non-volatile memory include read-only memory (see [[Read-only memory|ROM]]), [[flash memory]], most types of magnetic computer storage devices (e.g. [[hard disks]], [[floppy discs]] and [[magnetic tape]]), [[optical discs]], and early computer storage methods such as [[paper tape]] and [[punched cards]]. Upcoming non-volatile memory technologies include [[FeRAM]], [[CBRAM]], [[Parallel Random Access Machine|PRAM]], [[SONOS]], [[RRAM]], [[Racetrack memory]], [[Nano-RAM|NRAM]] and [[Millipede memory|Millipede]].

==Management of memory==
{{Mergeto|Memory management|date=February 2011}}
{{Main|Memory management}}
Proper management of memory is vital for a computer system to operate properly. Modern [[operating system]]s have complex systems to properly manage memory. Failure to do so can lead to bugs, slow performance, and at worst case, takeover by viruses and malicious software.

Nearly everything a computer programmer does requires him or her to consider how to manage memory. Even storing a number in memory requires the programmer to specify how the memory should store it.

===Memory management bugs===
Improper management of memory is a common cause of bugs.

*In [[arithmetic overflow]], a calculation results in a number larger than the allocated memory permits. For example, an 8-bit integer allows the numbers −127 to +127. If its value is 127 and it is instructed to add one, the computer can not store the number 128 in that space. Such a case will result in undesired operation, such as changing the number's value to −128 instead of +128.

*A [[memory leak]] occurs when a program requests memory from the operating system and never returns the memory when it's done with it. A program with this bug will gradually require more and more memory until the program fails as it runs out.

*A [[segmentation fault]] results when a program tries to access memory that it has no permission to access. Generally a program doing so will be terminated by the operating system.

*[[Buffer overflow]] means that a program writes data to the end of its allocated space and then continues to write data to memory that belongs to other programs. This may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, a crash, or a breach of system security. They are thus the basis of many software vulnerabilities and can be maliciously exploited.

===Early computer systems===
In early computer systems, programs typically specified the location to write memory and what data to put there. This location was a physical location on the actual memory hardware. The slow processing of such computers didn't allow for the complex memory management systems used today. Also, as most such systems were single-task, sophisticated systems weren't required as much.

This approach has its pitfalls. If the location specified is incorrect, this will cause the computer to write the data to some other part of the program. The results of an error like this are unpredictable. In some cases, the incorrect data might overwrite memory used by the operating system. Computer crackers can take advantage of this to create viruses and malware.

===Virtual memory===
{{main|virtual memory}}

'''Virtual memory''' is a system where all physical memory is controlled by the operating system. When a program needs memory, it requests it from the operating system. The operating system then decides what physical location to place the memory in.

This offers several advantages. Computer programmers no longer need to worry about where the memory is physically stored or whether the user's computer will have enough memory. It also allows multiple types of memory to be used. For example, some memory can be stored in physical RAM chips while other memory is stored on a hard drive. This drastically increases the amount of memory available to programs. The operating system will place actively used memory in physical RAM, which is much faster than hard disks. When the amount of RAM is not sufficient to run all the current programs, it can result in a situation where the computer spends more time moving memory from RAM to disk and back than it does accomplishing tasks; this is known as [[Thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]].

Virtual memory systems usually include protected memory, but this is not always the case.

===Protected memory===
{{main|memory protection}}

'''Protected memory''' is a system where each program is given an area of memory to use and is not permitted to go outside that range. Use of protected memory greatly enhances both the reliability and security of a computer system.

Without protected memory, it is possible that a bug in one program will alter the memory used by another program. This will cause that other program to run off of corrupted memory with unpredictable results. If the operating system's memory is corrupted, the entire computer system may crash and need to be rebooted. At times programs intentionally alter the memory used by other programs. This is done by viruses and malware to take over computers.

Protected memory assigns programs their own areas of memory. If the operating system detects that a program has tried to alter memory that doesn't belong to it, the program is terminated. This way, only the offending program crashes, and other programs are not affected by the error.

Protected memory systems almost always include virtual memory as well.

The new agency was a branch of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and Atlanta was chosen as the location because [[malaria]] was endemic in the Southern United States. The agency changed names (see infobox on top right) before adopting the title '''Communicable Disease Center''' in 1946. Offices were located on the sixth floor of the Volunteer Building on Peachtree Street. With a budget at the time of about $1 million, 59 percent of its personnel were engaged in [[mosquito]] abatement and habitat control with the objective of control and eradication of malaria in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Division of Parasitic Diseases |title=Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA) (1942-1945) |work=The History of Malaria, an Ancient Disease (2004) |publisher='''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''' |location=[[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] |date=2010-02-08 |url=

Among its 369 employees, the main jobs at CDC were originally [[entomology]] and [[engineering]]. In CDC's initial years, more than six and a half million homes were sprayed.  In 1946, there were only seven medical officers on duty and an early organization chart was drawn, somewhat fancifully, in the shape of a mosquito.

CDC leader Dr. [[Joseph Mountin]] continued to advocate for public health issues and to push for CDC to extend its responsibilities to many other [[Infectious disease|communicable diseases]]. In 1947, CDC made a token payment of $10 to [[Emory University]] for {{convert|15|acre|m2}} of land on Clifton Road in DeKalb County, the home of CDC headquarters today. CDC employees collected the money to make the purchase. The benefactor behind the “gift” was [[Robert Woodruff]], [[Chairman of the Board]] of the [[Coca-Cola Company]]. Woodruff had a long-time interest in [[malaria]] control; it had been a problem in areas where he went hunting.

The mission of CDC expanded beyond its original focus on malaria to include [[sexually transmitted disease]]s when the Venereal Disease Division of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) was transferred to the CDC in [[1957]]. Shortly thereafter, Tuberculosis Control was transferred (in [[1960]]) to the CDC from PHS, and then in [[1963]] the Immunization program was established.&lt;ref&gt;Beth E. Meyerson, Fred A. Martich, and Gerald P. Naehr (2008). ''Ready to Go: The History and Contributions of U.S. Public Health Advisors''. (Research Triangle Park: American Social Health Association).&lt;/ref&gt;

It became the '''National Communicable Disease Center (NCDC)''' effective July 1, 1967.&lt;ref name=NARA/&gt; The organization was renamed the '''Center for Disease Control (CDC)''' on June 24, 1970, and '''Centers for Disease Control''' effective October 14, 1980.&lt;ref name=NARA/&gt; An act of the [[United States Congress]] appended the words &quot;and Prevention&quot; to the name effective October 27, 1992; however, Congress directed that the initialism ''CDC'' be retained because of its name recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= CDC |title= CDC: the nation's prevention agency |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=41 |issue=44 |page=833 |year=1992 |pmid=1331740 |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00017924.htm|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKrUfGZ8 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDC now operates under the Department of Health and Human Services umbrella.

Currently the CDC focus has broadened to include [[Chronic (medical)|chronic diseases]], [[Disability|disabilities]], injury control, [[Occupational safety and health|workplace hazards]], [[environmental health]] threats, and [[terrorism]] preparedness. CDC combats emerging diseases and other health risks, including [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]], [[West Nile virus]], [[obesity]], [[Avian influenza|avian]], [[Swine influenza|swine]], and [[pandemic flu]], [[E. coli]], auto wrecks, and [[bioterrorism]], to name a few.  The organization would also prove to be an important factor in preventing the abuse of [[penicillin]].

In May 1994 the CDC admitted to having sent several biological warfare agents to Iraq from 1984 through 1989, including [[Botulinum toxin]], [[West Nile virus]], [[Yersinia pestis]] and [[Dengue fever]] virus.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The eleventh plague: the politics of biological and chemical warfare&quot; (p. 84-86) by [http://www.leonardcole.com Leonard A. Cole] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC has one of the few [[Biosafety Level 4]] laboratories in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/disinfo.htm|title=CDC Special Pathogens Branch|accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of only two official repositories of [[smallpox]] in the world. The second smallpox store resides at the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].

The CDC campus in Atlanta houses facilities for the research of extremely dangerous biological agents. This setting was featured in the Dustin Hoffman film ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'', although the location depicted in the film was supposed to be the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] bio-research facility. The CDC figures prominently in the book &quot;Ready to Go: The History and Contributions of U.S. Public Health Advisors&quot; by B.E. Meyerson, F.A. Martich and G.P. Naehr (ASHA, 2008). The CDC labs figure prominently in the books &quot;[[The Demon in the Freezer]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Hot Zone]]&quot; by [[Richard Preston]] and &quot;Virus Hunter&quot; by C.J. Peters, former head of the Special Pathogens Branch at the CDC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The &quot;Atlanta Plague center&quot; which is in all likelihood a fictionalized version of the CDC appears in the [[Stephen King]] book [[The Stand]].  It was mentioned numerous times in the film [[Mission: Impossible II]].

It has been recently featured as a topic of &quot;Haven&quot; and &quot;TS-19&quot; in the popular AMC original televised production; [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]. The building shown in the show was, however, not the CDC itself but the [[Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre]].

On May 18, 2011, the CDC issues a guide on its blog telling people how to prepare for a zombie apocalypse. The effort was part of an outreach campaign hoping to utilize popular culture to educate the general public about all-hazards preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraven|first=Vlad|title=CDC Zombie Warning|url=http://vladkraven.com/cdc-zombie-warning/|work=&quot;Earlier today the CDC (Center for Disease Controls and Prevention) issued a preparedness guide on their blog, informing citizens on how to be ready for the rise of the undead.&quot;|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chandrasekhar limit''' is an upper bound on the mass of a [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|stable]] [[white dwarf]] [[star]].  It was named after [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], the Indian [[astrophysicist]] who predicted it in 1930.  White dwarfs, unlike [[main sequence]] stars, resist [[gravitational collapse]] primarily through [[electron degeneracy pressure]], rather than [[Pressure#Pressure_of_an_ideal_gas|thermal pressure]].  The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction.  Consequently, white dwarfs with masses greater than the limit undergo further gravitational collapse, [[Stellar evolution|evolving]] into a different type of [[Compact star|stellar remnant]], such as a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]].  Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs.  The Chandrasekhar limit is analogous to the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]] for neutron stars.

The currently accepted numerical value of the limit is about 1.4 [[solar masses|&lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}M_\odot\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;]], or 2.8&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;p. 55, How A Supernova Explodes, Hans A.

==Physics==
Electron degeneracy pressure is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] effect arising from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Since [[electron]]s are [[fermion]]s, no two electrons can be in the same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a band of energy levels. Compression of the electron gas increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the maximum energy level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons will increase upon compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of [[electron capture]], relieving the pressure.
[[Image:WhiteDwarf mass-radius.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Radius–mass relations for a model white dwarf. The green curve uses the general pressure law for an ideal [[Fermi gas]], while the blue curve is for a non-relativistic ideal Fermi gas. The black line marks the [[ultra-relativistic limit]].]]
In the nonrelativistic case, electron degeneracy pressure gives rise to an [[equation of state]] of the form &lt;math&gt;P = K_1 \rho^{5\over 3}&lt;/math&gt;. Solving the hydrostatic equation leads to a model white dwarf which is a [[polytrope]] of index 3/2 and therefore has radius inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass, and volume inversely proportional to its mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra3&quot;&gt;The Density of White Dwarf Stars, S. Chandrasekhar, ''Philosophical Magazine'' (7th series) '''11''' (1931), pp. 592–596.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the mass of a model white dwarf increases, the typical energies to which degeneracy pressure forces the electrons are no longer negligible relative to their rest masses. The velocities of the electrons approach the speed of light, and [[special relativity]] must be taken into account. In the strongly relativistic limit, we find that the equation of state takes the form &lt;math&gt;P = K_2 \rho^{4\over 3}&lt;/math&gt;. This will yield a polytrope of index 3, which will have a total mass, M&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt; say, depending only on &lt;var&gt;K&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra4&quot;&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1931ApJ....74...81C The Maximum Mass of Ideal White Dwarfs], S. Chandrasekhar, ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''74''' (1931), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For a fully relativistic treatment, the equation of state used will interpolate between the equations &lt;math&gt;P = K_1 \rho^{5\over 3}&lt;/math&gt; for small ρ and &lt;math&gt;P = K_2 \rho^{4\over 3}&lt;/math&gt; for large ρ.  
When this is done, the model radius still decreases with mass, but becomes zero at M&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt;. This is the Chandrasekhar limit.&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra2&quot;/&gt;  The curves of radius against mass for the non-relativistic and relativistic models are shown in the graph. They are colored blue and green, respectively. μ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; has been set equal to 2.
Radius is measured in standard solar radii&lt;ref name=&quot;stds&quot;&gt;[http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/doc/catstd-3.2.htx ''Standards for Astronomical Catalogues, Version 2.0''], section 3.2.2, web page, accessed 12-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or kilometers, and mass in standard solar masses.

Calculated values for the limit will vary depending on the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclear]] composition of the mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;timmes&quot;/&gt;  Chandrasekhar&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra1&quot;&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1931MNRAS..91..456C The Highly Collapsed Configurations of a Stellar Mass], S.

(43)&lt;/sup&gt; gives the following expression, based on the [[equation of state]] for an ideal [[Fermi gas]]:
:&lt;math&gt; M_{\rm limit} = \frac{\omega_3^0 \sqrt{3\pi}}{2}\left ( \frac{\hbar c}{G}\right )^{3/2}\frac{1}{(\mu_e m_H)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*''&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Planck_constant#Reduced_Planck_constant|reduced Planck constant]]
*''c'' is the [[speed of light]]
*''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]]
*''μ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the average [[molecular weight]] per electron, which depends upon the chemical composition of the star.
*''m&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the [[hydrogen]] [[atom]].
*&lt;math&gt;\omega_3^0 \approx 2.018236&lt;/math&gt; is a constant connected with the solution to the [[Lane-Emden equation]].
As &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\hbar c/G}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck mass]], the limit is of the order of &lt;math&gt;\frac{M_{Pl}^3}{m_H^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

A more accurate value of the limit than that given by this simple model requires adjusting for various factors, including electrostatic interactions between the electrons and nuclei and effects caused by nonzero temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;timmes&quot;&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...457..834T The Neutron Star and Black Hole Initial Mass Function], F.

==History==
In 1926, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] [[Ralph H. Fowler]] observed that the relationship between the density, energy and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei which obeyed [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926MNRAS..87..114F On Dense Matter], R. H. Fowler, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''87''' (1926), pp. 114–122.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[Fermi gas]] model was then used by the British physicist [[Edmund Clifton Stoner|E. C. Stoner]] in 1929 to calculate the relationship between the mass, radius, and density of white dwarfs, assuming them to be homogenous spheres.&lt;ref&gt;The Limiting Density of White Dwarf Stars, Edmund C. Stoner, ''Philosophical Magazine'' (7th series) '''7''' (1929), pp. 63–70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Anderson]] applied a relativistic correction to this model, giving rise to a maximum possible mass of approximately 1.37{{e|30}} kg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01340146 Über die Grenzdichte der Materie und der Energie], Wilhelm Anderson, ''Zeitschrift für Physik'' '''56''', #11–12 (November 1929), pp. 851–856. DOI 10.1007/BF01340146.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Stoner derived the [[internal energy]]-[[density]] [[equation of state]] for a Fermi gas, and was then able to treat the mass-radius relationship in a fully relativistic manner, giving a limiting mass of approximately (for μ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;=2.5) 2.19 · 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref&gt;The Equilibrium of Dense Stars, Edmund C. Stoner, ''Philosophical Magazine'' (7th series) '''9''' (1930), pp. 944–963.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoner went on to derive the [[pressure]]-[[density]] equation of state, which he published in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1932MNRAS..92..651S The minimum pressure of a degenerate electron gas], E. C. Stoner, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''92''' (May 1932), pp. 651–661.&lt;/ref&gt;  These equations of state were also previously published by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[physicist]] [[Yakov Frenkel]] in 1928, together with some other remarks on the physics of degenerate matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01328867 Anwendung der Pauli-Fermischen Elektronengastheorie auf das Problem der Kohäsionskräfte], J. Frenkel, ''Zeitschrift für Physik'' '''50''', #3–4 (March 1928), pp. 234–248.

A series of papers published between 1931 and 1935 had its beginning on a trip from [[India]] to [[England]] in 1930,
where the [[ethnic Indian|Indian]] [[physicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] worked on the calculation of the statistics of a degenerate Fermi gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/schandrasekhar.html Chandrasekhar's biographical memoir at the National Academy of Sciences], web page, accessed 12-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In these papers, Chandrasekhar solved
the [[hydrostatic equation]] together with the nonrelativistic Fermi gas [[equation of state]],&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra3&quot;/&gt; and also treated the case of a relativistic Fermi gas, giving rise to the value of the limit shown above.&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chandra4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1934Obs....57..373C Stellar Configurations with degenerate Cores], S. Chandrasekhar, ''The Observatory'' '''57''' (1934), pp. 373–377.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chandrasekhar reviews this work in his Nobel Prize lecture.&lt;ref name=&quot;chandranobel&quot;/&gt;  This value was also computed in 1932 by the Soviet physicist [[Lev Davidovich Landau]],&lt;ref&gt;On the Theory of Stars, in ''Collected Papers of L. D. Landau'', ed. and with an introduction by D. ter Haar, New York: Gordon and Breach, 1965; originally published in ''Phys. Z. Sowjet.'' '''1''' (1932), 285.&lt;/ref&gt; who, however, did not apply it to white dwarfs.

Chandrasekhar's work on the limit aroused controversy, owing to the opposition of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[astrophysicist]] [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]. Eddington was aware that the existence of [[black hole]]s was theoretically possible, and also realized that the existence of the limit made their formation possible. However, he was unwilling to accept that this could happen. After a talk by Chandrasekhar on the limit in 1935, he replied:

{{quote|The star has to go on radiating and radiating and contracting and contracting until, I suppose, it gets down to a few km. radius, when gravity becomes strong enough to hold in the radiation, and the star can at last find peace. … I think there should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way!|&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1935Obs....58...33.

Eddington's proposed solution to the perceived problem was to modify relativistic mechanics so as to make the law P=K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sup&gt;5/3&lt;/sup&gt; universally applicable, even for large ρ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1935MNRAS..95..194E On &quot;Relativistic Degeneracy&quot;], Sir A.

{{quote|Chandra's discovery might well have transformed and accelerated developments in both physics and astrophysics in the 1930s.

As a result, Chandra's work was almost forgotten.|p. 150|&lt;ref name=&quot;eos&quot;/&gt;}}

==Applications==
The core of a star is kept from collapsing by the heat generated by the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of lighter [[chemical element|elements]] into heavier ones. At various points in a star's life, the nuclei required for this process will be exhausted, and the core will collapse, causing it to become denser and hotter. A critical situation arises when [[iron]] accumulates in the core, since iron nuclei are incapable of generating further energy through fusion. If the core becomes sufficiently dense, electron degeneracy pressure will play a significant part in stabilizing it against gravitational collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo2&quot;&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002RvMP...74.1015W The evolution and explosion of massive stars], S. E. Woosley, A. Heger, and T. A. Weaver, ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' '''74''', #4 (October 2002), pp. 1015–1071.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a main-sequence star is not too massive (less than approximately 8 [[solar mass]]es), it will eventually shed enough mass to form a white dwarf having mass below the Chandrasekhar limit, which will consist of the former core of the star. For more massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure will not keep the iron core from collapsing to very great density, leading to formation of a [[neutron star]], [[black hole]], or, speculatively, a [[quark star]].  (For very massive, low-[[metallicity]] stars, it is also possible that instabilities will destroy the star completely.)&lt;ref name=&quot;ifmr1&quot;&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996A%26A...313..810K White dwarfs in open clusters.

[[Type Ia supernova]]e derive their energy from runaway fusion of the nuclei in the interior of a [[white dwarf]]. This fate may befall [[carbon]]-[[oxygen]] white dwarfs that accrete matter from a companion [[giant star]], leading to a steadily increasing mass. It has been inferred that as the white dwarf's mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, its central density increases, and, as a result of [[compression (physical)|compression]]al heating, its temperature also increases. This results in an increasing rate of [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions, eventually igniting a [[thermonuclear]] flame which causes the supernova.&lt;ref name=&quot;sniamodels&quot;&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ARA&amp;A..38..191H Type IA Supernova Explosion Models], Wolfgang Hillebrandt and Jens C. Niemeyer, ''Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics'' '''38''' (2000), pp. 191–230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, §5.1.2&lt;/sup&gt;

Strong indications of the reliability of Chandrasekhar's formula are:

*Only one white dwarf with a mass greater than Chandrasekhar's limit has ever been observed. (See below.)
*The absolute magnitudes of supernovae of Type Ia are all approximately the same; at maximum luminosity, M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; is approximately -19.3, with a [[standard deviation]] of no more than 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;sniamodels&quot;/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, (1)&lt;/sup&gt;  A [[Confidence interval|1-sigma interval]] therefore represents a factor of less than 2 in luminosity. This seems to indicate that all type Ia supernovae convert approximately the same amount of mass to energy.

==Champagne Supernova==
{{main|SN 2003fg|l1=Champagne Supernova}}
On April 2003, the [[Supernova Legacy Survey]] observed a type Ia supernova, designated [[SNLS-03D3bb]], in a galaxy approximately 4 billion [[light year]]s away. According to a group of astronomers at the [[University of Toronto]] and elsewhere, the observations of this supernova are best explained by assuming that it arose from a white dwarf which grew to twice the mass of the [[Sun]] before exploding. They believe that the star, dubbed the &quot;[[SN 2003fg|Champagne Supernova]]&quot; by University of Oklahoma astronomer David R. Branch, may have been spinning so fast that [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] allowed it to exceed the limit. Alternatively, the supernova may have resulted from the merger of two white dwarfs, so that the limit was only violated momentarily. Nevertheless, they point out that this observation poses a challenge to the use of type Ia supernovae as [[standard candles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-09/dbnl-twt092006.php The weirdest Type Ia supernova yet], LBL press release, web page accessed 13-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Champagne_Supernova_Challenges_Ideas_about_How_Supernovae_Work_999.html Champagne Supernova Challenges Ideas about How Supernovae Work], web page, spacedaily.com, accessed 13-I-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7109/abs/nature05103.html The type Ia supernova SNLS-03D3bb from a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf star], D.

'''Congregationalist polity''', often known as '''congregationalism,''' is a system of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church governance]] in which every [[local church]] congregation is independent, [[Ecclesiastical polity|ecclesiastically]] [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], or &quot;[[autonomy|autonomous]]&quot;. Among those major [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions that employ congregationalism are those [[Congregational Churches]] known by the &quot;Congregationalist&quot; name that descended from the Anglo-American [[Puritan]] movement of the 17th century, the [[Baptists|Baptist]] churches, and most of the groups brought about by the [[Anabaptist]] movement in [[Germany]] that immigrated to the U.S. in the late 18th century. More recent generations have witnessed also a growing number of [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]] churches, which are most often congregationalist in their governance. In [[Christianity]], congregationalism is distinguished most clearly from [[episcopal polity]], which is governance by a hierarchy of bishops. But it is also distinct from [[presbyterian polity]], in which higher assemblies of congregational representatives can exercise considerable authority over individual congregations.

Congregationalism is not limited only to organization of Christian congregations; the principles of congregationalism have been inherited by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]. [[Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s and most [[Islam]]ic [[mosque]]s in the U.S. operate under congregational government as well, with no hierarchies.

==Basic form==
The term &quot;congregationalist polity&quot; describes a form of church governance that is based on the local congregation.  Each local congregation is independent and self-supporting, governed by its own members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;&gt;Carmen Renee Berry, ''The Unauthorized Guide to Choosing a Church'', Brazos Press, 2003, ISBN 1-58743-036-3&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}  Some band into loose voluntary associations with other congregations that share similar beliefs (e.g., the [[Willow Creek Association]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}  Others join &quot;conventions&quot;, such as the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] or the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] (formerly the Northern Baptist Convention).&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}  These conventions generally provide stronger ties between congregations, including some doctrinal direction and pooling of financial resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}  Congregations that belong to associations and conventions are still independently governed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}  Most [[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational churches]] are organized along congregationalist lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}} Many do not see these voluntary associations as &quot;[[Christian denomination|denominations]]&quot;, because they &quot;believe that there is no church other than the local church, and denominations are in variance to Scripture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized Guide&quot;/&gt;{{rp|49}}

==Congregational church==

{{essay-like|section|date=December 2009}}
{{citations missing|section|date=December 2009}}
The earmarks of Congregationalism can be traced back to the Pilgrim societies of the United States in the early 17th century. Congregationalism expressed the viewpoint that (1) every local church is a full realization in miniature of the [[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church|entire Church]] of [[Jesus Christ]]; and (2) the Church, while on earth, besides the local church, can '''only''' be invisible and ideal. While other theories may insist on the truth of the former, the latter precept of congregationalism gives the entire theory a unique character among plans of church government. There is no other reference than the local congregation for the &quot;visible church&quot; in Congregationalism. And yet, the connection of all Christians is also asserted, albeit in a way that defenders of this view usually decline, often intentionally, to elaborate more clearly or consistently. This first, foundational principle by which congregationalism is guided results in confining it to operate with the consent of each gathering of believers.

Although &quot;congregational rule&quot; may seem to suggest that [[direct democracy|pure democracy]] reigns in congregational churches, this is seldom the case. It is granted, with few exceptions (namely in some Anabaptist churches), that [[God]] has given the government of the Church into the hands of an [[ordination|ordained]] ministry. What makes congregationalism unique is its system of checks and balances, which constrains the authority of the minister, the lay officers, and the members.

Most importantly, the boundaries of the powers of the ministers and church officers are set by clear and constant reminders of the freedoms guaranteed by the [[Gospel]] to the laity, collectively and individually. With that freedom comes the responsibility upon each member to govern himself or herself under Christ. This requires lay people to exercise great charity and patience in debating issues with one another and to seek the glory and service of God as the foremost consideration in all of their decisions.

The authority of all of the people, including the officers, is limited in the local congregation by a definition of union, or a covenant, by which the terms of their cooperation together are spelled out and agreed to. This might be something as minimal as a charter specifying a handful of [[doctrine]]s and behavioral expectations, or even a statement only guaranteeing specific freedoms. Or, it may be a [[constitution]] describing a comprehensive doctrinal system and specifying terms under which the local church is connected to other local churches, to which participating congregations give their assent. In congregationalism, rather uniquely, the church is understood to be a truly voluntary association.

Finally, the congregational theory strictly forbids ministers from ruling their local churches by themselves. Not only does the minister serve by the approval of the congregation, but committees further constrain the pastor from exercising power without consent by either the particular committee, or the entire congregation. It is a contradiction of the congregational principle if a minister makes decisions concerning the congregation without the vote of these other officers. 

The other officers may be called &quot;deacons&quot;, &quot;elders&quot; or &quot;session&quot; (borrowing [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] terminology), or even &quot;[[vestry]]&quot; (borrowing the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] term) &amp;mdash; it is not their label that is important to the theory, but rather their lay status and their equal vote, together with the pastor, in deciding the issues of the church. While other forms of church government are more likely to define &quot;tyranny&quot; as &quot;the imposition of unjust rule&quot;, a congregationally-governed church would more likely define tyranny as &quot;transgression of liberty&quot; or equivalently, &quot;rule by one man&quot;. To a congregationalist, no abuse of authority is worse than the concentration of all decisive power in the hands of one ruling body, or one person. 

Following this sentiment, congregationalism has evolved over time to include even more participation of the congregation, more kinds of lay committees to whom various tasks are apportioned, and more decisions subject to the vote of the entire membership.

One of the most notable characteristics of New England (or British)-heritage Congregationalism has been its consistent leadership role in the formation of &quot;unions&quot; with other churches. Such sentiments especially grew strong in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when ecumenism evolved out of a liberal, non-sectarian perspective on relations to other Christian groups that accompanied the relaxation of [[Calvinist]] stringencies held by earlier generations. The congregationalist theory of independence within a union has been a cornerstone of most ecumenical movements since the 18th century.

The congregationalist principles of complete autonomy and strictly voluntary union produce a practically indescribable diversity of beliefs within the congregational unions. The [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) is the result of a union constructed according to congregationalist theory between the [[Evangelical and Reformed Church]] and the [[Congregational Christian Churches]]. These uniting congregations were themselves the result of several previous unions. The General Council of Congregational Christian Churches was formed from a merger between the National Council of Congregational Churches and the General Convention of the Christian Church, also known as [[Christian Connection|Christian Churches or Christian Connection]] (not to be confused with, although partially related to, the Disciples of Christ). The Evangelical and Reformed Church was the result of a partial union of the Reformed Church in the United States and the Evangelical Synod of North America (a union of [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and Reformed). The UCC is by far the most diverse of the Reformed churches in the U.S. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United Reformed Church]] was formed in 1972 by the merger of the Presbyterian and the Congregational churches, on presbyterian principles of union but within a continuing congregational regard for local diversity.

==Baptist churches==
{{main|Baptists}}
{{ref improve section|date=February 2010}}
Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pinson, William M., Jr. |title=Trends in Baptist Polity |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society | url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of [[Elder (Christianity)#Baptists|elders]], as well as the [[Episcopal Baptist]]s that have an [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal system]].

[[Independent Baptist]] churches have no formal organizational structure above the level of the local congregation.  More generally among [[Baptists]], a variety of parachurch agencies and evangelical educational institutions may be supported generously or not at all, depending entirely upon the local congregation's customs and predilections. Usually doctrinal conformity is held as a first consideration when a church makes a decision to grant or decline financial contributions to such agencies, which are legally external and separate from the congregations they serve. These practices also find currency among non-denominational fundamentalist or [[Charismatic (Christians)|charismatic]] fellowships, many of which derive from Baptist origins, culturally if not theologically.

Most Southern Baptist congregations and [[African-American]] Baptist churches, by contrast, generally relate more closely to external groups such as mission agencies and educational institutions than do those of independent persuasion. However, they adhere to a very similar ecclesiology, refusing to permit outside control or oversight of local affairs.

'''''Cavalry''''' (from [[French language|French]] ''cavalerie'', cf. ''cheval'' 'horse') were [[soldier]]s or [[warrior]]s who fought mounted on [[horseback]]. Cavalry were historically the third oldest (after [[infantry]] and [[chariot]]ry) and the most mobile of the combat arms. A soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as '''cavalryman''' or '''trooper'''.

The designation of '''cavalry''' was not usually given to any [[Military animals|military force that used other animals]], such as [[Camel cavalry|camels]] or mules. [[Infantry]] who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as [[dragoon]]s, a class of [[mounted infantry]] which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.

From earliest times cavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, making it an &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;instrument which multiplied the fighting value of even the smallest forces, allowing them to outflank and avoid, to surprise and overpower, to retreat and escape according to the requirements of the moment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;p.4, Rodger&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; A man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and inertial mass over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.

The mobility and shock value of the cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the Ancient and Middle Ages; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in nomadic societies of Asia, notably the Mongol armies. In Europe cavalry became increasingly [[Heavy cavalry|armoured]] (heavy), and eventually became known for the mounted [[knight]]s. During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, with some regiments retained a small thickened [[cuirass]] that offered some protection against shot.

In the period between the World Wars many cavalry units were converted into [[motorised infantry]] and [[mechanised infantry]] units, or reformed as tank troops. However some cavalry still served during the [[Second World War]], notably in the [[Red Army]] and the [[Italian Royal Army]]. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas.


==Role of cavalry==
{{Main|Cavalry tactics}}
In many modern armies, the term ''cavalry'' is still often used to refer to units that are a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of the [[armed forces]] which in the past filled the traditional horse-borne land combat [[light cavalry]] roles. These include [[reconnaissance|scouting]], [[skirmishing]] with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of own disposition of troops, forward security, offensive reconnaissance by combat, defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement, [[retreat (military)|retreat]], restoration of command and control, deception, battle handover and passage of lines, relief in place, linkup, [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] operations, and [[Raid (military)|raiding]]. The [[shock attack|shock]] role, traditionally filled by [[heavy cavalry]], is generally filled by [[Military unit|unit]]s with the &quot;[[Armoured warfare|armored]]&quot; designation.

==History==
[[Image:Assyriancavalry.JPG|thumb|right|Assyrian cavalry]]

=== Origins ===
Before the [[Iron Age]], the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light [[chariot]]s. The chariot originated with the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in [[Central Asia]] and spread by nomadic or semi-nomadic [[Indo-Iranians]].&lt;ref&gt;p.1, Menon&lt;/ref&gt; The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status, especially by the [[Pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] as well as [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Babylonian]] royalty.

The power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of horses (then mostly small) to carry heavy armor. Cavalry techniques were an innovation of [[equestrian nomad]]s of the Central Asian and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] steppe and [[pastoralist]] [[tribe]]s such as the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Parthians]] and [[Sarmatians]].

The photograph above right shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865&amp;ndash;860 BC. At this time, the men had no [[spur]]s, [[saddle]]s, [[saddle cloth]]s, or [[stirrup]]s. Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the mounted archer were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse.

As early as 490 BC a breed of large horses was bred in the Nisaean plain in Media to carry men with increasing amounts of armour (Herodotus 7,40 &amp; 9,20). But large horses were still very exceptional at this time. Excepting a few ineffective trials of [[scythed chariot]]s, the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in civilized nations by the time of the Persian defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]], but chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a [[Roman triumph]], or for racing. The southern [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] met [[Julius Caesar]] with chariots in [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|55 and 54 BC]], but by the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a century later chariots were obsolete even in Britannia.

=== Ancient Greece: city-states, Thebes, Thessaly and Macedonia===
[[Image:Amphora Louvre F12.jpg|thumb|right|Warrior's departure; an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[amphora]] dated 550&amp;ndash;540 BC.]]
{{main|hippeis|companion cavalry}}

Cavalry played a relatively minor role in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-states]], with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry. However, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] produced [[Pelopidas]], her first great cavalry commander, whose tactics and skills were absorbed by Phillip II of Macedon when Phillip was a guest-hostage in Thebes. [[Thessaly]] was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen, and later experiences in wars both with and against the [[Persian Empire|Persian]]s taught the [[Greeks]] the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit. The [[Athens|Athenian]] author and soldier [[Xenophon]] in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.

The [[Macedon]]ian kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]]) of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and Alexander the Great. In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian combined arms army also employed lighter horsemen called [[prodromoi]] for scouting and screening, as well as the [[Macedonian phalanx|Macedonian pike phalanx]] and various kinds of [[light infantry]]. There were also the ''Ippiko'' (or &quot;Horserider&quot;), Greek &quot;heavy&quot; cavalry, armed with kontos (or cavalry lance), and sword. They wore leather armour or mail and hat. They were medium cavalry, rather than heavy cavalry. They were good scouts, skirmishers, and chasers.

The effectiveness of this combined-arms system was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander's conquest of [[Persia]], [[Bactria]], and northwestern India.

=== Roman Republic and Early Empire ===
{{main|Roman cavalry}}
[[Image:Köln Reitergrabmal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tombstone of a Roman auxiliary trooper from Cologne, Germany. Second half 1st C. AD]]
The cavalry in the early [[Roman Republic]] remained the preserve of the wealthy [[landed class]] known as the ''[[equites]]''&amp;mdash;men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common [[Roman legion|legion]]s. As the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property-based military grouping, the Romans began to employ Italian [[socii]] for filling the ranks of their cavalry. At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], and [[Numidians]], the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts (see [[Numidian cavalry]]). [[Julius Caesar]] himself was known for his admiration of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry, giving rise to the ''[[cohors equitata|Cohortae Equitates]]''. Early emperors maintained an [[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]] of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an cavalry as their bodyguards until the unit was dismissed by [[Galba]] after the [[Batavian Rebellion]].

For the most part, Roman cavalry during the Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one-fifth of the showing force. This does not mean that its utility could be underestimated, though, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans' capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. In some occasions it also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the [[Battle of Aquilonia]].

After defeats such as the [[Battle of Carrhae]], the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. They would begin to substantially increase both the numbers and the training standards of the cavalry in their employ, just as nearly a thousand years earlier the first Iranians to reach the [[Iranian Plateau]] forced the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] to a similar reform. Nonetheless, they would continue to rely mainly on their heavy infantry supported by auxiliary cavalry.

[[Image:Roman cavalry lg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Reenactor as a Roman [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] cavalryman.]]

=== Late Roman Empire and the Migration Period ===
In the army of the late [[Roman Empire]], cavalry played an increasingly important role. The [[Spatha]], the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empire's cavalry forces.

The most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the [[Parthia]]ns and their [[Iran]]ian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] successors. Both, but especially the latter, were famed for the [[cataphract]] (fully armored cavalry armed with lances) even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter [[horse archer]]s. The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the [[Hellenistic]] period with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]&amp;ndash;[[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[wars]]. At first the Parthians' mobility greatly confounded the Romans, whose armoured close-order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians. However, later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and ''clibanarii''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historynet.com/mhq/blromespersianmirage/&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces, and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield, also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the Roman [[horse tack|saddle]] by variants on the Scythian model, with [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] and cantle,&lt;ref&gt;The raised rear part of a saddle&lt;/ref&gt; was also a significant factor as was the adoption of [[stirrup]]s and the concomitant increase in stability of the rider's seat. Armored Cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the [[near East]], following the precedents established by [[Persian Empire|Persia]]n forces, as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts, raiders, and outflankers.

The late Roman cavalry tradition and the mounted nobility of the Germanic invaders both contributed to the development of mediaeval knightly cavalry.

=== Arabs ===
{{main|Mobile guard}}
[[Image:Ikhwan.jpg|right|thumb|Arab camel cavalry]]
Early organized Arab cavalry under the [[Rashidun]] [[caliphate]] was a [[light cavalry]] armed with [[lance]] and [[sword]], its main role was to attack the enemy flanks and rear. Armor was relatively light. The Muslims' light cavalry during the later years of Islamic conquest of Levant became the most powerful section of army. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the '''[[Battle of Yarmouk]]''' (636 AD) in which [[Khalid ibn Walid]], knowing the importance and ability of his cavalry, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage and disengage and turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign of Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name ''Mutaharrik tulai'a''( متحرك طليعة ), or the [[Mobile guard]]. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that give it an upper hand when maneuvering against any [[Byzantine]] army. With this mobile striking force, the conquest of Syria was made easy.&lt;ref&gt;p.239, Muir&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Mamluke.jpg|right|thumb|A Mamluk cavalryman]]

The [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 CE was a conflict between the Arab [[Abbasid]] Caliphate and the [[China|Chinese]] [[Tang Dynasty]] over the control of [[Central Asia]]. Chinese infantry were routed by [[Arab]] cavalry near the bank of the River Talas.

Later [[Mamluk]]s were trained as cavalry soldiers. Mamluks were to follow the dictates of al-furusiyya,&lt;ref&gt;tradition of al-furusiyya is defined by principles of horsemanship, chivalry, and the mutual dependence of the rider and the horse&lt;/ref&gt; a code of conduct that included values like courage and generosity but also doctrine of cavalry tactics, horsemanship, archery and treatment of wounds.

=== Asia ===
{{main|Horse archer}}

====Central Asia====
[[Xiongnu]] or [[Hun]], [[Tujue]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Kipchaks]], [[Mongol]]s, [[Cossack]]s and the various [[Turkic peoples]] are also examples of the horse-mounted peoples that managed to gain substantial successes in military conflicts with settled agrarian and urban societies, due to their strategic and tactical mobility. As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic [[nation-states]] supporting professional standing armies, recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders. The best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of [[Tsarist Russia]]. In eastern Europe, Russia, and out onto the [[steppes]], cavalry remained important much longer and dominated the scene of warfare until the early 17th century and even beyond, as the strategic mobility of cavalry was crucial for the semi-nomadic [[pastoralist]] lives that many steppe cultures led.&lt;ref&gt;This needs a re-write&amp;mdash;the chronology is all over the place.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibet]]ans also had a tradition of cavalry warfare, in several military engagements early on with the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907 AD), including [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Tufan]] in 638.

====East Asia====
[[File:DiezAlbumsArmedRiders I.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mongol]] [[Mongol_Army#Cavalry|cavalry]] pursuing their enemy.]] 
[[Image:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|right|A bas-[[relief]] of a soldier and horse with saddle and [[stirrup]]s, from the tomb of Chinese [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626-649), c. 650]]

Further east, the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|military history of China]], specifically [[North China|northern China]], held a long tradition of intense military exchange between [[Han Chinese]] infantry forces of the settled dynastic empires and the mounted [[nomads]] or &quot;barbarians&quot; of the north. The [[naval history of China]] was centered more to the south, where mountains, rivers, and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well-kept [[Naval warfare|navy]].

In 307 BC, [[King Wuling of Zhao]], the ancient Chinese ruler of the former [[Jin (state)|State of Jin]] territory, ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the [[trousers]] of the [[nomad]]s as well as practice the nomads' form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 29 30&quot;&gt;Ebrey, 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards the cavalry tactics employed by the [[Zhao (state)|State of Zhao]] forced their enemies in the other [[Warring States]] to adopt the same techniques in order to mount any effective attack against their swift movements on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 30&quot;&gt;Ebrey, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]-riding [[Four occupations|Chinese aristocracy]] in battle, which had been in use since the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC-1050 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 29&quot;&gt;Ebrey, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time large Chinese infantry-based armies of 100,000 to 200,000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey 30&quot;/&gt; The handheld pistol-and-trigger [[crossbow]] was invented in China in the 4th century BC;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebrey cambridge 41&quot;&gt;Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; it was written by the [[Song Dynasty]] scholars Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in their book ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (1044 AD) that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;peers 130&quot;&gt;Peers, 130.we can right anything&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Qianlong Emperor in Ceremonial Armour on Horseback.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in ceremonial armor on horseback, painted by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (1688–1766)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], dated 1739 or 1758.]]
On many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering, as in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]] and its sinicized part, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279–1368). The Chinese recognized early on during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC-220 AD) that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141 BC-87 BC) went to war with the [[Dayuan]] for this reason, since the Dayuan were hording a massive amount of tall, strong, Central Asian bred horses in the [[Hellenized]]&amp;ndash;[[Greeks|Greek]] region of [[Fergana]] (established slightly earlier by [[Alexander the Great]]). Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign, Emperor Wu's war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana.

Cavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle-attached [[stirrup]] by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of the year 322 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dien&quot;&gt;[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/stirrup.shtml Dien, Albert. &quot;THE STIRRUP AND ITS EFFECT ON CHINESE MILITARY HISTORY&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 &quot;The stirrup - history of Chinese science.&quot; ''UNESCO Courier, October, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_madeinchina/2005-07/21/content_70825.htm &quot;The invention and influences of stirrup&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese invention of the [[horse collar]] by the 5th century was also a great improvement from the breast harness, allowing the horse to haul greater weight without heavy burden on its skeletal structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 322&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 305&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

The horse warfare of [[History of Korea|Korea]] was first started during the ancient Korean kingdom [[Gojoseon]]. Since at least the 3rd century BC, there was influence of northern [[nomadic]] peoples and [[Yemaek]] peoples on Korean Warfare. By roughly the 1st century BC, the ancient kingdom of [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]] also had mounted warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The cavalry of [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], were called ''Gaemamusa'' (개마무사, 鎧馬武士). [[Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo|King Gwanggaeto the Great]] often led expeditions into the [[Baekje]], [[Gaya confederacy]], [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Later Yan]] and against [[Yamato period|Japanese]] invaders with his cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Peter H &amp; Wm. Theodore De Bary. Sources of Korean Tradition, page 24-26. Columbia University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12 century, [[Jurchen]] tribes began to violate the Goryeo-Jurchen borders, and eventually invaded [[Goryeo]] Korea. After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general [[Yun Gwan]] realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo-Jurchen borders (동북 9성, 東北 九城).

The [[History of Japan|ancient Japanese]] of the [[Kofun period]] also adopted [[Kofun period#Introduction of equine culture to Japan|cavalry and equine culture]] by the 5th century AD.

In the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the [[Gupta Dynasty]] (320-600) period onwards. India has also the oldest evidence for the introduction of toe-[[stirrup]]s. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Indian literature contains numerous references to the cavalry forces of the [[Central Asia]]n horse nomads like the [[Saka]]s, [[Kambojas]], [[Yona|Yavanas]], [[The Pahlavas|Pahlavas]] and [[Paradas]]. Numerous [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts refer to a conflict in ancient India (16th c. BC)&lt;ref&gt;p. 182&amp;ndash;183, Pargiter.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the cavalry forces of five nations, called five hordes (''pañca.ganan'') or [[Kshatriya|Kśatriya]] hordes (''Kśatriya ganah''), attacked and captured the throne of Ayudhya by dethroning its [[Vedic period|Vedic]]King Bahu&lt;ref&gt;Harivamsa 14.1&amp;ndash;19; Vayu Purana 88.127&amp;ndash;43; Brahma Purana (8.35&amp;ndash;51); Brahamanda Purana (3.63.123&amp;ndash;141); Shiva Purana (7.61.23); Vishnu Purana (5.3.15&amp;ndash;21), Padama Purana (6.21.16&amp;ndash;33) etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], numerous Puranas and some foreign sources numerously attest that Kamboja cavalry was frequently requisitioned in ancient wars. V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar writes: ''&quot;Both the Puranas and the epics agree that the horses of the Sindhu and Kamboja regions were of the finest breed, and that the services of the Kambojas as cavalry troopers were requisitioned in ancient wars &quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;War in Ancient India, 1944, p 178, V. R. Ramachandra Dikshtar - Military art and science.&lt;/ref&gt; J.A.O.S. writes: ''&quot;Most famous horses are said to come either from Sindhu or Kamboja; of the latter (i.e the Kamboja), the Indian [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] [[Mahabharata]] speaks among the finest [[horsemen]]&quot; ''.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of American Oriental society, 1889, p 257, American Oriental Society; The Social and Military Position of the Ruling Caste in Ancient India: As ..., 1972, p 201, Edward Washburn Hopkins - Caste; Mahabharata 10.18.13; cf: Ancient Indian Civilization, 1985, p 120, Grigoriĭ Maksimovich Bongard-Levin - History; Cf also: A History of Zoroastrianism, 1991, p 129, Mary Boyce, Frantz Grenet.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahabharata (950 c BC)&lt;ref&gt;p.182, Pargiter&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of the esteemed cavalry of the Kambojas, Sakas, Yavanas and [[Tocharians|Tusharas]], all of whom had participated in the [[Kurukshetra War and the Kambojas|Kurukshetra war]] under the supreme command of [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] ruler [[Sudakshina Kamboja|Sudakshin Kamboj]].&lt;ref&gt;MBH 1.185.13; Felicitation Volume Presented to Professor Sripad Krishna Belvalkar, 1957, p 260, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Shripad Krishna Belvalkar.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahabharata and Vishnudharmotari Purana especially styles the Kambojas, Yavansa, Gandharas etc. as &quot;Ashva.yuddha.kushalah&quot; (expert cavalrymen).&lt;ref&gt;Ashva.yuddha.kushalah: Mahabharata 7.7.14; See also: Vishnudharmotra Purana, Part II, Chapter 118; Post Gupta Polity (AD 500&amp;ndash;700): A Study of the Growth of Feudal Elements and Rural Administration 1972, p 136, Ganesh Prasad Sinha; Wisdom in the Puranas 1969, p 64, professor Sen Sarma etc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata war, the Kamboja cavalry along with that of the Sakas, Yavanas is reported to have been enlisted by the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] king [[Duryodhana]] of [[Hastinapur]]a.&lt;ref&gt;Some Kṣatriya Tribes of Ancient India, 1924, p 238, Dr B.

[[Herodotus]] (484 c BC&amp;ndash;425 c BC) attests that the [[Gandhara|Gandarian]] mercenaries (i.e. ''Gandharans/Kambojans'' of Gandari Strapy of [[Achaemenids]]) from the 20th strapy of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]s were recruited in the army of emperor [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]] (486-465 BC), which he led against the [[Greeks|Hellas]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Book VII 65, 70, 86, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ''men of the Mountain Land '' from north of [[Kabul|Kabol]]-River equivalent to medieval [[Kohistan District, North West Frontier Province|Kohistan]] (Pakistan), figure in the army of [[Darius III]] against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] at [[Battle of Gaugamela|Arbela]] with a cavalry and fifteen elephants.&lt;ref&gt;History of Persian Empire, p 232, Dr A.

The [[Sanskrit]] drama ''Mudra-rakashas'' by ''Visakha Dutta'' and the [[Jain]]a work ''Parisishtaparvan'' refer to [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]'s (320 C BC&amp;ndash;298 c BC) alliance with [[Himalaya]]n king ''Parvataka''. The [[Himalaya]]n alliance gave Chandragupta a formidable composite army made up of the cavalry forces of the Shakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Kiratas, Parasikas and Bahlikas as attested by Mudra-Rakashas (Mudra-Rakshasa 2).&lt;ref&gt;In Sanskrit:
:''asti tava Shaka-Yavana-Kirata-Kamboja-Parasika-Bahlika parbhutibhih''
:''Chankyamatipragrahittaishcha Chandergupta Parvateshvara''
:''balairudidhibhiriva parchalitsalilaih samantaad uprudham Kusumpurama''
: (Mudra-Rakshasa 2).&lt;/ref&gt; These hordes had helped [[Chandragupta Maurya]] defeat the ruler of [[Magadha]] and placed Vhandragupta on the throne, thus laying the foundations of [[Mauryan Dynasty]] in Northern India.

The cavalry of [[Hunas]] and the Kambojas is also attested in the [[Raghuvaṃśa|Raghu Vamsa]] epic poem of Sanskrit poet [[Kalidasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kālidāsa, 1960, p 141, Raghunath Damodar Karmarkar.&lt;/ref&gt; Raghu of Kalidasa is believed to be [[Chandragupta II]] (''Vikaramaditya'') (375&amp;ndash;413/15 AD), of the well-known [[Gupta Dynasty]].

As late as mediaeval era, the Kamboja cavalry had also formed part of the Gurjara-Pratihara armed forces in 8th/10th centuries AD. They had come to [[Bengal]] with the [[Pratihara]]s when the latter conquered part of the province.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Historical Quarterly, XV-4, December, 1939, p 511 Dr H. C. Ray.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Ancient Bengal, 1971, pp 182&amp;ndash;83, Dr R. C. Majumdar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indian Historical Quarterly, 1963, p 625.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dynastic History of Magadha, 1977, p 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indiaca, XVIII, p 304ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Kambojas were constituted into military ''Sanghas'' and Srenis (Corporations) to manage their political and military affairs, as [[Arthashastra]] of [[Kautiliya]] as well as the [[Mahabharata]] amply attest for us. They are attested to be living as ''Ayuddha-jivi'' or ''Shastr-opajivis'' (Nation-in-arms), which also means that the Kamboja cavalry offered its [[military]] services to other nations as well. There are numerous references to Kambojas having been requisitioned as cavalry [[trooper (rank)|trooper]]s in ancient wars by outside [[nation]]s.

=== European Middle Ages ===
{{see also|Horses in the Middle Ages}}
[[Image:Normans Bayeux.jpg|thumb|right|Horse-mounted [[Normans]] fighting in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], 11th century.]]
Although Roman cavalry had no stirrups, their horned saddle allowed the combination of a firm seat with substantial flexibility. But the introduction of the wraparound [[saddle]] during the Middle Ages provided greater efficiency in mounted shock combat and the important invention of the [[stirrup]] enabled a broader array of attacks to be delivered from the back of a horse. As a greater weight of man and armor could be supported in the saddle, the probability of being dismounted in combat was significantly reduced.

In particular, a charge with the lance couched under the armpit would no longer turn into [[pole vaulting]]; this eventually led to an enormous increase in the impact of the charge. Last but not least, the introduction of [[spur]]s allowed better control of the mount during the &quot;knightly charge&quot; in full gallop. In western Europe there emerged what is considered the &quot;ultimate&quot; [[heavy cavalry]], the [[knight]]. The knights and other similarly equipped mounted men-at-arms charged in close formation, exchanging flexibility for a massive, irresistible first charge.

[[Image:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseUnkFolio3SealBlackHorse.jpg|right|thumb|right|A 13th century depiction of a riding horse. Note resemblance to the modern [[Paso Fino]].]]
[[Image:Husitsky bojovy vuz replika.jpg|thumb|right|A Hussite war wagon: it enabled peasants to defeat knights]]

The mounted men-at-arms quickly became an important force in Western European tactics. Medieval military doctrine employed them as part of a combined-arms force along with various kinds of foot troops; however medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the rank and file, which led early students of military history to suppose that this heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields, which was not the case.

Massed English longbowmen triumphed over French cavalry at [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], while at [[Battle of Gisors|Gisors]] (1188), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]] (1339), foot-soldiers proved their invulnerability to cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. Once the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] developed their [[pike square]]s for offensive as well as defensive use, infantry started to become the principal arm. This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries, and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive [[combined arms]] doctrine, as evidenced in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow, such as the [[crossbow]] and [[hand cannon]], also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy-to-learn weapons. These missile weapons were very successfully used in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics.

This gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the [[Battle of the Dyle]] (891) and the [[Battle of Bremule]] (1119), but after 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed [[sword]]s and [[poleaxe]]s. In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position.

=== Renaissance Europe ===
[[Image:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (8).jpg|thumb|right|Knighted cavalry and noblemen, painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (ca. 1390-1441).]]
Ironically, the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the &quot;golden age&quot; of heavy cavalry; a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry, whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter. 

Knighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society. With the rise of drilled and trained infantry, the mounted men-at-arms, now sometimes called ''[[gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]]'' and often part of the standing army themselves, adopted the same role as in the Hellenistic age, that of delivering a decisive blow once the battle was already engaged, either by charging the enemy in the flank or attacking their commander-in-chief.


From the 1550s onwards, the use of [[Gunpowder warfare|gunpowder weapons]] solidified infantry's dominance of the battlefield and began to allow true mass armies to develop. This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period; heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse, while [[arquebusier]]s and later [[musketeer]]s could be trained and kept in the field at much lower cost, and were much easier to replace. 

The Spanish [[tercio]] and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The [[pistol]] was specifically developed to try and bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the [[caracole]]. The caracole was not particularly successful, however, and the charge (whether with sword, pistol, or lance) remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry, although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before. The [[demi-lancer]]s and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol [[reiter]]s were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries, as for the [[Polish Hussars|Polish winged hussars]], a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against [[Sweden|Swedes]], Russians, and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

=== 18th-century Europe and Napoleonic Wars ===
[[Image:Simon-eylau.jpg|thumb|Cavalry charge at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]], painted by [[Simon Fort]].]]

Cavalry retained an important role in this age of regularization and standardization across European armies. First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry. Attacking an unbroken infantry force head-on usually resulted in failure, but extended linear infantry formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks. Cavalry was important at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]] (1757), [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (1807), remaining significant throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. 

Massed infantry was deadly to cavalry, but offered an excellent target for [[artillery]]. Once the bombardment had disordered the infantry formation, cavalry were able to [[rout]] and pursue the scattered foot soldiers. It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well. Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting, screening the army's movements, and harassing the enemy's supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early stages of World War I.

The greatest cavalry charge of modern history was at the 1807 [[battle of Eylau]], when the entire 11,000-strong French cavalry reserve, led by Maréchal [[Murat]], launched a huge charge on and through the Russian infantry lines. The French horsemen also proved that cavalry could be a decisive element during the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain.

=== 19th century ===
By the 19th century, European cavalry fell into four main categories:
* [[Cuirassier]]s, heavy cavalry
* [[Dragoon]]s, originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry
* [[Hussar]]s, light cavalry
* [[Lancer]]s or [[Uhlan]]s, light cavalry armed with [[lance]]s
[[File:Batalla de Carabobo.JPG|thumb|250px|The charge of the First Division's cavalry at the [[Battle of Carabobo]].]]
There were cavalry variations for individual nations as well: France had the ''chasseurs à cheval''; Germany had the ''Jäger zu Pferd''; [[Bavaria]] had the ''Chevaulegers''; and Russia had Cossacks. Britain's only [[cuirassier]]s were the [[Household Cavalry]], but Dragoon Guards regiments were classed as heavy cavalry. In the [[United States Army]] the cavalry were almost always dragoons. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had its cavalry uniformed as [[hussar]]s, but they fought as dragoons.

[[Image:Union cavalry charge culpepper.jpg|right|thumb|left|[[Union Cavalry]] capture [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] guns at [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpepper]].]]

In the early [[American Civil War]] the regular United States Army mounted rifle, dragoon, and two existing cavalry regiments were reorganized and renamed cavalry regiments, of which there were six. Over a hundred other federal and state cavalry regiments were organized, but the infantry played a much larger role in many battles due to its larger numbers, lower cost per rifle fielded, and much easier recruitment. However, cavalry saw a role as part of screening forces and in foraging and scouting. The later phases of the war saw the [[Union Army|Federal army]] developing a truly effective cavalry force fighting as [[Reconnaissance|scouts]], raiders, and, with repeating rifles, as [[mounted infantry]].

Post Civil War, as the volunteer armies disbanded, the regular army cavalry regiments increased in number from six to ten, among them the [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment]] of [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]] fame, and the [[African-American]] [[U.S. 9th Cavalry Regiment]] and [[U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment]]. These units, along with others (both cavalry and [[infantry]]), collectively became known as the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s.
These regiments, which rarely took the field as complete organizations, served throughout the [[Indian Wars]] through the close of the frontier in the 1890s.

=== 19th-century Imperial Expansion ===
Cavalry found new success in Imperial operations ([[irregular military|irregular warfare]]), where modern weapons were lacking and the slow moving infantry-artillery train or fixed fortifications were often ineffective against native insurgents (unless the natives offered a fight on an equal footing, as at [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|Tel-el-Kebir]], [[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]], etc.). Cavalry &quot;[[flying column]]s&quot; proved effective, or at least cost-effective, in many campaigns&amp;mdash;although an astute native commander (like [[Samori]] in western Africa, [[Imam Shamil|Shamil]] in the [[Caucasus]], or any of the better [[Boer]] commanders) could turn the tables and use the greater mobility of their cavalry to offset their relative lack of firepower compared to European forces.

The [[British Indian Army]] maintained about forty regiments of cavalry, officered by British and manned by Indian [[sowars]] (cavalrymen). The legendary exploits of this branch lives on in literature and early films. Among the more famous regiments in the lineages of modern Indian and Pakistani Armies are:[[Image:21lancers.JPG|right|thumb|right|The charge of the 21st Lancers at [[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]]]]
* [[Governor General's Bodyguard]] (now [[President's Bodyguard (India)|President's Bodyguard]])
* Skinner's Horse (now India's [[1st Horse (Skinner's Horse)]])
* Gardner's Lancers (now India's [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]])
* Hodson's Horse (now India's [[Hodson's Horse|3rd Horse (Hodson's)]]) of the Bengal Lancers fame
* [[6th Bengal Cavalry]] (later amalgamated with [[7th Hariana Lancers]] to form [[18th King Edward's Own Cavalry]]) now [[18th Cavalry]] of the [[Indian Army]]
* Probyn's Horse (now Pakistani)
* Royal Deccan Horse (now India's [[Deccan Horse|The Deccan Horse]])
* Poona Horse (now India's [[The Poona Horse]])
* Scinde Horse (now India's [[Scinde Horse|The Scinde Horse]])

* [[Guides Cavalry|Queen's Own Guides Cavalry]] (now partitioned between Pakistan and India).

Several of these formations are still active, though they now are armoured formations, for example Guides Cavalry in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defencejournal.com/jun99/guides-cavalry.htm THE GUIDES CAVALRY (10th QUEEN VICTORIA'S OWN FRONTIER FORCE)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Army maintained substantial cavalry forces in Algeria and Morocco from 1830 until the Second World War. Much of the Mediterranean coastal terrain was suitable for mounted action and there was a long established culture of horsemanship amongst the Arab and Berber inhabitants. The French forces included [[Spahis]], [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]], [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] cavalry and mounted [[Goumier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;L'Armee d'Afrique 1830-1962, General R. Hure, Paris-Limogues 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First World War ===
[[Image:Italian cavalry drill.jpg|thumb|Italian cavalry officers practice their horsemanship in 1904 outside Rome.]]
At the beginning of the 20th century all armies still maintained substantial cavalry forces, although there was contention over whether their role should revert to that of mounted infantry (the historic dragoon function). Following the experience of the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] of 1899-1902 (where mounted Boer citizen commandos fighting on foot from cover proved superior to regular cavalry) the British Army withdrew lances for all but ceremonial purposes and placed a new emphasis on training for dismounted action. 
[[File:Kurdish cavalry.jpg|thumb|Kurdish men and women cavalry during World War I in [[Kurdistan]]]]
In 1908 however the six British lancer regiments in existence resumed use of this impressive but obsolete weapon for active service. In 1882 the Imperial Russian Army converted all its line hussar and lancer regiments to dragoons, with an emphasis on mounted infantry training. In 1910 these regiments reverted to their historic roles, designations and uniforms.

[[Image:Kavallerie Wk I.jpg|thumb||thumb|right|German Cavalryman in September 1914, [[German South-West Africa]].]]

In August 1914 all combatant armies still retained substantial numbers of cavalry and the mobile nature of the opening battles on both [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Fronts]] provided a number of instances of traditional cavalry actions, though on a smaller and more scattered scale than those of previous wars. The Imperial German Cavalry, while as colourful and traditional as any in peacetime appearance, had adopted a practice of falling back on infantry support when any substantial opposition was encountered. These cautious tactics aroused derision amongst their more conservative French and Russian opponents but proved appropriate to the new nature of warfare. Once the front lines stabilised, a combination of barbed wire, machine guns and rapid fire rifles proved deadly to horse mounted troops.

For the remainder of the War on the Western Front cavalry had virtually no role to play. The British and French armies dismounted many of their cavalry regiments and used them in infantry and other roles: the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] for example spent the last months of the War as a machine gun corps; and the [[Australian Light Horse]] served as light infantry during the Gallipoli campaign. In September 1914 cavalry comprised 9.28% of the total manpower of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in France - by July 1918 this proportion had fallen to 1.65%.&lt;ref&gt;page 212, ''The Oxford History of the British Army'', ISBN 0-19-285333-3&lt;/ref&gt; The German Army dismounted nearly all their cavalry in the West.

[[Image:French heavy cavalry Paris August 1914.jpg|160px|thumb|right|French [[cuirassiers]], wearing breastplates and helmets, parade through Paris on the way to battle, August 1914.]]

Some cavalry were retained as mounted troops behind the lines in anticipation of a penetration of the opposing trenches that it seemed would never come. [[Tanks]], introduced on the Western Front in September 1916, had the capacity to achieve such breakthroughs but did not have the reliable range to exploit them. Since mounted troops were too vulnerable and slow moving to act in effective support of the new weapon, history recorded no significant role for cavalry in mechanized warfare, and post war planning in the allied nations replaced horse cavalry with mechanized cavalry.

In the wider spaces of the Eastern Front a more fluid form of warfare continued and there was still a use for mounted troops. Some wide-ranging actions were fought, again mostly in the early months of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmott&quot;&gt;''First World War'' - Willmott, H.P., Dorling Kindersley, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, even here the value of cavalry was over-rated and the maintenance of large mounted formations at the front by the [[Military history of the Russian Empire|Russian Army]] put a major strain on the railway system, to little strategic advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the Middle East mounted forces (British, Indian, Turkish, Australian, Arab and New Zealand) retained an important role, though of the mounted infantry variety.

=== Post World War I ===
A combination of military conservatism in almost all armies and post-war financial constraints prevented the lessons of 1914-18 being acted on immediately. There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British, French, Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction (for example in the 1922 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'') that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare. The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies, though much less so than prior to 1914.

Cavalry was extensively used in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Soviet-Polish War]]. The last major cavalry battle was the [[Battle of Komarów]] in 1920, between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks. Colonial warfare in Morocco, Syria, the Middle East and the [[North West Frontier]] of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry.

The post-war German Army ([[Reichsheer]]) was permitted a large proportion of cavalry (18 regiments or 16.4% of total manpower) under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The U.S. Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry, starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933.

In the [[British Army]], all cavalry regiments were mechanised between 1929 and 1941, redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] together with the [[Royal Tank Regiment]].

The thirty-nine regiments of the [[Indian Army]] were reduced to twenty-one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I. The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units, each with six, still mounted, regiments linked to them. In 1938 the process of mechanism began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade (two Indian regiments and one British) to armoured car and tank units. By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanised, receiving light tanks, armoured cars or 15cwt trucks. The last horsed regiment of the Indian Army (other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments) was the 19th King George's Own Lancers which had its last mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939. This unit still exists (though in the Pakistan Army) with an armour TOE.

During the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations. Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry (trucks and motor cycles), and cuirassiers to armoured units; while light cavalry (Chasseurs a' Cheval, Hussars and Spahis) remained as mounted sabre squadrons. The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances. In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance.

=== World War II ===
[[Image:Polish cavalry in Sochaczew(1939)a.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Polish cavalry galloping through a bombed town during the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] in 1939.]]
While most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns.

A popular myth is that Polish cavalry armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September near Krojanty, when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabres scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Two examples illustrate how the myth developed. First, because motorised vehicles were in short supply, the Poles used horses to pull anti-tank weapons into position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Time Staff|date=April 22, 1940|number= |title= The New Pictures|journal= Time|volume= |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763905-1,00.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, there were a few incidents when Polish cavalry was trapped by German tanks, and attempted to fight free. However, this did not mean that the Polish army chose to attack tanks with horse cavalry.&lt;ref name=Davies324&gt;Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' pp. 324-325&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on the Eastern Front, the [[Red Army]] did deploy cavalry units effectively against the Germans.&lt;ref name=Davies325&gt;Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;
(See also [[Polish cavalry#Cavalry charges and propaganda|Polish cavalry]].)

A more correct term should be &quot;mounted infantry&quot; instead of &quot;cavalry&quot;, as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation, for which they were very suitable in view of the very poor road conditions in pre-war Poland. Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances; lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle. Individual equipment did include a sabre, probably because of well-established tradition, but in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet. Moreover, the [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle]] of 1939 included, apart from the mounted soldiers themselves, light and heavy machine guns (wheeled), [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35]], anti-aircraft weapon, artillery like [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti tank gun or light and scout tanks, etc.

The Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania. Three Greek cavalry regiments (two mounted and one partially mechanised) played an important role in the Italian defeat in this difficult terrain.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Armed Forces of World War II 1914-1945, Andrew Mollo, ISBN 0-85613-296-9&lt;/ref&gt;

By the final stages of the war only the Soviet Union was still fielding mounted units in substantial numbers, some in combined mechanized and horse units. The advantage of this approach was that in exploitation mounted infantry could keep pace with advancing tanks. Other factors favouring the retention of mounted forces included the high quality of Russian [[Cossacks]] and other horse cavalry; and the relative lack of roads suitable for wheeled vehicles in many parts of the Eastern Front. Another consideration was that the logistic capacity required to support very large motorised forces exceeded that necessary for mounted troops.

Romanian, Hungarian and Italian cavalry had been dispersed or disbanded following the retreat of the Axis forces from Russia. Germany still maintained some mounted (mixed with bicycles) SS and Cossack units until the last days of the War. 18th Indian Cavalry Regiment (later 18 Cavalry of [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]]), fought in a dismounted role, in Tobruk as part of [[9th Australian Division]].

The U.S. Army's last horse cavalry actions were fought during World War II: a) by the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] in World War II - a small mounted regiment of [[Philippine Scouts]] which fought the Japanese during the retreat down the Bataan peninsula, until it was effectively destroyed by January 1942; and b) on captured German horses by the mounted reconnaissance section of the U.S. 10th Mountain Division in a spearhead pursuit of the German Army across the Po Valley in Italy in April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Personal memoirs of Colonel Ernest Neal Cory, Jr., Esquire&lt;/ref&gt; The last horsed U.S. Cavalry (the [[2nd Cavalry Division (United States)|Second Cavalry Division]]) were dismounted in March 1944.

All British Army cavalry regiments had been mechanised since 1 March 1942 when the [[Queen's Own Yorkshire Dragoons]] ([[Yeomanry]]) was converted to a motorised role, following mounted service against the Vichy French in Syria the previous year. The final cavalry charge by British Empire forces occurred on 21 March 1942 when a 60 strong patrol of the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry near [[Toungoo]] airfield in central [[Burma]]. The [[Sikh]] [[sowar]]s of the Frontier Force cavalry, led by Captain Arthur Sandeman, charged in the old style with sabres and most were killed.

The last substantive and successful classical cavalry charge of the war - and the final such confirmed charge in history - was probably that made in August 1942 near [[Isbushensky]] on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] river by a cavalry unit of the [[Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia]] (''Corpo di Spedizione Italiano in Russia'', or CSIR) on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The 2nd squadron of the 3rd Dragoons ''Savoia Cavalleria'' Regiment of the Prince Amedeo Duke of Aosta Fast (''Celere'') Division, armed with sabres and hand grenades, outflanked an estimated 2,000 Soviet infantry while the remainder of the regiment took Isbushensky in a dismounted attack.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jeffrey T.

[[Image:W-3 Sokół.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Polish [[PZL W-3 Sokół]] of the 66 Air Force Squadron, 25th Aeromobile Cavalry Brigade.]]
The [[Soviet Army]] retained horse cavalry divisions until 1955, and even at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an independent horse mounted cavalry squadron in [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Carey Schofield, Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, 1991, p.133-134&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[armour|armored]] units of the modern United States Army retain the designation of &quot;[[Armoured cavalry]]&quot;. The United States also had &quot;[[Air assault|air cavalry]]&quot; units equipped with [[helicopter]]s, though that designation has fallen out of use, with the term Air Assault coined for that mission and modern &quot;cavalry&quot; being retained for ground-based mobility.

While most modern &quot;cavalry&quot; units have some historic connection with formerly mounted troops this is not always the case. The modern Irish Defence Force (IDF) includes a &quot;Cavalry Corps&quot; equipped with [[Panhard]] armoured cars and [[FV101 Scorpion|Scorpion tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles]]. The Irish Defense Force has never included horse cavalry since its establishment in 1922 (other than a small mounted escort drawn from the Artillery Corps when required for ceremonial occasions). However, the mystique of the cavalry is such that the name has been introduced for what was always a mechanised force.

[[Image:US forces Operation Enduring Freedom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[United States Army Special Forces]] on horseback with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] of [[Afghanistan]], which frequently used horses as military transport.]]

Some engagements in late 20th and early 21st century [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] wars involved mounted troops, particularly against partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure. Such units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry. Examples occurred in Afghanistan, Portuguese Africa and Rhodesia. The French Army used existing mounted squadrons of [[Spahis]] to a limited extent for patrol work during the Algerian War (1954–62) and the Swiss Army maintained a mounted dragoon regiment for combat purposes until 1973. There were reports of Chinese mounted troops in action during frontier clashes with Vietnam in the mid/late 1970s. The Portuguese Army used horse mounted cavalry with some success in the wars of independence in Angola and Mozambique in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1964-79 [[Rhodesian Bush War]] the [[Rhodesian Army]] created an elite mounted infantry unit called [[Grey's Scouts]] to fight unconventional actions against the rebel forces of [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]]. The horse mounted infantry of the Scouts were very effective and feared by their opponents in the rebel African forces. In the 1978 to present [[Afghan Civil War]] there have been several instances of horse mounted combat.

South and Central American armies maintained mounted cavalry longer than those of Europe, Asia or North America. The Mexican Army included a number of horse mounted cavalry regiments as late as the mid 1990s and the Chilean Army had five such regiments in 1983 as mounted mountain troops (see Jane's &quot;Armed Forces of Latin America&quot; by Adrian J. English).

A number of armored regiments in the [[British Army]] retain the historic designations of Hussars, Dragoons, Dragoon Guards or Lancers. Only the [[Household Cavalry]] squadrons maintained for ceremonial duties in London are mounted.

Cavalry or mounted gendarmerie units continue to be maintained for purely or primarily ceremonial purposes by the United States, British, French, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Dutch, Chilean, Portuguese, Moroccan, Nigerian, Venezuelan, Brazilian, Peruvian, Paraguayan, Polish, Argentine, Senegalese, Jordanian, Pakistani, Indian, Spanish and Bulgarian armed forces. The Army of the Russian Federation has recently reintroduced a ceremonial mounted squadron wearing historic uniforms.

In the United States, the Horse Cavalry Detachment of the U.S. Army's [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] is made up of active duty soldiers, still functions as an active unit, trained to approximate the weapons, tools, equipment and techniques used by the United States Cavalry in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pao.hood.army.mil/1stCavDiv/horseDet/default.html First Team! Horse Cavalry Detachment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbell, Gary. &quot;21st Century Horse Soldiers.&quot; ''Western Horseman'', December 2006, pp. 45-50&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Parsons' Mounted Cavalry is a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit which forms part of the [[Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].

The [[French Army]] still has regiments with the historic designations of [[Cuirassiers]], [[Hussars]], [[Chasseurs]], [[Dragoons]] and [[Spahi]]s. Only the cavalry of the [[French Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] and a ceremonial fanfare (trumpeters) for the cavalry/armoured branch as a whole are now mounted.

[[Image:French Republican Guard cavalry DSC03123.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Cavalry of the [[French Republican Guard]]  - May 8, 2005 celebrations]]

In the [[Canadian Army]], a number of regular and reserve units have cavalry roots, including [[The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal)]], [[the Governor General's Horse Guards]], [[Lord Strathcona's Horse]], the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]], and the [[South Alberta Light Horse]]. Of these, only the Lord Strathcona's Horse &lt;ref&gt;http://www.strathconas.ca/bmenu_history.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the Governor General's Horse Guards maintain an official ceremonial horse-mounted cavalry troop or squadron.&lt;ref&gt;The Honours, Flags, and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Australian and New Zealand armies follow the British practice of maintaining traditional titles ([[Australian Light Horse|Light Horse]] or Mounted Rifles) for modern mechanised units.  However, neither country retains a horse-mounted unit.

Today, the [[Indian Army]]'s [[61 Cavalry|61st Cavalry]] is reported to be the largest remaining non-ceremonial horse-mounted cavalry in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html India Polo Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; It was raised in 1951 from the amalgamated state cavalry squadrons of Gwailior, Jodhpur, and Mysore. The 61st Cavalry and the President's Body Guard parade in full dress uniform in New Delhi each year in what is probably the largest assembly of traditional cavalry still to be seen in the world.  Both the Indian and the Pakistani armies maintain armoured regiments with the titles of [[Lancer]]s or [[Horse]], dating back to the 19th century.

As of 2007 the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] employs two battalions of horse cavalry in Xinjing Military District for border patrol work (see China-Defense.com website). In the wake of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], there have been calls to rebuild the army horse inventory for disaster relief in difficult terrain.

==Light and armored cavalry==
{{See also|Heavy cavalry|light cavalry}}
[[Image:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander the Great]] using armoured cavalry, fighting Persian King [[Darius III]]]]Historically, cavalry was divided into [[Light cavalry|light]] and [[heavy cavalry|armoured cavalry]] and [[Horse archer]]s. The differences were their role in combat, the size of the mount, and how much armor was worn by the mount and [[Equestrianism|rider]].

Early light cavalry (like the auxiliaries of the Roman army) were typically used to [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[skirmish]], to cut down retreating infantry, and for defeating enemy missile troops. Armoured cavalry such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Cataphract]] were used as shock troops&amp;mdash;they would charge the main body of the enemy and, in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle, hence the later term &quot;battle cavalry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p.490, Lynn&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gunpowder warfare|Gunpowder Age]], armored cavalry become obsolescent. However, many units retained [[cuirass]]es and helmets for their protective value against [[sword]] and [[bayonet]] strikes and the morale boost these provide to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and battle cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.

Since the development of armored warfare the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines. [[Armored car (military)|Armored car]]s and [[light tank]]s have adopted the [[reconnaissance]] role while medium and heavy tanks are regarded as the decisive [[shock troops]].

== Social status ==
From the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport.

For this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high [[social status]]. This was most clearly seen in the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of [[peasants]] on foot. If landlords and peasants came into conflict, the peasants would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.
[[Image:blues.and.royals.closeup.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A Trooper of the [[Blues and Royals]] on mounted duty in [[Whitehall]], London]]
In later national armies, service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status. For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means, even after it became possible for officers of the line infantry regiments to live on their pay. Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable (though often highly professional) frontier or colonial units. These included the British Indian cavalry, the Russian [[Cossacks]] or the French [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]].

During the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their royal or imperial guards. These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards through to large formations intended for active service. The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the Prussian Imperial Guard an example of the latter. In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies.

==On film==
Some small sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film [[Waterloo (1970 film)|''Waterloo'']], which featured some 2000 cavalrymen,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} some of them cossacks. It included detailed displays of the horsemanship required to manage animal and weapons in large numbers at the gallop (unlike the real [[battle of Waterloo]], where deep mud significantly slowed the horses).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/waterloo.html ''Waterloo''] Film review by Major J G H Corrigan. Accessed 2008-02-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gary Cooper]] movie [[They Came to Cordura|''They Came to Cordura'']] contains an excellent scene of a cavalry regiment deploying from march to battleline formation. A smaller-scale cavalry charge can be seen in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|''The Lord of the Rings'']] (2003); although the finished scene has substantial [[computer-generated imagery]], raw footage and reactions of the riders are shown in the Extended Version DVD Appendices.

The '''citric acid cycle''' — also known as the '''tricarboxylic acid cycle''' ('''TCA cycle'''), the '''Krebs cycle''', or recently in certain former [[Soviet Bloc]] countries the '''Szent-Györgyi-Krebs cycle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |work= Heymans Institute of Pharmacology  |title= Archives Internationales de Pharmacodynamie Et de Therapie |publisher= H. Engelcke  |year= |month=|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Hans-Werner |last1=Altmann|first2= Franz |last2=Büchner  |title= Handbuch der allgemeinen Pathologie |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |year= 1962 |month=|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — is a series of [[enzyme]]-catalysed [[chemical reaction]]s, which is of central importance in all living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, especially those that use [[oxygen]] as part of [[cellular respiration]]. In [[eukaryotic]] cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the [[mitochondrion]]. The components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established by discovery of Vitamin C by Hungarian&lt;ref&gt; http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1937/szent-gyorgyi-bio.html &lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] and continued on to its complex metabolism into energy and metabolites by Nobel laureate [[Hans Adolf Krebs]], a German born, Jewish refugee to Britain.&lt;ref&gt; www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1541.html &lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[aerobic organism]]s, the citric acid cycle is part of a [[metabolic pathway]] involved in the chemical conversion of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s and [[protein]]s into [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] to generate a form of usable energy. Other relevant reactions in the pathway include those in [[glycolysis]] and [[pyruvate oxidation]] before the citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] after it. In addition, it provides [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] for many compounds including some [[amino acid]]s and is therefore functional even in cells performing [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].  Its centrality to many paths of biosynthesis suggest that it was one of the earliest formed parts of the cellular metabolic processes, and may have formed [[abiogenesis|abiogenically]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Nick (2010), &quot;Life Ascending: the 10 great innovations of evolution&quot; (Profile)&lt;/ref&gt;

==A simplified view of the process==
* The [[citric acid]] cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon [[acetyl]] group from [[acetyl-CoA]] to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).
* The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two [[carboxyl]] groups as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The carbons lost as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in anabolism,  they may not be lost, since many TCA cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite document|format=PDF|last1=Wolfe |first1=R. R.|last2= Jahoor |first2=F.  |year=1990| url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/51/2/248.pdf |title=Recovery of labeled CO}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during the infusion of C-1- vs C-2-labeled acetate: implications for tracer studies of substrate oxidation. ''Am J Clin Nutr.'' '''51(2)''':248-52. PMID 2106256&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is transferred as energy-rich [[electrons]] to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming NADH. For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced.
* Electrons are also transferred to the electron acceptor Q, forming QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
* At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.

==Steps==

Two [[carbon]] atoms  are [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the energy from these reactions being transferred to other metabolic processes by [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] (or [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and as electrons in [[NADH]] and [[Ubiquinol|QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The  NADH generated in the TCA cycle may later donate its electrons in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] to drive ATP synthesis; [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is covalently attached to [[succinate dehydrogenase]], an enzyme functioning both in the TCA cycle and the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] in oxidative phosphorylation. FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore, facilitates transfer of electrons to [[coenzyme Q]], which is the final electron acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain.&lt;ref name=[[Stryer]]&gt;{{cite book |last= Berg |first=J.

The GTP that is formed by GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase may be utilized by [[nucleoside-diphosphate kinase]] to form ATP (the catalyzed reaction is GTP + ADP → GDP + ATP).&lt;ref name=[[Stryer]]/&gt;

==Products==

Products of the first turn of the cycle are: ''one GTP (or ATP), three NADH, one QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, two CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Because two acetyl-CoA [[molecules]] are produced from each [[glucose]] molecule, two cycles are required per glucose molecule. Therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two GTP, six NADH, two QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and four CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

The total number of ATP obtained after complete oxidation of one glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is estimated to be between 30 and 38. A recent assessment of the total ATP yield with the updated proton-to-ATP ratios provides an estimate of 29.85 ATP per glucose molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rich |first=PR |title=The molecular machinery of Keilin's respiratory chain |journal=Biochem.

== Regulation ==
''Although pyruvate dehydrogenase is not technically a part of the citric acid cycle, its regulation is included here.''

The regulation of the TCA cycle is largely determined by substrate availability and product inhibition. NADH, a product of all dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle with the exception of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]],  [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|&amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]], and also [[citrate synthase]]. [[Acetyl-coA]] inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], while [[succinyl-CoA]] inhibits succinyl-CoA synthetase and [[citrate synthase]]. When tested in vitro with TCA enzymes,  ATP inhibits [[citrate synthase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|&amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]; however, ATP levels do not change more than 10% in vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. There is no known [[allosteric]] mechanism that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an [[allosteric]] effector whose concentration changes less than 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Voet|first1= D. |last2= Voet|first2= J.

Calcium is used as a regulator. It activates [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|&amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increases the reaction rate of many of the steps in the cycle, and therefore increases flux throughout the pathway.

Citrate is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits [[phosphofructokinase]], an enzyme involved in [[glycolysis]] that catalyses formation of [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]],a precursor of pyruvate. This prevents a constant high rate of flux when there is an accumulation of citrate and a decrease in substrate for the enzyme.

Recent work has demonstrated an important link between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] ([[HIF1A|HIF]]). HIF plays a role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. HIF is synthesized consititutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues mediates their interaction with the von Hippel Lindau [[E3 ubiquitin ligase]] complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. This reaction is catalysed by [[prolyl hydroxylase|prolyl 4-hydroxylase]]s. Fumarate and succinate have been identified as potent inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases, thus leading to the stabilisation of HIF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koivunen |first1=P. |last2=Hirsila |first2=M. |last3=Remes |first3=A.

== Major metabolic pathways converging on the TCA cycle ==
Several [[catabolic]] pathways converge on the TCA cycle. Reactions that form intermediates of the TCA cycle in order to replenish them (especially during the scarcity of the intermediates) are called [[anaplerotic reactions]].

The citric acid cycle is the third step in [[carbohydrate catabolism]] (the breakdown of sugars). Glycolysis breaks glucose (a six-carbon-molecule) down into [[pyruvate]] (a three-carbon molecule). In [[eukaryote]]s, pyruvate moves into the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. It is converted into acetyl-CoA by [[pyruvate decarboxylation|decarboxylation]] and enters the citric acid cycle.

In [[protein catabolism]], [[protein]]s are broken down by [[protease]]s into their constituent amino acids. The carbon backbone of these [[amino acid]]s can become a source of energy by being converted to acetyl-CoA and entering into the citric acid cycle.

In [[fat catabolism]], [[triglyceride]]s are [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to break them into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. In the liver the glycerol can be converted into glucose via [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] and [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] by way of [[gluconeogenesis]]. In many tissues, especially heart tissue, fatty acids are broken down through a process known as [[beta oxidation]], which results in acetyl-CoA, which can be used in the citric acid cycle. Beta oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of [[Methylenes|methylene]] groups produces [[propionyl CoA]], which is then converted into [[succinyl-CoA]] and fed into the citric acid cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Halarnkar  |first1=P  |last2=Blomquist  |first2=G  |title=Comparative aspects of propionate metabolism |journal=Comp. Biochem. Physiol., B |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=227–31 |year=1989 |pmid=2647392 |doi=10.1016/0305-0491(89)90270-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by [[glycolysis]], the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules, in eukaryotes.
The citric acid cycle is called an [[amphibolic]] pathway because it participates in both [[catabolism]] and [[anabolism]].

[[File:Bat-m.jpg|thumb|BAT-M engineering vehicle of [[Russia]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]]]

'''Military engineering vehicle'''s are vehicles built for the construction work or for the transportation of [[combat engineering|combat engineer]]s on the battlefield.  These vehicles can range from civilian equipment to purpose built military vehicles.

== Types of military engineering vehicles ==
=== Civilian and militarized heavy equipment ===
[[Image:D9-us pic28m.jpg|300px|thumb|USMC [[Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]]. The civilian tractor is fitted with an armor kit, produced by [[Israel Military Industries]].]]
Military engineering can employ a wide variety of [[Heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]] in the same or similar ways to how this equipment is used outside the military.  [[Bulldozer]]s, [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, [[grader]]s, [[excavator]]s, [[dump truck]]s, loaders, and backhoes all see extensive use by military engineers.

Military engineers may also use civilian heavy equipment which was modified for military applications. Typically, this involves adding armour for protection from battlefield hazards such as artillery, unexploded ordnance, mines, and small arms fire.  Often this protection is provided by [[armour plate]]s and steel jackets.  Some examples of armoured civilian heavy equipment are the [[IDF Caterpillar D9]], American D7 TPK, Canadian D6 [[Armored bulldozer|armoured bulldozer]], cranes, graders, excavators, and [[M35 2-1/2 ton cargo truck]].

Militarized heavy equipment may also take on the form of traditional civilian equipment designed and built to unique military specifications.  These vehicles typically sacrifice some depth of capability from civilian models in order to gain greater speed and independence from prime movers.  Examples of this type of vehicle include high speed backhoes such as the Australian Army's High Mobility Engineering Vehicle (HMEV) from Thales or the Canadian Army's Multi-Purpose Engineer Vehicle (MPEV) from Arva.

''The main article for civilian heavy equipment is:''  [[Heavy equipment (construction)]]

=== Armoured engineering vehicle ===
[[File:Pionierpanzer Dachs (2008).jpg|thumb|''PiPz Dachs'' AEV of the [[German Army]] (2008)]]
[[File:MID Polish.jpg|right|thumb|Polish Army [[PT-91_Twardy#MID_Bizon-S|MID Bizon-S]]]]
Typically based on the platform of a main battle tank, these vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture.  In the US the term &quot;combat engineer vehicle (CEV)&quot; is used, in the UK the term &quot;[[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVRE)&quot; is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term &quot;armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)&quot; is used.  There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes or lifting booms.

These vehicles are designed to directly conduct obstacle breaching operations and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield.  

Good examples of this type of vehicle include the UK [[Trojan (vehicle)|Trojan AVRE]], the Russian IMR, and the US [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].

It should be noted that while the term &quot;armoured engineer vehicle&quot; is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces.  Thus, &quot;armoured engineer vehicle&quot; used generically would refer to AEV, AVLB, Assault Breachers, and so on.

=== Armoured earth mover ===
Lighter and less multi-functional than the AEVs described above, these vehicles are designed to conduct earth-moving work on the battlefield. These vehicles have greater high speed mobility than traditional heavy equipment and are protected against the effects of blast and fragmentation.  Good examples are the American [[M9 ACE]] and the UK [[FV180 Combat Engineer Tractor]].

=== Breaching vehicle ===
These vehicles are equipped with mechanical or other means for the breaching of man made obstacles.  Common types of breaching vehicles include mechanical [[Mine flail|flails]], mine plough vehicles, and mine roller vehicles.  In some cases, these vehicles will also mount [[Mine-clearing line charge]]s.  Breaching vehicles may be either converted armoured fighting vehicles or purpose built vehicles. In larger militaries, converted AFV are likely to be used as ''assault breachers'' while the breached obstacle is still covered by enemy observation and fire, and then purpose built breaching vehicles will create additional lanes for following forces.

Good examples of breaching vehicles include the USMC M1 [[Assault Breacher Vehicle]], the UK [[Aardvark JSFU]], and the Singaporean Trailblazer

=== Bridging vehicles ===
[[File:M104 HAB.jpg|thumb|right|U.S Army [[M104 Wolverine]] Heavy Assault Bridge]]
Several types of military bridging vehicles have existed through the years.  The most notable are the various [[armoured vehicle-launched bridge]] (AVLB).  An AVLB is typically a modified tank hull converted to carry a bridge into battle in order to support crossing ditches, small waterways, or other gap obstacles.

Another type of bridging vehicle is the truck launched bridge.  Possibly the most notorious such vehicle was the former Soviet TMM bridging truck that could carry and launch a 10 meter bridge that could be daisy-chained with other TMM bridges to cross larger obstacles.  More recent developments have seen the conversion of AVLB and truck launched bridge with launching systems that can be mounted on either tank or truck for bridges that are capable of supporting heavy main battle tanks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armedforces-int.com/article/leguan-system.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier examples of bridging vehicles include a type in which a converted tank hull is the bridge.  On these vehicles, the hull deck comprises the main portion of the tread way while ramps extend from the front and rear of the vehicle to allow other climb over the vehicle and cross obstacles.  A notable example of this type of armoured bridging vehicle was the Churchill Ark used by the Allies in the Second World War.

''The main article for AVLB is:''  [[Armoured vehicle-launched bridge]]

=== Combat engineer section carriers ===
Another type of CEVs are armoured fighting vehicles which are used to transport [[sapper]]s ([[combat engineer]]s) and can be fitted with a [[bulldozer]]'s blade and other mine-breaching devices. They are often used as APCs because of their carrying ability and heavy protection. They are usually armed with [[machine gun]]s and grenade launchers and usually tracked to provide enough tractive force to push blades and rakes. Some examples are the U.S. [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113 APC]], [[IDF Puma]], [[Nagmachon]], Husky, and U.S. [[M1132 Engineer Support Vehicle|M1132 ESV]] (a [[Stryker]] variant).

=== Military ferries and amphibious crossing vehicles ===
[[Image:French army EFA DSC00859.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This field-deployable apparatus, known as [[EFA (mobile bridge)|EFA]], used by the engineers of the [[French Army]], may either be used as a [[bridge]] (deployed in a series), or as a [[ferry]] ]]
One of the major tasks of military engineering is crossing major rivers.  Several military engineering vehicles have been developed in various nations to achieve this task.  One of the more common types is the amphibious [[ferry]] such as the [[M3 Amphibious Rig]].  These vehicles are self-propelled on land, they can transform into raft type ferries when in the water, and often multiple vehicles can connect to form larger rafts or [[pontoon bridge|floating bridge]]s.  Other types of military ferries, such as the Soviet [[PTS (amphibious vehicle)|''Plavayushij Transportyor - Srednyj'']], are able to load while still on land and transport other vehicles cross country and over water.

In addition to amphibious crossing vehicles, military engineers may also employ several types of boats.  Military assault boats are small boats propelled by oars or an outboard motor and used to ferry dismounted infantry across water.

== Tank based combat engineering vehicles ==
[[Image:AVRE-Bobbin.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill &quot;Bobbin&quot;, a rolled roadsurface that could be laid for following vehicles to cross loose sand]] 
Most CEVs are [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s that may be based on a [[tank]] [[chassis]] and have special attachments in order to breach obstacles. Such attachments may include dozer blades, [[land mine|mine]] rollers, cranes etc. An example of an engineering vehicle of this kind is a bridgelaying tank, which replaces the turret with a segmented hydraulic [[bridge]]. 

The [[Hobart's Funnies]] of the Second World War were a wide variety of armoured vehicles for combat engineering tasks. They were allocated to the initial beachhead assaults by the British and Commonwealth forces in the D-Day landings

===Churchill tank===
The British [[Churchill tank]] because of its good cross-country performance and capacious interior with side hatches became the most adapted with modifications, the base unit being the AVRE carrying a large demolition gun.

===M4 Sherman===
[[Image:M4A3-Sherman-105mm-Dozer-latrun-1.jpg|right|thumb|M4 with 105 mm howitzer and a dozer blade.]] 
*'''Dozer''': The bulldozer blade was a valuable battlefield tool on the WWII [[M4 Sherman tank]]. A 1943 field modification added the hydraulic dozer blade from a [[Caterpillar D8]] to a Sherman.  The later M1 dozer blade was standardized to fit any Sherman with VVSS suspension and the M1A1 would fit the wider HVSS.  Some M4s made for the Engineer Corps had the blades fitted permanently and the turrets removed. In the early stages of the 1944 [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] before the Culin Cutter, breaking through the [[Bocage]] hedgerows relied heavily on Sherman dozers.

*'''M4 Doozit''': Engineer Corps' Sherman dozer with demolition charge on wooden platform and T40 ''Whizbang'' rocket launcher (the ''Doozit'' did not see combat but the [[Rocket artillery|''Whizbang'']] did).

*'''Bridgelayer''': The US field-converted a few M4 in Italy with A-frame-supported bridge and heavy rear counter-weight to make the Mobile Assault Bridge.  British developments for Shermans included the fascine (used by [[79th Armoured Division]]), Crib, Twaby Ark, Octopus, Plymouth (Bailey Bridge), and AVRE ([[Small Box Girder|SBG]] bridge).

*'''Mine-Clearing''': British conversions included the [[Sherman Crab]].  The US developed an extensive array of experimental types:
**'''T15/E1/E2''': Series of mine resistant Shermans based on the T14 kit. Cancelled at war's end.
**'''Mine Exploder T1E1 Roller''' (''Earthworm''): Three sets of 6 discs made from armor plate.
**'''Mine Exploder T1E2 Roller''': Two forward units with 7 discs only. Experimental.
**'''Mine Exploder T1E3/M1 Roller''' (''Aunt Jemima''): Two forward units with five 10' discs. Most widely used T1 variant, adopted as the M1. ([http://www.ww2incolor.com/gallery/us_army/mine_clearing_sherman picture])
**'''Mine Exploder T1E4 Roller''': 16 discs.
**'''Mine Exploder T1E5 Roller''': T1E3/M1 w/ smaller wheels. Experimental.
**'''Mine Exploder T1E6 Roller''': T1E3/M1 w/ serrated edged discs. Experimental
**'''Mine Exploder T2 Flail''': British Crab I mine flail.
**'''Mine Exploder T3 Flail''': Based on British Scorpion flail. Development stopped in 1943.
***'''Mine Exploder T3E1 Flail''': T3 w/ longer arms and sand filled rotor. Cancelled.
***'''Mine Exploder T3E2 Flail''': E1 variant, rotor replaced with steel drum of larger diameter. Development terminated at war's end.
**'''Mine Exploder T4''': British Crab II mine flail.
**'''Mine Exploder T7''': Frame with small rollers with two discs each. Abandoned.
**'''Mine Exploder T8''' (''Johnny Walker''): Steel plungers on a pivot frame designed to pound on the ground. Vehicle steering was adversely affected.
**'''Mine Exploder T9''': 6' Roller. Difficult to maneuver.
***'''Mine Exploder T9E1''': Lightened version, but proved unsatisfactory because it failed to explode all mines.
**'''Mine Exploder T10''': Remote control unit designed to be controlled by the following tank. Cancelled.
**'''Mine Exploder T11''': Six forward firing mortars to set off mines. Experimental.
**'''Mine Exploder T12''': 23 forward firing mortars. Apparently effective, but cancelled.
**'''Mine Exploder T14''': Direct modification to a Sherman tank, upgraded belly armor and reinforced tracks. Cancelled.
**'''Mine Excavator T4''': Plough device. Developed during 1942, but abandoned.
**'''Mine Excavator T5/E1/E2''': T4 variant w/ v-shaped plough. E1/E2 was a further improvement.
**'''Mine Excavator T5E3''': T5E1/E2 rigged to the hydraulic lift mechanism from the M1 dozer kit to control depth.
**'''Mine Excavator T6''': Based on the v-shape/T5, unable to control depth.
**'''Mine Excavator T2/E1/E2''': Based on the T4/T5's, but rigged to the hydraulic lift mechanism from the M1 dozer kit to control depth.

* '''ALT-55''' - Bulldozer version of the T-55 with large flat-plate superstructure, angular concave dozer blade on front and prominent hydraulic rams for dozer blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;&gt;[http://www.jedsite.info/tanks-tango/tango-numbers-su/t-62_series/t62-series.html &quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;]{{Verify credibility|date=December 2009}}{{Registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''T-55''' hull fitted with an excavator body and armoured cab.&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;/&gt;
* '''T-55 MARRS''' - Fitted with a Vickers armoured recovery vehicle kit. It has a large flat-plate turret with slightly chamfered sides, vertical rear and very chmfered front and a large A-frame crane on the front of the turret. The crane has cylindrical winch rope feer between legs of crane. A dozer blade is fitted to the hull front.&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;/&gt;
* '''[[MT-55]]''' or '''MTU-55''' (''Tankoviy Mostoukladchik'') - Soviet designator for Czechoslovakian MT-55A bridge-layer tank with scissors bridge.
* '''MTU-12''' (''Tankoviy Mostoukladchik'')&lt;ref name=OBT1&gt;Karpenko, A.V.''Obozreniye Bronetankovoj Tekhniki'' (1905-1995 gg.) Bastion Nevskij  455-56&lt;/ref&gt;- Bridge-layer tank with 12 m single span bridge that can carry 50 tonnes. The system entered service in 1955; today only a very small number remains in service. Combat weight: 34 tonnes.
* '''MTU-20 (Ob'yekt 602)''' (''Tankoviy Mostoukladchik'')&lt;ref name=OBT1/&gt; - The MTU-20 consists of a twin-treadway superstructure mounted on a modified T-54 tank chassis. Each treadway is made up of a box-type aluminum girder with a folding ramp attached to both ends to save space in the travel position. Because of that the vehicle with the bridge on board is only 11.6 m long, but the over all span length is 20 m. This is an increase of about 62% over that of the older MTU-1. The bridge is launched by the cantilever method. First the ramps are lowered and fully extended before the treadways are forward with the full load of the bridge resting on the forward support plate during launch. The span is moved out over the launching girder until the far end reaches the far bank. Next the near end is lowered onto the near bank. This method of launching gives the bridgelayer a low silhouette which makes it less vulnerable to detection and destruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;/&gt;
** '''MTU-20''' based on the T-55 chassis.&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;/&gt;

It was developed on the T-54 hull in 1951; series production started in 1955. The prototype Ob.9 had a commander's cupola with [[DShK|DShK 1938/46]] machine gun, but the production model has a square commander's hatch, opening to the right. Combat weight: 32 tons. Only a very small number remains in service.&lt;ref name=OBT1/&gt;
* '''BTS-3''' (''Bronetankoviy Tyagach Sredniy'' - Medium Armoured Tractor) - JVBT-55A in service with the Soviet Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;/&gt;
* '''BTS-4''' (''Bronetankoviy Tyagach Sredniy'' - Medium Armoured Tractor) - Similar to BTS-2 but with snorkel. In the West generally known as '''T-54T'''. There are many different models, based on the T-44, T-54, T-55 and [[T-62]].&lt;ref name=OBT2&gt;Karpenko, A.V.''Obozreniye Bronetankovoj Tekhniki'' (1905-1995 gg.)

** '''BTS-4BM''' - Experimental version of the BTS-4B with the capacity to winch over the front of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;/&gt;
* '''IMR (Ob'yekt 616)''' (''Inzhenernaya Mashina Razgrazhdeniya'') - Combat engineer vehicle. It's a T-55 that had its turret replaced with a hydraulically-operated 2t crane. The crane can also be fitted with a small bucket or a pair of pincer type grabs for removing trees and other obstacles. A hydraulically-operated dozer blade mounts to the front of the hull; it can be used in a straight or V-configuration only. The IMR was developed in 1969 and entered service five years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;/&gt;

** Improved version of BMR-2 that has been seen fitted with a wide variety of mine roller designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;JED The Military Equipment Directory&quot;/&gt;

===T-64===
* '''[[BAT-2]]''' – Fast [[combat engineering vehicle]] with the engine, lower hull and &quot;small roadwheels&quot; suspension of the T-64. [http://www.morozov.com.ua/eng/body/traktors/mt-tbas.php] The 40-ton tractor sports a very large, all axis adjustable V-shaped hydraulic dozer blade at the front, a single soil ripper spike at the rear and a 2-ton crane on the top. The crew compartment holds 8 persons (driver, commander, radio operators plus a five-man [[sapper]] squad for dismounted tasks). The highly capable BAT-2 was designed to replace the old [[T-54]]/AT-T based [[BAT-M]], but [[Warsaw Pact]] allies received only small numbers due to its high price and the old and new vehicles served alongside during the late Cold War.

===T-72===
* '''IMR-2''' (''Inzhenernaya Mashina Razgrashdeniya'') - [[Combat engineering vehicle]] (CEV). It has a telescoping crane arm which can lift between 5 and 11 metric tons and utilizes a pincers for uprooting trees. Pivoted at the front of the vehicle is a dozer blade that can be used in a V-configuration or as a straight dozer blade.

==Etymology==
[[File:Liber Iudiciorum visigòtic.png|thumb|upright|left|From the 12th century, this is thought to be the first written document in the [[Catalan language]]]]
The name ''Catalunya'' (Catalonia) began to be used in the 11th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 Enciclopèdia Catalana online: Catalunya (&quot;Geral de Cataluign, Raimundi Catalan and Arnal Catalan appear in 1107/1112&quot;)] '''in Catalan'''&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the group of counties that comprised the [[Spanish March]]. The origin of the term is subject to diverse interpretations. A theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' derives from the term &quot;Land of Castles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.cat/catalunya/eng/historia/historia2.htm |title=La formació de Catalunya |publisher=Gencat.cat |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; having evolved from the term ''castlà'', the ruler of a castle (see [[castellan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neni.galeon.com/aficiones1345631.html |title=Curiositats sobre Catalunya i el català |publisher=Neni.galeon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory therefore suggests that the name [[Castile (historical region)|Castille]] and Catalonia have the same etymology, though critics question this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediterranees.net/vagabondages/divers/catalogne.html La Catalogne : son nom et ses limites historiques]. Histoire de Roussillon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nUABAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=gotholandia&amp;dq=gotholandia&amp;hl=es&amp;pgis=1 |title=Historia del nacionalismo catalán - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' (Latin ''Gathia Launia'') derives from the name ''Gothia'' (or ''Gauthia''), &quot;Land of the [[Goths]]&quot;, since the [[Spanish March]] was first known as ''[[Gothia]]'', whence ''Gothland'' &gt; ''Gothlandia'' &gt; ''Gothalania'' &gt; ''Catalonia'' theoretically derived.&lt;ref&gt;Bulke, Ulrich. (1900). [http://books.google.com/books?id=tz3g_YzTQaUC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=gothia+catalonia&amp;ei=eSG3SLezDZTEzAS338H0Bg#PPR3,M1 A History of Spain from the Earliest Times to the Death of Ferdinand the Catholic]. Longman, Greens and Co. London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet another less accepted theory points to the [[Lacetani]], an [[Iberians|Iberian]] tribe that lived in the area and whose name, due to the Roman influence, could have evolved by [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] to ''Katelans'' and then ''Catalans''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/talaiotic1.pdf El Misteri de la Paraula Cathalunya]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The climate of Catalonia is diverse. The populated areas lying by the coast in Tarragona Province, Barcelona Province and Girona Province feature a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The inland part (including the Lleida Province and the inner part of Barcelona Province) show a mostly [[continental Mediterranean climate]]. The Pyreneean peaks have a [[mountain climate|mountain]] or even [[Alpine climate]] at the highest summits.

In the Mediterranean area, summers are dry and hot with sea breezes, and the maximum temperature is around 26-31 °C. Winter is cool or cold depending on the location. It snows frequently in the Pyrenees, and it occasionally snows at lower altitudes, even by the coastline. Spring and autumn are typically the rainiest seasons, except for the Pyrenean valleys, where summer is typically stormy.

The inland part of Catalonia is hotter and drier in summer. Temperature may reach 35 °C, some days even 40 °C. Nights are cooler there than at the coast, with the temperature of around 14-16 °C. Fog is not uncommon in valleys and plains; it can be especially persistent, with [[freezing drizzle]] episodes during winter, along the [[Segre River|Segre]] and in other river valleys.

==Statutes of Autonomy==
{{Main|Autonomous Communities of Spain}}

In the [[Constitution of Spain|Spanish constitution of 1978]] Catalonia, along with the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], was defined as a &quot;historical nationality&quot; and set apart from the rest of Spain. The same constitution gave Catalonia the automatic right to autonomy, which resulted in the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979]]. The rest of Spain, in a process spearheaded by [[Andalusia]], followed by [[Asturias]] and [[Castile and León]], and completed by 1985, carved itself into 14 additional autonomous regions that drafted their own Statutes of Autonomy. 

Both the 1979 Statute of Autonomy and the current one, approved in 2006, state that &quot;Catalonia, as a nationality, exercises its self-government constituted as an Autonomous Community in accordance with the Constitution and with the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which is its basic institutional law, always under the law in Spain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a1 |title=First article of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalunya |publisher=Gencat.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Preamble of the 2006 [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] states that the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] has defined Catalonia as a [[nation]], but that &quot;the Spanish Constitution recognizes Catalonia's national reality as a nationality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/castellano/titulo_preliminar.html Constitución Española, Título Preliminar]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Statute was approved by and sanctioned by both the Catalan and Spanish parliaments, and later by referendum in Catalonia, it has been subject to a legal challenge by the surrounding autonomous regions of Aragon, Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Europa Press/Madrid |url=http://www.hoy.es/prensa/20061115/nacional/admitidos-recursos-aragon-valencia_20061115.html |title=Admitidos los recursos de Aragón, Valencia y Baleares contra el Estatuto catalán. |publisher=Hoy.es |date=1997-12-01 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. The objections are based on various issues such as disputed [[cultural heritage]] but, especially, on the Statute's alleged breaches of the principle of &quot;solidarity between regions&quot; in fiscal and educational matters enshrined by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]]. After considerable legal debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=El País |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/anos/encarnizada/batalla/politica/elpepuesp/20100416elpepunac_26/Tes |title=Cuatro años de encarnizada batalla política. |publisher=El País |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] assessed the disputed articles and on 28 June 2010, issued its judgment on the principal allegation of unconstitutionality presented by the People's Party in 2006. The judgment granted clear passage to 182 articles of the 223 that make up the fundamental text. The court approved 73 of the 114 articles that the People's Party had contested, while declaring 14 articles unconstitutional in whole or in part and imposing a restrictive interpretation on 27 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/retoque/74/articulos/recurridos/elpepunac/20100629elpepinac_4/Tes |title=Ni un retoque en 74 artículos recurridos |publisher=El País |date= |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court accepted the specific provision that described Catalonia as a &quot;nation&quot;, however ruled that it was a historical and cultural term with no legal weight, and that Spain remained the only nation recognised by the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/Catalonia-39is-not-a-nation39.6412380.jp |title=Catalonia 'is not a nation' 10 July 2010 |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= 2010-07-10|accessdate=2011-01-06 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewbennett.es/2150/is-catalonia-a-nation-a-nationality-or-is-spain-the-only-nation-in-spain/ |title=Is Catalonia a nation or a nationality, or is Spain the only nation in Spain? |publisher=Matthewbennett.es |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fiona Govan in Madrid 1:59PM BST 29 Jun 2010 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7861118/Catalonia-can-call-itself-a-nation-rules-Spains-top-court.html |title=Catalonia can call itself a 'nation', rules Spain's top court 29 Jun 2010 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2011-01-06 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16490065 |title=A nationality, not a nation Jul 1st 2010 |publisher=Economist.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like some other parts in the rest of the [[Mediterranean]] coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Catalonia was colonised by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who settled around the [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] area.  Both Greeks and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] (who, in the course of the [[Second Punic War]], briefly ruled the territory) interacted with the main Iberian substratum. After the Carthaginian defeat by Rome, it became, along with the rest of [[Hispania]], part of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Tarraco]] being one of the main Roman posts in the Iberian Peninsula.

Catalonia then came under [[Goths|Visigothic]] rule for four centuries after Rome's collapse. In the 8th century, it came under [[Moors|Moorish]] [[al-Andalus]] control.  Still, after the defeat of Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]]'s troops at [[Battle of Tours|Tours]] in 732, the [[Franks]] conquered former Visigoth states which had been captured by the Muslims or had become allied with them in what today is the northernmost part of Catalonia. [[Charlemagne]] created in 795 what came to be known as the [[Marca Hispanica]], a [[buffer zone]] beyond the province of [[Septimania]] made up of locally administered separate [[petty kingdom]]s which served as a defensive barrier between the [[Umayyad]] [[Moors]] of Al-Andalus and the [[Frankish Kingdom]].

The Catalan culture, close to [[occitan]] culture, started to develop during the [[Middle Ages]] in a number of these petty kingdoms organised as small counties throughout the northernmost part of Catalonia. The [[List of Counts of Barcelona|counts of Barcelona]] were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the emperor and then the king of France, to whom they were feudatories (801–987).

In 987 the count of Barcelona did not recognize the French king [[Hugh Capet]] and his new dynasty, which put Catalonia effectively beyond Frankish rule. In 1137, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] married Queen [[Petronila of Aragon]], establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] that was to create the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Catalonia strongly supported the occitan country against the [[Albigensian Crusade]], and become itself later a target.

It was not until 1258, by means of the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]], that the king of France formally relinquished his feudal lordship over the counties of the [[Principality of Catalonia]] to the king of Aragon [[James I of Aragon|James I]], descendant of Ramon Berenguer IV.  This Treaty transformed the region's ''[[de facto]]'' autonomy into a ''[[de jure]]'' direct Aragonese rule. As part of the Crown of Aragon, Catalonia became a maritime power, helping expand the Crown by trade and conquest into the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], and ultimately even [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Corsica]], [[Naples]], [[Athens]].

Aragon had been very severely hit by the [[Black Death]] and by continuing outbreaks of plague. According to John Huxtable Elliott, &quot;Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality had lost 37% of its inhabitants, and was reduced to a population of something like 300,000.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.cz/books?id=X2Hf-crzPjUC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The revolt of the Catalans: a study in the decline of Spain (1598-1640)|author=John Huxtable Elliott|year=1984 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=26|isbn=0521278902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1410, King [[Martin of Aragon|Martin I]] died without surviving descendants. As a result, by the [[Pact of Caspe]], [[Ferdinand of Antequera]] from the Castilian dynasty of [[Trastamara]], received the Crown of Aragon as [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]].

His grandson, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] married in 1469, becoming ''[[Catholic Monarchs|los Reyes Catolicos]]''; subsequently, this event was seen as the dawn of the Kingdom of Spain. At that point, though personally and informally unified, both Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and Aragon maintained distinct territories, each keeping its own traditional institutions, Parliaments and laws. Castile commissioned the expeditions to the [[Americas]], and benefited from the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial]] riches. Political power had shifted away from Aragon toward Castile and, subsequently, from Castile to the [[Spanish Empire]]. King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was the first sole monarch holding the crowns of both Aragon and Castile.

For an extended period, Barcelona (not Catalonia), as part of the former Kingdom of Aragon, continued to retain its own usages and laws, but these gradually eroded in the course of the transition from [[feudalism]] to a modern state, fueled by the kings' struggle to have more [[Centralization|centralized]] territories. Over the next few centuries, Catalonia was generally on the losing side of a series of local conflicts that led steadily to more centralization of power in Spain, like the [[Reapers' War]] (1640–52). In 1659 the [[Spanish Crown]] offered the [[Roussillon|Roussillon territory]] to the [[Early Modern France|Kingdom of France]]. Now this territory is the Department of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], and also is named [[Northern Catalonia]] (''Catalunya Nord'').

The most significant conflict was the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which began when [[Charles II of Spain]] (the last Spanish [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]) died without a direct heir in 1700. Catalonia, like the other territories that had formed the Crown of Aragon in the Middle Ages, mostly rose up in support of the Habsburg pretender [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Valencia]] [[Holy Roman Emperor]], while the rest of Spain mostly adhered to the French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] claimant, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]. Following the [[Siege of Barcelona|fall of Barcelona]] on 11 September 1714, the &quot;special status&quot; of the territories belonging to the former Crown of Aragon and its institutions was abolished by the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], under which all its lands were incorporated to the Crown of Castile as provinces, within a united Spanish administration, as [[Spain]] moved towards a [[centralised government]] under the new Bourbon dynasty.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Catalonia became an industrial center; to this day it remains one of the most industrialised parts of Spain.  In the first third of the 20th century, Catalonia gained and lost varying degrees of autonomy several times, receiving its first statute of autonomy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931). This period was marked by political unrest and the preeminence of the [[Anarchist Catalonia|Anarchists]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39). The Anarchists had been active throughout the early 20th century, achieving the first eight-hour workday in the world in 1919. After the defeat of the Republic in the civil war, which brought General [[Francisco Franco]] to power, his regime suppressed any kind of public activities associated with Catalan nationalism, [[Anarchism]], [[Socialism]], [[Democracy]] or [[Communism]], including the publication of books on those subjects or simply discussion of them in open meetings. As part of this suppression, the use of Catalan in government-run institutions and during public events was banned.  During later stages of the [[Spain under Franco|Franco Régime]], certain folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the [[mass media]] had been forbidden, but was permitted from the early 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Marc Howard Ross | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Oe4popSDfW0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#PPA139,M1 | title = Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict | page = 139 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the theatre. Publishing in Catalan continued throughout the dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Resurgence of Catalan | first = Earl W | last = Thomas

After Franco's death (1975) and with the adoption of a democratic Spanish constitution (1978), Catalonia recovered political and cultural autonomy. Today, Catalonia is one of the most economically dynamic regions of Spain. The Catalan capital and largest city, Barcelona, is a major international cultural centre and a major tourist destination.

In 2010, Catalonia passed a ban on [[Bullfighting]], effective on the first day of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;''La Raza'', 8/8/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
{{Main|Languages of Catalonia}}
{{See also|Catalan language|Occitan}}

According to the most recent linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia {{As of|2009|lc=on}}, a plurality claims Spanish as &quot;their own language&quot; (46.53% Spanish compared to 37.26% Catalan). In everyday use, 11.95% of the population claim to use both languages equally, while 45.92% use mainly Spanish and 35.54% use mainly Catalan. There is a significant difference between the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]] (and, to a lesser extent, the [[Camp de Tarragona|Tarragona area]]), where Spanish is more spoken than Catalan, and the rest of Catalonia, where Catalan clearly prevails over Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idescat.cat/dequavi/?TC=444&amp;V0=15&amp;V1=2 |title=Idescat.

Also, starting with the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]], [[Aranese]] (a dialect of [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]]) has been official and subject to special protection in the [[Aran Valley]]. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants was the only place where a dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] has received full official status. Then, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Occitan became official throughout Catalonia. Occitan is the mother tongue of 22.4% of the population of [[Val d'Aran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/Llengcat/Documents/Dades_territori_poblacio/Altres/Arxius/EULP2008.pdf Enquesta d'usos lingüístics de la població 2008], cap. 8. ''La Val d’Aran''&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating in the historic territory of Catalonia, Catalan has enjoyed special status since the approval of the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]] which declares it to be the &quot;native language of Catalonia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 |title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Article 6) |publisher=Gencat.cat |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other languages with official status are Spanish, which has official status throughout Spain, and Aranese Occitan, which enjoys co-official status with Catalan and Spanish in the Aran Valley.

Under the Franco dictatorship, Catalan was excluded from the public education system and all other official use, so that for example families were not allowed to officially register children with Catalan names.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Miralles i Monserrat, Josep Massot i Muntaner (2001), &quot;Entorn de la història de la llengua&quot; (Environment of History of Language), Ed. by Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat, ISBN 84-8415-309-6, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; While never completely banned, Catalan language publishing was severely restricted during the early '40s, with only religious texts and small-run self-published texts being released. Some books were published clandestinely or circumvented the restrictions by showing publishing dates prior to 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=llibres+publicats+en+catala+1940&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9Ru-aJv_yk&amp;sig=sCLYG-Aqjnav4X2nsp6vKEM6Ib4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rbruTJ7BOoXJswagyd2kCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=(Franquisme i repressió: la repressió franquista als països catalans (1939-1975) By Pelai Pagès i Blanch) |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This policy was changed in 1946, when unrestricted publishing in Catalan resumed.&lt;ref&gt;[Franquisme i repressió: la repressió franquista als països catalans (1939-1975)

Lately, a similar [[sociolinguistic]] phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration. Catalan cultural activity increased in the 1960s and Catalan classes began thanks to the initiative of associations such as [[Òmnium Cultural]].

After the end of Franco's dictatorship, the newly established self-governing democratic institutions in Catalonia embarked on a long-term [[language policy]] to increase the use of Catalan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=li0Fmtfxd6kC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;ots=wZKdr8Yxeq&amp;dq=linguistic+policy+Catalonia&amp;sig=_XXKHeB8_QEDLJDSTjLGsPrlLYE |title=Multilingualism in Spain: Sociolinguistic and Psycholinguistic Aspects of Linguistic Minority Groups |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has, since 1983, enforced laws which attempt to protect and extend, the use of Catalan. This policy, known as the &quot;linguistic normalization&quot; (''normalització lingüística'' in Catalan, ''normalización lingüística'' in Spanish) has been supported by the vast majority of Catalan political parties through the last thirty years. Some groups consider these efforts a way to discourage the use of Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Belen Parra |url=http://medios.mugak.eu/noticias/noticia/150764 |title=Diario El Mundo, Spanish Only |publisher=Medios.mugak.eu |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elimparcial.es/contenido/19605.html |title=Diario El Imparcial, Spanish Only |publisher=Elimparcial.es |date=2008-07-26 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/ultimahora.php/2006/06/17/llaman_lputo_inmigrante_espanolr_al_padr |title=Diario Periodista Digital, Spanish Only |publisher=Blogs.periodistadigital.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/ultimahora.php/2006/02/02/la_justicia_obliga_a_una_escuela_de_bada |title=Diario Periodista Digital, Spanish Only |publisher=Blogs.periodistadigital.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some others, including the Catalan government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.cat/activitat/dspcp/transcripcions/09_Inter_hora_castella.pdf Page 13: Catalan Deputy of Education [[Ernest Maragall]] declares respect from the Catalan Government to Spanish language and to everyone's rights.

In Catalonia, on the other hand, there is a high social and political consensus on the language policies favoring Catalan, also among Spanish speakers and speakers of other languages&lt;ref name=&quot;presencia.cat&quot;&gt;http://www.presencia.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/349929-els-nous-catalanoparlants-a-favor-de-la-immersio-lingueistica.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;presencia.cat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asabadell.cat/ca/notices/2010/04/els_nous_catalanoparlants_defensen_la_llengua_catalana_8694.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.normalitzacio.cat/noticia/index.php?sec=noticia&amp;n=17756&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.si/books?id=HFGjJKrayXQC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=castellanoparlants+normalitzaci%C3%B3+linguistica&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pBdi6GKIUo&amp;sig=juWyOAg9yg8BZzlxzSWxGnFrs-o&amp;hl=sl&amp;ei=8sAoTc6bC4bMswawpNjNAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In Catalonia, the Catalan language policy has been challenged by some anti-nationalist intellectuals like [[Albert Boadella]]. Since 2006, the liberal [[Citizens - Party of the Citizenry]] has been one of the most consistent critics of the Catalan language policy within Catalonia. The local Catalan branch of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] has a more ambiguous position on the issue: on one hand, it demands a bilingual Catalan-Spanish education and a more balanced language policy that would defend Catalan without favoring it over Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y3yT9t_IDA&lt;/ref&gt; while on the other, a few local PP politicians have supported in their municipalties measures privileging Catalan over Spanish&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regio7.cat/arreu-catalunya-espanya-mon/2010/10/28/ppc-votar-favor-dun-reglament-sobre-catala/110435.html&lt;/ref&gt; and it has defended some aspects of the official language policies, sometimes against the positions of its colleagues from other parts of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3cat24.cat/noticia/889146/barcelones/Sanchez-Camacho-rebutja-la-postura-inicial-de-Bauza-de-derogar-la-llei-de-Normalitzacio-Linguistica-a-les-Illes-Balears&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Catalan is the main language of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction. Basic public education is given in Catalan, except for two hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. Businesses are required to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) at least in Catalan under penalty of fines. There is no obligation to display this information in either Occitan or Spanish, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages (which is often done, particularly in Spanish). The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.df5fba67cac781e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default&amp;newLang=en_GB |title=Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to increase the public use of Catalan and defend the rights of Catalan speakers. The law ensures that both Catalan and Spanish – being official languages – can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.21576464db9e81e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall&amp;contentid=bc1f657030672110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |title=Second article of Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but primary education can only be taken in Catalan language.

Due to the [[Immigration to Spain|intense immigration]] which Spain in general and Catalonia in particular experienced in the first decade of the 21st century, many foreign languages are spoken in various cultural communities in Catalonia, of which [[Riff language|Riff]] [[Berber languages|Berber]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocatalunya.ca/noticia/1612/ |title=Ràdio Catalunya - EL 80% DELS MARROQUINS QUE VIUEN A CATALUNYA SÓN BERBERS I PARLEN AMAZIC |publisher=Radiocatalunya.ca |date=2001-03-19 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and [[Urdu]] are the more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-catalunya-arabe-urdu-aparecen-lenguas-habituales-catalunya-creando-peligro-guetos-20090629150020.html |title=Árabe y urdu aparecen entre las lenguas habituales de Catalunya, creando peligro de guetos. |publisher=Europapress.es |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the regional [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of Catalonia was €216.9  billion ($314.4 billion), the highest in Spain, and per capita GDP was €30,700 – similar to that of countries such as the United Kingdom or Austria. However, it had the fourth per capita GDP in Spain, considerably behind the Basque Country (€34,100), [[Madrid (autonomous community)]] (€34,100) and [[Navarra]] (€32,900).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidem.com/catalonia/en/about/facts/index.jsp]  CIDEM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Madrid, con una renta de 28.850 euros por habitante, se sitúa más de un 30 por ciento por encima de la media nacional'' [http://www.madridiario.es/2007/Marzo/madrid/madrid/15491/pib-madrid-mas-alto.html Madrid tiene el PIB per cápita más alto de España]&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the GDP growth was 3.7%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idescat.cat/pub/?id=aec&amp;n=356&amp;lang=en] CIDEM&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the [[2008 financial crisis]], Catalonia is expected to suffer a [[recession]] amounting to almost a 2% contraction of its regional GDP in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/economia/BBVA/descarta/economia/catalana/caiga/elpepuespcat/20090114elpepueco_7/Tes |title=BBVA no descarta que la economía catalana caiga un 2% · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tourist destinations in Catalonia are the city of Barcelona, the beaches of the [[Costa Brava]] in [[Girona]] and the [[Costa Daurada]] in [[Tarragona]]. In the Pyrenees there are several ski resorts.

Many [[savings bank]]s are based in Catalonia: 10 of the 46 Spanish savings banks are Catalan and &quot;[[La Caixa]]&quot; is Europe's premier savings bank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdf.lacaixa.comunicacions.com/im/esp/199507rkg_esp.pdf |title=Ranking of Savings Banks |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[private bank]] in Catalonia is [[Banc Sabadell]], now fourth of the Spanish private banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroinvestor.es/Stock/ShowStockInfo.aspx?StockID=555911 |title=Profile of &quot;Banc Sabadell&quot; in Euroinvestor |publisher=Euroinvestor.es |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stock market of Barcelona, which in 2004 traded almost €205,000 million {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, is the second largest of Spain after Madrid, and [[Fira de Barcelona]] organizes international exhibitions and congresses to do with different sectors of the economy.

The main economic cost for the Catalan families is the purchase of a home. According to data from the Society of Appraisal on the 31 December 2005 Catalonia is, after Madrid, the second most expensive region in Spain for housing: 3,397 €/m² on average(See [[Spanish property bubble]]).

[[Image:CatMCVPtoponims.svg|250px|thumb|left|Administrative divisions of Catalonia.]]
After Franco's death in 1975  and the adoption of a democratic constitution in Spain in 1978, Catalonia recovered, and extended, the powers that it had gained in the statute of autonomy of 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/guia/antecedents/antecedents15.htm |title=Beginnings of the autonomous regime, 1918-1932 |publisher=Gencat.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost with the fall of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/guia/antecedents/antecedents16.htm |title=The republican Government of Catalonia, 1931-1939 |publisher=Gencat.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1939.

The region has gradually achieved more autonomy since 1979. The Generalitat holds exclusive jurisdiction in culture, environment, communications, transportation, commerce, public safety and local government, and shares jurisdiction with the Spanish government in education, health and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_4.htm |title=Title IV.

A relatively large sector of the population supports the ideas and policies of [[Catalan nationalism]] (also known as Catalanism),&lt;ref name=&quot;CIS poll&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.es/cis/opencms/-Archivos/Marginales/2400_2419/2410/e241000.html |title=CIS Poll covering, among others, nationalist opinions |publisher=Cis.es |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a political movement which defends the notion that Catalonia is a separate [[nation]] and advocates for either further political autonomy or full independence of Catalonia. 

In the last Catalan parliamentary election, the parties that are considered nationalist have obtained 50.02% of the votes and hold 72 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament. Parties supporting full independence from Spain have obtained 11.56% of the votes, down from 14.08% in 2006 and 16.5% in 2003.

Parties that consider themselves either Catalan nationalist or [[Independentism|independentist]] have been present in all Catalan governments since 1980. The largest Catalan nationalist party, [[Convergence and Union]], has ruled Catalonia from 1980 to 2003, and has come back to power in the [[Catalonian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 election]]. Between 2003 and 2010, a leftist coalition, composed by the [[Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya|Catalan Socialists' Party]], the pro-independence [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] and the leftist-environmentalist [[Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds|Initiative for Catalonia - Greens]], implemented policies that widened Catalonian autonomy from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.si/books?id=JKPZOz6t0TkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=m%C3%A9s+alt+nivell+autogovern+psc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c36DSHhrVr&amp;sig=is2l8XsUu8TTzG35vpuMwFK7ojk&amp;hl=sl&amp;ei=gMsoTamuD8zzsgax9dDEAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The support for Catalan nationalism ranges from the desire for independence from Spain expressed by Catalan independentists,&lt;ref name = &quot;CIS poll&quot;/&gt; to a more general demand for further autonomy and the [[federalization]] of Spain.&lt;ref name = &quot;CIS poll&quot;/&gt; Since 2007, support for Catalan independence has been on the rise. According to an opinion poll from July 2007, two thirds of Catalans believed Catalonia should have a higher level of autonomy, but only 16.5% supported full independence from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8787105592753353849#&lt;/ref&gt; The first survey following the Constitutional Court ruling that cut back elements of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy, published by ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' on July 18, 2010, found that a majority would support independence in a referendum.&lt;ref name=&quot;La Vanguardia poll&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/noticias/20100718/53967434806/el-fallo-del-tc-catapulta-el-respaldo-a-la-independencia-que-roza-el-50.html |title=La Vanguardia poll}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already in February of the same year, a poll by the [[Open University of Catalonia]] gave more or less results.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uoc.edu/portal/_resources/CA/documents/sala_premsa/noticies/Dossier_premsa_Diagnxstic_Catalunya-_Espanya.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other polls have shown lower support for independence, raging from 40 to 49%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cadenaser.com/espana/articulo/42-catalanes-dice-quiere-cataluna-sea-independiente/csrcsrpor/20101115csrcsrnac_3/Tes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.racalacarta.com/audio/audio_rac1/Racometre28setembre.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/noticias/20100907/53996153467/el-apoyo-a-la-independencia-remite-y-cae-al-40-tribunal-constitucional-partido-popular-instituto-nox.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In dozens of non-binding local referendums on independence, organised across the region from 13 September 2009, a large majority voted for independence, although critics argued that the polls were mostly held in pro-independence areas. As of December 2009, 94% of those voting backed independence from Spain, on a turn out of 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8410730.stm |title=Spain's Catalonia region in symbolic independence vote |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-12-14 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final local referendum is planned for Barcelona, in April 2011.

===Government and law ===
{{Main|Generalitat de Catalunya}}
[[Image:Girona river-street.jpeg|250px|thumb|View in [[Girona]].]]

The Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia is the fundamental organic law, second only to the Spanish Constitution from which the Statute originates. The Catalan Statute of Autonomy establishes that Catalonia is organized politically through the ''[[Generalitat de Catalunya]]'', conformed by the Parliament, the Presidency of the Generalitat, the Government or Executive Council and the other institutions created by the Parliament.

The seat of the Executive Council is the city of Barcelona. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the [[List of Presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya|presidents of Catalonia]] have been [[Jordi Pujol]] (1980–2003), [[Pasqual Maragall]] (2003–2006), [[José Montilla Aguilera]] (2006–2010) and [[Artur Mas]] incumbent {{As of|2010|lc=on}}. 

Catalonia is divided into four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona, which are subdivided into [[Catalonia/Comarques|comarques]] (roughly equivalent to counties), and further into local municipalities.

===Security forces===
Catalonia has its own police force, the ''[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]'', whose origins date back to the 18th century. Since 1980 they have been under the command of the Generalitat, and since 1994  they have expanded in number in order to replace the national ''[[Guardia Civil]]'' and ''[[Policía Nacional (Spain)|Policía Nacional]]'', which report directly to the Homeland Department of Spain. The national bodies retain personnel within Catalonia to exercise functions of national scope such as overseeing ports, airports, coasts, international borders, custom offices, the identification of documents and arms control amongst others.

Most of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions. The [[criminal justice]] system is uniform throughout Spain, while &quot;[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]&quot; is administered separately within Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/catalunya.htm |title=Legislació civil catalana |publisher=Civil.udg.es |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Navarre]], the Basque Country and Catalonia are the Spanish regions with the highest degree of autonomy in terms of [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]].

===Administrative and territorial division===
Catalonia is organized territorially into provinces. The 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia establishes the administrative organization of three local authorities: municipalities, [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] and [[Vegueria|vegueries]].

====Provinces====
Catalonia is divided administratively into four provinces, the governing body of which is the Diputació. The four provinces and its population are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idescat.cat/territ/BasicTerr?TC=5&amp;V0=5&amp;V1=08&amp;V3=863&amp;V4=435&amp;ALLINFO=TRUE&amp;PARENT=1&amp;GERMANS=TRUE&amp;CTX=B |title=Padró municipal d'habitants. Xifres Oficials. Recomptes. Any 2010 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=idescat |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Province of Barcelona]]: 5,507,813 population.
* [[Province of Girona]]: 752,026 population.
* [[Province of Lleida]]: 439,253 population.
* [[Province of Tarragona]]: 805,789 population.

====Municipalities====
There are at present 947 municipalities in Catalonia.

====Comarques====
[[Comarques of Catalonia|Comarques]] are entities composed by the municipalities to manage their responsibilities and services. The current regional division has its roots in a decree of the Generalitat de Catalunya of 1936 in effect until 1939 when it was suppressed by Franco. In 1987 the Government adopted the territorial division again in 1988 and three new comarques were added (Alta Ribagorça, Pla d'Urgell i Pla de l'Estany). At present there are 41.

The comarca of [[Val d'Aran]] has a special status and its autonomous government is named [[Conselh Generau d'Aran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l16-1990.html# |title=

====Vegueries====
[[Vegueria]] is a new division defined as a specific territorial area for the exercise of government and inter-local cooperation with legal personality.

====Other divisions====
The territorial plan of Catalonia (''Pla territorial general de Catalunya'') provided six general functional areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pla territorial general de Catalunya |url=http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/general/ptgeneral.jsp |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |accessdate=20 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was amended by Law 24/2001, of December 31, recognizing the [[Alt Pirineu i Aran]] as a new functional area differentiated of Ponent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/parcials/ptapa/aprovacio_definitiva.jsp Aprovació del Pla territorial parcial de l'Alt Pirineu i Aran]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 14 July 2010 the Catalan Parliament approved the creation of the functional area of the [[Penedès]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avui.elpunt.cat/noticia/article/3-politica/17-politica/195270.html|date=15 de juliol del 2010|work=Avui|title=El Parlament reconeix l'àmbit funcional del Penedès}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Catalonia covers an area of 32,114&amp;nbsp;km² with an official population of 7,354,411 (2008) from which non Spanish immigrants represent an estimated 12.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vilaweb.cat/www/elpunt/noticia?p_idcmp=2004564 &quot;Catalunya arriba a set milions d'habitants&quot;], Diari El Punt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/6226305.stm Catalans grapple with migrant influx]&quot;, BBC News. 3 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Urban Region of Barcelona]] includes 5,217,864 people and covers an area of 2.268&amp;nbsp;km² and about 1.7 million people live in a radius of 15&amp;nbsp;km from Barcelona. The metropolitan area of the Urban Region includes cities like [[l'Hospitalet de Llobregat]], Badalona, [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Cornellà de Llobregat]].

In 1900 the population of Catalonia was 1,984,115 people and in  1970 it was 5,107,606.&lt;ref&gt;http://www15.gencat.net/pres_catalunya_dades/AppPHP/cat/poblacio.htm {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; That increase was produced due to the demographic boom produced in Spain during the 60s and early 70s and also due to the large-scale internal migration produced from the rural interior of Spain to its industrial cities. In Catalonia that wave of internal migration arrived from several regions of Spain, especially Andalusia, [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and [[Extremadura]].

Immigration from other countries settled down in Catalonia in the 1990s and 2000s, a large percentage came from [[Africa]] and  [[Latin America]], and smaller numbers from [[Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]], often settle in urban centers such as Barcelona and industrial areas. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Transport==
===Airports===
[[Image:Torre Agbar - Barcelona, Spain - Jan 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Agbar]] in Barcelona]]

Airports in Catalonia are owned and operated by [[Aena]] (a [[Government of Spain|Spanish Government]] entity) except two airports in Lleida which are operated by [[Aeroports de Catalunya]] (an entity belonging to the [[Government of Catalonia]]).

*[[Barcelona International Airport]] (BCN, Aena)
*[[Girona-Costa Brava Airport]] (GRO, Aena)
*[[Reus Airport]] (REU, Aena)
*[[Lleida-Alguaire Airport]] (ILD, Aeroports de Catalunya)
*[[Sabadell Airport]] (QSA, Aena)
*[[La Seu d'Urgell Airport]] (LEU, Aeroports de Catalunya)

===Commercial and passenger ports===
The two main commercial and passenger ports in Catalonia are owned and operated by [[:es:Puertos del Estado|Puertos del Estado]] (a Spanish Government entity).

*[[Barcelona#Seaport|Port of Barcelona]]
*Port of [[Tarragona#Modern Tarragona|Tarragona]]
*Port of [[Palamós]] (only passenger)

===Roads===
{{see also|List of autopistes and autovies in Catalonia}}

There are 12,000&amp;nbsp;km of roads throughout Catalonia.

The principal highway is [[Autopista AP-7|AP-7]] known also as ''Autopista del Mediterrani''. It follows the coast from the French Border to [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], located south of Tarragona.  The main roads generally radiate from Barcelona.  The A-2 and AP-2 connect inland and onward to Madrid.

Other major roads are:

*[[Autopista AP-2|AP-2]]
*[[Autovía A-2|A-2]]
*[[N-II]]
*[[Autovía C-12|C-12]]
*[[Autovía A-16|A-16]] or C-32
*[[Autovía C-16|C-16]]
*[[Autopista C-17|C-17]]
*[[Autovía C-25|C-25]]
*[[Autovía A-26|A-26]]
*[[Autopista C-32|C-32]]
*[[Autopista C-60|C-60]]

===Railways===
Catalonia saw the first railway construction in Iberian Peninsula in 1848, linking Barcelona with [[Mataró]]. Given the topography most lines radiate from Barcelona.  The city has both suburban and inter-city services.  The main east coast line runs through the province connecting with the SNCF (French Railways) at [[Portbou]] on the coast.

There are two publicly owned railway companies operating in Catalonia: the Catalan [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya|FGC]] and the Spanish national [[RENFE]] that operates [[Rodalies de Catalunya]], MD, LD and High Speed services (AVE and Avant).

High speed [[AVE]] ([[Alta Velocidad Española]]) services from Madrid currently reach [[Lleida]], Tarragona and Barcelona. The official opening between Barcelona and [[Madrid]] took place 20 February 2008. The journey between Barcelona and Madrid now takes about 2 and a half hours. Construction has commenced to extend the high speed line northwards to connect with the French high speed TGV network.  This new line passes through Girona and there is a tunnel through the Pyrenees.

==Symbols of Catalonia==
{{Main|Catalan symbols}}
Catalonia has its own representative and distinctive symbols such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a8 |title=Statute of Catalonia (Article 8) |publisher=Gencat.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Flag of Catalonia.svg|thumb|The flag of Catalonia]]
*The flag of Catalonia, called ''la [[Senyera]]'', is a [[vexillological symbol]] based on the heraldic emblem  of [[Counts of Barcelona]] and the [[coat of arms]] of the Crown of Aragon, which consists of four red stripes on a golden background. It is an official symbol since the Statute of Catalonia of 1932.
*The National Day of Catalonia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l1-1980.html |title=Law 1/1980 where the Parlamient of Catalonia declares that 11th of September is the National Day of Catalonia |publisher=Noticias.juridicas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is on the Eleventh of September, and it is commonly called ''la diada''. It commemorates the 1714 [[Siege of Barcelona]] defeat during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].
*The anthem of Catalonia is ''[[Els Segadors]]'' and was written in its present form by [[Emili Guanyavents]] in 1899. The song is official by law from 25 February 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l1-1993.html |title=Law 1/1993 National Anthem of Catalonia |publisher=Noticias.juridicas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.boe.es/datos/imagenes/BOE/1993/074/A09308.tif Law 1/1993 in the BOE]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the events of 1639 and 1640 during the [[Catalan Revolt]].
**[[St George's Day#St. George's Day in Catalonia|St George's Day]] (''la diada de Sant Jordi'') is widely celebrated in all the towns of Catalonia on 23 April. It is a day where in addition to the exchange of books and roses, Catalans will proudly display their ''senyeres''.

==UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Catalonia==
There are several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in Catalonia:

==Popular culture==
{{Main|Traditions of Catalonia}}
[[Image:Festa major de la Seu d'Urgell.JPG|thumb|250px|''Gegants'' and ''Capgrossos'' in [[la Seu d'Urgell]] festival]] [[Image:3d10 fm de vilafranca.jpg|thumb|250px|3 of 10 with ''folre'' and ''manilles'' built by the [[Castellers de Vilafranca]].]]
''[[Castellers]]'' are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing ''colles castelleres'' (teams). This practice originated in the southern part of Catalonia during the 18th century.

The [[sardana]] is the most characteristic Catalan popular dance, other groups also practice ''[[Ball de bastons]]'', [[moixiganga]] or [[jota (music)|jota]] in the southern part. Musically the ''[[Music of Catalonia|Havaneres]]'' are also characteristic in the marine localities of the Costa Brava specially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a ''[[cremat]]'' of burned rum. The [[rumba (dance)|rumba]] is a more prevalent dance style.

In the greater celebrations other elements of the Catalan popular culture are usually present: the parades of ''[[Gegants i capgrossos|gegants]]'' (giants) and ''[[correfoc]]s'' of devils and firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is ''[[Patum de Berga|La Patum de Berga]]'' declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 25 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp Patum de Berga]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional local Catalan culture, traditions from other parts of Spain can be found as a result of migration from other regions. On July 28, 2010, [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|Catalonia became the second Spanish region]], after the Canary Islands, to forbid bullfighting. The ban, which will be effective as of January 1, 2012, had originated in a popular petition supported by over 180,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hCUSkWOROQvtXQvPrgGjjE3dZWag The Press Association: Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting, 28 July 2010]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constantine Kanaris''' (''or Canaris'', {{lang-el|'''Κωνσταντίνος Κανάρης'''}}) (1793 or 1795{{ndash}}September 2, 1877) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Prime Minister]], [[admiral]] and [[politician]] who in his youth was also a [[freedom fighter]], [[pirate]], [[privateer]] and merchantman.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse129&gt;Woodhouse, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Kanaris Konstantinos - Greek Fighter.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Constantine Kanaris during the Greek War of Independence.]]

He was born and grew up on the island of [[Psara]], close to the island of [[Chios]], in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. His exact year of birth is unknown. The official records of the [[Hellenic Navy]] indicate 1795 but modern Greek historians believe that 1793 is more probable.

Constantine was left an orphan at a young age. Having to support himself, he chose to became a seaman like most members of his family since the beginning of the 18th century. He was hired as a boy on the brig of his uncle Dimitris Bourekas.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Constantine gained his fame during the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821&amp;ndash;1829). Unlike most other prominent figures of the War, he had never been initiated in to the [[Filiki Eteria]] (Friendly Society), which played a significant role in the revolution against the [[Ottoman Empire]], primarily by secret recruitment of supporters against the Empire.

By early 1821, it had gained enough support to declare a revolution. This declaration seems to have surprised Constantine, who was absent at Odessa. He returned to [[Psara]] in haste and was there when the island joined the Revolution on April 10, 1821.

The island formed its own fleet of ships and the famed seamen of Psara, already known for their successful naval combats against [[pirate]]s and their well-equipped ships, proved to be effective at full naval war. Constantine soon distinguished himself as a [[fire ship]] captain.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse138&gt;Woodhouse, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lytras-nikiforos-pyrpolisi-tourkikis-navarhidas-apo-kanari.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|The destruction of the Ottoman flagship at [[Chios]] by Kanaris.]]

Notably at [[Chios]], where on the night of June 6/June 7, 1822 forces under his command destroyed the flagship of the Turkish admiral Nasuhzade Ali Pasha (or Kara-Ali Pasha) in revenge for the [[Chios Massacre]]. The admiral was holding a celebration, while Kanaris and his men managed to place a fire ship next to it. When the flagship's powder store caught fire, all men aboard were instantly killed. The Ottoman casualties comprised 2000 men, both naval officers and common sailors, as well as Kara-Ali himself.

Constantine led three further successful attacks against the Turkish fleet in 1822–1824. He was famously said to have encouraged himself by murmuring &quot;''Konstantí, you are going to die''&quot; every time he was approaching a Turkish warship on the fire boat he was about to detonate.

[[Egypt]] was technically a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the time but its  viceroy [[Mehemet Ali (Egypt)|Mohammad Ali]] (1769&amp;ndash;1849), had earned enough power to act independently from the Sultan and had formed his own army and naval fleet. It was headed by his adoptive son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] (1789&amp;ndash;1848). The latter had hired a number of veteran French officers - who had served under Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] and were discharged from the French army following his defeat - to help organise the new army. By 1824, it counted 100,000 men and was both better organised and better equipped than the Sultan's army.

Sultan [[Mahmud II]] offered to the viceroy the command of [[Crete]], if he agreed to send part of this army against the Greeks. They quickly reached an agreement. The Egyptian army, under the personal command of Ibrahim Pasha, started a successful campaign in both land and sea against the relatively ill-equipped, disorganized and outnumbered Greeks.

Among other victories, the Egyptian fleet managed to capture Psara on June 21, 1824. A part of the population managed to flee the island, but those who didn't were either sold into [[slave]]ry or slaughtered. The island was deserted and surviving islanders were scattered through what is now Southern Greece.

After the destruction of his home island, Constantine continued to lead his men into attacks with minor successes. Despite them, Ibrahim Pasha would be virtually undefeated until the [[Battle of Navarino]] of October 20, 1827. Then the Turkish-Egyptian fleet was destroyed by the combined naval forces of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]] and [[Russia]], that had taken the Greeks under their &quot;protection&quot;.

Following the end of the war and the independence of Greece, Constantine became an officer of the new Greek Navy, reaching the rank of Admiral, and later became a prominent politician.

==Political career==
[[Image:Oldkanaris.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Constantine Kanaris (1790-1877); Photographic Archive of Hellenic Literary and Historical Museum, Athens.]]

Constantine Kanaris was one of the few with the personal confidence of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] the first Head of State of independent Greece.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse152&gt;Woodhouse, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Kanaris served as Minister in various governments and then as [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]], in the provisional government, from March 11-April 11, 1844. He served a second term (October 27, 1848{{ndash}}December 24, 1849), and as Navy Minister in Mavrokordatos' 1854 cabinet.

In 1862, he was one of the few War of Independence veterans that helped in the bloodless revolution that deposed King [[Otto of Greece]] and put Prince William of Denmark on the Greek throne as King [[George I of Greece]]. Under George I, he served as a prime minister for a third term (March 17{{ndash}} April 28, 1864), fourth term (August 7, 1864{{ndash}}February 9, 1865) and fifth and last term (June 7{{ndash}}September 14, 1877).

Kanaris died on 2 September 1877 whilst still serving in office as Prime Minister. Following his death his government remained in power until September 14, 1877 without agreeing on a replacement at its head. He was buried in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]], where most Greek prime ministers and celebrated figures are also buried. After his death he was honored as a national hero.

To honour Kanaris, the Hellenic Navy named, in 18 December 1941, a Hunt III type destroyer after him. The Kanaris L51, the former HMS Hatherleigh, was transferred to Greece from the Royal Navy on July 1, 1972.  A destroyer, the [[USS Stickell (DD-888)|HNS Kanaris (D-212)]] (formerly USS ''Stickell'' (DD-888)), and on November 29, 2002 a frigate [http://www.hellenicnavy.gr/frigates_s_en.asp FFG Kanaris (F 464)] (an [[F-450 Elli|Elli (F 450)]] class frigate) were also named after him.

==Family==
[[File:Constantine Kanaris, munument in Kypseli, Athens.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Monument of Constantine Kanaris in [[Kypseli, Athens]].]]
In 1817, he married Despina Maniatis, a [[Maniot]] woman. They had seven children:
*Nikolaos Kanaris, (1818&amp;ndash;1848) - a member of a military expeditionary force to Beirut, killed there in 1848.
*Themistocles Kanaris, (1819&amp;ndash;1851) - a member of a military expeditionary force to Egypt, killed there in 1851.
*Thrasyvoulos Kanaris, (1820&amp;ndash;1898) - Admiral.
*Miltiades Kanaris, (1822&amp;ndash;1899) - Admiral, member of the Greek Parliament for many years, Naval Minister three times in 1864, 1871, and 1878.
*Lykourgos Kanaris, (1826&amp;ndash;1865) - Lawyer
*Maria Kanari, (1828&amp;ndash;1847) - married A. Balambano.
*Aristides Kanaris, (1831&amp;ndash;1863) - officer killed in the uprising of 1863.

[[Wilhelm Canaris]], a German Admiral, speculated that he might be a descendant of Constantine Kanaris. An official genealogical family history that was researched in 1938 showed that he was unrelated and that his family was from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hitler's Spy Chief: The Wilhelm Canaris Mystery |last=Bassett |first=Richard |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Cassell |location= |isbn=978-0304367184|page=65|pages=|url=http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Spy-Chief-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304367184|accessdate=|quote=His name was of Italian origin, as was later shown in an elaborate family tree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Edward Sagan''' ({{IPA-en|ˈseɪɡən}}) (November 9, 1934&amp;nbsp;– December 20, 1996) was an American [[astronomer]], [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]], [[Cosmology|cosmologist]], author, [[Popular science|science popularizer]], and [[Science communication|science communicator]] in the [[space science|space]] and [[natural science]]s. During his lifetime, he published more than 600 scientific papers and popular articles and was author, co-author, or editor of more than 20 books. In his works, he advocated [[Scientific skepticism|skeptical inquiry]] and the [[scientific method]]. He pioneered [[exobiology]] and promoted the [[SETI|Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI)]].

Sagan became world-famous for his [[popular science]] books and for the award-winning 1980 television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', which he narrated and co-wrote.&lt;ref name =Starchild&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/sagan.html | title=StarChild: Dr. Carl Sagan | publisher=NASA | accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cosmos (book)|book]] to accompany the program was also published. Sagan also wrote the novel [[Contact (novel)|''Contact'']], the basis for the 1997 [[Contact (film)|film of the same name]].

==Early life==
Carl Sagan was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York,&lt;ref name=poundstone&gt;{{Cite book | last=Poundstone | first=William | title=Carl Sagan: A Life in the Cosmos | pages=363–364, 374–375 | location=New York | publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company | year=1999 | isbn=0-805-05766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] family. His father, Sam Sagan, was a Russian immigrant garment worker; his mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, a housewife. Carl was named in honor of Rachel's biological mother, Chaiya Clara, in Sagan's words, &quot;the mother she never knew&quot;. Sagan graduated from [[Rahway High School]] in [[Rahway, New Jersey]], in 1951.&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;

He had one sister, Carol, and the family lived in a modest apartment near the Atlantic Ocean, in [[Bensonhurst]], a Brooklyn neighborhood. According to Sagan, they were [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] Jews, the most liberal of the three main Jewish groups. Both Sagan and his sister agree that their father was not especially religious, but that their mother &quot;definitely believed in God, and was active in the temple&amp;nbsp;... and served only [[Kosher]] meat.&quot;&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|12}} During the height of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], his father had to accept a job as a theater usher.

According to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's &quot;inner war&quot; was a result of his close relations with both his parents, who were in many ways &quot;opposites.&quot; Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had known &quot;extreme poverty as a child,&quot; and had grown up almost homeless in New York City during World War I and the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|2}} She had her own intellectual ambitions as a young woman, but they were blocked by social restrictions, because of her poverty, her being a woman and wife, and her Jewish religion. Davidson notes that she therefore &quot;worshiped her only son, Carl. He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams.&quot;&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|2}}

However, his &quot;sense of wonder&quot; came from his father, who was a &quot;quiet and soft-hearted escapee from the Czar.&quot; In his free time, he gave apples to the poor, or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's &quot;tumultuous&quot; garment industry.&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|2}} Although he was &quot;awed&quot; by Carl's &quot;brilliance, his boyish chatter about stars and dinosaurs,&quot; he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride, as part of his growing up.&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|2}} In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, ''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors''.&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|9}} Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking:

:''My parents were not scientists. They knew almost nothing about science. But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method.''&lt;ref name=Spangenburg/&gt;

=== 1939 World's Fair ===
Sagan recalls that one of his best experiences was when he was four or five years old, his parents took him to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. The exhibits became a turning point in his life. He later recalled the moving map of the &quot;America of Tomorrow&quot; exhibit: &quot;It showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses&amp;nbsp;— and it looked great!&quot;&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|14}} At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashlight that shined on a photoelectric cell created a cracking sound, and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope. He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television.  Sagan wrote:

:''Plainly, the world held wonders of a kind I had never guessed. How could a tone become a picture and light become a noise?''&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|14}}

He also saw one of the Fair's most publicized events, the burial of a time capsule at [[Flushing Meadows]], which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. &quot;The time capsule thrilled Carl,&quot; writes Davidson. As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues created similar time capsules, but ones that would be sent out into the galaxy. These were the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the ''[[Voyager Golden Record]]'' records, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World Fair.&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|15}}

=== World War II ===
During World War II, Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He writes, &quot;Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the Holocaust. Hitler was not a popular fellow in our household&amp;nbsp;... But on the other hand, I was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war.&quot; His sister, Carol, said that their mother &quot;above all wanted to protect Carl&amp;nbsp;... She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with World War II and the Holocaust.&quot;&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|15}} Sagan's book, ''The Demon-Haunted World'' (1996), included his memories of this conflicted period in his life, where his family dealt with the realities of the war in Europe, but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.&lt;ref name=Spangenburg/&gt;

===Inquisitiveness about nature===
Soon after entering elementary school, he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a library card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer:
:''I went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars&amp;nbsp;... And the answer was stunning. It was that the Sun was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just little points of light&amp;nbsp;... The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. It was a kind of religious experience. There was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.''&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|18}}

About the time he was six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. While there, they went to the [[Hayden Planetarium]] and walked around the museum's exhibits of space objects, such as [[meteorites]], and displays of [[dinosaurs]] and animals in natural settings. Sagan writes about those visits:
:''I was transfixed by the dioramas&amp;nbsp;— lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world. [[Penguin]]s on the dimly lit Antarctic ice;&amp;nbsp;... a family of [[gorilla]]s, the male beating his chest,&amp;nbsp;... an American [[grizzly bear]] standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye.''&lt;ref name=Keay/&gt;{{rp|18}}

His parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials. His interest in space, however, was his primary focus, especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], which stirred his imagination about life on other planets, such as [[Mars]]. According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets, became a &quot;driving force in his life, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten.&quot;&lt;ref name=Spangenburg&gt;Spangenburg, Ray; Moser, Diane. ''Carl Sagan: A Biography'', Greenwood Publ. (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and scientific career ==
He attended the [[University of Chicago]], where he participated in the Ryerson Astronomical Society,&lt;ref&gt;http://astro.uchicago.edu/RAS/&lt;/ref&gt; received a bachelor of arts with general and special honors in 1954, a bachelor of science in 1955, and a master of science in [[physics]] in 1956 before earning a PhD in [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/931111/sagan.shtml Graduate students receive first Sagan teaching awards]&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as an undergraduate, Sagan worked in the laboratory of the [[geneticist]] [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]]. From 1960 to 1962 Sagan was a [[Miller Research Fellows|Miller Fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  From 1962 to 1968, he worked at the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Sagan lectured and did research at [[Harvard University]] until 1968, when he moved to [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]]. He became a [[Professor|full Professor]] at Cornell in 1971, and he directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]] there. From 1972 to 1981, Sagan was the Associate Director of the Center for Radio Physics and Space Research at Cornell.

Sagan was associated with the American space program from its inception. From the 1950s onward, he worked as an advisor to [[NASA]], where one of his duties included briefing the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[astronaut]]s before their flights to the [[Moon]]. Sagan contributed to many of the [[robotic spacecraft]] missions that explored the [[solar system]], arranging experiments on many of the expeditions. He conceived the idea of adding an unalterable and universal message on spacecraft destined to leave the solar system that could potentially be understood by any [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] that might find it. Sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into [[outer space|space]]: a [[gold|gold-]][[anodized]] [[Pioneer plaque|plaque]], attached to the space probe [[Pioneer 10]], launched in 1972. [[Pioneer 11]], also carrying another copy of the plaque, was launched the following year. He continued to refine his designs; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the [[Voyager Golden Record]] that was sent out with the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space probes in 1977. Sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Space Station]] at the expense of further robotic missions.&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Rose interview, January 5, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan taught a course on [[critical thinking]] at [[Cornell University]] until he died in 1996 from pneumonia, a few months after finding that he was in remission of [[myelodysplastic syndrome]].

== Scientific achievements ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sagan in Time mag 10-20-80.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''Time'' cover, Oct. 20, 1980&lt;/center&gt;{{ifdc|File_name.ext|log=2011 April 16|date=April 2011}}]] --&gt;
Sagan's contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet [[Venus]]. In the early 1960s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of that planet's surface, and Sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a [[Time-Life]] book, ''[[Planets (book)|Planets]]''. His own view was that Venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined. He had investigated radio emissions from Venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of {{convert|500|°C|-2}}. As a visiting scientist to NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], he contributed to the first [[Mariner program|Mariner]] missions to Venus, working on the design and management of the project. [[Mariner 2]] confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of Venus in 1962.

Sagan was among the first to hypothesize that [[Saturn|Saturn's]] moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] might possess subsurface oceans of water. This would make Europa potentially habitable for life.&lt;ref&gt;Much of Sagan's research in the field of planetary science is outlined by William Poundstone. Poundstone's biography of Sagan includes an 8-page list of Sagan's scientific articles published from 1957 to 1998. Detailed information about Sagan's scientific work comes from the primary research articles. Example: Sagan, C., Thompson, W. R., and Khare, B. N. ''[[Titan: A Laboratory for Prebiological Organic Chemistry]]'', Accounts of Chemical Research, volume 25, page 286 (1992). There is commentary on this research article about Titan at [http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/T/Titanprebiotic.html The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight].&lt;/ref&gt; Europa's subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft [[Galileo probe|Galileo]]. Sagan also helped solve the mystery of the reddish haze seen on Titan, revealing that it is composed of complex [[organic molecules]] constantly raining down onto the moon's surface.

He further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of Venus and Jupiter as well as seasonal changes on [[Mars]]. Sagan established that the atmosphere of Venus is extremely hot and dense with pressures increasing steadily all the way down to the surface. He also perceived [[global warming]] as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of runaway [[greenhouse effect]]. Sagan and his Cornell colleague [[Edwin Ernest Salpeter]] speculated about [[Jupiter#Possibility of life|life in Jupiter's clouds]], given the planet's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules. He studied the observed color variations on Mars' surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed but shifts in surface dust caused by [[dust storm#Extraterrestrial dust storms|windstorms]].

Sagan is best known, however, for his research on the possibilities of [[exobiology|extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acid]]s from basic chemicals by [[radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bartelby.com/65/sa/Sagan-Ca.html | title=Sagan, Carl Edward | publisher=Columbia University Press | author=The Columbia Encyclopedia | work=Sixth Edition | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also the 1994 recipient of the [[Public Welfare Medal]], the highest award of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] for &quot;distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.planetary.org/about/founders/carl_sagan.html | title=Carl Sagan | publisher=The Planetary Society | author=The Planetary Society| accessdate=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was denied membership in the Academy, reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=[[Gregory Benford]] | title = A Tribute to Carl Sagan: Popular &amp; Pilloried | journal=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)]] | volume=13 | issue=1 | year=1997 | url=http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/popular-and-pilloried/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan's ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to better understand the cosmos&amp;nbsp;— simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race, and the relative insignificance of the Earth in comparison to the [[universe]]. He delivered the 1977 series of [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]] in London. He hosted and, with [[Ann Druyan]], co-wrote and co-produced the highly popular thirteen-part [[PBS]] television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' modeled on [[Jacob Bronowski|Jacob Bronowski's]] ''[[The Ascent of Man]]''.

Sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life. He urged the scientific community to listen with [[radio telescope]]s for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms. So persuasive was he that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating [[SETI]] published in the journal ''Science'' and signed by 70 scientists including seven [[Nobel Prize]] winners. This was a tremendous turnaround in the respectability of this controversial field. Sagan also helped [[Frank Drake|Dr. Frank Drake]] write the [[Arecibo message]], a radio message beamed into space from the [[Arecibo radio telescope]] on November 16, 1974, aimed at informing extraterrestrials about Earth.

Sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal ''[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]'' for twelve years. He co-founded the ''[[Planetary Society]]'', the largest space-interest group in the world, with over 100,000 members in more than 149 countries, and was a member of the [[SETI Institute]] Board of Trustees. Sagan served as Chairman of the Division for Planetary Science of the [[American Astronomical Society]], as President of the Planetology Section of the [[American Geophysical Union]], and as Chairman of the Astronomy Section of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

At the height of the [[Cold War]], Sagan became involved in public awareness efforts for the effects of [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] when a mathematical climate model suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could upset the delicate balance of life on Earth. He was one of five authors&amp;nbsp;— the &quot;S&quot; of the [[Nuclear winter#1983|&quot;TTAPS&quot;]] report as the research paper came to be known. He eventually co-authored the scientific paper hypothesizing a global [[nuclear winter]] following nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;Turco RP, [[Owen Toon|Toon OB]], Ackerman TP, Pollack JB, Sagan C. ''[[Climate and smoke: an appraisal of nuclear winter]],'' [[Science (journal)|Science]], volume 247, pages 166–176 (1990).

Carl Sagan discussed his involvement in the political nuclear winter debates and his erroneous global cooling prediction for the Gulf War fires in his book, ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-authored the book ''A Path Where No Man Thought: Nuclear Winter and the End of the Arms Race'', a comprehensive examination of the phenomenon of nuclear winter.

''Cosmos'' covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the [[origin of life]] and a perspective of our place in the [[universe]]. The series was first broadcast by the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] in 1980, winning an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and a [[Peabody Award]]. It has been broadcast in more than 60 countries and seen by over 500 million people,&lt;ref name=Starchild/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html|title=Carl Sagan|publisher=EMuseum@Minnesota State University|accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Retaining two refs here as Wikipedia seems to have incorrectly stated 500 million for years... --&gt; making it the most widely watched [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmolearning.com/documentaries/cosmos/|title=CosmoLearning Astronomy|publisher=CosmoLearning|accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''Time'' magazine ran a cover story about Sagan soon after the show broadcast, referring to him as &quot;creator, chief writer and host-narrator of the new public television series Cosmos, [and] takes the controls of his fantasy spaceship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951539,00.html ''Time'' magazine], cover story, Oct. 20, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan also wrote books to popularize science, such as ''[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]'', which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of ''A Personal Voyage'', and became the best-selling science book ever published in English;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 | title=Meet Dr. Carl Sagan | publisher=The Science Channel | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Dragons of Eden|The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence]]'', which won a [[Pulitzer Prize]]; and ''[[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]''. Sagan also wrote the best-selling science fiction novel [[Contact (novel)|''Contact'']], but did not live to see the book's 1997 [[Contact (film)|motion picture adaptation]], which starred [[Jodie Foster]] and won the 1998 [[Hugo Award]].

[[Image:Pale Blue Dot (uitsnede).png|thumb|left|[[Pale Blue Dot]]: Earth is a bright pixel when photographed from &quot;[[Voyager 1]]&quot; six billion kilometers out (past Pluto). Sagan encouraged NASA to generate this image.]] He wrote a sequel to ''Cosmos,'' [[Pale Blue Dot (book)|''Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space'']], which was selected as a notable book of 1995 by ''[[The New York Times]]''. He appeared on [[PBS|PBS']] [[Charlie Rose]] program in January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |last=Sagan |first=Carl |subject=Carl Sagan, Astronomer: Author of Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space |interviewer=Charlie Rose |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1127834163386485385#2370s |format=.SWF |program=Charlie Rose |callsign=PBS |city=New York |date=January 5, 1995 |accessdate=April 25, 2007}} starts at 00:39:29&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan also wrote an introduction for the bestselling book by [[Stephen Hawking]], ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''. Sagan was also known for his popularization of science, his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public, and his positions in favor of [[scientific skepticism]] and against [[pseudoscience]], such as his [[Debunker|debunking]] of the [[Betty and Barney Hill abduction]]. To mark the tenth anniversary of Sagan's passing, David Morrison, a former student of Sagan, recalled &quot;Sagan's immense contributions to planetary research, the public understanding of science, and the skeptical movement&quot; in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, David (2007).

Sagan hypothesized in January 1991 that enough smoke from the 1991 [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] &quot;might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia&amp;nbsp;...&quot; He later conceded in ''The Demon-Haunted World'' that this prediction did not turn out to be correct: &quot;it ''was'' pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4°–6°C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Sagan, Carl |title=The demon-haunted world: science as a candle in the dark |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1996 |page=257 |isbn=0-394-53512-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study noted that modern computer models have been applied to the Kuwait oil fires, finding that individual smoke plumes are not able to loft smoke into the stratosphere, but that smoke from fires covering a large area, like some forest fires or the burning of cities that would be expected to follow a nuclear strike, would loft significant amounts of smoke into the stratosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espo.nasa.gov/docs/crystalface/Jost2004.grl.pdf In-situ observations of mid-latitude forest fire plumes deep in the stratosphere]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16641 EO Newsroom: New Images&amp;nbsp;— Smoke Soars to Stratospheric Heights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpi.com/remsensing/midatm/smoke.html Observations of Boreal Forest Fire Smoke in the Stratosphere]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fromm |title=Smoke in the Stratosphere: What Wildfires have Taught Us About Nuclear Winter |journal=Eos Trans.

In his later years Sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for near Earth objects that might impact the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Head | first = Tom | authorlink = Tom Head | title = Conversations With Carl Sagan | publisher=University Press of Mississippi | year = 2006 | pages = 86–87 | isbn = 1-578-06736-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When others suggested creating large nuclear bombs that could be used to alter the orbit of a NEO that was predicted to hit the Earth, Sagan proposed the Deflection Dilemma: If we create the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth, then we also create the ability to deflect an asteroid towards the Earth&amp;nbsp;— providing an evil power with a true doomsday bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = David Morrison&amp;nbsp;— Taking a Hit: Asteroid Impacts &amp; Evolution | series = Silicon Valley Astronomy Lectures | url = http://www.astrosociety.org/education/podcast/index.html | airdate = October 3, 2007 | season = 2007–2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sagan | first = Carl | last2 = Ostro | title = Long-Range Consequences of Interplanetary Collisions | journal=Issues in Science and Technology | volume = X | issue = 4 | year = 1994 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Billions and billions ===
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sagan with a model of the [[Viking Lander]] probes which would land on [[Mars]]. Sagan examined possible landing sites for Viking along with Mike Carr and Hal Masursky.]]

From ''Cosmos'' and his frequent appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', Sagan became associated with the [[catch phrase]] &quot;billions and billions&quot;. Sagan stated that he never actually used the phrase in the ''Cosmos'' series.&lt;ref name=BandB&gt;{{Cite book | last=Sagan | first=Carl | coauthors=p. 3-4 | title=[[Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium|Billions and Billions]] | location=New York | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=1998 | isbn=0-345-37918-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The closest that he ever came was in the book ''Cosmos'', where he talked of &quot;billions ''upon'' billions&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Yale Book of Quotations|article=Carl Sagan|author=Fred R. Shapiro and Joseph Epstein|pages=660|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-10798-6|isnb13=9780300107982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bquote|A galaxy is composed of gas and dust and stars&amp;nbsp;— billions upon billions of stars.|||Carl Sagan|''[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]'', chapter 1, page 3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]|author=Carl Sagan|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1980|isbn=0-345-33135-4|isbn13=9780345331359}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, his frequent use of the word ''billions'', and distinctive delivery emphasizing the &quot;b&quot; (which he did intentionally, in place of more cumbersome alternatives such as &quot;billions with a 'b'&quot;, in order to distinguish the word from &quot;millions&quot; in viewers' minds),&lt;ref name=BandB /&gt; made him a favorite target of comic performers, including [[Johnny Carson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagan_takes_questions|title=Carl Sagan Takes Questions: More From His 'Wonder and Skepticism' CSICOP 1994 Keynote|publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|date=June 26, 1994|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Kroeger]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Bronson Pinchot]], [[Penn Jillette]], [[Harry Shearer]], and others. [[Frank Zappa]] satirized the line in the song &quot;[[Be In My Video]]&quot;, noting as well &quot;atomic light&quot;. Sagan took this all in good humor, and his final book was entitled ''[[Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium|Billions and Billions]]'' which opened with a tongue-in-cheek discussion of this catch phrase, observing that Carson himself was an amateur astronomer and that Carson's comic caricature often included real science.&lt;ref name=BandB /&gt;

The popular perception of his characterization of large cosmic quantities continued to be a sense of wonderment at the vastness of space and time, as in his phrase &quot;The total number of stars in the Universe is larger than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth&quot;. However, this famous saying was widely misunderstood, as he was in fact referring to the world being at a &quot;critical branch point in history&quot; as in the following quote from ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', Episode 8: &quot;Journeys in Space and Time&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Those worlds in space are as countless as all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the earth. Each of those worlds is as real as ours and every one of them is a succession of incidents, events, occurrences which influence its future. Countless worlds, numberless moments, an immensity of space and time. And our small planet at this moment, here we face a critical branch point in history: what we do with our world, right now, will propagate down through the centuries and powerfully affect the destiny of our descendants. It is well within our power to destroy our civilization and perhaps our species as well.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sagan units ===
As a humorous tribute to him, a ''sagan'' has been defined as a [[unit of measurement]] equal to at least four billion, since the lower bound of a number conforming to the constraint of ''billions and billions'' must be two billion plus two billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sagan sagan] at dictionary.reference.com (definition from the [[Jargon File]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]], [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E3DF143EF934A25757C0A962958260 ON LANGUAGE; Footprints on the Infobahn], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 17, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social concerns ==
Sagan believed that the [[Drake equation]], on substitution of reasonable estimates, suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the [[Fermi paradox]] suggests [[technological]] civilizations tend to destroy themselves rather quickly. This stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself, with the hope of avoiding such a [[Doomsday event|cataclysm]] and eventually becoming a [[spacefaring]] species.  Sagan's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of [[end of civilization|human civilization]] in a [[nuclear holocaust]] was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|''Cosmos'']], called &quot;Who Speaks for Earth?&quot; Sagan had already resigned from the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board and voluntarily surrendered his top secret clearance in protest over the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_6_60/ai_78889720/ | work=Humanist | title=A New Sense of the Sacred Carl Sagan's &quot;Cosmic Connection&quot; | first=Ann | last=Druyan | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his marriage to his third wife (novelist [[Ann Druyan]]) in June 1981, Sagan became more politically active&amp;nbsp;— particularly in opposing escalation of the [[nuclear arms race]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]].

In March 1983, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]&amp;nbsp;— a multi-billion dollar project to develop a comprehensive [[missile defense|defense]] against attack by [[nuclear missiles]], which was quickly dubbed the &quot;Star Wars&quot; program. Sagan spoke out against the project, arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required, and far more expensive to build than for an enemy to defeat through [[decoy]]s and other means&amp;nbsp;— and that its construction would seriously destabilize the nuclear balance between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], making further progress toward [[nuclear disarmament]] impossible.

When Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] declared a unilateral moratorium on the [[nuclear testing|testing of nuclear weapons]], which would begin on August 6, 1985&amp;nbsp;— the 40th anniversary of the [[atomic bomb]]ing of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]]&amp;nbsp;— the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than [[propaganda]], and refused to follow suit. In response, American [[anti-nuclear]] and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the [[Nevada Test Site]], beginning on [[Easter Sunday]] in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chain-link fence at the test site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Personal life and beliefs ==
Sagan was married three times&amp;nbsp;— in 1957, to biologist [[Lynn Margulis]], mother of [[Dorion Sagan]] and [[Jeremy Sagan]]; in 1968, to artist [[Linda Salzman Sagan|Linda Salzman]], mother of [[Nick Sagan]]; and in 1981, to author [[Ann Druyan]], mother of Alexandra Rachel (Sasha) Sagan and Samuel Democritus Sagan. His marriage to Druyan continued until his death in 1996.

[[Isaac Asimov]] described Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own. The other, he claimed, was the [[Computer science|computer scientist]] and [[artificial intelligence]] expert [[Marvin Minsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978 | author=Asimov, Isaac | pages =217, 302 | publisher=Doubleday/Avon | year=1980 | isbn= 0-380-53025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others&amp;nbsp;— for example [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Albert Einstein]]&amp;nbsp;— considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Sagan | first=Carl | authorlink=Carl Sagan | title=Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science | chapter=Chapter 23 | page=330 | publisher=Ballantine Books | date=February 12, 1986 | isbn=0345336895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another description of his view of God, Sagan emphatically writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://atheism.about.com/library/quotes/bl_q_CSagan.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite his criticism of religion, Sagan denied that he was an atheist, saying &quot;An atheist has to know a lot more than I know. An atheist is someone who knows there is no god. By some definitions atheism is very stupid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/18/AR2006041801870.html | author=Achenbach, Joel | title=Worlds Away | work=Washington Post | page=W15 | date=April 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply to a question in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Sagan answered, &quot;I'm agnostic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Head, Tom | title=Conversations with Carl | journal=Skeptic | volume=13 | pages=32–38 | issue=1}}Excerpted in {{Cite book | author=Head, Tom, ed. | year=2006 | publisher=University of Mississippi Press | isbn=1-57806-736-7. | unused_data=Conversations with Carl Sagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan maintained that the idea of a creator of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=[[The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]] | page=278 | last=Sagan | first=Carl | year=1996 | publisher=Ballantine Books | location=New York | isbn=0-345-40946-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his last wife, Ann Druyan, he was not a believer: {{Quote|When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me&amp;nbsp;— it still sometimes happens&amp;nbsp;— and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again.

In 2006, Ann Druyan edited Sagan's 1985 Glasgow ''[[Gifford Lectures]] in Natural Theology'' into a book, ''[[The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God]]'', in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the [[nature|natural world]].
[[Image:Carl Sagan with two CDC employees.png|thumb|right|Carl Sagan (center) speaks with [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] employees in 1988.]]
Sagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic; one of his most famous quotations, in ''Cosmos'', was, &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= Encyclopaedia Galactica | series= Cosmos | credits= Carl Sagan (writer/host) | network= PBS | airdate= December 14, 1980 | number= 12 | minutes= 01:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called the &quot;Sagan Standard&quot; by some&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://lawsoflife.co.uk/sagans-standard/ | title= Sagan's Standard | work=The Unwritten Laws of Life | publisher= CSBC Ltd | author=Hugh Rawson | year=2008 | accessdate=Feb 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]], [[Marcello Truzzi]], &quot;An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=[[Marcello Truzzi]] | title = On the Extraordinary: An Attempt at Clarification | journal=[[Zetetic Scholar]] | volume=1 | issue=1 | page=11 | year=1978 | url=http://www.tricksterbook.com/truzzi/ZS-Issues-PDFs/ZeteticScholarNo1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.skepticalinvestigations.org/anomalistics/practices.htm | title=On Some Unfair Practices towards Claims of the Paranormal | work=Oxymoron: Annual Thematic Anthology of the Arts and Sciences, Vol.2: The Fringe | publisher=Oxymoron Media | author=Truzzi, Marcello | year=1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea originated with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827), a French [[mathematician]] and astronomer who said, &quot;The weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportioned to its strangeness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=497783&amp;format=print A sense of place in the heartland], The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Online&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in his life, Sagan's books elaborated on his skeptical, [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] view of the world. In ''[[The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]]'', he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones, essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the [[scientific method]]. The compilation ''[[Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium]]'', published in 1997 after Sagan's death, contains essays written by Sagan, such as his views on [[abortion]], and his widow Ann Druyan's account of his death as a [[skepticism|skeptic]], [[agnosticism|agnostic]], and [[freethought|freethinker]].

Sagan warned against humans' tendency towards [[anthropocentrism]]. He was the faculty adviser for the Cornell Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In the ''Cosmos'' chapter &quot;Blues For a Red Planet&quot;, Sagan wrote, &quot;If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Sagan | first=Carl | authorlink=Carl Sagan | title=Cosmos | page=108 | publisher=Ballantine Books | date=October 12, 1985 | isbn=0345331354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan was a user and advocate of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Under the pseudonym &quot;Mr. X&quot;, he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the 1971 book ''Marihuana Reconsidered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Grinspoon | first=Lester | authorlink=Lester Grinspoon | edition=2nd | title=Marihuana Reconsidered | location=Oakland, CA | publisher=Quick American Archives | year=1994 | isbn=0-932-55113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Mr. X | url=http://marijuana-uses.com/mr-x/ | publisher=Marijuana-Uses.com | author=Sagan, Carl | accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: The book's title spells 'Marihuana' with an 'h' --&gt; The essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of Sagan's works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences. After Sagan's death, his friend [[Lester Grinspoon]] disclosed this information to Sagan's biographer, Keay Davidson. The publishing of the biography, ''Carl Sagan: A Life'', in 1999 brought media attention to this aspect of Sagan's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/475954.stm | title=Carl Sagan: A Life in the Cosmos | publisher=BBC News | author=Whitehouse, David | date=October 15, 1999 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.druglibrary.org/think/~jnr/sagan.htm | title=US: Billions and Billions of '60s Flashbacks | work=San Francisco Examiner | author=Davidson, Keay | date=August 22, 1999 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://cannabisculture.com/articles/63.html | title=Carl Sagan: Toking Astronomer | work=Cannabis Culture Magazine | author=Larsen, Dana | date=November 1, 1999 | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, engineers at [[Apple Computer]] code-named the [[Power Macintosh 7100]] &quot;Carl Sagan&quot; in the hope that Apple would make &quot;billions and billions&quot; with the sale of the PowerMac 7100.&lt;ref name=poundstone/&gt;  The name was only used internally, but Sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent Apple a cease and desist letter.  Apple complied, but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to &quot;BHA&quot; for &quot;[[Notable litigation of Apple Computer#Libel dispute with Carl Sagan|Butt-Head Astronomer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poundstone, p. 364&quot;&gt;Poundstone, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.macobserver.com/columns/thisweek/2004/20041120.shtml | title=This Week in Apple History: November&amp;nbsp;14–20 | publisher=The Mac Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sagan then sued Apple for libel, a form of [[defamation]], in federal court.  The court granted Apple's motion to dismiss Sagan's claims and opined in [[Obiter dictum|dicta]] that a reader aware of the context would understand Apple was &quot;clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way&quot;, and that &quot;It strains reason to conclude that Defendant was attempting to criticize Plaintiff's reputation or competency as an astronomer. One does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase 'butt-head'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poundstone, p. 364&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sagan v. Apple Computer, Inc., 874 F.Supp. 1072 (USDC C.D. Cal. 1994), CV 94-2180 LGB (BRx); 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sagan then sued for Apple's original use of his name and likeness, but again lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poundstone374&quot;&gt;Poundstone, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan appealed the ruling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poundstone374&quot;/&gt;  In November 1995, an out of court settlement was reached and Apple's office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that &quot;Apple has always had great respect for Dr. Sagan.  It was never Apple's intention to cause Dr. Sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, pp. 374–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan briefly served as an adviser on [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name=Keay&gt;{{Cite book

== Sagan and UFOs ==
Sagan had some interest in [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] reports from at least 1964 when he had several conversations on the subject with [[Jacques Vallee]].&lt;ref name=westrum&gt;{{Cite book | last=Westrum | first=Ron | coauthors=Jacobs, David Michael (ed.) | chapter=Limited Access: Six Natural Scientists and the UFO Phenomenon | pages=30–55 | title=UFOs and abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge | location=Lawrence, Kansas | publisher=University Press of Kansas | year=2000 | isbn=0-700-61032-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the UFO question, Sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon, at least because there was widespread public interest in UFO reports.

[[Stuart Appelle]] notes that Sagan &quot;wrote frequently on what he perceived as the [[logic]]al and [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fallacy|fallacies]] regarding UFOs and the [[abduction phenomenon|abduction experience]]. Sagan rejected an [[extraterrestrial hypothesis|extraterrestrial explanation]] for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] benefits for examining UFO reports and that the subject was, therefore, a legitimate topic of study.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Appelle | first=Stuart | coauthors=Jacobs, David Michael (ed.) | chapter=Ufology and Academia: The UFO Phenomenon as a Scholarly Discipline | pages=7–30 | title=UFOs and abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge | location=Lawrence, Kansas | publisher=University Press of Kansas | year=2000 | isbn=0-700-61032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Sagan was a member of the Ad Hoc Committee to Review [[Project Blue Book]], the U.S. Air Force's UFO investigation project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the [[Condon Committee]] (1966–1968), led by physicist [[Edward Condon]], and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.

[[Ron Westrum]] writes that &quot;The high point of Sagan's treatment of the UFO question was the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS's]] symposium in 1969. A wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants, including not only proponents such as [[James E. McDonald|James McDonald]] and [[J. Allen Hynek]] but also skeptics like astronomers [[William Kenneth Hartmann|William Hartmann]] and [[Donald Menzel]]. The roster of speakers was balanced, and it is to Sagan's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from [[Edward Condon]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=westrum/&gt; With physicist [[Thornton Page]], Sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium; these were published in 1972 as ''UFOs: A Scientific Debate''. Some of Sagan's many books examine UFOs (as did one episode of ''Cosmos'') and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon.

Sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his 1980 ''Cosmos'' series. In one of his last written works, Sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small. However, Sagan did think it plausible that [[Cold War]] concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about UFOs, and that &quot;some UFO reports and analyses, and perhaps voluminous files, have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills ... It's time for the files to be declassified and made generally available.&quot; He cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed UFO data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the Earth either in the past or present.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, 1996: 81–96, 99–104&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
[[File:Carl-sagan-brooklyn.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Stone dedicated to Carl Sagan in the Celebrity Path of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden]]
After a long and difficult fight with [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]], which included three [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplants]], Sagan died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 62 at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], on December 20, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/20/sagan/ |publisher=CNN | title=Carl Sagan dies at 62 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in [[Ithaca, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|1347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Posthumous recognition ==
The 1997 movie ''[[Contact (film)|Contact]]'', based on Sagan's [[Contact (novel)|novel of the same name]] and finished after his death, ends with the dedication &quot;For Carl&quot;.

In 1997, the Sagan Planet Walk was opened in Ithaca New York. It is a walking scale model of the solar system, extending 1.2&amp;nbsp;km from the center of The Commons in downtown Ithaca, NY, to the Sciencenter, a hands-on museum. The exhibition was created in memory of Carl Sagan, who was an Ithaca resident and Cornell Professor. Professor Sagan had been a founding member of the museum's advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/&lt;/ref&gt;

The landing site of the unmanned [[Mars Pathfinder]] spacecraft was renamed the ''[[Mars Pathfinder#End of mission|Carl Sagan Memorial Station]]'' on July 5, 1997.

Sagan's son, [[Nick Sagan]], wrote several episodes in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. In an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' entitled &quot;[[Terra Prime]]&quot;, a quick shot is shown of the relic rover [[Mars Pathfinder|Sojourner]], part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, placed by a historical marker at [[Mars Pathfinder|Carl Sagan Memorial Station]] on the Martian surface. The marker displays a quote from Sagan: &quot;Whatever the reason you're on Mars, I'm glad you're there, and I wish I was with you.&quot; Sagan's student [[Steve Squyres]] led the team that landed the [[Spirit Rover]] and [[Opportunity Rover]] successfully on Mars in 2004.

Asteroid [[2709 Sagan]] is also named in his honor.

Ann Druyan was at the Center as it opened its doors on October 22, 2006.

Sagan has at least three awards named in his honor:
* The [[Carl Sagan Memorial Award]] presented jointly since 1997 by the [[American Astronomical Society|American Astronomical Society (AAS)]] and the [[Planetary Society]],
* The [[Carl Sagan Medal]] for Excellence in Public Communication in Planetary Science presented since 1998 by the American Astronomical Society's [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] (AAS/DPS) for outstanding communication by an active planetary scientist to the general public&amp;nbsp;— Carl Sagan was one of the original organizing committee members of the DPS, and
* The [[Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science]] presented by the [[Council of Scientific Society Presidents]] (CSSP)&amp;nbsp;— Sagan himself was the first recipient of the CSSP award in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cssp.us/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=47 | title=Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science | publisher=The Council of Scientific Society Presidents | accessdate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, the Carl Sagan Medal was awarded to astrobiologist and author [[David Grinspoon]], the son of Sagan's friend [[Lester Grinspoon]].

On December 20, 2006, the tenth anniversary of Sagan's death, a blogger, Joel Schlosberg, organized a Carl Sagan &quot;blog-a-thon&quot; to commemorate Sagan's death, and the idea was supported by Nick Sagan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joelschlosberg.blogspot.com/2006/11/announcing-carl-sagan-memorial-blog.html Joel's humanistic blog: Announcing the Carl Sagan memorial blog-a-thon]&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the blogging community participated.

August 2007 the Independent Investigative Group [[IIG]] awarded Sagan posthumously a Lifetime Achievement Award. This honor has also been awarded to [[Harry Houdini]] and [[James Randi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iigwest.com/iigawards/2006/index.html |title=IIG &amp;#124; The IIG Awards |publisher=Iigwest.com |date=August 21, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Benn Jordan]], also known as &quot;The Flashbulb&quot;, released the album ''[[Pale Blue Dot (album)|Pale Blue Dot: A Tribute to Carl Sagan]]''.

In 2009, clips from Carl Sagan's ''Cosmos'' were used as the basis for ''A Glorious Dawn'', the first video produced for the [[Symphony of Science]], an educational music video production by composer John Boswell. Musician [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] later released this song as a vinyl single under his record label [[Third Man Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/reliable-source/2009/11/jack_white_carl_sagans_biggest.html | title=Jack White: Carl Sagan's Biggest Fan |work=The Washington Post | accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional clips were used in several followup videos which featured Sagan alongside other noted scientists and proponents of rational thinking, such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Brian Greene]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], [[Bill Nye]], and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]]. Sagan is the only scientist featured in every Symphony of Science video.

In 2010, the 76th anniversary of Carl Sagan's birth, the second &quot;Carl Sagan Day&quot; was celebrated on November 6.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carlsaganday.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cuban Missile Crisis''' (known as ''The October Crisis'' in [[Cuba]] or {{lang-ru|Карибский кризис}} ''Caribbean Crisis'' in Russia) was a confrontation among the [[Soviet Union]], Cuba and the [[United States]] in October 1962, during the [[Cold War]]. In September 1962, after some unsuccessful operations by the U.S. to overthrow the Cuban regime ([[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]], [[Operation Mongoose]]), the Cuban and Soviet governments began to surreptitiously build bases in Cuba for a number of [[medium-range ballistic missile|medium-range]] and [[intermediate-range ballistic missile|intermediate-range ballistic]] nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) with the ability to strike most of the continental United States. This action followed the 1958 deployment of [[Thor IRBM]]s in the UK ([[Project Emily]]) and [[Jupiter IRBM]]s to [[PGM-19 Jupiter#Military deployment|Italy and Turkey in 1961]] – more than 100 U.S.-built missiles having the capability to strike [[Moscow]] with nuclear warheads. On October 14, 1962, a United States Air Force [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] plane on a [[photoreconnaissance]] mission captured photographic proof of Soviet missile bases under construction in Cuba.

The ensuing crisis ranks with the [[Berlin Blockade]] as one of the major confrontations of the Cold War and is generally regarded as the moment in which the Cold War came closest to turning into a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=B. Gregory |last=Marfleet|title=The Operational Code of John F.

The United States considered attacking Cuba via air and sea, and settled on a military &quot;quarantine&quot; of Cuba. The U.S. announced that it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the Soviets dismantle the missile bases already under construction or completed in Cuba and remove all offensive weapons. The [[Kennedy administration]] held a slim hope that the Kremlin would agree to their demands, and expected a military confrontation. On the Soviet end, Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] wrote in a letter to Kennedy that his quarantine of &quot;navigation in international waters and air space&quot; constituted &quot;an act of aggression propelling humankind into the abyss of a world nuclear-missile war.&quot;

The Soviets publicly balked at the U.S. demands, but in secret back-channel communications initiated a proposal to resolve the crisis. The confrontation ended on October 28, 1962, when President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] reached a public and secret agreement with Khrushchev. Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a U.S. public declaration and agreement to never invade Cuba. Secretly, the U.S. agreed that it would dismantle all U.S.-built Thor and Jupiter IRBMs deployed in Europe and Turkey. 

Only two weeks after the agreement, the Soviets had removed the missile systems and their support equipment, loading them onto eight Soviet ships from November 5–9. A month later, on December 5 and 6, the Soviet [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] bombers were loaded onto three Soviet ships and shipped back to Russia. The quarantine was formally ended at 6:45&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] on November 20, 1962. Eleven months after the agreement, all American weapons were [[PGM-17 Thor#Deployment|deactivated (by September 1963)]]. An additional outcome of the negotiations was the creation of the Hotline Agreement and the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]], a direct communications link between Moscow and [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Earlier actions by the United States==
The Americans feared the Soviet expansion of [[Communism]], but for a [[Latin America]]n country to ally openly with the USSR was regarded as unacceptable, given the Soviet-American enmity since the end of [[World War II]] in 1945. Such an involvement would also directly defy the [[Monroe Doctrine]]; a United States policy which, while limiting the United States' involvement with European colonies and European affairs, held that European powers ought not have involvement with states in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

The United States had been embarrassed publicly by the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961, which had been launched under President [[John F. Kennedy]] by [[CIA]]-trained forces of [[Cuban exile]]s. Afterward, former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] told Kennedy that &quot;the failure of the Bay of Pigs will embolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.&quot;&lt;ref name=Absher&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mind-Sets and Missiles: A First Hand Account of the Cuban Missile Crisis |first=Kenneth Michael |last=Absher |publisher=Strategic Studies Institute, United States Army War College |year=2009 |url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=935}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} The half-hearted invasion left Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his advisers with the impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet adviser wrote, &quot;too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations ... too intelligent and too weak.&quot;&lt;ref name=Absher /&gt; U.S. covert operations continued in 1961 with the unsuccessful [[Operation Mongoose]].&lt;ref name=&quot;franklin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Cuba and the United States: A Chronological History |first = Jane |last = Franklin |url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/missile.htm |year=1997 |publisher=Ocean Press |location=Melbourne|isbn=1875284923}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 1962, General [[Edward Lansdale]] described plans to overthrow the Cuban Government in a top-secret report (partially declassified 1989), addressed to President Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.&lt;ref name=&quot;franklin&quot;/&gt; CIA agents or &quot;pathfinders&quot; from the [[Special Activities Division]] were to be infiltrated into [[Cuba]] to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shadow Warrior: The CIA Hero of 100 Unknown Battles|last=Rodriguez |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |date=October 1989 |isbn=978-0-671-66721-4 |others= John Weisman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1962, the United States launched an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=58824 |title = Proclamation 3447—Embargo on all trade with Cuba |author=[[John F. Kennedy]] |work= The American Presidency Project |location=Santa Barbara, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban Government, mandating that guerrilla operations begin in August and September, and in the first two weeks of October: &quot;Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;franklin&quot;/&gt;

As early as August 1962, the United States suspected the Soviets of building missile facilities in Cuba. During that month, its intelligence services gathered information about sightings by ground observers of Russian-built [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters and [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] light bombers. U-2 spyplanes found [[S-75 Dvina]] (NATO designation ''SA-2'') surface-to-air missile sites at eight different locations. CIA director [[John A. McCone]] was suspicious. On August 10, he wrote a memo to President Kennedy in which he guessed that the Soviets were preparing to introduce ballistic missiles into Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;afmag&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2005/August%202005/0805u2.aspx|title=Airpower and the Cuban Missile Crisis |last=Correll |first=John T. |date=August 2005|volume=88|issue=8 |journal=AirForce-Magazine.com|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, Senator [[Kenneth Keating]] (R-New York), who probably received his information from Cuban exiles in Florida,&lt;ref name=&quot;afmag&quot;/&gt; warned on the Senate floor that the Soviet Union may be constructing a missile base in Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;franklin&quot;/&gt;

Air Force General [[Curtis LeMay]] presented a pre-invasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, while spy flights and minor military harassment from U.S. forces at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] were the subject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=&quot;franklin&quot;/&gt;

==Balance of power==
When Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged &quot;[[missile gap]]&quot; with the Russians leading. In fact, the United States led the Soviets. In 1961, the Soviets had only four intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). By October 1962, they may have had a few dozen, although some intelligence estimates were as high as 75.&lt;ref name=&quot;afmag&quot;/&gt; The United States, on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more. It also had eight [[George Washington class submarine|George Washington]] and [[Ethan Allen class submarine|Ethan Allen]] class [[ballistic missile submarine]]s with the ability to launch 16 [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] missiles each with a range of {{convert|2200|km}}. Khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted that the USSR was building missiles &quot;like sausages&quot; whose numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to reality. However, the Soviets did have medium-range ballistic missiles in quantity, about 700 of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;afmag&quot;/&gt; In his memoirs published in 1970, Khrushchev wrote, “In addition to protecting Cuba, our missiles would have equalized what the West likes to call ‘the balance of power.’”&lt;ref name=&quot;afmag&quot;/&gt;

==Eastern Bloc strategy==
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev conceived in May 1962 the idea of countering the United States' growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing its own intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba. Khrushchev was also reacting in part to the United States' placement of [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] intermediate-range ballistic missiles the United States had installed during April 1962 in Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;afmag&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Jupiter IRBM.jpg|thumb|The [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] intermediate-range ballistic missile. The U.S. secretly agreed to withdraw these missiles from Italy and Turkey.]]
From the very beginning, the Soviet's operation entailed elaborate denial and deception, known in Russia as ''Maskirovka''.&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt; All of the planning and preparation for transporting and deploying the missiles were carried out in the utmost secrecy, with only a very few told the exact nature of the mission. Even the troops detailed for the mission were given misdirection, told they were headed for a cold region and outfitted with ski boots, fleece-lined parkas, and other winter equipment.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol46no1/pdf/v46i1a06p.pdf|title=Soviet Deception in the Cuban Missile Crisis|last=Hansen|first=James H.|work=Learning from the Past|accessdate=May 2, 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5slHYhnEk |archivedate = September 15, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet code name, [[Operation Anadyr]], was also the name of a [[Anadyr River|river]] flowing into the [[Bering Sea]], the name of the [[Anadyr (town)|capital]] of [[Chukotsky District]], and a bomber base in the far eastern region. All these were meant to conceal the program from both internal and external audiences.&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt;

In early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]]. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the U.S. would invade Cuba again and they enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. Specialists in missile construction under the guise of &quot;machine operators,&quot; &quot;irrigation specialists,&quot; and &quot;agricultural specialists&quot; arrived in July.&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt; Marshal Sergei Biryuzov, chief of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by the palm trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;afmag&quot;/&gt;

The Cuban leadership was further upset when in September Congress approved U.S. Joint Resolution 230, which authorized the use of military force in Cuba if American interests were threatened.&lt;ref name=blight/&gt; On the same day, the U.S. announced a major military exercise in the Caribbean, [[Operation Ortsac|PHIBRIGLEX-62]], which Cuba denounced as a deliberate provocation and proof that the U.S. planned to invade Cuba.&lt;ref name=blight/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thedays&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/10826/cuba.htm |title=The Days the World Held Its Breath |accessdate=4-3-2010 |publisher= |date=July 31, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a U.S. invasion of Cuba was imminent, and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communist cause, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans &quot;with more than words...the logical answer was missiles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weldes |first=Jutta |title=Constructing National Interests: The United States and the Cuban Missile Crisis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1999|isbn=978-0-8166-3111-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by [[Rodion Malinovsky]] on July 4 and Khrushchev on July 7.

The Soviet leadership believed, based on their perception of Kennedy's lack of confidence during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, that he would avoid confrontation and accept the missiles as a ''fait accompli''.&lt;ref name=Absher/&gt;{{rp|1}} On September 11, the Soviet Union publicly warned that a U.S. attack on Cuba or on Soviet ships carrying supplies to the island would mean war.&lt;ref name=franklin /&gt; The Soviets continued their ''Maskirovka'' program to conceal their actions in Cuba. They repeatedly denied that the weapons being brought into Cuba were offensive in nature. On September 7, Soviet Ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] assured U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations [[Adlai Stevenson]] that the USSR was supplying only defensive weapons to Cuba. On September 11, the Soviet News Agency TASS announced that the Soviet Union has no need or intention to introduce offensive nuclear missiles into Cuba. On October 13, Dobrynin was questioned by former Undersecretary of State [[Chester Bowles]] about whether the Soviets plan to put offensive weapons in Cuba. He denied any such plans.&lt;ref name=blight&gt;{{cite book|last=Blight|first=James G.|coauthors=Bruce J. Allyn and David A. Welch|title=Cuba on the Brink|publisher=Rowmand and Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland| year=2002| edition=paperback| isbn=978-0-7425-2269-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; And again on October 17, Soviet embassy official Georgy Bolshakov brought President Kennedy a &quot;personal message&quot; from Khrushchev reassuring him that &quot;under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba.&lt;ref name=blight/&gt;{{rp|494}}

The first consignment of [[R-12 (missile)|R-12]] missiles arrived on the night of September 8, followed by a second on September 16. The R-12 was the first operational intermediate-range ballistic missile, the first missile ever mass-produced, and the first Soviet missile deployed with a [[thermonuclear]] warhead. It  was a single-stage, road-transportable, surface-launched, storable propellant fueled missile that could deliver a [[megaton|megaton-class]] nuclear weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/r-12-specs.htm|title=R-12 / SS-4 SANDAL|publisher=Global Security|accessdate=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviets were building nine sites—six for [[R-12 (missile)|R-12]] medium-range missiles (NATO designation ''SS-4 Sandal'') with an effective range of {{convert|2000|km}} and three for [[R-14 (missile)|R-14]] intermediate-range ballistic missiles (NATO designation ''SS-5 Skean'') with a maximum range of {{convert|4500|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/r-14-specs.htm|title=R-14 / SS-5 SKEAN |publisher=Global Security|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba positioning===
On October 7, Cuban President [[Osvaldo Dorticós]] spoke at the [[UN General Assembly]]: &quot;If ... we are attacked, we will defend ourselves. I repeat, we have sufficient means with which to defend ourselves; we have indeed our inevitable weapons, the weapons, which we would have preferred not to acquire, and which we do not wish to employ.&quot;

== Missiles reported==

These missiles allowed the Soviets to effectively target almost the entire continental United States. The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached [[Miami]]. U.S. intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, and most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles. Only five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing through towns at night carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. Defensive missiles could make these turns. These reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed.&lt;ref name=GWUgraybeal&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-21/graybeal3.html  | publisher = [[George Washington University]], National Security Archive |work=Cold War Interviews | title = Interview with Sidney Graybeal - 29.1.98 | work=Episode 21 |date=March 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U-2 flights find missiles===
Despite the increasing evidence of a military build-up on Cuba, no U-2 flights were made over Cuba from September 5 to October 14. The first problem that caused the pause in reconnaissance flights took place on August 30, an Air Force [[Strategic Air Command]] U-2 flew over [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] in the Far East by mistake. The Soviets lodged a protest and the U.S. apologized. Nine days later, a Taiwanese-owned U-2 was lost over western China, probably to a [[surface-to-air missile|SAM]]. U.S. officials worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in Cuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident. At the end of September, Navy reconnaissance aircraft photographed the Soviet ship ''Kasimov'' with large crates on its deck the size and shape of [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28 light bombers]].&lt;ref name=afmag/&gt;

On October 12,the administration decided to transfer the Cuban U-2 reconnaissance missions to the Air Force. In the event another U-2 was shot down, they thought a cover story involving Air Force flights would be easier to explain than CIA flights. There was also some evidence that the Department of Defense and the Air Force lobbied to get responsibility for the Cuban flights.&lt;ref name=afmag/&gt; When the reconnaissance missions were re-authorized on October 8, weather kept the planes from flying. The U.S. first obtained photographic evidence of the missiles on October 14 when a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] flight piloted by Major Richard Heyser took 928 pictures, capturing images of what turned out to be an SS-4 construction site at [[San Cristóbal, Cuba|San Cristóbal]], [[Pinar del Río Province]], in western Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://future.state.gov/educators/slideshow/cuba/cuba2.html| title=Cuban Missile Crisis |publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== President notified ===

On October 15, the CIA's National Photographic Intelligence Center reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles. That evening, the CIA notified the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] and at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]] [[McGeorge Bundy]] elected to wait until morning to tell the President. [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] was briefed at midnight. The next morning, Bundy met with Kennedy and showed him the U-2 photographs and briefed him on the CIA's analysis of the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/colc.html |title=Revelations from the Russian Archives | publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm EDT Kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and five other key advisers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/jfkl/cmc/cmc_misc_transcripts.html |title=Cuban Missile Crisis: Miscellaneous Transcripts |accessdate=201-5-4|publisher-John F. Kennedy Museum and Presidential Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a group he formally named the [[EXCOMM|Executive Committee of the National Security Council]] after the fact on October 22 by National Security Action Memorandum 196.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/jfkl/cmc/cmc_misc_transcripts.html |title=National Security Action Memorandum 196 |accessdate=May 2, 2010|publisher=JFK Presidential Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses considered===

The U.S. had no plan in place because U.S. intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba. The EXCOMM quickly discussed several possible courses of action, including:&lt;ref name=&quot;thedays&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Allison | first = Graham T.| authorlink = Graham T. Allison |coauthor=Zelikow, Philip D.| title = [[Essence of Decision|Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis]] | publisher = Addison Wesley Longman |location=New York| pages = 111–116 | isbn = 978-0-321-01349-1 | year = 1999|edition=2nd|origyear=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

# No action.
# Diplomacy: Use diplomatic pressure to get the Soviet Union to remove the missiles.
# Warning: Send a message to Castro to warn him of the grave danger he, and Cuba were in.
# Blockade: Use the U.S. Navy to block any missiles from arriving in Cuba.
# Air strike: Use the U.S. Air Force to attack all known missile sites.
# Invasion: Full force invasion of Cuba and overthrow of Castro.

The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and invasion was the only solution. They believed that the Soviets would not attempt to stop the U.S. from conquering Cuba. Kennedy was skeptical.

Kennedy concluded that attacking Cuba by air would signal the Soviets to presume &quot;a clear line&quot; to conquer Berlin.

[[File:McNamara and Kennedy.jpg|left|thumb|President Kennedy and Secretary of Defense McNamara in an EXCOMM meeting.]]

The EXCOMM then discussed the effect on the strategic balance of power, both political and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the missiles would seriously alter the military balance, but Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] disagreed. He was convinced that the missiles would not affect the strategic balance at all. An extra forty, he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic balance. The U.S. already had approximately 5,000 strategic warheads,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert Evan |last=Ornstein |title=New world new mind: moving toward conscious evolution|publisher=The University of Michigan, Doubleday |year=1989|unused_data=others}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|261}} while the Soviet Union had only 300. He concluded that the Soviets having 340 would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. In 1990, he reiterated that &quot;it made ''no'' difference...The military balance wasn't changed.

The EXCOMM agreed that the missiles would affect the ''political'' balance. First, Kennedy had explicitly promised the American people less than a month before the crisis that &quot;if Cuba should possess a capacity to carry out offensive actions against the United States...the United States would act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: title=In Public Papers of the Presidents: John F Kennedy, 1962|last=Kennedy |first=J. |title=The President's News Conference of September&amp;nbsp;13, 1962 |location=Washington, DC |publisher= Government Printing Office |year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|674-681}} Second, U.S. credibility amongst their allies, and amongst the American people, would be damaged if they allowed the Soviet Union to ''appear'' to redress the strategic balance by placing missiles in Cuba.

On October 18, President Kennedy met with Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Andrei Gromyko]], who claimed the weapons were for defensive purposes only. Not wanting to expose what he already knew, and wanting to avoid panicking the American public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1736.html|title=Cuban  Missile Crisis|publisher=Online Highways LLC|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the President did not reveal that he was already aware of the missile build-up.&lt;ref name=historyplace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/jfk-cuban.htm|title=JFK on the Cuban Missile Crisis|publisher=The History Place|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 19, frequent U-2 spy flights showed four operational sites. As part of the blockade, the U.S. military was put on high alert to enforce the blockade and to be ready to invade Cuba at a moment's notice. The [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was sent to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and five army [[Division (military)|divisions]] were alerted for maximal action. The [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) distributed its shorter-ranged [[B-47 Stratojet]] [[medium bomber]]s to civilian airports and sent aloft its [[B-52 Stratofortress]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=global/&gt;

==Operational Plans==

Two Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units supported by the Navy following Air Force and naval airstrikes. However, Army units in the United States would have had trouble fielding mechanized and logistical assets, while the U.S. Navy could not supply sufficient amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armored contingent from the Army. OPLAN 312, primarily an Air Force and Navy carrier operation, was designed with enough flexibility to do anything from engaging individual missile sites to providing air support for OPLAN 316's ground forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamps, Charles Tustin 2007, page 88&quot;&gt;Kamps, Charles Tustin, &quot;''The Cuban Missile Crisis''&quot;, Air &amp; Space Power Journal, AU Press, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, Fall 2007, Volume XXI, Number 3, page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout October 21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases, or a naval blockade of Cuba.&lt;ref name=historyplace/&gt; A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option, but something had to be done. Robert McNamara supported the naval [[blockade]] as a strong but limited military action that left the U.S. in control. According to [[international law]] a blockade is an [[Casus belli|act of war]], but the Kennedy administration did not think that the USSR would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Naval Quarantine of Cuba, 1962|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq90-5.htm|work=Report on the Naval Quarantine of Cuba, Operational Archives Branch, Post 46 Command File, Box 10, Washington, DC|publisher=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Admiral]] [[George Whelan Anderson, Jr.|Anderson]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]] wrote a position paper that helped Kennedy to differentiate between a quarantine of offensive weapons and a blockade of all materials, indicating that a classic blockade was not the original intention. Since it would take place in international waters, Kennedy obtained the approval of the OAS for military action under the hemispheric defense provisions of the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance|Rio Treaty]].

{{Block quote|Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the U.S. Commander South Atlantic [COMSOLANT] at Trinidad on November 9. An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required. In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers and one submarine had reported to COMSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the quarantine. The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship. Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the U.S. to discuss this assistance. The Argentine Air Force informally offered three [[Grumman SA-16|SA-16]] aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the quarantine operation.&lt;ref name=NHC-Intro&gt;{{cite web |first = George Whelan Jr |last = Anderson |title= The Naval Quarantine of Cuba, 1962: Abeyance and Negociation,  31&amp;nbsp;October-13&amp;nbsp;November |authorlink = George Whelan Anderson, Jr. |work = Report on the Naval Quarantine of Cuba, Operational Archives Branch, Post 46 Command File, Box 10, Washington, DC |publisher = Naval History &amp; Heritage Command |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq90-5c.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Block quote|This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the [[Organization of American States]] and the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance|Rio Treaty]].

The CNO's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the quarantine.}}

On October 19, the EXCOMM formed separate working groups to examine the air strike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the EXCOMM shifted to the blockade option.

At 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT on October 22, President Kennedy formally established the Executive Committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 196. At 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm, he met with Congressional leaders who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response. In Moscow, Ambassador [[Foy D. Kohler|Kohler]] briefed Chairman Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation. Ambassadors around the world gave advance notice to non-[[Eastern Bloc]] leaders. Before the speech, U.S. delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]], British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]], West German [[Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]], and French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] to brief them on the U.S. intelligence and their proposed response. All were supportive of the U.S. position.&lt;ref name=&quot;brink&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cubacrisis.net/angl/pages/aubordset_02.html |title=Brinkmanship |work=The Cuban Missile Crisis exhibition |publisher=The Caen Mémorial | last=Buffet |first=Cyril |coauthors=Touze, Vincent |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22 at 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, President Kennedy delivered a nation-wide televised address on all of the major networks announcing the discovery of the missiles.

{{Block quote|It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;}}

Kennedy described the administration's plan:

{{Block quote|To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1962/Cuban-Missile-Crisis/12295509437657-6/ |title=1962 Year In Review: Cuban Missile Crisis |year=1962|publisher= United Press International, Inc.|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the speech a directive went out to all U.S. forces worldwide placing them on [[DEFCON]] 3.

=== Crisis deepens ===
[[File:Khrushchev letter to kennedy.gif|thumb|left|Khrushchev's October 24, 1962 letter to President Kennedy stating that the Cuban Missile Crisis quarantine &quot;constitute[s] an act of aggression...&quot;]]
On October 23 at 11:24&amp;nbsp;am EDT a cable drafted by [[George Wildman Ball|George Ball]] to the U.S. Ambassador in Turkey and the U.S. Ambassador to [[NATO]] notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw what the U.S knew to be nearly obsolete missiles from Italy and Turkey in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba. Turkish officials replied that they would &quot;deeply resent&quot; any trade for the U.S. missile's presence in their country.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrono26oct15nov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/621026_621115%20Chronology%201.pdf|title=Chronology 1: October 26, 1962 to November 15, 1962 |work=The Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962 |publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on the morning of October 25, journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] proposed the same thing in his syndicated column. Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba will not allow an inspection.&lt;ref name=franklin/&gt;

===International response===

Kennedy's speech was not well liked in Britain. The day after the speech, the British press, recalling previous CIA missteps, was unconvinced about the existence of Soviet bases in Cuba, and guessed that Kennedy's actions might be related to his re-election.&lt;ref name=cubacrisis/&gt;

Three days after Kennedy's speech, the Chinese ''[[People's Daily]]'' announced that &quot;650,000,000 Chinese men and women were standing by the Cuban people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;brink&quot;/&gt;  Chi Ming also expressed solidarity with the Cuban government.

In Germany, newspapers supported the United States' response, contrasting it with the weak-kneed American actions in the region during the preceding months. They also expressed some fear that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;cubacrisis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubacrisis.net/angl/pages/aubord_rfa11.html | title=Germany, between Cuba and Berlin |work=The Cuban Missile Crisis exhibition |publisher=The Caen Mémorial | last=Buffet |first=Cyril |coauthors=Touze, Vincent |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France on October 23, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers. The next day, an editorial in ''[[Le Monde]]'' expressed doubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence. Two days later, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, they accepted the validity of the photographs. Also in France, in the October 29 issue of ''[[Le Figaro]]'', Raymond Aron wrote in support of the American response.&lt;ref name=&quot;cubacrisis&quot;/&gt;

===Soviet broadcast===
At the time, the crisis continued unabated, and on the evening of October 24, the Soviet news agency [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|Telegrafnoe Agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza]] (TASS) broadcast a telegram from Khrushchev to President Kennedy, in which Khrushchev warned that the United States' &quot;pirate action&quot; would lead to war. However, this was followed at 9:24&amp;nbsp;pm by a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy which was received at 10:52&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, in which Khrushchev stated, &quot;If you coolly weigh the situation which has developed, not giving way to passions, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot fail to reject the arbitrary demands of the United States,&quot; and that the Soviet Union views the blockade as &quot;an act of aggression&quot; and their ships will be instructed to ignore it.

===U.S. alert level raised===
[[File:Adlai Stevenson shows missiles to UN Security Council with David Parker standing.jpg|thumb|[[Adlai Stevenson]] shows aerial photos of Cuban missiles to the United Nations. (October 25, 1962)]]

The United States requested an emergency meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on October 25. In a loud, demanding tone, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador [[Valerian Zorin]] in an emergency meeting of the SC challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles. Ambassador Zorin refused to answer. The next day at 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, the U.S. raised the readiness level of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] forces to DEFCON 2. For the only confirmed time in U.S. history, the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers were dispersed to various locations and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15&amp;nbsp;minutes notice.&lt;ref name=hpol&gt;{{cite web|editor1-last=Goldman|editor1-first=Jerry|title=The Cuban Missile Crisis, October 18-29, 1962 |url=http://www.hpol.org/jfk/cuban/ |work=History and Politics Out Loud |publisher=[[Northwestern University]]|date=8 October 1997 |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, while [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours with one-third maintaining 15-minute alert status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamps, Charles Tustin 2007, page 88&quot;/&gt;

&quot;By October 22, [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) had 511 fighters plus supporting tankers and reconnaissance aircraft deployed to face Cuba on one-hour alert status. However, TAC and the Military Air Transport Service had problems. The concentration of aircraft in Florida strained command and support echelons; we faced critical undermanning in security, armaments, and communications; the absence of initial authorization for war-reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced TAC to scrounge; and the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne drop necessitated the call-up of 24 Reserve squadrons.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamps, Charles Tustin 2007, page 88&quot;/&gt;

On October 25 at 1:45&amp;nbsp;am EDT, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram, stating that the U.S. was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances that no offensive missiles were being placed in Cuba, and that when these assurances proved to be false, the deployment &quot;required the responses I have announced... I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit a restoration of the earlier situation.&quot;
[[File:Location of Navy and Soviet ships during the Cuban Missile Crisis.jpg|thumb|A recently declassified map used by the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet showing the position of American and Soviet ships at the height of the crisis.]]

===Quarantine challenged===

At 7:15&amp;nbsp;am EDT on October 25, the [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS ''Essex'']] and [[USS Gearing (DD-710)|USS ''Gearing'']] attempted to intercept the ''Bucharest'' but failed to do so. Fairly certain the tanker did not contain any military material, they allowed it through the blockade. Later that day, at 5:43&amp;nbsp;pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the [[USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. (DD-850)|USS ''Kennedy'']] to intercept and board the Lebanese freighter ''Marucla''. This took place the next day, and the ''Marucla'' was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.battleshipcove.org/news-boarding-marucla.htm|title=Boarding MARUCLA: A personal account from the Executive Officer of USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|last=Reynolds|first=K.C.|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT on October 25, William Clements announced that the missiles in Cuba were still actively being worked on. This report was later verified by a CIA report that suggested there had been no slow-down at all. In response, Kennedy issued Security Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of [[SACEUR]] (which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet Union). During the day, the Soviets responded to the quarantine by turning back 14 ships presumably carrying offensive weapons.&lt;ref name=hpol/&gt;

===Crisis stalemated===

The next morning, October 26, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. However, he was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure. He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead.

At this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The USSR had shown no indication that they would back down and had made several comments to the contrary. The U.S. had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union in case it responded militarily, which was assumed.&lt;ref name = GWUCubaAG&gt;{{cite web

== Secret negotiations==
At 1:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT on October 26, [[John A. Scali]] of [[ABC News]] had lunch with [[Alexander Feklisov|Aleksandr Fomin]] at Fomin's request. Fomin noted, &quot;War seems about to break out,&quot; and asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to his &quot;high-level friends&quot; at the State Department to see if the U.S. would be interested in a diplomatic solution. He suggested that the language of the deal would contain an assurance from the Soviet Union to remove the weapons under UN supervision and that Castro would publicly announce that he would not accept such weapons in the future, in exchange for a public statement by the U.S. that it would never invade Cuba.&lt;ref name=chrono28sep26oct&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology 1: September 28, 1962 to October 26, 1962|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/620928_621025%20Chronology%201.pdf|work=The Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. responded by asking the [[Brazil]]ian government to pass a message to Castro that the U.S. would be &quot;unlikely to invade&quot; if the missiles were removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrono26oct15nov&quot;/&gt;

On October 26 at 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, the State Department started receiving a message that appeared to be written personally by Khrushchev. It was Saturday at 2:00&amp;nbsp;am in Moscow. The long letter took several minutes to arrive, and it took translators additional time to translate and transcribe the long letter.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrono26oct15nov&quot;/&gt;

Robert Kennedy described the letter as &quot;very long and emotional.&quot; Khrushchev reiterated the basic outline that had been stated to John Scali earlier in the day, &quot;I propose: we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any armaments. You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in Cuba will disappear.&quot; At 6:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a &quot;set up&quot; for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate, although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrono26oct15nov&quot;/&gt;

Castro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion was soon at hand, and he dictated a letter to [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] that appeared to call for a preemptive strike on the U.S. However, in a 2010 interview, Castro said of his recommendation for the Soviets to bomb America &quot;After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing what I know now, it wasn't worth it at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11226158 |first= Jeffrey |last=Goldberg |publisher=BBC |date=September 8, 2010 | title=Cuban model no longer works, says Fidel Castro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any U.S. aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/cuba/subject/missile-crisis/ch03.htm|title=Cuban History Missile Crisis|last=Baggins|first=Brian |work=Marxist History: Cuba (1959 - present)|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the past they had been ordered only to fire on groups of two or more.

At 9:00&amp;nbsp;am EDT on October 27, [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] began broadcasting a message from Khrushchev. Contrary to the letter of the night before, the message offered a new trade, that the missiles on Cuba would be removed in exchange for the removal of the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] missiles from Italy and Turkey. At 10:00&amp;nbsp;am EDT, the executive committee met again to discuss the situation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was due to internal debate between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=For the President's Eyes Only: Secret Intelligence and the American Presidency from Washington to Bush |last=Christopher |first= Andrew |page=688 |isbn=978-0-06-092178-1|publisher=Harper Perennial |date=March 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|300}} McNamara noted that another tanker, the ''Grozny'', was about {{convert|600|mi|km|-1}} out and should be intercepted.

While the meeting progressed, at 11:03&amp;nbsp;am EDT a new message began to arrive from Khrushchev. The message stated, in part,

{{Block quote|You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety-nine miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But... you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us... I therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive... Your representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the United States ... will remove its analogous means from Turkey ... and after that, persons entrusted by the United Nations Security Council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of the pledges made.}}

The executive committee continued to meet through the day.

Throughout the crisis, Turkey had repeatedly stated that it would be upset if the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] missiles were removed. Italy's Prime Minister [[Amintore Fanfani|Fanfani]], who was also Foreign Minister ''ad interim'', offered to allow withdrawal of the missiles deployed in [[Apulia]] as a bargaining chip. He gave the message to one of his most trusted friends, [[Ettore Bernabei]], the general manager of [[RAI|RAI-TV]], to convery to [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]]. Bernabei was in New York to attend an international conference on satellite TV broadcasting. Unknown to the Soviets, the U.S regarded the Jupiter missiles as obsolete and already supplanted by the Polaris nuclear ballistic submarine missiles.&lt;ref name=afmag/&gt;

On the morning of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, modified for air-to-air refueling) piloted by USAF [[Major]] [[Rudolf Anderson]],&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, Chris, &quot;50 Years of the U-2: The Complete Illustrated History of the 'Dragon Lady' &quot;, Schiffer Publishing, Ltd., Atglen, Pennsylvania, Library of Congress card number 2005927577, ISBN 978-0-7643-2346-1, page 406.&lt;/ref&gt; departed its forward operating location at [[McCoy AFB]], Florida, and at approximately 12:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, the aircraft was struck by a [[S-75 Dvina]] ([[NATO]] designation ''[[SA-2 Guideline]]'') [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] missile launched from Cuba. The aircraft was shot down and Anderson was killed. The stress in negotiations between the USSR and the U.S. intensified, and only much later was it learned that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, several U.S. Navy [[F8U Crusader|RF-8A Crusader]] aircraft on low-level [[photoreconnaissance]] missions were fired upon, and one was hit by a 37&amp;nbsp;mm shell but managed to return to base.

At 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, Kennedy recalled members of EXCOMM to the [[White House]] and ordered that a message immediately be sent to U Thant asking the Soviets to &quot;suspend&quot; work on the missiles while negotiations were carried out. During this meeting, Maxwell Taylor delivered the news that the U-2 had been shot down. Kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an attack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another attack was made. In an interview 40 years later, McNamara said:

{{Block quote| We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It was shot down on Friday [...]. Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought &quot;Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack.&quot; Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.&lt;ref name=mcnamara group=note&gt;McNamara mistakenly dates the shooting down of USAF [[Major]] [[Rudolf Anderson]]'s U-2 on October 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Robert McNamara | title = [[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]| medium = DVD   | publisher = Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment | location =   | date =1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Drafting the response ===

Emissaries sent by both Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev agreed to meet at the Yenching Palace Chinese restaurant in the [[Cleveland Park]] neighborhood of Washington D.C. on the evening of October 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/13/AR2007011301272.html|title=At Yenching Palace, Five Decades of History to Go|last=Frey|first=Jennifer |date=January 14, 2007|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=December 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy suggested that they take Khrushchev's offer to trade away the missiles. Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, Robert Kennedy had been meeting with the Soviet Ambassador in Washington to discover whether these intentions were genuine. The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal because it would undermine [[NATO]]'s authority, and the Turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade.

As the meeting progressed, a new plan emerged and Kennedy was slowly persuaded. The new plan called for the President to ignore the latest message and instead to return to Khrushchev's earlier one. Kennedy was initially hesitant, feeling that Khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had been offered, but [[Llewellyn Thompson]] argued that he might accept it anyway. White House Special Counsel and Adviser [[Ted Sorensen]] and Robert Kennedy left the meeting and returned 45&amp;nbsp;minutes later with a draft letter to this effect. The President made several changes, had it typed, and sent it.

After the EXCOMM meeting, a smaller meeting continued in the [[Oval Office]]. The group argued that the letter should be underscored with an oral message to Ambassador Dobrynin stating that if the missiles were not withdrawn, military action would be used to remove them. Dean Rusk added one proviso, that no part of the language of the deal would mention Turkey, but there would be an understanding that the missiles would be removed &quot;voluntarily&quot; in the immediate aftermath. The President agreed, and the message was sent.

At Juan Brito's request, Fomin and Scali met again. Scali asked why the two letters from Khrushchev were so different, and Fomin claimed it was because of &quot;poor communications&quot;. Scali replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was a &quot;stinking double cross&quot;. He went on to claim that an invasion was only hours away, at which point Fomin stated that a response to the U.S. message was expected from Khrushchev shortly, and he urged Scali to tell the State Department that no treachery was intended. Scali said that he did not think anyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message. The two went their separate ways, and Scali immediately typed out a memo for the EXCOMM.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Within the U.S. establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second offer and returning to the first put Khrushchev in a terrible position. Military preparations continued, and all active duty Air Force personnel were recalled to their bases for possible action. Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood, &quot;We had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with Khrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours. It was a hope, not an expectation. The expectation was military confrontation by Tuesday, and possibly tomorrow...&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

At 8:05&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, the letter drafted earlier in the day was delivered. The message read, &quot;As I read your letter, the key elements of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) You would agree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba.&quot; The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be &quot;delayed.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

With the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. However, as Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to &quot;have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

At 12:12&amp;nbsp;am EDT, on October 27, the U.S. informed its NATO allies that &quot;the situation is growing shorter... the United States may find it necessary within a very short time in its interest and that of its fellow nations in the Western Hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary.&quot; To add to the concern, at 6&amp;nbsp;am the CIA reported that all missiles in Cuba were ready for action.

Later on that same day, what the White House later called &quot;Black Saturday,&quot; the U.S. Navy dropped a series of &quot;signaling [[depth charge]]s&quot; (practice depth charges the size of hand grenades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB75/|title=The Submarines of October|accessdate=May 1, 2010|publisher= [[George Washington University]], National Security Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;) on a Soviet submarine (B-59) at the quarantine line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was &quot;hulled&quot; (a hole in the hull from depth charges or surface fire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/press3.htm|title=The Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962: Press Release, 11&amp;nbsp;October 2002, 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm|date=October 11, 2002|publisher= [[George Washington University]], National Security Archive |accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, a U.S. U-2 spy plane made an accidental, unauthorized ninety-minute overflight of the Soviet Union's far eastern coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/files/resources/sr205.pdf|title=Why We Should Still Study the Cuban Missile Crisis|last=Dobbs|first=Michael|date=June 2008|work=Special Report 205|publisher=United States Institute of Peace|accessdate=May 2, 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5slHYqZeQ |archivedate = September 15, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crisis ends ==

After much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in southern Italy and in Turkey, the latter on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba.

At 9:00&amp;nbsp;am EDT, on October 28, a new message from Khrushchev was broadcast on Radio Moscow. Khrushchev stated that, &quot;the Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return to the Soviet Union.&quot;

Kennedy immediately responded, issuing a statement calling the letter &quot;an important and constructive contribution to peace&quot;. He continued this with a formal letter: &quot;I consider my letter to you of October twenty-seventh and your reply of today as firm undertakings on the part of both our governments which should be promptly carried out... The U.S. will make a statement in the framework of the Security Council in reference to Cuba as follows: it will declare that the United States of America will respect the inviolability of Cuban borders, its sovereignty, that it take the pledge not to interfere in internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of Cuba, and will restrain those who would plan to carry an aggression against Cuba, either from U.S. territory or from the territory of other countries neighbouring to Cuba.&quot;&lt;ref name=Faria&gt;{{cite book|last=Faria |first=Miguel |title=Cuba in Revolution—Escape from a Lost Paradise |year=2002 |publisher= Hacienda Publishing |location=Macon, Georgia | ISBN=978-0-9641077-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}}

The U.S continued the quarantine, and in the following days, aerial reconnaissance proved that the Soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems. The 42 missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight Soviet ships. The ships left Cuba from November 5–9. The U.S. made a final visual check as each of the ships passed the quarantine line. Further diplomatic efforts were required to remove the Soviet IL-28 bombers, and they were loaded on three Soviet ships on December 5 and 6. Concurrent with the Soviet commitment on the IL-28's, the U.S. Government announced the end of the quarantine effective at 6:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT on November 20, 1962.&lt;ref name=global&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/cuba-62.htm|title=Cuban Missile Crisis|publisher=Global Security|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This ref. mistakenly has a typo claiming Nov. 20, 1963 is the date of end of quarantine instead of 1962, as the 4-wk. quarantine period would encompass, and not into 1963 --&gt;

In his negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]], U.S. Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]] informally proposed that the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] missiles in [[Turkey]] would be removed &quot;within a short time after this crisis was over.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Glover |first=Jonathan |title=Humanity: a moral history of the twentieth century  |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xtqFJVhmuowC |accessdate=July 2, 2009 |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-08700-0 |page=464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|222}} The last U.S. missiles were disassembled by April 24, 1963, and were flown out of Turkey soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schlesinger |first=Arthur  |title=Robert Kennedy and his times  |url=http://books.google.com/?id=0xqrU5lnD7AC&amp;pg=PA528&amp;dq=robert+kennedy+ambassador++cuban+missile |accessdate=July 2, 2009 |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-618-21928-5 |page=523  |page=1088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical effect of this Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that it effectively strengthened Castro's position in Cuba, guaranteeing that the U.S. would not invade Cuba. It is possible that Khrushchev only placed the missiles in Cuba to get Kennedy to remove the missiles from Italy and Turkey and that the Soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garthoff|first=Raymond L.|title=Did Khrushchev Bluff in Cuba?

The perception was that Kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and Khrushchev had been humiliated. This is not entirely the case as both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite the pressures of their governments. Khrushchev held power for another two years.&lt;ref name=Faria/&gt;{{rp|102-105}}

===Aftermath===

The compromise was a particularly sharp embarrassment for Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of U.S. missiles from Italy and Turkey was not made public—it was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev. The Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started—though if played well, it could have looked just the opposite. Khrushchev's fall from power two years later can be partially linked to [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the U.S. and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place.

Cuba perceived it as a partial betrayal by the Soviets, given that decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev. Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of Guantanamo, were not addressed. This caused Cuban-Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come.&lt;ref name=Ramonet&gt;{{cite book|first=Ramonet|last=Ignacio |title=Fidel Castro: My Life |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2007|isbn=978-0-14-102626-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|278}} On the other hand, Cuba continued to be protected from invasion.

One U.S. military commander was not happy with the result either. General LeMay told the President that it was &quot;the greatest defeat in our history&quot; and that the U.S. should have immediately invaded Cuba.

The Cuban Missile Crisis spurred the [[Hotline Agreement]], which created the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]], a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington, D.C. The purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two Cold War countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis. The world-wide U.S. Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November 20, 1962. U-2 pilot Major Anderson's body was returned to the United States and he was buried with full military honors in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly-created [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]], which was awarded posthumously.

Although Anderson was the only combat fatality during the crisis, eleven crew members of three reconnaissance Boeing [[RB-47 Stratojet]]s of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period between September 27 and November 11, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Alwyn T., &quot;Boeing's B-47 Stratojet&quot;, Specialty Press, North Branch, Minnesota, 2005, ISBN 978-1-58007-071-3, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics including Seymour Melman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Seymour |last=Melman |title=The Demilitarized Society: Disarmament and Conversion |publisher=Harvest House |year=1988|authorlink=Seymour Melman |location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Seymour Hersh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Seymour |last=Hersh |title= The Dark Side of Camelot |year=1978|authorlink=Seymour Hersh}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Cuban Missile Crisis encouraged U.S. use of military means, such as in the [[Vietnam War]]. This Russo-American confrontation was synchronous with the [[Sino-Indian War]], dating from the U.S.'s military quarantine of Cuba; historians{{Who|date=May 2010}} speculate that the Chinese attack against India for disputed land was meant to coincide with the Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.frontierindia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=53 |title=Frontier India India-China Section| quote= Note alleged connections to Cuban Missile Crisis|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928115849/http%3A//journal.frontierindia.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dsection%26id%3D7%26Itemid%3D53 |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-crisis history===
[[File:Soviet b-59 submarine.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Navy HSS-1 Seabat helicopter hovers over Soviet submarine B-59, forced to the surface by U.S. Naval forces in the Caribbean near Cuba (October 28–29, 1962)]]

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], a historian and adviser to John F. Kennedy, told [[National Public Radio]] in an interview on October 16, 2002 that Castro did not want the missiles, but that Khrushchev had pressured Castro to accept them. Castro was not completely happy with the idea but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them to protect Cuba against U.S. attack, and to aid its ally, the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Ramonet/&gt;{{rp|272}} Schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was angrier with Khrushchev than he was with Kennedy because Khrushchev had not consulted Castro before deciding to remove them.&lt;ref name=castro group=note&gt;In his biography, Castro does not compare his feelings for either leader at that moment, however, he makes it clear that he was angry with Khrushchev for failing to consult with him. (Ramonet 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had, by the time the crisis broke, received tactical nuclear warheads for their [[rocket artillery|artillery rockets]] and [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28 bombers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aca&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2002_11/cubanmissile.asp |title=Arms Control Association: Arms Control Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro stated that he would have recommended their use if the U.S. invaded despite knowing Cuba would be destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;aca&quot;/&gt;

Arguably the most dangerous moment in the crisis was only recognized during the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference in October 2002. Attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on October 26, 1962 the [[USS Beale (DD-471)|USS Beale]] had tracked and dropped signaling depth charges (the size of hand grenades) on the B-59, a Soviet Project 641 (NATO designation ''[[Foxtrot class submarine|Foxtrot]]'') submarine which, unknown to the U.S., was armed with a 15 kiloton nuclear torpedo. Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was surrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface. An argument broke out among three officers on the B-59, including submarine captain Valentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy brigade commander Second Captain [[Vasili Arkhipov]]. An exhausted Savitsky became furious and ordered that the nuclear torpedo on board be made combat ready. Accounts differ about whether Commander Arkhipov convinced Savitsky not to make the attack, or whether Savitsky himself finally concluded that the only reasonable choice left open to him was to come to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dobbs |first=Michael |title=One Minute to Midnight: Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro on the Brink of Nuclear War |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4000-4358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|303, 317}} During the conference Robert McNamara stated that nuclear war had come much closer than people had thought. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, said, &quot;A guy called Vasili Arkhipov saved the world.&quot;

The crisis was a substantial focus of the 2003 documentary, ''[[The Fog of War]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].

'''''Aquilegia''''' ('''Columbine'''; from Latin ''columba'' &quot;dove&quot;) is a [[genus]] of about 60-70 [[species]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607&lt;/ref&gt; of [[perennial plant]]s that are found in [[meadow]]s, [[woodland]]s, and at higher altitudes throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]], known for the [[spur (botany)|spurred]] petals of their [[flower]]s.

==Etymology==
The genus name ''Aquilegia'' is derived from the Latin word for eagle (''aquila''), because the shape of the flower petals  are said to resemble an eagle's claw.

&quot;Columbine&quot; is derived from the Latin word for pigeon (''columba'').

==Description==
[[Fruit]] is a [[follicle (fruit)|follicle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dezhi &amp; Robinson (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relatives==
Columbines are closely related to plants in the genera ''[[Actaea]]'' (baneberries) and ''[[Aconitum]]'' (wolfsbanes/monkshoods), which like ''Aquilegia'' produce cardiogenic [[toxin]]s.&lt;ref name = tilford1997&gt;Tilford (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insects==
They are used as food plants by some [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) [[caterpillar]]s. These are mainly of [[noctuid moth]]s &amp;ndash; noted for feeding on many poisonous plants without harm &amp;ndash; like [[Cabbage Moth]] (''Mamestra brassicae''), [[Dot Moth]] (''Melanchra persicariae'') and [[Mouse Moth]] (''Amphipyra tragopoginis''). [[Engrailed|The Engrailed]] (''Ectropis crepuscularia''), a [[geometer moth]], also uses columbine as larval foodplant.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Aquilegia columbine magpie cultivar 2.jpg|thumb|left|Columbine [[cultivar]] 'Magpie']]
[[File:Doubled flower of Aquilegia x hybrida 001.JPG|thumb|left|[[Double-flowered]] ''[[Aquilegia × hybrida]]'']]
Several species are grown in [[gardens]], including the [[European Columbine]] (''A. vulgaris''), a traditional garden flower in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nold (2003): p.128&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[cultivar]]s and [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s have also been developed as well. They are easy to propagate from seed.  

Columbine is a perennial, which propagates by seed. It will grow to a height of 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;inches. It will grow in full sun, however, prefers growing in partial shade and well drained soil, and is able to tolerate average soils and dry soil conditions. Columbine is rated hardiness of Zone 3 so does not require mulching or protection in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gardenersnet.com/flower/columbine.htm The Gardener's Network&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Kilmer (1989). ''The Perennial Encyclopedia'' ISBN 0886656397&lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of hybrids are now available for the garden, since the British A vulgaris was joined by other European and N American varieties.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=taGxynmhi54C Andrew McIndoe, Kevin Hobbs: Perennials. David &amp; Charles, 2005 ISBN 1558707646, 9781558707641]&lt;/ref&gt; Aquilegia species are very interfertile, and will self sow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=aLlt53wiYr8C New England Wild Flower Society Guide to Growing and Propagating Wildflowers of the United States and Canada]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The flowers of various species of ''Colombine'' were consumed in moderation by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s as a [[condiment]] with other fresh greens, and are reported to be very sweet, and safe if consumed in small quantities. The plant's seeds and roots are highly poisonous however, and contain cardiogenic [[toxin]]s which cause both severe [[gastroenteritis]] and [[heart palpitation]]s if consumed as food. Native Americans used very small amounts of ''Aquilegia'' root as an effective treatment for [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s. However, the medical use of this plant is better avoided due to its high toxicity; columbine poisonings may be fatal.&lt;ref name = tilford1997 /&gt;

==Culture==
The [[Colorado Blue Columbine]] (''A. caerulea'') is the official [[state flower]] of [[Colorado]] (see also [[Columbine, Colorado]]).

==Evolution==
Columbines have been important in the study of [[evolution]]. It was found that [[Sierra Columbine]] (''A. pubescens'') and [[Crimson Columbine]] (''A. formosa'') each have specifically [[adaptation|adapted]] [[pollinator]]s, with [[hawkmoth]]s that can pollinate one species while usually failing to pollinate the other. Such a &quot;[[pollination syndrome]]&quot;, being due to flower [[genetics]], ensures [[reproductive isolation]] and can be a cause of underlying [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulton &amp; Hodges (1999), Hodges ''et al.'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer engineering]], '''cache''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|æ|ʃ}} {{respell|kash}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cache |title=Cache - Definition |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated  |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data that is stored within a cache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original values that are stored elsewhere. If requested data is contained in the cache (cache hit), this request can be served by simply reading the cache, which is comparatively faster. Otherwise (cache miss), the data has to be recomputed or fetched from its original storage location, which is comparatively slower. Hence, the more requests can be served from the cache the faster the overall system performance is.

To be cost efficient and to enable an efficient use of data, caches are relatively small. Nevertheless, caches have proven themselves in many areas of computing because access patterns in typical [[Application software|computer applications]] have [[locality of reference]]. References exhibit [[Memory locality|temporal locality]] if data is requested again that has been recently requested already. References exhibit [[spatial locality]] if data is requested that is physically stored close to data that has been requested already.

[[File:cache,basic.svg|frame|Diagram of a CPU memory cache]]

== Operation ==

Hardware implements cache as a block of memory for temporary storage of data likely to be used again. [[CPU]]s and [[hard drive]]s frequently use a cache, as do web browsers and web servers.

A cache is made up of a pool of entries. Each entry has a datum (a nugget (piece) of data) - a copy of the same datum in some backing store. Each entry also has a tag, which specifies the identity of the datum in the backing store of which the entry is a copy.

When the cache client (a CPU, web browser, [[operating system]]) needs to access a datum presumed to exist in the backing store, it first checks the cache. If an entry can be found with a tag matching that of the desired datum, the datum in the entry is used instead. This situation is known as a '''cache hit'''. So, for example, a web browser program might check its local cache on disk to see if it has a local copy of the contents of a web page at a particular URL. In this example, the URL is the tag, and the contents of the web page is the datum. The percentage of accesses that result in cache hits is known as the '''hit rate''' or '''hit ratio''' of the cache.

The alternative situation, when the cache is consulted and found not to contain a datum with the desired tag, has become known as a '''cache miss'''. The previously uncached datum fetched from the backing store during miss handling is usually copied into the cache, ready for the next access.

During a cache miss, the CPU usually ejects some other entry in order to make room for the previously uncached datum. The [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] used to select the entry to eject is known as the [[Page replacement algorithm|replacement policy]]. One popular replacement policy, &quot;least recently used&quot; (LRU), replaces the least recently used entry (see [[cache algorithms]]). More efficient caches compute use frequency against the size of the stored contents, as well as the [[Access time|latencies]] and throughputs for both the cache and the backing store. This works well for larger amounts of data, longer latencies and slower throughputs, such as experienced with a hard drive and the Internet, but is not efficient for use with a CPU cache.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

{{Anchor|Dirty}}
When a system writes a datum to the cache, it must at some point write that datum to the backing store as well. The timing of this write is controlled by what is known as the '''write policy'''.

In a '''write-through''' cache, every write to the cache causes a synchronous write to the backing store.

Alternatively, in a '''write-back''' (or ''' write-behind''') cache, writes are not immediately mirrored to the store. Instead, the cache tracks which of its locations have been written over and marks these locations as '''dirty'''. The data in these locations are written back to the backing store when those data are evicted from the cache, an effect referred to as a '''lazy write'''. For this reason, a read miss in a write-back cache (which requires a block to be replaced by another) will often require two memory accesses to service: one to retrieve the needed datum, and one to write replaced data from the cache to the store.

Other policies may also trigger data write-back. The client may make many changes to a datum in the cache, and then explicitly notify the cache to write back the datum.

'''No-write allocation''' (a.k.a. write-no-allocate) is a cache policy which caches only processor reads, i.e. on a write-miss:
* Datum is written directly to memory,
* Datum at the missed-write location is not added to cache.
This avoids the need for write-back or write-through when the old value of the datum was absent from the cache prior to the write.

Entities other than the cache may change the data in the backing store, in which case the copy in the cache may become out-of-date or '''stale'''. Alternatively, when the client updates the data in the cache, copies of those data in other caches will become stale. Communication protocols between the cache managers which keep the data consistent are known as [[cache coherency|coherency protocols]].

== Applications ==
=== CPU cache ===
{{Main|CPU cache}}

Small memories on or close to the '''[[CPU]]''' can operate faster than the much larger main memory. Most CPUs since the 1980s have used one or more caches, and modern high-end embedded, desktop and server '''[[microprocessors]]''' may have as many as half a dozen, each specialized for a specific function. Examples of caches with a specific function are the D-cache and I-cache (data cache and instruction cache).

=== Disk cache ===
{{Main|Page cache}}

While CPU caches are generally managed entirely by hardware, a variety of software manages other caches. The [[page cache]] in [[main memory]], which is an example of disk cache, is managed by the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]].

While the hard drive's hardware [[disk buffer]] is sometimes misleadingly referred to as &quot;disk cache&quot;, its main functions are write sequencing and read prefetching. Repeated cache hits are relatively rare, due to the small size of the buffer in comparison to the drive's capacity. However, high-end [[disk controller]]s often have their own on-board cache of hard disk [[Block (data storage)|data blocks]]. 

Finally, fast local hard disk can also cache information held on even slower data storage devices, such as remote servers ([[web cache]]) or local [[tape drive]]s or [[optical jukebox]]es. Such a scheme is the main concept of [[hierarchical storage management]].

=== Web cache ===
{{Main|Web cache}}

[[Web browser]]s and [[Proxy server|web proxy servers]] employ '''web caches''' to store previous responses from [[web server]]s, such as [[web page]]s. Web caches reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted across the network, as information previously stored in the cache can often be re-used. This reduces bandwidth and processing requirements of the web server, and helps to improve [[responsiveness]] for users of the web.

Web browsers employ a built-in web cache, but some [[Internet Service Provider|internet service providers]] or organizations also use a caching proxy server, which is a web cache that is shared among all users of that network.

Another form of cache is [[P2P caching]], where the files most sought for by [[peer-to-peer]] applications are stored in an [[ISP]] cache to accelerate P2P transfers. Similarly, decentralised equivalents exist, which allow communities to perform the same task for P2P traffic, for example, Corelli &lt;ref&gt;Gareth Tyson, Andreas Mauthe, Sebastian Kaune, Mu Mu and Thomas Plagemann. Corelli: A Dynamic Replication Service for Supporting Latency-Dependent Content in Community Networks. In Proc. MMCN'09 [http://eprints.comp.lancs.ac.uk/2044/1/MMCN09.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other caches ===
The BIND [[Domain Name System|DNS]] daemon caches a mapping of domain names to [[IP address]]es, as does a resolver library.

Write-through operation is common when operating over unreliable networks (like an Ethernet LAN), because of the enormous complexity of the [[cache coherency|coherency protocol]] required between multiple write-back caches when communication is unreliable. For instance, web page caches and [[client-side]] [[Network File System|network file system]] caches (like those in [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] or [[Server Message Block|SMB]]) are typically read-only or write-through specifically to keep the network protocol simple and reliable.

[[Web search engine|Search engine]]s also frequently make [[web page]]s they have indexed available from their cache. For example, [[Google]] provides a &quot;Cached&quot; link next to each search result. This can prove useful when web pages from a [[web server]] are temporarily or permanently inaccessible.

Another type of caching is storing computed results that will likely be needed again, or &lt;!-- yes, this really is memoization; it is not a typo --&gt; [[memoization]]. [[ccache]],&lt;!-- nor is this a typo, &quot;ccache&quot; is C compiler cache --&gt; a program that caches the output of the compilation to speed up the second-time compilation, exemplifies this type.

[[Database caching]] can substantially improve the throughput of [[database]] applications, for example in the processing of [[Index (database)|indexes]], [[Data dictionary|data dictionaries]], and frequently used subsets of data.

[[Distributed caching]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
uses caches spread across different networked hosts, for example, [http://eprints.comp.lancs.ac.uk/2044/1/MMCN09.pdf Corelli]

=== The difference between buffer and cache ===
The terms &quot;buffer&quot; and &quot;cache&quot; are not mutually exclusive and the functions are frequently combined; however, there is a difference in intent.

A [[data buffer|buffer]] is a temporary memory location that is traditionally used because CPU [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s cannot directly address data stored in peripheral devices. Thus, addressable memory is used as intermediate stage. Additionally such a buffer may be feasible when a large block of data is assembled or disassembled (as required by a storage device), or when data may be delivered in a different order than that in which it is produced. Also a whole buffer of data is usually transferred sequentially (for example to hard disk), so buffering itself sometimes increases transfer performance or reduce the variation or jitter of the transfer's latency as opposed to caching where the intent is to reduce the latency. These benefits are present even if the buffered data are written to the [[Data buffer|buffer]] once and read from the buffer once.

A cache also increases transfer performance. A part of the increase similarly comes from the possibility that multiple small transfers will combine into one large block. But the main performance-gain occurs because there is a good chance that the same datum will be read from cache multiple times, or that written data will soon be read. A cache's sole purpose is to reduce accesses to the underlying slower storage. Cache is also usually an [[abstraction layer]] that is designed to be invisible from the perspective of neighbouring layers.

[[Image:ColumbusCityHall.jpg|thumb|Columbus City Hall]]
'''Columbus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|b|ə|s}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Bartholomew County, Indiana|Bartholomew County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}} The population was 44,061 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The current mayor is [[Fred Armstrong]]. It is located approximately 40 miles (64&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], on the east fork of the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]]. It is the state's 20th largest city. It is also the principal city of the Columbus, Indiana, [[metropolitan statistical area]] which encompasses all of Bartholomew County.

Columbus is currently ranked 11th in the United States on the list of safest cities per population. In 2006, Columbus won the national contest &quot;America in Bloom.&quot; In 2004 it was named as one of &quot;The Ten Most Playful Towns&quot; by [[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Jr.]] Family Magazine. The July 2005 edition of &quot;[[GQ Magazine]]&quot; named Columbus one of the &quot;62 Reasons to Love Your Country.&quot; Columbus is the headquarters of the engine company [[Cummins Inc.]]

==History==
In 1820, the land which is now Columbus was bought by General [[John Tipton]] and Luke Bonesteel. General Tipton built a log cabin on Mt. Tipton, a small hill overlooking White River and the surrounding flat, heavily forested, swampy valley. The town was known as Tiptonia, named in honor of General [[John Tipton]]. On March 20, 1821, the town's name was changed to Columbus. General Tipton was very upset by the change of names, and he moved from Columbus. Later in life, General [[John Tipton]] became the Highway Commissioner for the [[State of Indiana]], and was given the job of building a highway from [[Indianapolis]], Indiana to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky. Upon reaching Columbus, he constructed the first bypass road ever built. Mauxferry Road detoured south around the west side of Columbus on its way to Seymour.

Joseph McKinney was the first to plot the town of Columbus. No date of this plot was recorded by Mr. McKinney.

For years, it was recorded in the local history books that the land on which Columbus sits was donated by General Tipton. However, a deed purporting to show a sale of the land was acquired by the [http://www.historiccolumbusindiana.org Historic Columbus Indiana website] in 2003 which indicated General Tipton actually sold the land.

A ferry was established in order to avoid crossing both the Flat Rock and Driftwood rivers, which join only a short distance above the site of the ferry. This became a village of three or four log cabins and in 1821, the first store was added. In the same year, Bartholomew County was organized by an act of the State Legislature and named after the famous Indian fighter, General Joseph Bartholomew. Columbus, Indiana was incorporated as a city on June 28, 1864.

In 1844, the first railroad in Indiana reached Columbus from Madison, Indiana. This was known as the Madison branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The railroad caused the community to grow into one of the larger communities of the State of Indiana. By 1850, three more railroads came into the city.

Columbus is host to the oldest theater in the State of Indiana: the [http://www.historiccolumbusindiana.org/jscrump.htm Crump Theatre], which was built in 1889 by John Crump. Today, the building is a historical landmark and is also an all-ages venue where bands perform occasionally. Columbus is also host to the formerly oldest continually operated bookstore in the State of Indiana: Cummins Bookstore first began its operations in 1892 and ended in late 2007.

The Irwin Union Bank building was built in 1954. It was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 2001 because of its architecture.

The building consists of a one-story bank structure adjacent to a three-story office annex. A portion of the office annex was built along with the banking hall in 1954. The remaining, much larger portion, designed by Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo and Associates, was built in 1973.

[[Eero Saarinen]] designed the bank building with its glazed hall to be set off against the blank background of its three-story brick annex. Two steel and glass vestibule connectors lead from the north side of this structure to the annex.

The building was designed to distance the Irwin Union Bank from traditional banking architecture, which mostly echoed imposing, neoclassical style buildings of brick or stone. Tellers were behind iron bars and removed from their customers. Saarinen worked to develop a building that would welcome customers rather than intimidate them.

Columbus has been home to many manufacturing companies, including [[Noblitt-Sparks Industries]] (which built radios under the Arvin brand in the 1930s),&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Morgan E. ''A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950'' (Antiques Electronics Supply, 1990), pp.58–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Arvin Industries, now [[ArvinMeritor Incorporated|ArvinMeritor Industries]]. After merging with Meritor Automotive on July 10, 2000, the headquarters of ArvinMeritor Industries was moved to Troy, Michigan.

[[Cummins|Cummins Inc.]] is by far the region's largest employer. In addition, the Infotech Park accounts for a sizable number of research jobs in Columbus proper. Other notable industries include architecture, a discipline for which Columbus is famous worldwide. The late J. Irwin Miller (then president and chairman of [[Cummins|Cummins Engine Company]]) launched the Cummins Foundation, a charitable program which helps subsidize a large number of architectural projects throughout the city by up-and-coming engineers and architects.

Early in the 20th century, Columbus was also home to a number of pioneering car manufacturers, including [[Reeves (automobile company)|Reeves]], which produced the unusual four-axle Octoauto and the twin rear axle Sextoauto, both around 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925''. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.122-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Columbus is far enough away from Indianapolis, it benefits tremendously from nearby commuters who recognize Columbus as a major city in its own right. During the day, nearly 19,000 workers commute into the city from the surrounding townships and villages.

In recent years, city officials have looked for ways to revitalize the city and return Columbus to the days when Miller's architectural innovation made it one of the most envied cities in the United States. Economic development, widespread beautification innovations, various tax incentives, and increased law enforcement have helped Columbus overcome what some considered a slump during the 1980s and 1990s.

==Architecture and art==
[[Image:Columbus indiana fountain.JPG|thumb | Fountain in front of the Commons-Courthouse Center]]
Columbus is a city known for its [http://www.columbus.in.us/listings/index.cfm?catId=336 architecture]. [[J. Irwin Miller]], Co-Founder of the [[Cummins|Cummins Engine Company]], a local diesel engine manufacturer, instituted a program in which the Cummins company paid the architects' fee if the client selected a firm from a list compiled by Mr. Miller. The plan was initiated with public schools. It was so successful that Miller went on to defray the design costs of fire stations, public housing and other community structures. The high number of notable public buildings and [[List of public art in Columbus, Indiana|sculptures]] in the Columbus area, designed by such individuals as [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Cesar Pelli]], [[Richard Meier]] and others have led to Columbus being referred to as the &quot;Athens of the prairie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taglineguru.com/mottolist.html&lt;/ref&gt; Six buildings, built between 1942 and 1965, are [[National Historic Landmark]]s, and 60 other buildings sustain the Bartholomew County seat's reputation as a showcase of modern architecture. [[National Geographic Magazine]] once devoted an entire article to the town's architecture.

The National Historical Landmarks are:

This is a '''list of well-known computer scientists''', people who do work in [[computer science]], in particular researchers and authors.

Some persons notable as [[programmer]]s are included here because they work in research as well as program. A few of these people pre-date the [[invention]] of the digital computer; they are now regarded as computer scientists because their work can be seen as leading to the invention of the computer. Others are mathematicians whose work falls within what would now be called theoretical computer science, such as [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[algorithmic information theory]].
