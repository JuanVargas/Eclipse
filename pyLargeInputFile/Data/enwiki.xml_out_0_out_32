In [[condensed matter physics]], an '''amorphous''' or '''non-crystalline solid''' is a [[solid]] that lacks the [[long-range order]] characteristic of a [[crystal]].

In part of the older literature, the term has been used synonymously with [[glass]]. Nowadays, &quot;amorphous solid&quot; is considered to be the overarching concept, and &quot;glass&quot; the more special case: A glass is an amorphous solid that transforms into a liquid upon heating through the [[glass transition]].&lt;ref&gt;
J. Zarzycki: Les verres et l'état vitreux. Paris: Masson 1982. English translation available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of amorphous solids include [[gel]]s, [[thin film]]s, and nanostructured materials.

==Nanostructured materials==

It is difficult to make a distinction between truly amorphous solids and crystalline solids if the size of the crystals are very small. Even amorphous materials have some short-range order at the atomic length scale due the nature of [[chemical bonding]]. Furthermore, in very small [[crystal]]s a large fraction of the [[atom]]s are located at or near the surface of the crystal; relaxation of the surface and interfacial effects distort the atomic positions, decreasing the structural order. Even the most advanced structural characterization techniques, such as x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, have difficulty in distinguishing between amorphous and crystalline structures on these length scales.

== Amorphous thin films ==

Amorphous phases are important constituents of [[thin film]]s, which are solid layers of a few [[Nanometer|nm]] to some tens of [[Micrometre|µm]] thickness deposited upon an underlying substrate. So-called structure zone models were developed to describe the microstructure and 
ceramics of thin films as a function of the homologeous temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is the ratio of deposition temperature over melting temperature.&lt;ref name=MoDe1969&gt;{{cite journal | author = B. A. Movchan and A. V. Demchishin | title = Study of the structure and properties of thick vacuum condensates of nickel, titanium, tungsten, aluminium oxide and zirconium dioxide | journal = Phys. Met. Metallogr. | volume = 28 | pages = 83–90 | year = 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thor1974&gt;{{cite journal | author = J.A. Thornton | title = Influence of apparatus geometry and deposition conditions on the structure and topography of thick sputtered coatings | journal = J. Vac. Sci. Tech. | volume = 11 | pages = 666–670 | year = 1974 | doi = 10.1116/1.1312732 |bibcode = 1974JVST...11..666T }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these models, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the occurrence of amorphous phases is that ''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' has to be smaller than 0.3, that is the deposition temperature must be below 30% of the melting temperature. For higher values, the surface diffusion of deposited atomic species would allow for the formation of crystallites with long range atomic order. 

Regarding their applications, amorphous metallic layers played an important role in the discussion of a suspected [[superconductivity]] in amorphous metals.&lt;ref name=Buck1961&gt;{{cite conference  | last = Buckel  | first = W.  | title = The influence of crystal bonds on film growth  | booktitle = Elektrische en Magnetische Eigenschappen van dunne Metallaagies  | place = Leuven, Belgium  | date = 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[optical coatings]] made from [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Tantalum pentoxide|Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] etc. and combinations of them in most cases consist of amorphous phases of these compounds. Much research is carried out into thin amorphous films as a gas separating [[Biological membrane|membrane]] layer.&lt;ref name=Vos1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = R.M. de Vos, H. Verweij | title = High-Selectivity, High-Flux Silica Membranes for Gas Separation | journal = Science | volume = 279 | pages = 1710 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1126/science.279.5357.1710 | pmid = 9497287 | issue = 5357|bibcode = 1998Sci...279.1710D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technologically most important thin amorphous film is probably represented by few nm thin SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers serving as isolator above the conducting channel of a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor ([[MOSFET]]). Also, hydrogenated [[amorphous silicon]], a-Si:H in short, is of technical significance for [[thin film solar cells]]. In case of a-Si:H the missing long-range order between silicon atoms is partly induced by the presence by hydrogen in the percent range. 

The occurrence of amorphous phases turned out as a phenomenon of particular interest for studying thin film growth. Remarkably, the growth of polycrystalline films is often preceded by an initial amorphous layer, the thickness of which may amount to only a few nm. The most investigated example is represented by thin multicrystalline silicon films, where such an initial amorphous layer was observed in many studies.&lt;ref name=Birk2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. Birkholz, B. Selle, W. Fuhs, S. Christiansen, H. P. Strunk, and R. Reich | title = [http://www.mariobirkholz.de/PRB2001.pdf Amorphous-crystalline phase transition during the growth of thin films: the case of microcrystalline silicon] | journal = Phys. Rev.

The phenomenon has been interpreted in the framework of [[Polymorphism (materials science)#Ostwald's rule|Ostwald's rule]] of stages&lt;ref name=Ostw1897&gt;{{cite journal | author = W. Ostwald | title = Studien über die Umwandlung fester Körper | journal = Z. Phys. Chem. | volume = 22 | pages = 289–330 | year = 1897 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that predicts the formation of phases to proceed with increasing condensation time towards increasing stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buck1961&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Birk2001&quot;/&gt; Experimental studies of the phenomenon require a clearly defined state of the substrate surface and its contaminant density etc., upon which the thin film is deposited.

'''''A Wizard of Earthsea''''', first published in 1968, is the first of a series of books written by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] and set in the [[fantasy]] world [[archipelago]] of [[Earthsea]] depicting the adventures of a budding young [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] named [[Ged (Earthsea)|Ged]]. The tale of Ged's growth and development as he travels across Earthsea continues in ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'' and ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'' and is supplemented in ''[[Tehanu]]'' and  ''[[The Other Wind]]''. The series has won numerous literary awards, including the 1990 Nebula for ''[[Tehanu]]'', the 1972 Newbery Silver Medal Award for ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'', 1972 National Book Award for Children's Books for ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'', and 1979 [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] for ''A Wizard of Earthsea''.

==Plot summary==
Ged (commonly known as Sparrowhawk) is a young boy on Gont, one of the larger islands in the north of the archipelago of Earthsea. His mother is dead, his much older siblings have all left home, and his father is a dour, taciturn [[bronze]]-smith with nothing in common with his son, so the boy grows up wild and headstrong. Ged discovers by accident that he has an extraordinary talent for [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. His aunt, the village [[witch]], teaches him the little she herself knows, but his power far exceeds hers.

One day, he uses his talent and a fog-gathering spell he learned from a passing weatherworker to save his village from [[Karg]] raiders. The tale of his remarkable feat spreads far and wide, finally reaching the ear of a wise Gontish mage, [[Aihal|Ogion]] the Silent. He recognizes that the boy is so powerful he must be trained so as not to become a danger to himself and others. In the rite of passage into adulthood, he gives the boy his &quot;[[true name]]&quot;, [[Ged (Earthsea)|Ged]], and takes him as an apprentice. In this world, a magician who knows someone's true name has control over that person, so one's true name is revealed only to those whom one trusts completely. Normally, a person is referred to by his or her &quot;use name&quot;. Ged's is Sparrowhawk. 

[[Image:Wizard earthsea.JPG|thumb|left|150px|1971 Puffin edition. 201 pages]]
The undisciplined young man grows restless under the gentle, patient tutelage of his master. One day at the taunting of the daughter of the local lord - who, it is later revealed, is also a witch - Ged reads out a powerful spell from one of Ogion's old books. Even though he does not go through completely with the spell, a shadowy being is somehow released. The shade advances on Ged but is driven away by the timely return of Ogion.  Ogion finally gives him a choice: stay with him or go to the renowned school for [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizards]], on the island of [[Islands of Earthsea|Roke]]. Though he has grown to love the old man, the youngster is drawn irresistibly to a life of doing, rather than being.

At the school, Ged masters his craft with ease, but his pride and arrogance grow even faster than his skill and, in his [[hubris]], he attempts to summon a dead spirit - a perilous spell which goes awry. The shadow seizes the chance to escape into the world and attacks him, scarring his face. It is driven off by the head of the school, the Archmage Nemmerle, who expends all of his power in the process and dies shortly thereafter.

Ged is wracked with guilt at causing the old man's death, but after a painful and slow recovery, he graduates from the school. Normally, Roke's wizards are much sought after by princes and rich merchants, but the new Archmage sends a willing Ged to a poor island group instead, to protect the inhabitants from a powerful [[western dragon|dragon]] and its maturing sons, who have been seen scouting the region. 

Ged eventually comes to realize that he cannot both defend the islanders against the dragon and fight against the nameless thing he summoned into the world. He takes a desperate gamble; in the old histories, he has found the true name of a dragon which might be the one he faces. His guess is right and by using the dragon's name Yevaud, he is able to force the dragon to vow that neither it nor its offspring will ever trouble the islanders. 

Then, with no idea how to deal with his other foe, Ged tries to return to the safety of Roke, but the magical, protective Mage-wind drives away the ship on which he is a passenger. Unsure of where to go next, he decides upon the far northern island of Osskil. While there his pursuing nemesis nearly catches him by taking the form of a ''gebbeth'', that is by taking over a man's body. Ged flees the gebbeth and finds what appears to be a safe haven in the domain of Benderesk, the lord of Terranen. However, Serret, the lady of Terranen, is the same girl who taunted him years ago, and she is determined to enslave Ged by using the power of an ancient stone. Fortunately Ged realizes his peril just in time and, taking the form of a falcon, flees yet again. 

He instinctively returns to Gont and Ogion, who advises him to turn the tables on his shadow. In following his master's wise guidance, the roles of Ged and his enemy become reversed, and the shadow becomes the hunted.

Ged pursues the shadow southwards across the ocean, but is nearly drowned when the shadow lures him into steering his boat onto rocks. The vessel sinks, but he manages to reach a small island inhabited by only two old people, a Kargish man and his sister, who were abandoned there as children and who have forgotten there is an outside world and other people. Despite their fear of him they provide with food and water. After Ged regains his strength, he constructs another boat, held together by magic. When he is ready to leave, he offers to take the pair wherever they want to go, but the man fearfully turns him down and the woman does not seem to understand what he means. However, she gives him a parting gift of one of her few possessions, a broken half of an armlet. (The siblings' story and the gift's significance are revealed in the sequel).

Back at sea, the shadow nearly takes Ged unawares, but he senses it just in time and comes to grips with it. His enemy flees, but Ged senses that he has forged a bond that cannot be broken and that the shadow cannot now avoid a final confrontation. Ged follows the shadow south, but he is now unwelcome at every island he lands on. This is because the shadow has taken on Ged's own shape and has gone before him, frightening the islanders. 

Increasingly despondant, Ged lands on the island of Iffish and there his luck begins to turn. The mage of the island is none other than Vetch or Estarriol, the only friend he made at school. Ged confides in Estarriol about his situation, and Estarriol agrees to help him. Together, the two wizards set off south and east in pursuit of the shadow. Eventually they leave the last known island of earthsea and head off into the open sea. As they draw closer to the shadow, Ged perceives the ocean gradually turning into land, an immensely powerful magic. Though Vetch cannot see the transformation, the boat runs aground.  Ged steps out of the boat and walks off to confront his waiting shadow. Though some of his teachers had thought it to be nameless, Ged and his adversary speak at the same moment, each naming the other &quot;Ged&quot;. So Ged embraces his foe and the two become one. By doing this he has accepted his own 'shadowside' and the possibility of his own death and thus, Ged has freed himself. Ged returns to the boat healed and a relieved Estarriol sails the boat back to earthsea and his home island of Iffish.

==Inspiration==
In 1967, Herman Schein (the publisher of Parnassus Press and the husband of Ruth Robbins, the illustrator of the book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sieruta|first=Peter D.|title=Smud-ged in Earthsea|url=http://collectingchildrensbooks.blogspot.com/2011/03/smud-ged-in-earthsea.html|publisher=collectingchildrensbooks.blogspot.com|accessdate=April 28, 2011|date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) asked Le Guin to try writing a book &quot;for older kids&quot;, giving her complete freedom for the subject and the approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esmonde|first=Margaret P.|title=The Good Witch of the West.|journal=Children's Literature|year=1981|volume=9|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chl/summary/v009/9.esmonde.html|accessdate=April 28, 2011|page=185 - 190|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Project MUSE database.|issn=1543-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Guin has said{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} that the book was in part a response to the image of wizards as ancient and wise, and to her wondering where they come from. Her short stories, &quot;[[The Rule of Names]]&quot; (1964) and &quot;[[The Word of Unbinding]]&quot; (1964), established some of the groundwork for the original Earthsea trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;Le Guin, Ursula, ''The Wind's Twelve Quarters'', (New York, Harper &amp; Row, October 1975), foreword.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further inspiration came from the work of her parents, anthropologists [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] and [[Theodora Kroeber]]:  see [[Ishi]].

==Adaptations==
An original mini-series based very loosely on ''A Wizard of Earthsea'' and ''The Tombs of Atuan'' was broadcast on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]].

'''Alex Lifeson''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (born '''Aleksandar Živojinović'''; August 27, 1953) is a [[Serbian-Canadian]] musician, best known as the [[guitarist]] of the Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. In the summer of 1968, Lifeson founded the band that would become Rush with friend and drummer [[John Rutsey]]. He has been an integral member of the band ever since.

For Rush, Lifeson plays electric and acoustic [[guitar]]s as well as other [[stringed instruments]] such as [[mandola]], [[mandolin]], and [[bouzouki]]. He also performs [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] in live performances, and occasionally plays keyboards and bass pedal synthesizers. During live performances, Lifeson, like the other members of Rush, performs real-time triggering of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampled]] instruments, concurrently with his guitar playing.&lt;ref name=&quot;onstagemag.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm &quot;Rush Rolls Again&quot;, September 2002, OnStage Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
The bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, although Lifeson has contributed to a body of work outside of the band as well. Aside from music, Lifeson is part owner of the Toronto restaurant [[The Orbit Room]], and is a licensed aircraft [[Aviator|pilot]].&lt;ref name = &quot;vdtsgn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alex Lifeson Biography |url=http://www.2112.net/xanadu/ |publisher=2112.net |accessdate=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his bandmates [[Geddy Lee]] and [[Neil Peart]], Lifeson was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] on May 9, 1996.  The trio was the first rock band to be so honoured, as a group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/rus/bio.asp &quot;Rush highlights&quot;], [[MapleMusic]] (accessed May 23, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Lifeson and the rest of the band recently began the 2nd leg of their [[Time Machine Tour]], which began March 30, 2011 in [[Ft. Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]. The tour is expected to be completed in July.  

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lifeson was born Aleksandar Živojinović in [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]], [[British Columbia]] to [[Serb]]ian immigrants, Nenad and Milka Zivojinovich (from [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Живојиновић, ''Živojinović''), and raised in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name = &quot;vdtsgn&quot; /&gt; His assumed stage name of &quot;Lifeson&quot; is a semi-literal translation of the name &quot;Zivojinovich&quot;, which means &quot;son of life&quot; in Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;Horizon to Horizon [http://rush.robpagano.com/index.php?c=alex Rob Pagano's Rush Music Tribute] Accessed October 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His first exposure to formal music training came in the form of the [[viola]], which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jimmy Page]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson profile [http://www.epiphone.com/news.asp?NewsID=137 Epiphone] Accessed 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer [[John Rutsey]] in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.

Lifeson recalls what inspired him to play guitar in a 2008 interview:

{{quote|My brother-in-law played flamenco guitar.  He lent his guitar to me and I grew to like it.  When you're a kid, you don't want to play an accordion because it would be too boring.  But your parents might want you to play one, especially if you're from a Yugoslavian family like me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inquirer with Alex Lifeson|author=Joe Lalaina
|year=2008|journal=Guitar Legends}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lifeson's first girlfriend, Charlene, gave birth to their eldest son, Justin, in October 1970, and they married in 1975. Their second son, Adrian, who is also involved in music, performed on two tracks from Lifeson's 1996 solo project, ''Victor''.

===Rush===
Lifeson's neighbour [[John Rutsey]] began experimenting on a rented drum kit and, in early 1968, Lifeson and Rutsey formed The Projection, which eventually became Rush following the recruitment of original bassist/vocalist [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]]. [[Geddy Lee]] assumed this role soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banasiewicz  |first=Bill |title=Rush Visions: The Official Biography |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=1990 |isbn= 0-7119-1162-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instrumentally, Lifeson is regarded as a guitarist whose strengths and notability rely primarily on signature riffing, electronic effects and processing, unorthodox chord structures, and a copious arsenal of equipment used over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson profile [http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/bios/Lifeson.shtml Dinosaur Rock God] Accessed 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson minor overview [http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=13124 Guitar Player]  Accessed 16 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson Archive [http://www.rusharchives.com/rush-gear/alex-lifeson/ Alex Lifeson Archive and equipment] Accessed 16 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his esteem, however, Lifeson is often regarded as being overshadowed by his bandmates due to Lee's on-stage multi-instrumental dexterity and Peart's status as a drummer.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson profile [http://www.allclassical.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=MIW030603310631&amp;sql=11:ghdayl7jxpnb~T1 All Classical] Accessed 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Rush was on hiatus for several years starting in 1997 owing to personal tragedies in Neil Peart's life, and Lifeson had not picked up a guitar for at least a year following those events.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammond |first=Shawn |title=Back in the limelight: Alex Lifeson and Rush reignite after a five-year hiatus |journal=Guitar Player |volume=38 |issue=8 |month=August |year=2002 |publisher=New Bay Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after some work in his home studio and on various side projects, Lifeson returned to the studio with Rush to begin work on 2002's ''Vapor Trails''. ''Vapor Trails'' is the first Rush album since the 1970s to lack keyboards—as such, Lifeson used over 50 different guitars in what [[Shawn Hammond]] of ''Guitar Player'' called &quot;his most rabid and experimental playing ever.&quot; Geddy Lee was amenable to leaving keyboards off the album due in part to Lifeson's ongoing concern about their use. Lifeson's approach to the guitar tracks for the album eschewed traditional guitar riffs and solos in favor of &quot;tonality and harmonic quality.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;

During live performances, he is still responsible for cuing various guitar effects, the use of bass-pedal synthesizers and backing vocals.

===''Victor''===
While the bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, Lifeson's first major outside work was his solo project, ''[[Victor (album)|Victor]]'', released in 1996. ''Victor'' was attributed as a self-titled work (i.e. ''Victor'' is attributed as the ''artist'' as well as the ''album title''). This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson's name.

===Side projects===
Lifeson has also contributed to a body of work outside of his involvement with the band in the form of instrumental contributions to other musical outfits. He made a guest appearance on the [[Platinum Blonde (band)|Platinum Blonde]] album ''[[Alien Shores]]'' (1985) performing guitar solos on the songs &quot;Crying Over You&quot; and &quot;Holy Water&quot;. Later, in 1990, he appeared on [[Lawrence Gowan]]'s album, ''Lost Brotherhood'' to play guitar. In 1995, he guested on two tracks on [[Tom Cochrane]]'s ''[[Ragged Ass Road]]'' album and then in 1996 on [[I Mother Earth]]'s &quot;Like a Girl&quot; from the ''[[Scenery and Fish]]'' album. In 2006, Lifeson founded The [[Big Dirty Band]], which he created for the purpose of providing original soundtrack material for ''[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie]]''. Lifeson [[Jam session|jammed]] regularly with The Dexters ([[The Orbit Room]] house band from 1994 to 2004). Recently, Lifeson made a guest appearance on the 2007 album ''[[Fear of a Blank Planet]]'' by UK progressive rock band, [[Porcupine Tree]], contributing a solo during the song 'Anesthetize'. He also appears on the 2008 album ''[[Tiles (band)#About &quot;Fly Paper&quot;|Fly Paper]]'' by Detroit progressive rockers, [[Tiles (band)|Tiles]]. He plays on the track &quot;Sacred and Mundane&quot;. Outside of band related endeavors, Lifeson composed the theme for the first season of the science-fiction TV series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]''. He also produced 3 songs from the album ''[[Away from the Sun]]'' by [[3 Doors Down]].

===Television and film appearances===
Lifeson made his film debut as himself under his birth name in the 1972 Canadian documentary film ''Come on Children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|269104|Come on Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2003 episode of the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[mockumentary]] ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'', titled &quot;[[Closer to the Heart]]&quot;, Lifeson plays a partly fictional version of himself. In the story, he is kidnapped by [[Robb Wells|Ricky]] and held as punishment for his inability (or refusal) to provide the main characters with free tickets to a Rush concert. In the end of the episode, Alex reconciles with the characters, and performs a duet of &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; with [[Mike Smith (actor)|Bubbles]] at the trailer park. In 2006, Lifeson appeared in ''[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie]]'' as a traffic cop in the opening scene and in 2009 he appeared in their follow up movie, ''[[Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day]]'', as an undercover vice cop in drag.

In 2008, Lifeson and the rest of Rush played &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; at the end of an episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. According to Colbert, this was their first appearance on American television as a band in 33 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/176340/july-16-2008/rush Colbert Nation: Rush - Wednesday July 16, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he and the rest of the band appeared as themselves in the comedy ''[[I Love You, Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Manohla Dargis, [http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/movies/20love.html?ref=movies Best Man Wanted. Must Be Rush Fan], [[The New York Times]], March 20, 2009 (accessed March 31, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Lifeson appeared in the independent Canadian film [[Suck (film)|Suck]] playing the role of an American border guard who initially tries to make trouble for the band members as they are trying to enter the US. Upon hearing that they are a band his attitude changes, he mentions that he was also in a band once, and lets them enter while saying &quot;Rock On&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 2010, Lifeson appeared in ''[[The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Fun Time Hour]]'', a new series from the ''Trailer Park Boys'' team.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/the-boys-are-back-this-time-on-drugs/article1637258/ &quot;The Boys are back and on drugs&quot;]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', July 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Naples incident===
On [[New_Year's_Eve#United_States|New Year's Eve]] 2003, Lifeson, his son, and his daughter-in-law were arrested at the [[Ritz-Carlton]] hotel in [[Naples, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Rush - Official Website [http://www.rush.com/low/viewStory.php?id=61] Accessed June 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Lifeson, after intervening in an altercation between his son and police, was accused of assaulting a sheriff's deputy in what was described as a drunken brawl. In addition to suffering a broken nose at the hands of the officers, Lifeson was [[tase]]d six times.  His son was also tased repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCDsf81IP_g] Accessed December 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2005, Lifeson and his son agreed to a plea deal with the local [[prosecutor]] for the [[State's Attorney]] office to avoid jail time by pleading [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to a first-degree [[misdemeanor]] charge of resisting arrest without violence.&lt;ref&gt;WBBH-TV 2, Naples (NBC) via YouTube [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvC8kMdwM] Accessed June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the plea agreement Lifeson and his son were each sentenced to 12 months of probation with the adjudication of that probation suspended. Lifeson acknowledged his subsequent legal action against both the Ritz-Carlton and the Collier County Sheriff's Department for &quot;their incredibly discourteous, arrogant and aggressive behaviour of which I had never experienced in thirty years of travel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rush - Official Website [http://www.rush.com/low/viewStory.php?id=62] Accessed June 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although both actions were initially dismissed in April 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Billboard News [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571111]  Accessed October 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; legal claims against the Ritz-Carlton were reinstated upon appeal, and ultimately settled out of court in August 2008, with Lifeson and his son agreeing to a confidential settlement from Ritz-Carlton.&lt;ref&gt;Naples Daily News [http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/aug/22/ritz-carlton-settles-lawsuit-rush-guitarists-son/] Accessed August 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his journal-based book ''Roadshow'', Peart relates the band's perspective on the events of that New Year's Eve.

==Guitar equipment==
[[Image:Alex Lifeson5.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Alex Lifeson playing his Garrison GD25-12 guitar]]
In Rush's early career, Lifeson used a [[Gibson ES-335]] for the first single and the first four Rush studio albums. For the 2112 tour, he used a 1974 [[Gibson Les Paul]] and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] amplification.  For the ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' sessions, Lifeson began using a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] for songs like &quot;[[Xanadu (Rush song)|Xanadu]]&quot; and his main guitar became a personally customized white [[Gibson ES-355]]. During this period Lifeson used [[Hiwatt]] amplifiers. For effects Lifeson used various [[phaser (electronics)|phaser]] and [[flanger (music)|flanger pedals]], a Cry Baby Wah Wah, along with Marshall 100 watt Super Lead amplifiers and 4x12 cabinets. Beginning in the late 1970s, he increasingly incorporated [[twelve-string guitar]] (acoustic and electric) and used a Boss CE-1 Chorus Ensemble and later, the Boss Dimension C.

By 1982 Lifeson's primary guitar was a modified [[Fender Stratocaster]] with a [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]] high-output [[humbucker]] L-500 in the bridge position and a [[Floyd Rose]] vibrato bridge. Lifeson increasingly relied on a selection of four identically modified Stratocasters from 1980 to 1986, all of them equipped with the Floyd Rose bridge. As a joke, he called these Hentor Sportscasters - a made-up name inspired by Peter Henderson's name, who was the producer of [[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/GUPtourbook.htm Grace Under Pressure Tourbook]&lt;/ref&gt; For the Moving Pictures and Signals albums, and on concurrent tours, Lifeson used up to four rare Marshall 4140 Club &amp; Country 100W combo amps. In the mid 1980s Lifeson switched from vacuum tube to solid-state amplification, all with an increasingly thick layer of [[digital signal processing]]. He became an endorser of [[Gallien-Krueger]] and [[Dean Markley]] solid-state guitar amplifier lines and Dean Markley Blue Steel strings respectively, gauges .009-.046. In the late 1980s he switched to [[Carvin A&amp;I|Carvin]] amplifiers in the studio. By 1987, Lifeson exclusively switched to using his [[Signature Guitar Co]] brand guitars onstage and in the studio. These guitars were most noted for generating his unique sound through the use of Evans single coil pickups wired to an onboard active preamp circuit. This enabled him to produce higher frequencies to &quot;cut through&quot; the heavy use and sounds of Geddy Lee's keyboards.

Lifeson primarily used [[PRS Guitars|PRS]] guitars during the recording of ''[[Roll The Bones]]'' in 1990/1991.  When recording 1993's ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'', Lifeson continued to use PRS Guitars and Marshall amplifiers to record the album, and for the subsequent tour. Lifeson continued to use PRS along with Fender and Gibson guitars, [[Hughes &amp; Kettner]] Triamp MK II and zenTera amplifiers and cabinets.

In 2005, Hughes &amp; Kettner introduced an Alex Lifeson signature series amplifier with $50 from each amplifier sold will be donated to [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alex Lifeson |url=http://www.hughes-and-kettner.com/user.php?mode=1&amp;id=1 |publisher=Hughes &amp; Kettner |accessdate=December 10, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alex Lifeson.jpg|Right|thumb|180px|Alex Lifeson playing his [[Gibson Les Paul]] in the 'Heritage Cherry Sunburst'. This guitar has been modified to incorporate a [[Floyd Rose]] tremolo.]]

For the 2007 [[Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour]], Lifeson replaced his PRS Guitars with [[Gibson Les Paul]]s. In a 2007 interview for Guitarist magazine, Lifeson states &quot;I hear PRS on everything these days and I wanted a little bit of a change ... I love them [PRS] but they have a smaller sound than the bigger heavier Gibsons ... I just wanted to be more traditional.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} He has ''Fishman Aura'' [[Pick up (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|piezoelectric pickup systems]] installed in his Les Pauls to model acoustic guitar sounds without changing guitars. As of July 2008, Lifeson uses Floyd Rose tremolos on his main Les Pauls. He has also replaced his Hughes &amp; Kettner zenTera amp heads with Switchblade heads (which, like the zenTeras, include built-in programmable digital effects, such as [[chorus effect|chorus]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], but use [[guitar amplifier#Vacuum tube amplifiers|vacuum tubes]] instead of [[guitar amplifier#Solid-state amplifiers|transistors]]) for the amplification circuits, while retaining his signature series H&amp;K Triamp heads. His effects for the 2007 tour include a [[TC Electronic]] G-Force rack multi-FX, a TC Electronic 1210 spatial expander and a Loft 440 Delay Line/Flanger, as well as the effects built into his Switchblade heads.

==Other instruments played==
In addition to traditional stringed instruments such as acoustic and electric guitars, Lifeson has also played [[mandola]], [[mandolin]] and [[bouzouki]] on recent Rush studio albums, including ''[[Test for Echo]]'', ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' and ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows]]''. During live Rush performances, Lifeson uses a [[MIDI controller]] that enables him to use his feet to trigger sounds from [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]], without taking his hands off his guitar. (Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were obsolesced and replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound &quot;events&quot; that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).&lt;ref name=&quot;onstagemag.com&quot; /&gt; It is with this technology that Lifeson and his bandmates are able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity that fans have come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.&lt;ref&gt;Peart, Neil [http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/peartbscpresto.htm Rush Backstage Club Newsletter, March 1990, via &quot;Power Windows&quot; Rush Fan Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ArgoUML''' is an [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagramming application written in Java and released under the [[open source]] [[Eclipse Public License]].  By virtue of being a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application, it is available on any platform supported by Java.

ArgoUML does not yet completely implement the UML standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://argouml.tigris.org/documentation/umlsupport/index.html | work = ArgoUML documentation | title = UML Specification Incompatibility list }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ArgoUML was originally developed at [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] by Jason E. Robbins, leading to his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] It is now an open source project hosted by [[Tigris.org]]. The ArgoUML project now includes more than 19,000 registered users and over 150 developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isr.uci.edu/tech-transition.html | title = Tech Transitions at ISR UCI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ArgoUML won the Software Development Magazine's annual Readers' Choice Award in the “Design and Analysis Tools” category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ddj.com/architect/184414997#designtools | title = Dr. Dobb's Readers' Choice Awards, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ArgoUML development has suffered from lack of manpower. For example, ''Undo'' has been a perpetually requested feature since 2003 but has not been implemented yet.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Features==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
*All 9 UML 1.4 diagrams supported though not yet implemented. Only class diagram and use-case diagrams are more or less fully implemented.
*Closely follows the UML standard.

A '''file archiver''' is a [[computer program]] that combines a number of [[computer file|files]] together into one [[archive file]], or a series of archive file, for easier transportation or storage. Many file archivers employ [[archive format]]s that provide [[lossless data compression]] to reduce the size of the archive which is often useful for transferring a large number of individual files over a high latency network like the Internet.

The most basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into the archive. In addition the archive must also contain some information about at least the names and lengths of the originals, so that proper reconstruction is possible. Most archivers also store [[metadata]] about a file that the [[operating system]] provides, such as timestamps, ownership and access control.

The process of making an archive file is called ''archiving'' or ''packing''. Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed ''unarchiving'', ''unpacking'' or ''extracting''.

==Discussion==
===Unix Archiver Tools===
Unlike integrated archival and compression tools like [[PKZIP]], [[WinZip]], and [[WinRAR]], the [[Unix]] tools '''[[ar (Unix)|ar]]''', [[tar (file format)|tar]], '''[[cpio]]''' (for &quot;archiver&quot;, &quot;tape archiver&quot; and &quot;copy in/out&quot; respectively) act as archivers but not compressors. Users of the Unix tools typically add compression by compressing the result of packing (and uncompressing before unpacking), most often using the [[gzip]] or [[bzip2]] programs. Modern tar programs can automatically invoke a (de)compression program, giving the appearance that tar itself handles compression and decompression.

This approach has two advantages:

*It follows the [[Unix philosophy|Unix toolbox]] concept that each program should accomplish a single, well-done task, as opposed to attempting to accomplish everything with one tool. As compression technology progresses, users may use different compression programs without having to modify or abandon their archiver.
*The archives use [[solid compression]]. Unlike an archiver that compresses each file in isolation, an archiver that combines files before compressing them can exploit redundancy across several archived files.

Solid compression does have disadvantages as compared with compressing within the archive:

*Extracting one file requires decompressing all the files that are before the file in the archive.  This may take many minutes for a large archive.
*Modification is even more inconvenient than extraction - just changing a single character of one of the archived files will typically require that the entire archive be uncompressed, updated, and then recompressed.
*It's impossible to take advantage of redundancy between files unless the compression window is larger than the size of an individual file. For example, gzip uses [[DEFLATE]], which typically operates with a 32768 byte window, whereas bzip2 uses a [[Burrows-Wheeler transform]] roughly 30 times bigger.

'''Artemis''' was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/10000women/article.cfm?articleid=6226 |title=Project Artemis in Arizona: Training and Transformation for Women Afghan Leaders |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the name, and indeed the goddess herself, was originally pre-Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, H. J. ''A Handbook of Greek Mythology'', Dutton 1959, p. 112; Guthrie, W. C. K. ''The Greeks and Their Gods'', Beacon 1955, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Homer refers to her as ''Artemis Agrotera, [[Potnia Theron]]'' &quot;Artemis of the wildland, Mistress of Animals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad xxi 470 f.&lt;/ref&gt; In the classical period of [[Greek mythology]], Artemis ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ([[nominative]]) {{polytonic|Ἄρτεμις}}, ([[genitive]]) {{polytonic|Ἀρτέμιδος}}) was often described as the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin sister of [[Apollo]]. She was the Hellenic goddess of the [[Hunting|hunt]], [[Wildlife|wild animals]], [[wilderness]], [[childbirth]], [[virginity]] and young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hammond&quot;&gt;“Her proper sphere is the earth, and specifically the uncultivated parts, forests and hills, where wild beasts are plentiful&quot; Hammond and Scullard (editors), ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary''. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970) 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[deer]] and the [[Cupressus|cypress]] were sacred to her. In later Hellenistic times, she even assumed the ancient role of [[Eileithyia]] in aiding childbirth.

Artemis later became identified with [[Selene]],&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 970-971.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Titan (mythology)|Titaness]] who was a Greek moon goddess, sometimes depicted with a crescent moon above her head. She was also identified with the Roman goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]],&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] goddess [[Artume]], and with the Greek or [[Caria]]n goddess [[Hecate]].&lt;ref&gt;“Artemis is very often identified with foreign goddesses of a more or less similar kind,” notes Hammond, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
A hypothesis connects Artemis to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''h₂ŕ̥tḱos'' meaning &quot;bear&quot; due to her cultic practices in [[Brauronia#Cult of Artemis Brauronia|Brauronia]] and the [[Neolithic]] remains at the [[Akrotiri (Crete)#Logistics|Arkouditessa]]. Though connection with [[Anatolia]]n names has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;Campanile, ''Ann. Scuola Pisa'' '''28''' :305; Restelli, ''Aevum'' '''37''' :307, 312.&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed, as from a &quot;common-gender term for ''bear'' in Hittite&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Edwin L. Brown, &quot;In Search of Anatolian Apollo&quot;, ''Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A. Immerwahr'', ''Hesperia Supplements'' '''33''' (2004:243-257) p. 251: Artemis, as Apollo's inseparable twin, is discussed pp. 251ff.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest attested form of the name ''Artemis'' is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''a-ti-mi-te'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script at [[Pylos]].&lt;ref&gt;John Chadwick and Lydia Baumbach, &quot;The Mycenaean Greek Vocabulary&quot; ''Glotta, '''41'''.3./4. (1963:157-271) p. 176f, ''s.v.'' Ἂρτεμις, ''a-te-mi-to-'' (genitive); C. Souvinous, &quot;A-TE-MI-TO and A-TI-MI-TE&quot;, ''Kadmos'''''9''' 1970:42-47; T. Christidis, &quot;Further remarks on A-TE-MI-TO and A-TI-MI-TE&quot;, ''Kadmos'' '''11''' :125-28;   [http://www.palaeolexicon.com Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages;&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis was venerated in [[Lydia]] as ''Artimus''.&lt;ref&gt;''Indogermanica et Caucasica: Festschrift fur Karl Horst Schmidt zum 65. Geburtstag'' (Studies in Indo-European language and culture), W. de Gruyter, 1994, ''Etyma Graeca'', pp. 213-214, on [http://books.google.com/books?id=P3vb4KDB_UkC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=lydian+artimus&amp;ei=QpsNTOjcC5bCzQSXlpXeCw&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=lydian%20artimus&amp;f=false Google books]; Houwink ten Cate, ''The Luwian Population Groups of Lycia and Cilicia Aspera during the Hellenistic Period'' (Leiden) 1961:166, noted in this context by Brown 2004:252.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more traditional etymology within [[Ancient Greek]], the name has been related to &quot;ἀρτεμής&quot; (''artemes''), &quot;safe&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rtemh%2Fs ἀρτεμής], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', On Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;ἄρταμος&quot; (''artamos'') &quot;a butcher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frtamos ἄρταμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', On Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29%2Fartemis Ἄρτεμις],

==Artemis in mythology==
===Birth===

[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|right|upright| ''Apollo (left) and Artemis''. [[Brygos]] (potter, signed), [[Briseis Painter]], Tondo of an Attic red-figure cup, ca. 470 BC, Louvre.]]

Various conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology of the birth of Artemis and her twin brother, Apollo. All accounts agree, however, that she was the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]] and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.

An account by [[Callimachus]] has it that Hera forbade Leto to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island. Hera was angry with Zeus, her husband, because he had impregnated Leto. But the island of [[Delos]] (or [[Ortygia]] in the [[Homeric Hymn|Homeric Hymn to Artemis]]) disobeyed Hera, and Leto gave birth there.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond. ''Oxford Classical Dictionary.'' 597-598.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at [[Phaistos]] and in Cretan mythology Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis at the islands known today as the [[Paximadia (islands)|Paximadia]].

A ''[[scholium]]'' of [[Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'' iii. 72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia&lt;ref&gt;Or as a separate island birthplace of Artemis— &quot;Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, the lord Apollon and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and him in rocky Delos,&quot; says the [[Homeric Hymn]]; the etymology ''Ortygia'', &quot;Isle of Quail&quot;, is not supported by modern scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; by asserting that Zeus transformed Leto into a [[quail]] (''ortux'') in order to prevent Hera from finding out his infidelity, and Kenneth McLeish suggested further that in quail form Leto would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth McLeish, ''Children of the Gods'' pp 33f; Leto's birth-pangs, however, are graphically depicted by ancient sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo. Most stories depict Artemis as born first, becoming her mother's mid-wife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.

===Childhood===
[[File:Artemis Kephisodotos Musei Capitolini MC1123.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Roman marble ''Bust of Artemis'' after [[Cephisodotus the Elder|Kephisodotos]] ([[Musei Capitolini]]), Rome]]

The childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth. The ''[[Iliad]]'' reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by [[Hera]], climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' xxi.505-13;&lt;/ref&gt; A poem of [[Callimachus]] to the goddess &quot;who amuses herself on mountains with archery&quot; imagines some charming vignettes:  according to Callimachus, at three years old, Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her six wishes: to remain always a virgin; to have many names to set her apart from her brother [[Apollo]]; to be the '''Phaesporia''' or Light Bringer; to have a bow and arrow and a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt; to have sixty &quot;daughters of [[Okeanos]]&quot;, all nine years of age, to be her choir; and for twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested. She wished for no city dedicated to her, but to rule the mountains, and for the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisMyths.html#Childhood Hymn Around Artemis' Childhood]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artemis believed that she had been chosen by [[Moirae|the Fates]] to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/other/artemis.html On-line English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; All of her companions remained virgins and Artemis guarded her own chastity closely. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, Hymn III to Artemis 46&lt;/ref&gt; how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress,  how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of [[Lipari|Lipara]], where [[Hephaestus]] and the [[Cyclops]] worked. Okeanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows. Callimachus then tells how Artemis visited [[Pan (god)|Pan]], the god of forest and he gave her seven bitches and six dogs. She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot. Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.&lt;!--where are all these vignettes/--&gt;

===Wooing the Goddess===
As a young virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but none of them successfully won her heart, except her hunting companion Orion, who was then accidentally killed either by the goddess herself or by Gaia.

[[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheus]], a river god, was in love with Artemis, but he realized that nothing he could do would win her heart. So he decided to capture her. Artemis who was with her companions at Letrenoi, went to Alpheus, but suspicious of his motives, she covered her face with mud so the river god would not recognize her. Another story involving the god is the story where he tried to rape Artemis' attendant [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]]. The goddess felt pity for her and saved her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, [[Artemis Alphaea]] in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.

Bouphagos, the son of the Titan Iapetos, saw Artemis and had a thought of raping her. Detecting his sinful thoughts Artemis struck him at Mount Pholoe.

Sipriotes was a boy who, either because he accidentally saw Artemis bathing or attempted to rape her, was turned into a girl by the goddess.

===Actaeon===
Artemis was once bathing in a vale on Mount [[Cithaeron]], when the Theban hunter [[Actaeon]] stumbled across her. Enraged, Artemis turned him into a stag and, not knowing their own owner, Actaeon's own dogs killed him.

===Adonis ===
[[File:Giuseppe-Mazzuoli-The-Death-of-Adonis-hermitag.jpg|thumb|150px|''The Death of Adonis'', by [[Giuseppe Mazzuoli (1644-1725)|Giuseppe Mazzuoli]], 1709 - ''[[Hermitage Museum]]'']]
In some versions of the story of [[Adonis]], who was a late addition to Greek mythology during the Hellenistic period, Artemis sent a [[Boar|wild boar]] to kill Adonis as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than she.

In other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge. In later myths, Adonis had been related as a favorite of [[Aphrodite]], and Aphrodite was responsible for the death of [[Hippolytus (mythology)#Hippolytus as Virbius|Hippolytus]], who had been a favorite of Artemis. Therefore, Artemis killed Adonis to avenge Hippolytus’s death.

In yet another version, Adonis was not killed by Artemis, but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.

===Orion===
[[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] was a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. In some versions of his story he was killed by Artemis, while in others he was killed by a [[Scorpius#Mythology|scorpion]] sent by [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. In some versions, Orion tried to seduce [[Opis]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Another name for Artemis herself&quot;, [[Karl Kerenyi]] observes, ''The Gods of the Greeks'' (1951:204).&lt;/ref&gt; one of her followers, and she killed him. In a version by [[Aratus]],&lt;ref&gt;Aratus, 638&lt;/ref&gt; Orion took hold of Artemis' robe and she killed him in [[self-defense]]. In yet another version, Apollo sent the scorpion. According to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'', ii.34, quoting the Greek poet Istrus.&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as [[Eos]] did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother Apollo, who was &quot;protective&quot; of his sister's maidenhood.

===The Aloadae===
These twin sons of [[Iphidemia]] and [[Poseidon]], Otos and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age. They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other. The growth of the [[Aloadae]] never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and [[Hera]] and take them as wives. The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.

===Callisto===
[[File:Tizian 015.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' by [[Titian]]]]
[[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants. As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity. Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo, gained her confidence, then took advantage of her (or raped her, according to [[Ovid]]). As a result of this encounter she conceived a son, Arcas. Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out of pity, Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the [[Ursa Minor]] and [[Ursa Major]] constellations.

===Iphigenia and the Taurian Artemis===
Artemis punished [[Agamemnon]] after he killed a sacred stag in a [[sacred grove]] and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was preparing at [[Aulis (ancient greece)|Aulis]] to depart for [[Troy]] to begin the [[Trojan War]], Artemis becalmed the winds. The seer [[Calchas]] advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter [[Iphigenia]]. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths have been told around what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there, or became Artemis' immortal companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisFavour.html#Iphigeneia |title=FAVOUR OF ARTEMIS : Greek mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |author=Aaron J. Atsma |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niobe===
A Queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], [[Niobe]] boasted of her superiority to Leto because while she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics,  and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.

=== Chione ===
Chione was a princess of Pokis. She was beloved by two gods, [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]], and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once. Artemis was furious and killed Chione with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue. However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.

===Atalanta, Oeneus and the Meleagrids===
Artemis saved the infant [[Atalanta]] from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her. She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters. But she later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because people said Atalanta was a better hunter. This is in some stories.

Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]], which Artemis had sent to destroy [[Calydon]] because King [[Oeneus]] had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices. In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood, and was awarded the prize of the skin. She hung it in a sacred grove at [[Tegea]] as a dedication to Artemis.

[[Meleager]] was a hero of Aetolia.  King [[Oeneus]] had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the [[Calydonian Boar]].  After the death of [[Meleager]], Artemis turned his grieving sisters, the [[Meleagrids]] into [[guineafowl]] that Artemis loved very much.

===Aura===
In [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Aura does not appear elsewhere in surviving literature and appears to have been offered no [[Cult (religion)|cult]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aura (mythology)|Aura]] was Greek goddess of breezes and cool air, daughter of [[Lelantos]] and [[Periboia]]. She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis, and proud of her maidenhood. One day, she claimed that Artemis' body was too womanly and she doubted her virginity. Artemis asked for [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]' help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by [[Dionysus]]. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer. When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, Iakhos, was saved by Artemis. Iakhos later became an attendant of [[Demeter]] and the leader of [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].

===Trojan War===
Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother [[Apollo]] was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times. In the ''[[Iliad]]''&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' 21.470 ff).&lt;/ref&gt; she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict. Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto gathered up the bow and arrows.

Artemis played quite a large part in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshiped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing Iphigenia, [[Agamemnon]]'s daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke the promise. Other sources{{which?|date=November 2010}} said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth,{{which?|date=November 2010}}, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into [[Hecate]], goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.

[[Aeneas]] was helped by Artemis, Leto, and Apollo. Apollo found him wounded by Diomedes and lifted him to heaven. There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.

==Worship of Artemis==

[[File:Jerash Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|left|''Roman Temple of Artemis'' in [[Jerash, Jordan]], built during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]].]]

{{Main|Brauronia}}

Artemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;“. . . a goddess universally worshiped in historical Greece, but in all likelihood pre-Hellenic.” Hammond, ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Her best known [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] were on the island of [[Delos]]
(her birthplace); in Attica at [[Brauron]] and Mounikhia (near [[Piraeus]]); in [[Sparta]]. She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows, and accompanied by a deer.

The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new [[military campaign]].

[[Athenian festivals]] in honor of Artemis included [[Elaphebolia]], [[Mounikhia]], Kharisteria, and [[Brauronia]]. The festival of [[Artemis Orthia]] was observed in [[Sparta]].

Pre-pubescent Athenian girls and young Athenian girls approaching marriageable age were sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron to serve the Goddess for one year. During this time the girls were known as ''arktoi'', or little she-bears. A myth explaining this servitude relates that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that over time the bear became tame. A young girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth it killed her, while in other versions it clawed her eyes out. Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged. She demanded that young girls &quot;act the bear&quot; at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.

Virginal Artemis was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating [[Ilithyia]], since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin. During the [[classical antiquity|Classical period]] in [[Athens]], she was identified with [[Hecate]]. Artemis also assimilated [[Caryatis]] ([[Carya (goddess)|Carya]]).

=== Epithets ===

As '''Aeginaea''', she was worshiped in [[Sparta]]; the name means either huntress of [[chamois]], or the wielder of the javelin ({{polytonic|αιγανέα}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], iii. 14. § 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |author-link =  |contribution=Aeginaea |editor-last=Smith | editor-first=William |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |page=26 |publisher= |place=Boston |year=1867 |contribution-url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0035.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was worshipped at [[Naupactus]] as '''Aetole'''; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], x. 38. § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;Aetolian Artemis&quot; would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of [[Ozolian Locris]], until it was awarded to the [[Aetolia]]ns by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Strabo records another precinct of &quot;Aetolian Artemos&quot; at the head of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Among the Heneti certain honours have been decreed to Diomedes; and, indeed, a white horse is still sacrificed to him, and two precincts are still to be seen — one of them sacred to the Argive Hera and the other to the Aetolian Artemis. (Strabo, v.1.9 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5A*.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Agoraea]] she was the protector of the [[agora]]. As '''[[Agrotera]]''', she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters. In [[Elis]] she was worshiped as '''[[Artemis Alphaea|Alphaea]]'''. In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local [[Aegina|Aeginian]] goddess, '''[[Aphaea]]'''. As '''[[Potnia Theron]]''', she was the patron of wild animals; [[Homer]] used this title. As '''Kourotrophos''', she was the nurse of youths. As '''Locheia''', she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives. She was sometimes known as '''Cynthia''', from her birthplace on [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on [[Delos]], or '''Amarynthia''' from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in [[Euboea]]. She was sometimes identified by the name '''Phoebe''', the feminine form of her brother Apollo's solar epithet [[Phoebus]].

==Artemis in art==

[[File:Bust of the goddess of Issa, Vis Museum, Croatia.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Fourth century [[Praxiteles|Praxitelean]] bronze head of a goddess wearing a [[lunate]] crown, found at Issa ([[Vis (island)|Vis]], Croatia)]]

The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as ''[[Potnia Theron]]'' (&quot;Queen of the Beasts&quot;): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard in her hands, or sometimes a leopard and a lion. This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as [[Artemis Orthia]], with a sanctuary close by [[Sparta]].

In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt,&lt;ref&gt;Homer portrayed Artemis as girlish in the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow&lt;ref&gt;Greek poets could not decide whether her bow was silver or gold: &quot;Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow.&quot; ([[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis), and it is a golden bow as well in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 1.693, where her nymph's is of horn. &quot;And how often goddess, didst thou make trial of thy silver bow?&quot;, asks [[Callimachus]] for whom it is a [[Cydonia (ancient Greece)|Cydonia]]n bow that the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] make for her (Callimachus, Hymn 3 to Artemis).&lt;/ref&gt; and arrows. Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a [[hunting dog]] or stag. When portrayed as a goddess of the moon, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of [[Niobe]].

Only in post-Classical art do we find representations of Artemis-Diana with the crown of the [[crescent]] [[moon]], as [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]]. In the ancient world, although she was occasionally associated with the moon, she was never portrayed as the moon itself. Ancient statues of Artemis have been found with crescent moons, but these moons are always Renaissance-era additions.

On June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of “Artemis and the Stag” was sold at [[Sotheby’s]] auction house in New York state by the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] for $25.5 million.


===Attributes===

*'''Bow and arrow'''

[[File:Ac artemisephesus.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Remains of the temple today.]]

According to the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was '''Khryselakatos''', &quot;of the Golden Shaft&quot;, and '''Iokheira''' (Showered by Arrows). The arrows of Artemis could also to bring sudden death and disease to girls and women. Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father. The bow of Artemis also became the witness of Callisto's oath of her virginity. In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Bow |title= Bow |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Chariots'''
Artemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer (Elaphoi Khrysokeroi). The bridles of her chariot were also made of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Chariot |title= Chariot|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Spears, nets, and lyre'''
&lt;!-- [[File:Artemis Spear.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=0.56|Artemis With A Hunting Spear, a statue at Venetia. {{deletable image-caption}}]]--&gt;
Although quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear. Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear. The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis{{where?}}, while Artemis with a fishing connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Spears |title= Spears|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fauna====
*'''[[Deer]]'''
Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself. On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred. Deer were also the first animals she captured. She caught five golden horned deer called '''Elaphoi Khrysokeroi''' and harnessed them to her chariot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Chariot |title= Chariot|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Labours of Hercules|third labour of Heracles]], commanded by [[Eurystheus]], consisted in catching the [[Cerynitian Hind]] alive. Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive. Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Kerynitian |title=Kerynitian |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Hunting dog'''
Artemis got her hunting dogs from [[Pan (god)|Pan]] in the forest of Arcadia. Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one - these dogs were able to hunt even lions. Pan also gave Atemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race. However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Pack|title=Pack |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Boar]]'''
The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame. In honor of Artemis' skill, they sacrificed it to her. Oineus and Adonis were both killed by Artemis' boar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisTreasures.html#Animals |title=Animals |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Bear]]'''
The sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started from the Brauron cult. Every year, a little girl age not more than ten and less than five sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. ''Arktos e Brauroniois'', a text by, [[Suidas]], a Byzantine writer, told a legend about a bear that was tamed by Artemis, and introduced to people of Athens. They touched it and played with it, until one day a group of young girls poked the bear which became furious and attacked the girls. One of the girls' brother found out what had happened and killed the bear so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, every young Athenian virgin should not be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/ArtemisCult.html |title=Cult |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Guinea fowl]]'''

==Artemis as ''the Lady of Ephesus''==
{{Main|Temple of Artemis}}
[[File:Statue of Artemis Ephesus.jpg|thumb|right|The Artemis of Ephesus, 1st century AD ([[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]])]]

At Ephesus in [[Ionia]], Turkey, her temple became one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]]. It was probably the best known center of her worship except for Delos. There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' was worshiped primarily as a mother goddess, akin to the Phrygian goddess [[Cybele]], in an ancient sanctuary where her [[cult image]] depicted the &quot;Lady of Ephesus&quot; adorned with multiple rounded breast like protuberances on her chest. They had been traditionally interpreted as multiple [[accessory breast]]s, or as sacrificed bull testes, as some newer scholars claimed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9E04E3DB1130F932A1575BC0A962958260 &quot;In Search of Diana of Ephesus&quot;, ''New York Times'', August 21, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt; until excavation at the site of the ''Artemision'' in 1987-88 identified the multitude of tear-shaped [[amber]] beads that had adorned her ancient wooden ''[[xoanon]]''. In [[Acts of the Apostles]], Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint Paul's preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “''Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!''”&lt;ref&gt;[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 19:28.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of 121 columns still stand in Ephesus. The rest were used for making churches, roads, and forts.

==Artemis in astronomy==

A [[minor planet]], [[(105) Artemis]]; a [[Artemis (crater)|lunar crater]]; the [[Artemis Chasma]] and the [[Artemis Corona]] (both on Venus) have all been named for her.

As [[Selene]] she is associated with the [[Moon]], and as [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] her name was borrowed for a moon of [[Saturn]].

&quot;'''{{lang|de|''Arbeit macht frei''}}'''&quot; ({{IPA-de|ˈaɐ̯baɪt ˈmaxt ˈfʁaɪ}}; literally &quot;work makes free&quot;) is a [[German language|German]] phrase that can be translated as &quot;work will set you free&quot;, &quot;work liberates&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]'', vol.4, p.1751 (Glossary).  [[Yad Vashem]], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;work makes one free&quot;.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gera&gt;{{cite news |last=Gera |first=Vanessa |url=http://www.sltrib.com/ci_14044451 |title=Damaged Auschwitz sign to go back up at main gate |agency=[[The Associated Press]] |publisher=''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan is well-known for being placed at the entrances to a number of [[Nazi concentration camps]], including most infamously [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]], where it was made by prisoners with metalwork skills and erected by order of the Nazis in June 1940. 
&lt;!---NOTE: Please think carefully before changing the English translations, and provide a citation for any alternative translations that you add. ---&gt;

The expression comes from the title of an 1873 novel by German philologist [[Lorenz Diefenbach]], in which gamblers and fraudsters find the path to virtue through labour.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Connolly |first=Kate |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/18/auschwitz-arbeit-macht-frei-sign |title=Poland declares state of emergency after 'Arbeit Macht Frei' stolen from Auschwitz |publisher=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=25 December 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diefenbach&gt;Diefenbach, Lorenz. ''Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach''. J. Kühtmann's Buchhandlung, 1873&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used, in French (&quot;le travail rend libre!&quot;)  by [[Auguste Forel]], a Swiss [[myrmecologist]], [[neuroanatomist]], and [[psychiatrist]], in the 1920 second edition of his &quot;Fourmis de la Suisse&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fourmis de la Suisse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/lesfourmisdelasu00fore#page/n7/mode/2up |title=Les fourmis de la Suisse (2nd Ed.) |first=Auguste |last=Forel |authorlink=Auguste Forel|location=La Chaux-de-Fonds |publisher=Imprimarie cooperative |year=1920 |language=French |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Deutsche Schulverein of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist &quot;protective&quot; organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase ''Arbeit macht frei''. The phrase was adopted in 1928 by the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar government]] as a slogan extolling the effects of their desired policy of large-scale [[public works]] programmes to end unemployment. It was continued in this usage by the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi Party) when it came to power in 1933.

The sign over [[Auschwitz]] was [[Auschwitz concentration camp#&quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; sign theft|stolen in December 2009 and then recovered by authorities in three separate pieces]]. The person behind the theft, a former [[Neo-Nazi]] leader, pleaded guilty on 30 December 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12094855 | work=BBC News | title=Auschwitz sign theft: Swedish man jailed | date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will serve his term in [[Sweden]], and one of the other people involved in the theft is said to have apologised for the action. As a result of the theft and desecration of the sign, the original sign over the Auschwitz entrance has now been permanently replaced with a replica, and the original sign, which has been repaired but will never look the same, is now in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] among other Auschwitz artifacts.

==Use by the Nazis==

[[Image:Auschwitz entrance.JPG|thumb|200px|''Arbeit Macht Frei'' at Auschwitz, with the inverted B]]
[[Image:Theresienstadt.JPG|thumb|200px|''Arbeit Macht Frei'' at concentration camp [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Terezín]] (Theresienstadt) in the Czech Republic]]The slogan &quot;''Arbeit macht frei''&quot; was placed at the entrances to a number of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s. The slogan's use in this instance was ordered by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] General [[Theodor Eicke]], inspector of [[concentration camp]]s and second commandant of [[Dachau Concentration Camp]]. 

The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]]. According to ''Auschwitz: a New History'', by BBC historian [[Laurence Rees]], the sign was placed there by commandant [[Rudolf Höss]]. Höss believed that doing menial work during his own imprisonment under the [[Weimar Republic]] helped him through the experience. At Auschwitz, the sign was made in 1940 by Polish political prisoners headed by [[Jan Liwacz]] (camp number 1010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Liwacz&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Łosińska | first = Ewa | first2 = Piotr |last2=Zychowicz | title = Kto ukradł napis z Auschwitz | newspaper = [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]] | url = http://www.rp.pl/artykul/21,408428.html | date = 19 December 2009 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper bowl in the &quot;[[B]]&quot; in &quot;ARBEIT&quot; is wider than the lower bowl, appearing to some as upside-down. Allegedly it was made on purpose by political prisoners to make a signal about what is really going on in Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liwacz&quot;/&gt; Prisoners in Auschwitz ridiculed the German cynicism of the slogan by saying ''Arbeit Macht Frei durch den Schornstein'' (Work brings freedom through the chimney).&lt;ref name=&quot;Albin&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Zychowicz | first = Piotr | title = Słowa „Arbeit macht frei” były dla nas symbolem piekła | newspaper = Rzeczpospolita | url = http://www.rp.pl/artykul/107684,408427.html | date = 19 December 2009 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan can also be seen at the [[Dachau concentration camp]], [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]], [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]], and the [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt]] Ghetto-Camp, as well as at [[Fort Breendonk]] in [[Belgium]]. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over entrance gates to Auschwitz III / Buna/Monowitz &lt;ref&gt; denis Avey with Rob Broomby 'The Man who Broke into Auschwitz, Hodder and Stoughton, London, 2011 p.236 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Freddie Knoller with Robert Landaw' Desperate Journey', Metro, London, 2002, p.158 &lt;/ref&gt; Primo Levi describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) in Auschwitz III / Buna Monowitz &lt;ref&gt; Primo Levi, trans. Stuart Woolf, 'If This is a Man' Abacus, London, 2004, p.28. &lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], &quot;[[Jedem das Seine]]&quot; (literally, &quot;to each his share&quot;, but idiomatically &quot;everyone gets what he deserves&quot;) was used.  

In 1938 the [[Austria]]n political [[cabaret]] writer [[Jura Soyfer]] and the [[composer]] [[Herbert Zipper]], while prisoners at [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], wrote the ''[[Dachaulied]]'' (The Dachau Song). They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily [[forced labour]], and considered the motto &quot;''Arbeit macht frei''&quot; over the gate an insult. The song repeats the phrase cynically as a &quot;lesson&quot; taught by Dachau.  (The first verse is translated in the article on [[Jura Soyfer]].)

It was said by The Ethical Spectacle about Höss:
:He seems not to have intended it as a mockery, nor even to have intended it literally, as a false promise that those who worked to exhaustion would eventually be released, but rather as a kind of mystical declaration that self-sacrifice in the form of endless labor does in itself bring a kind of spiritual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.org/695/arbeit.html|title=Arbeit Macht Frei|work=Auschwitz Alphabet|publisher=The Ethical Spectacle|accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Axayacatl''' ({{IPA-nah|aːʃaijakatɬ|}} - the name means &quot;Water-mask&quot; or &quot;Water-face&quot;) was a ruler (''[[tlatoani]]'') of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Aztec|Aztec Empire]] and city of [[Tenochtitlán]], who reigned from 1469 to 1481.

He is chiefly remembered for subjugating [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], Tenochtitlán's sister city, in 1473. Using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few Tlatelolcan citizens, he invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, [[Moquihuix]], and replaced him with a military governor. The Tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming Aztec policy. It is also important that the Great Sun Stone, also known as the Aztec Calendar, was carved under his leadership.

He was preceded on the throne by [[Moctezuma I]] and followed by his brother [[Tizoc|Tízoc]] in 1481.

[[Image:AhuitzotlGlyphHarvard.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Aztec writing|glyph]] of Ahuitzotl, from a temple at [[Tepoztlan]].]]
'''Ahuitzotl''' ({{lang-nah|āhuitzotl}}, {{IPA-nah|aːˈwitsotɬ|pron}}) was the eighth  [[Aztec]] ruler, the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'',  of the city of [[Tenochtitlan]].  He was responsible for much of the expansion of the Mexica domain, and consolidated the empire's power after a weak performance by his predecessor.  He took power as [[Tlatoani]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|7 Rabbit]] (1486), after the death of his predecessor [[Tízoc]]. 

Perhaps the greatest known military leader of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], Ahuitzotl began his reign by suppressing a [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] rebellion, and then swiftly more than doubled the size of lands under Aztec dominance.  He conquered the [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], and other peoples from Mexico's [[Pacific coast]] down to the western part of [[Guatemala]].  Ahuitzotl also supervised a major rebuilding of Tenochtitlan on a grander scale including the expansion of the Great Pyramid or [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan|Templo Mayor]] in the year [[Aztec calendar|8 Reed]] (1487).  
Ahuitzotl died in the year [[Aztec calendar|10 Rabbit]] (1502) and was succeeded by his nephew, [[Moctezuma II]].

Ahuitzotl took his name from the animal [[Ahuizotl (creature)|Ahuitzotl]], but it appears the Aztecs thought of it as a creature in its own right, and not merely a mythical beast representing the king.

'''Albinism''' (from [[Latin]] ''albus'', &quot;white&quot;; ''see [[wikt:albino|extended etymology]]'', also called '''achromia''', '''achromasia''', or '''achromatosis''') is a [[congenital disorder]] characterized by the complete or partial absence of [[Biological pigment|pigment]] in the skin, hair and eyes due to absence or defect of an enzyme involved in the production of [[melanin]]. Albinism results from inheritance of [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive gene]] [[alleles]] and is known to affect all [[vertebrate]]s, including [[humans]]. While an organism with complete absence of melanin is called an '''albino''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|l|ˈ|b|aɪ|n|oʊ}}&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com. (2011) &quot;Albino.&quot; Referenced May 11, 2011, from http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/albino&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|n|ə|ʊ}}),&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Dictionary. (2011). &quot;Albino.&quot; Accessed May 11, 2011, from http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/albino&lt;/ref&gt; an organism with only a diminished amount of melanin is described as '''albinoid'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tietz&quot;&gt;Tietz, W. A Syndrome of Deaf-Mutism Associated with Albinism Showing Dominant Autosomal Inheritance. Department of Pediatrics, Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as [[photophobia]], [[nystagmus]] and [[astigmatism]]. Lack of skin pigmentation makes the organism more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers.

==Classification in humans==
&lt;!--[[Image:Chelonia mydas albino p1440273.jpg|thumb|Green turtle (''[[Chelonia mydas]]''), albino{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}&lt;!--looks leucistic.]]--&gt;
There are two main categories of albinism in humans:
* In '''[[oculocutaneous albinism]] Types 1-4 with different levels with pigmentation''' (despite its Latin-derived name meaning &quot;eye-and-skin&quot; albinism), pigment is lacking in the eyes, skin and hair. (The equivalent mutation in non-humans also results in lack of melanin in the fur, scales or feathers.) People with oculocutaneous albinism can have anything from no pigment at all to almost normal levels for a Caucasian.
* In '''[[ocular albinism]]''', only the eyes lack pigment. People who have ocular albinism have generally normal skin and hair color, although it is typically lighter than either parent. Many even have a normal eye appearance. Also, ocular albinism is generally [[sex-linked]], therefore males are more likely to be affected. Males are without another X chromosome to mask recessive alleles on the X they inherit.

Other conditions include albinism as part of their presentation. These include [[Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome]], [[Chediak-Higashi syndrome]], [[Griscelli syndrome]], [[Waardenburg syndrome]], and [[Tietz syndrome]]. These conditions are sometimes classified with albinism.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlILDS - ICD10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ilds.org/icd10_list.php?VIEW=1&amp;START_CODE=E70.3&amp;START_EXT=14 |title=ILDS - ICD10 |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several have sub-types. Some are easily distinguished by appearance, but in most cases genetic testing is the only way to be certain.

Albinism was formerly categorized as [[tyrosinase]]-positive or -negative. In cases of tyrosinase-positive albinism, the [[enzyme]] tyrosinase is present. The [[melanocyte]]s (pigment cells) are unable to produce melanin for any one of a variety of reasons that do not directly involve the tyrosinase enzyme. In tyrosinase-negative cases, either the tyrosinase enzyme is not produced or a nonfunctional version is produced. This classification has been rendered obsolete by recent research.&lt;ref name = &quot;Facts_Albinism&quot;/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Albinistic girl papua new guinea.jpg|thumb|Albinistic girl from [[Papua New Guinea]]]]
Most albinistic humans appear white or very pale as the melanin pigments responsible for brown, black, and some yellow colorations are not present.

Because individuals with albinism have skin that partially or entirely lacks the dark pigment melanin, which helps protect the skin from the sun's [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]], their skin can [[sunburn|burn]] more easily from overexposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Chen, Harold |title=Atlas of genetic diagnosis and counseling |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2006 |pages=37–40 |isbn=1-58829-681-4 |oclc= |doi= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2VcdAXJ_dZkC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Albinism&amp;q=Albinism|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human eye normally produces enough pigment to color the iris and lend opacity to the eye. However, there are cases in which the eyes of an albinistic person appear red or purple, depending on the amount of pigment present. Lack of pigment in the eyes also results in problems with vision, related and unrelated to [[photosensitivity]].

The albinistic are generally as healthy as the rest of the population (but see related disorders below), with growth and development occurring as normal, and albinism by itself does not cause mortality,&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot; /&gt; although the lack of pigment increases the risk of skin cancer and other problems.

===Visual problems===
Development of the optical system is highly dependent on the presence of melanin, and the reduction or absence of this pigment in albinistic individuals may lead to
* Misrouting of the retinogeniculate projections, resulting in abnormal [[decussation]] (crossing) of optic nerve fibres&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;
* [[Photophobia]] and decreased [[visual acuity]] due to light scattering within the eye&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;
* Reduced visual acuity due to [[Macular hypoplasia|foveal hypoplasia]] and possibly light-induced [[retina]]l damage&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;

Eye conditions common in albinism include:
* [[Pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]], irregular rapid movement of the eyes back and forth, or in circular motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;
* Refractive errors such as [[myopia]] or [[hyperopia]] and especially [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Albinism_Diagnosis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carden SM, Boissy RE, Schoettker PJ, Good WV |title=Albinism: modern molecular diagnosis |journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=189–95 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9613388 |pmc=1722467 |doi=10.1136/bjo.82.2.189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amblyopia]], decrease in acuity of one or both eyes due to poor transmission to the brain, often due to other conditions such as [[strabismus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;
* [[Optic nerve hypoplasia]], underdevelopment of the optic nerve

Some of the visual problems associated with albinism arise from a poorly developed [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) due to the lack of melanin.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This degenerate RPE causes foveal hypoplasia (a failure in the development of normal [[fovea]]e), which results in eccentric fixation and lower visual acuity, and often a minor level of strabismus.

The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a [[sphincter]] formed from pigmented tissue that contracts when the eye is exposed to bright light, to protect the [[retina]] by limiting the amount of light passing through the pupil. In low light conditions the iris relaxes to allow more light to enter the eye. In albinistic subjects, the iris does not have enough pigment to block the light, thus the decrease in pupil diameter is only partially successful in reducing the amount of light entering the eye.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Additionally, the improper development of the RPE, which in normal eyes absorbs most of the reflected sunlight, further increases glare due to light scattering within the eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Optometry_Albinism&quot;&gt;[http://www.revoptom.com/HANDBOOK/SECT58a.HTM &quot;Albinism&amp;mdash;Review of Optometry Online&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting sensitivity (photophobia) generally leads to discomfort in bright light, but this can be reduced by the use of sunglasses and/or brimmed hats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts_Albinism&quot;&gt;[http://albinism.med.umn.edu/facts.htm &quot;Facts about Albinism&quot;], by Dr. Richard King et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
Most forms of albinism are the result of the [[biological inheritance]] of [[dominance relationship|genetically recessive]] [[allele]]s ([[gene]]s) passed from both parents of an individual, though some rare forms are inherited from only one parent. There are other [[genetic mutation]]s which are proven to be associated with albinism. All alterations, however, lead to changes in melanin production in the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot;&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic12.htm &quot;Albinism&quot;], by Dr. Raymond E. Boissy, Dr. James J. Nordlund, et al., at [[eMedicine]], 22 August 2005. Retrieved 31 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMIM1&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=omim&amp;term=albinism Online ''Mendelian Inheritance in Man''], at [[Johns Hopkins University]] (see also [[Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] for more information about this source).&lt;/ref&gt;

The chance of offspring with albinism resulting from the pairing of an organism with albinism and one without albinism is low. However, because organisms can be carriers of genes for albinism without exhibiting any traits, albinistic offspring can be produced by two non-albinistic parents. Albinism usually occurs with equal frequency in both genders.&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot; /&gt; An exception to this is ocular albinism, which it is passed on to offspring through X-linked inheritance. Thus, ocular albinism occurs more frequently in males as they have a single X and Y chromosome, unlike females, whose genetics are characterized by two X&amp;nbsp;chromosomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sex-linked_recessive&quot;&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm &quot;Sex-linked recessive&quot;], by Chad Haldeman-Englert, MD, Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different forms of albinism; a partial lack of the melanin is known as hypomelanism, or hypomelanosis and the total absence of melanin is known as [[amelanism]] or amelanosis.

==Diagnosis==
{{Ref improve section|date=November 2007}}
[[Genetic testing]] can confirm albinism and what variety it is, but offers no medical benefits except in the cases of non-OCA disorders (see below) that cause albinism ''along with'' other medical problems which may be treatable. The ''symptoms'' of albinism can be treated by various methods detailed below.

==Treatment==
For the most part, treatment of the eye conditions consists of visual rehabilitation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Surgery is possible on the ocular muscles to decrease [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[strabismus]] and common refractive errors like [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt; Strabismus surgery may improve the appearance of the eyes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]]-damping surgery can also be performed, to reduce the &quot;shaking&quot; of the eyes back and forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Surgical management of nystagmus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee J |title=Surgical management of nystagmus |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=238–41 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11983764 |pmc=1279676 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.5.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of all these procedures varies greatly and depends on individual circumstances. More importantly, since surgery will not restore a normal RPE or foveae, surgery will not provide fine binocular vision.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In the case of [[esotropia]] (the &quot;crossed eyes&quot; form of strabismus), surgery may help vision by expanding the [[visual field]] (the area that the eyes can see while looking at one point).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} &lt;!--citation tagging temporarily stops here--&gt;

[[Glasses]] and other vision aids, [[large-print]] materials and [[CCTV]], as well as bright but angled reading lights, can help individuals with albinism, even though their vision cannot be corrected completely. Some people with Albinism do well using [[bifocals]] (with a strong reading lens), prescription reading glasses, and/or hand-held devices such as [[Magnifying glass|magnifiers]] or [[monocular]]s (a very simple telescope).&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts_Albinism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://albinism.med.umn.edu/facts.htm |title=Facts about Albinism |first=Richard |last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contact lenses]] may be colored to block light transmission through the &lt;!--commenting out unexplained term for now: aniridic--&gt;iris. But in case of nystagmus this is not possible, due to the irritation that is caused by the movement of the eyes. Some use [[bioptics (device)|bioptics]], glasses which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses, so that they can look through either the regular lens or the telescope. Newer designs of bioptics use smaller light-weight lenses. Some [[United States of America|US]] states allow the use of bioptic telescopes for driving motor vehicles. (See also [[NOAH]] bulletin &quot;Low Vision Aids&quot;.)&lt;!--Link that. Where is it?--&gt;

Although still disputed among the experts,{{Who|date=July 2007}} many [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] recommend the use of spectacles from early childhood onward to allow the eyes the best development possible.

===Epidemiology===
Albinism affects people from all races and its frequency across the human population is estimated to be approximately 1 in 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McHugh, Michael P.; MacKenzie, Leslie; David Arwine; Edward J.

In physical terms, humans with albinism commonly have vision problems and need sun protection. But they also face [[society|social]] and [[culture|cultural]] challenges (even threats) as the condition is often a source of ridicule, discrimination, or even fear and violence. Cultures around the world have developed many beliefs regarding people with albinism. This folklore ranges from harmless myth to dangerous superstitions that cost human lives. Cultural challenges can be expected to be vastly higher in areas where pale skin and light hair stand out more from the ethnic majority's average phenotype.

In African countries such as [[Tanzania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7518049.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Burundi]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11614957 | work=BBC News | title=Burundi albino boy 'dismembered' | date=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8057956.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Burundian albino murders denied |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been an unprecedented rise in [[witchcraft]]-related killings of albino people in recent years. This is because albino body parts are used in potions sold by [[witchdoctor]]s. Numerous authenticated incidents have occurred in Africa during the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7726743.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Man 'tried to sell' albino wife |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7527729.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Tanzania albinos targeted again |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-27 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ntetema |first=Vicky |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7523796.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; In hiding for exposing Tanzania witchdoctors |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7730193.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Mothers hacked in albino attacks |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Tanzania, in September 2009, three men were convicted of killing a 14-year-old albino boy and severing his legs in order to sell them for witchcraft purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8270446.stm |title=Death for Tanzania albino killers |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again in Tanzania and Burundi in 2010, the murder and dismemberment of a kidnapped albino child is reported from the courts,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; as part of a continuing problem.

Other examples: In [[Zimbabwe]], belief that sex with an albinistic woman will cure a man of [[HIV]] has led to [[rape]]s (and subsequent HIV infection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=14122|title=RIGHTS-ZIMBABWE: The Last Minority Group to Find a Voice|last=Machipisa|first=Lewis |work=Inter Press Service News Agency|publisher=IPS-Inter Press Service|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain ethnic groups and insular areas exhibit heightened susceptibility to albinism, presumably due to genetic factors (reinforced by cultural traditions). These include notably the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] and [[Zuni people|Zuni]] nations (respectively of [[Panama]] and [[New Mexico]]); [[Japan]], in which one particular form of albinism is unusually common; and [[Ukerewe Island]], the population of which shows a very high incidence of albinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southern-africas-children.org.uk/ukerewe-albino.html|title=Ukerewe Albino Society|last=Anon|year=2009|work=southern-africas-children.org.uk/|publisher=Southern Africas Children|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of people with albinism have become famous, including historical figures such as [[Emperor Seinei]] of Japan, and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] don [[William Archibald Spooner]]; actor-comedian [[Victor Varnado]]; musicians such as [[Johnny Winter|Johnny]] and [[Edgar Winter]], [[Salif Keita]], [[Yellowman|Winston &quot;Yellowman&quot; Foster]], [[Brother Ali]], [[Sivuca]], [[Piano Red|Willie &quot;Piano Red&quot; Perryman]]; and fashion model [[Connie Chiu]].

There have also been some famed albino animals, including [[Migaloo]], a [[humpback whale]] off the coast of Australia; [[Snowflake (albino gorilla)|Snowflake]], a [[gorilla]] from a zoo in [[Barcelona]]; [[Snowdrop]], a [[Bristol Zoo]] [[penguin]]; and an albino buffalo known as [[Mahpiya Ska]] which is Sioux for White Cloud, in Jamestown, ND.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287938,00.html |title=Rare Pink Dolphin Seen in Louisiana Lake - Science News &amp;#124; Science &amp; Technology &amp;#124; Technology News |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2007-07-03 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[sperm whale]] [[Mocha Dick]], the inspiration for [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.

== In other animals ==
Many animals with albinism lack their protective [[camouflage]] and are unable to conceal themselves from their predators or prey; the survival rate of animals with albinism in the wild is usually quite low.&lt;ref name=&quot;survival1&quot;&gt;Ilo Hiler, Albinos. ''Young Naturalist''. The Louise Lindsey Merrick Texas Environment Series, No. 6, pp. 28–31. Texas A&amp;M University Press, College Station (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;survival2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0426.2000.00147.x |doi_brokendate=2010-02-16 |first1=ByS |last1=Dobosz |first2=K. |last2=Kohlmann |first3=K. |last3=Goryczko |first4=H. |last4=Kuzminski |month=July |year=2008 |title=Growth and vitality in yellow forms of rainbow trout |journal=Journal of Applied Ichthyology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=117–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the novelty of albino animals has occasionally led to their protection by groups such as the [[Albino Squirrel Preservation Society]].

In partial albinism there can be a single patch or patches of skin that lack melanin. Especially in [[albinism in birds|albinistic birds]] and reptiles, ruddy and yellow hues or other colors may be present on the entire body or in patches (as is common among pigeons), because of the presence of other pigments unaffected by albinism such as [[porphyrin]]s, [[pteridine]]s and psittacins, as well as [[carotenoid]] pigments derived from the diet.

In some animals albinism-like conditions may affect other pigments or pigment-production mechanisms:
* &quot;Whiteface&quot; a condition that affect some parrot species is caused by a lack of psittacins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesford&quot;&gt;[http://www.birdhobbyist.com/parrotcolour/parblu04.html &quot;The Parblue Puzzle: Part 4&amp;mdash;Common Parblue Varieties: The Cockatiel &amp;#91;''Nymphicus hollandicus''&amp;#93;&quot;] by Clive Hesford, ''The Genetics of Colour in the Budgerigar and Other Parrots'', January 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Axanthism]] is a condition common in reptiles and amphibians, in which [[xanthophore#Xanthophores and erythrophores|xanthophore]] [[metabolism]] is affected rather than [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of melanin, resulting in reduction or absence of red and yellow pteridine pigments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABPC&quot;&gt;[http://www.livingunderworld.org/biology/caudata/ &quot;Amphibian Biology &amp; Physiology: ''Caudata''&quot;] at ''Amphibian Information Resource: An Educational Web Project About Amphibian Species''; sourced December 2006, actual authoring/publication date unspecified.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Leucism]] differs from albinism in that the melanin is, at least, partially absent but the eyes retain their usual color. Some leucistic animals are white or pale because of [[chromatophore]] (pigment cell) defects, and do not lack melanin.
* [[Melanism]] is the direct opposite of albinism. An unusually high level of melanin pigmentation (and sometimes absence of other types of pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance darker than non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feinstein&quot;&gt;[http://www.birdersworld.com/brd/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=676 &quot;Feather Colors: What We See&quot;] by Dr. Julie Feinstein of the American Museum of Natural History (NY), in ''Birder's World Magazine'' online archive; sourced December 2006, actual authoring/publication date unspecified.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intentionally bred albinistic strains of some animal species are commonly used as [[model organism]]s in biomedical study and experimentation, although some researchers have argued that they are not always the best choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Creel D |title=Inappropriate use of albino animals as models in research |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=969–7 |year=1980 |month=June |pmid=7403210 |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(80)90461-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[BALB/c]] mouse and [[Wistar rat|Wistar]] and [[Sprague Dawley rat]] strains, while albino rabbits were historically used for [[Draize test|Draize toxicity testing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Draize&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Draize, J.H., Woodard, G. and Calvery, H.O. | year = 1944 | title = Methods for the study of irritation and toxicity of substances applied topically to the skin and mucous membranes | url =  | journal = J.

The eyes of an albino animal appear red because the colour of the red blood cells in the underlying retinal blood vessels shows through where there is no pigment to obscure it.

'''Amr Abdel Basset Abdel Azeez Diab''' ([[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]: '''عمرو عبد الباسط عبد العزيز دياب'''; born October 11, 1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0229018/bio |title=Bio |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] singer and composer of [[Al Jeel|geel]] music; the contemporary face of Egyptian el-geel pop music, according to ''World Music''. Diab is the best-selling Arab recording artist of all time, according to ''Let's Go Egypt''. He was awarded the [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]] for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist four times: 1998, 2002, 2007 and 2009. He has also sold over 50 million albums worldwide. He is currently the top singer in the Arab world, and considered a living legend by many of his fans in the Arab world.

Amr Diab is known as the Father of Mediterranean Music.{{fact|date=May 2011}} He has created his own style which is often termed &quot;Mediterranean Music&quot; or &quot;Mediterranean Sound&quot;, a blend of Western and Egyptian rhythms.&lt;ref name=tinge&gt;{{cite book |title= Mediterranean mosaic: popular music and global sounds |last= Frishkopf |first= Michael |editor1-first= Goffredo |editor1-last= Plastino |year= 2003 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 9780415936569 |pages= 145–148 |chapter= Some Meanings of the Spanish Tinge in Contemporary Egyptian Music |url= http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~michaelf/Some%20Meanings%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Tinge.pdf |accessdate= June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mediterranean in Music'', David Cooper and Kevin Dawe referred to his music as &quot;the new breed of Mediterranean music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Mediterranean in music: Critical perspectives, common concerns, cultural differences |last= Cooper |first= David |coauthors= Kevin Dawe |year= 2005 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn= 0810854074 |page= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author Michael Frishkopf, Amr Diab has produced a new concept of Mediterranean music, especially in his international hit, &quot;Nour El Ain&quot;.&lt;ref name=tinge/&gt;

In his analysis of ''The Very Best of Amr Diab'' album, Victor W. Valdivia of [[Allmusic]] said: &quot;His music melded traditional Arabic sounds and textures with Western rhythms and instruments. The mesh was dubbed Mediterranean music, and The Very Best of Amr Diab displays Diab's superb skill in creating it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Valdivia | first= Victor W. | title= The Very Best of Amr Diab | url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r565771|pure_url=yes}} | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[BBC]], Diab &quot;has ruled the Arab music world, especially Egypt and the Middle East, since the mid '80s, continually breaking sales records&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= [[JJC]] | first= | coauthors= | title= Ghana's Tic Tac, Nigeria's Ayetoro and Egypt's Amr Diab | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/africabeyond/africaonyourstreet/hosts/jjc/17911.shtml | date= August 2005 | publisher= BBC | accessdate=2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical career ==

In 1983, Diab released his first studio album, ''Ya Tareeq''. Diab released three more albums between 1984 and 1987. 1988's &quot;Mayaal&quot; garnered huge success all around the Middle East. It was produced, arranged and remixed by German musicians, Frank Von Dem Bottlenberg and Jörg Evers, with various releases. More success followed in the following years including the albums ''Shawakkna'', ''Matkhafesh'', and ''We Yloumouni''.

Amr Diab quickly developed fame for his new style of &quot;Pan-Mediterranean&quot; Arabic music, fusing touches of [[flamenco]] and [[raï]] with western pop with traditional Arabic rhythms. By 1992, he became the first Arabic artist to start making high-tech music videos.&lt;ref name=tinge/&gt;

&quot;Habibi&quot; from Diab's 1996 album, ''[[Nour El Ain]]'' became a hit worldwide, and was remixed by many of the world's top DJs at the time.{{fact|date=May 2011}} A special CD named ''Habibi: The Remix Album'' was released later with all of these remixes. Since then, Diab has remained at the top of the Arabic music scene, expanding reach to all parts of the Mediterranean with his 1999 release, ''Amarain'', that featured duets with Algeria's king of rai [[Khaled]] in a song called &quot;Qalbi&quot; and Greece's [[Angela Dimitriou]] in &quot;Ana Bahibak Aktar&quot; and &quot;Eleos&quot;. &quot;Tamally Maak&quot; from Diab's 2000 album became a huge success. ''Leily Nahari'', Diab's first album with [[Rotana Records]], was released in 2004.  Diab's album ''El Leila De'' was released in the summer of 2007 and topped the Arabic music charts for 22 weeks. Diab received a World Music Award for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist for the album. In 2008, Diab renewed his contract with Rotana for five more years.{{fact|date=May 2011}}
In 2009, Diab released a new album ''[[Wayah]]''.

== Influences and contributions ==

Diab revolutionized Egyptian show business in several respects,{{fact|date=May 2011}} and some of his biographers have referred to him as rebellious, because he challenged everything in Middle Eastern show business, from hairstyle and appearance to music style, presentation, and the financial scale of his projects.

Diab’s blending of Western rhythms with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern music styles created a new music style, referred to as Mediterranean music. His song “Tamalli Ma’ak”/“Always With You,” wherein he introduced [[classical guitar]], is a good example of the genre.

== The world's perspective ==

Diab is one of the most popular and acclaimed Arab pop singers of the modern age.{{fact|date=May 2011}} In 1997 he won three awards at the Annual Arabic Festival; one for Best Video, for Best Song, and for Best Artist of the Year. The following year Diab received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of ''[[Nour El Ain]]'' and also received a World Music Award in Monaco.

== Albums ==
=== ''Nour El Ain'' ===

In 1996, ''[[Nour El Ain]]'' (Light of The Eye – Sight) was released, becoming a tremendous success not only in the Middle East but throughout the entire world. The song was composed by [[Nasser el-Mizdawi]], lyrics were written by Ahmed Sheta and it was arranged by Hameed Elshaery. The title track, and its English version &quot;Habibi&quot;, was an international phenomenon, becoming a massive crossover hit in countries such as [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Sri Lanka]] (performed by Sangeeth Wickremasinghe) and [[Malaysia]] ([[Malay language|Malay]] version sung by [[Datuk Sharifah Aini]]). The song was copied and remade with [[Malayalam]] lyrics, a south Indian language, in the Malayalam movie [[Chandralekha (1997 film)|Chandralekha]] staring the South Indian actor [[Mohanlal]]. In a style reminiscent of the [[Aldo (musician)]] Franco-Arabic style, the song was remixed by several top European arrangers and has become a big pull on the dance floors of Europe. The video clip, also [[Film producer|produced]] by Alam El Phan for the song &quot;Nour El Ain&quot;, was one of the most lavish and expensive productions in the field of Egyptian song, and set a new standard for his contemporaries to aspire to. This album sold 3 million copies.
In 1997, Amr Diab won three Awards at the Annual Arabic Festival (for Best Video, Best Song and Artist of the Year). In the following year, he received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of ''Nour El Ain'', and received a [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]] in Monaco on 6 May 1998, under the patronage of H.S.H. Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and attended by [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Céline Dion]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[The Backstreet Boys]], [[Steven Seagal]] and others. This award was the first of its kind for an Egyptian artist, emphasizing that his appeal is not just confined to the Middle East unlike the majority of his contemporaries.

=== ''Awedooni'' ===

His follow-up studio album entitled ''Awedooni'' (they made me used to...) was released in July 1998, and as with ''Nour El Ain'' (the light of the eye) it was [[Record producer|produced]] with [[Hamid El Shaery]] and recorded in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The first video from the album, the title track &quot;Awedooni&quot; (they made me used to...), was shot by the river Nile in Egypt and directed by Tareq Al Aryan. Like its predecessor, this album was a huge success for Amr and reinforced his popularity in the Arab world and abroad.

=== ''Amarain'' &quot;Two Moons&quot; in english ===

Diab released his July 1999 new studio album ''Amarain'' (two moons), which is hailed as the best work of his career to date.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Amr is working on eagerly anticipated duets with the France-based international Rai superstar, [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] of &quot;[[Didi (single)|Didi]]&quot; fame, and with the Greek singer, [[Angela Dimitrou]], whose crossover smash &quot;Marguerites&quot; was a huge hit across the Middle East in 1998. The title track &quot;Amarain&quot; was the first video to be broadcast.

=== ''Tamally Ma'ak'' ===

In 2000, Diab revolutionized Arab music when he issued ''[[Tamally Maak|Tamally Ma'ak]]'' (I'm Always With You). The song was composed by Sherif Tag, a modern Egyptian Composer. He introduced the Spanish guitar in his song &quot;Tamally Ma'ak&quot; and in other songs. The clip of this song was made in the [[Czech Republic]] with much success. The album contained songs like &quot;El Allem Alla&quot; (Only God Knows), &quot;Ba'terf&quot; (I Confess), &quot;Sa'ban Alaea&quot; (It Makes Me Feel Sorry) and &quot;We Heya Amla Eih&quot; (And How Was She?). The song &quot;Tamally Ma'ak&quot; was even copied in the hit [[Bollywood]] song &quot;[[Kaho Na Kaho]]&quot; from the film ''[[Murder (film)|Murder]]''
and also &quot;I'm Calling U&quot; by the group, Outlandish.

=== ''Aktar Wahed'' ===

''Aktar Wahed'' was released on August 1, 2001. The album's name is short for one of the songs, &quot;Aktar Wahed Beyhebbak&quot; (One loves you the most). It contains 10 tracks and received the [[World Music Award]] for the best selling album in the [[Middle East]] for 2001.

=== ''Allem Albi'' ===

In February 2003, Diab released ''[[Allem Alby]]'' (Teach My Heart). The album's release date was arranged to be with the debut broadcast of Alam El Phan's (Allem Alby's production company, owned by Mohsen Gaber) music channel &quot;Mazzika&quot;.

The album was a great success, with the release of the video &quot;Ana Ayesh&quot; (I'm Alive) which was directed by Stuart Gosling. The video was intensely broadcast on Mazzika. The album contains other songs, like the [[Rhythm and Blues|R&amp;B]]-influenced hit, &quot;Allem Albi&quot;. Others that tend to be more distinctively Arabic-sounding are songs like &quot;Kolohom&quot; (All of Them), &quot;Law Ash'any&quot; (If You Adore Me), and &quot;Alli El Wadaa'&quot; (Goodbye To Me).

=== ''Leily Nahary'' ===

In late summer 2004, Diab's first album with [[Rotana]] was released, titled ''[[Leily Nahary]]'' (My Nights, My Days). The album's cover was from the promotional photo shoot of [[Pepsi]]. The video &quot;Leily Nahari&quot; directed by Cameron Casey provided aid to give Diab his space in the record-exclusive music channels. It was criticized because of its similarity to his previously unreleased video for &quot;El Alem Allah&quot; from the album ''Tamally Ma'ak''. This album sold over 1.5 million copies.

=== ''Kammel Kalamak'' ===

Diab's album ''[[Kammel Kalamak]]'', released on December 14, 2005, was the follow up to ''[[Leily Nahary]]''. The album cost a reported $4 million to record, and was Rotana's biggest album of 2005.  The love ballad &quot;We Malo&quot; was released as the single of the album, ''Kammel Kalamak''. The music video was shot in [[London]] and was released on a late notice after the release of the album. Rumors surfaced in late 2005 and early 2006 stated that Amr is considering terminating his contract with [[Rotana]] due to the poor promotion of his latest album, ''[[Kammel Kalamak]]''.

=== ''El Leila De'' (Tonight) ===
The album ''[[El Leila De]]'' was originally set to be released after [[Ramadan]] 2006. However, it was pushed back several times due to Diab's repeated changes in the [[musical producer]]s he was dealing with. Diab attributes the changes to the producer's lack of new and strong styles. In early 2006, Music [[Arranger]] Fahd was supposed to work on this album; however, later that year [[Tarek Madkour]] joined Amr Diab, and they started together to work on it. On March 25, 2007, Madkour's official website announced that Amr Diab and Madkour had decided jointly to skip the collaboration on the album due to the lack of time and conflicting working schedules. Fahd and a new producer called Hasan Al Shafei are elected to produce the music in the album, which is supposed to hit the markets in July 2007. The title of the album was changed from ''Khaleek Ma'aya'' to ''El Leila De''. After the release Amr, shot a new Pepsi advertisement in Europe. On June 21, 2007, two of the biggest sites (AmrDiabWorld.com &amp; AmrDiab.info) for Amr Diab announced that the album, now entitled ''El Lilady'', would hit the market on July 7, 2007. The album would contain 10 tracks; AL Shafei and Fahd shared the production Al Shaei 7 songs &amp; Fahd 3 Songs. Before releasing his album, Diab traveled to Portugal to shoot the new Pepsi ad choosing &quot;Inta El Ghaly&quot; song from his upcoming album ''El Leila De'' as the ad music. Amr then traveled to the USA to film the music video for his upcoming album.

The album master copy was given to Rotana, Amr Diab's CD production company, on the last week of June to meet the July 7, 2007 release date he had planned earlier. Rotana, however, has delayed the release of the new CD for a couple of days for unknown reasons. The album has also been leaked.
The album was officially released on July 11, 2007. The album has already become a huge hit in Egypt and all over the Middle East. The album sold over 1,000,000 copies in only 5 days of release. The video clip has been slated for a July 27 release. The song that Diab chose to film was &quot;N'eoul Eih&quot;, which is in the new style of [[House Music]] mixed with oriental Arabic music. The video clip was filmed in [[Santa Monica]] and [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], and also near [[Hollywood]]. 

On July 27, Rotana News announced that ''El Leila De'' had sold over 5 million copies in less than two weeks in the Middle East, which gives the album a good chance to surpass [[Kammel Kalamak]]'s 3 million copies only. 
On October 30, 2007, the management of the World Music Awards announced that Amr Diab was to receive an award for best selling artist in the Middle East for this album. Amr Diab received the award in the festival that was held in Monaco, Monte-Carlo, on the November 4, 2007.

=== ''Wayah'' (With Her) (2009) ===
the world music award of for the best selling album in the [[Middle East]] 2009
''[[Wayah]]'' (With Her) was released for sale on the internet on June 27; however, the album was leaked online and was downloaded illegally amid complaints of slow download speed on the official site. Diab's fans initiated a massive boycott of the sites with the illegal copies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |coauthors= |title= Amr Diab's album sweeping cassette market |url= http://www.musicananet.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=831:2009-06-30-21-53-47&amp;catid=55:2009-02-18-21-10-52&amp;Itemid=93 |date= June 30, 2009 |publisher= Musicananet |accessdate=2 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} {{ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by July 3, 2009 ''Wayah'' had sold more than 1.5 million copies in the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |coauthors= |title= Amr Diab sales exceed one million and a half |url= http://www.musicananet.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=851:2009-07-03-20-27-58&amp;catid=55:2009-02-18-21-10-52&amp;Itemid=93 |date= July 3, 2009 |publisher= Musicananet |accessdate=2 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} {{ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later on Amr Diab's administration announced that the album has become the highest selling album in Diab's career. This album sold 3 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dubaimoves.com/9944/amr-diab-in-dubai |title= Amr Diab in Dubai | author= Salman | date= April 20, 2010 |publisher= DubaiMoves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2009 Amr Diab won four 2009 African Music Awards in the following categories: best artist, best album, best vocalist and best song for &quot;Wayah&quot; and Amr Diab has been nominated by the Big Apple Music Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://artonline.tv/Entertainment/newsdetails.aspx?newsID=17963 |title= Amr Diab wins four African Music Awards |author= Khaled Taha |date= October 25, 2009 |publisher= [[Arab Radio and Television Network|ART]] |accessdate=2009-10-28 |language=Arabic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Aslaha Betefre''' (2010) ===
Amr Diab has released a mini album for the first time in his career history, produced by Rotana, in July 2010. The mini album contains 1 song with 3 arrangements (Original song + Club Mix + Karaoke).

== Music videos ==
Diab is one of the first singers to popularise music videos in the Arab World, and the first Egyptian singer to appear in music videos.&lt;ref name=tinge/&gt; With the exception of his very early releases, all of his albums have had at least one song shot as a music video. Diab has collaborated with a variety of music video directors in the Middle East, including [[Tarek El-Erian]] and [[Sherif Sabri]]. 

The most anticipated video clip of 2007, ''N'eoul Eih'', was released on August 14 that year on Rotana TV. It was broadcast minutes later on [[Egyptian television]] on &quot;El Beit Betak&quot;.
The video was a great success.

August 6, 2009 witnessed the release of Amr Diab's latest video clip for his smash hit [[Wayah]]. Working alongside Cameron Casey and [Leily Nahari] for a second time, Amr Diab presented a fresh video clip which was filmed mostly on [[Green Screen]] and in Amr Diab's personal villa in Cairo, Egypt. The biggest surprise was the appearance of Amr Diab's children alongside his niece, who represented the younger generation of children who are still inspired by the music of Amr Diab. 

Diab also filmed &quot;Ba2dem Alby&quot; which is set to be released on [[Valentine's Day]].

=== ''El Helm/The Dream'' ===

''The Dream'' or ''El Helm'' is a biographical TV production produced by Amr Afefy that gives viewers the story of Amr Diab's life. The show consists of 12 episodes and began airing on December 24, 2008. ''El Helm'' is narrated by actor Ezzat Abou Ouf and includes interviews with Diab and people he worked with throughout the span of his career. The show, which aired on Rotana TV, saw great success and was preceded by one of the biggest advertising campaigns in the history of Middle Eastern music.

== Film career ==
Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, ''El Afareet'', which was released in 1989. The film also starred [[Madiha Kamel]]. His second film ''Ice Cream in Gleam'' (''Ays Krim fi Glym''), the 1992 movie in which Diab starred, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. The film was also featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program &quot;Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films&quot; at James Bridges Theater, UCLA, April 6, 8 and 10. David Chute of the Los Angeles Weekly termed the film &quot;observant&quot; and &quot;a big leap&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= David |last= Chute |coauthors= Irene G. Behnan |title= All Singing! All Belly-Dancing |url= http://www.laweekly.com/1999-04-08/film-tv/all-singing-all-belly-dancing/2 |work= Los Angeles Weekly |date= April 8, 1999 |accessdate=June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His third movie was released in 1993, and was named ''Deahk We La'ab'' (''Laughter and Fun''). The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star [[Omar Sharif]] (''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[Doctor Zhivago]]'') and [[Yousra]] in the movie. 
Overall, Diab did not experience the same level of success in film that he had with his music career. Since 1993, Diab has focused on his singing career.

In the US version, [[Enrique Iglesias]] takes the role of Caesar. But in the pan Arab version, the four American singers were retained but the male figure was replaced with Diab. This was not the first Pepsi commercial Diab has done; he also filmed commercials featuring his songs &quot;Ana Aktar Wahed&quot; (I'm the most), &quot;Allem Alby&quot; (teach my heart) and &quot;Khad Alby Ma'aa&quot; (She took my heart with her). Diab also appeared in a commercial alongside Jennifer Lopez, singing The Troggs hit &quot;Wild Thing&quot;. In 2009 Pepsi decided not to renew his contract. In 2010 he was the star of &quot;Hayat&quot; bottled water campaign.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Belgian hip hop music''' has a few [[rapper]]s stemming from [[Africa]] and [[Italy]]. [[Belgium]], like [[France]], controlled [[Africa]]n countries like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly Zaire), [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]] until the early 1960s. Like in France, [[Immigration|immigrants]] from these countries started to study and live in [[Belgium]].

The Belgian [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene started in the late 1980s with a U.S.-based [[techno music|techno]]/hip hop group called [[Technotronic]]. In the group was an emcee named [[Ya Kid K]] from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] who later led the group into international fame with hits like &quot;Pump up the Jam&quot; and &quot;Shake That Body&quot;. In 1990, she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' movie [[soundtrack]]. 

However, the first major pop rapper from Belgium was [[Benny B]], who had a very mainstream and commercial sound.  According to the European Music Office's report on ''Music in Europe'', this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/MIE/Part2_chapter08.shtml].

Also in the late 1990s in the [[Wallonia|Walloon south]] of the country, French speaking/rapping [[Starflam]] was the biggest name in hip hop. In the [[Flanders|Flemish]] north Dutch speaking/rapping groups like [['t Hof van Commerce]], Krapoel In Axe, St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional [[dialect]]s.

'''Dutch hip hop''' or '''Nederhop''' is [[hip hop music]] created by musicians in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]].

==Early days==
In 1986, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] rap duo [[MC Miker G &amp; DJ Sven]] (Lucien Witteveen and Sven van Veen) had a top 10 hit across Europe with &quot;Holiday Rap&quot;, which sampled [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] &quot;Holiday&quot;. Another 1980s group was the [[Osdorp Posse]], who first started to record tracks in Dutch. But there is disagreement about who started rapping in Dutch between Blonnie B, Alex and the CityCrew ( Dynamic Rockers, Def Rhymes and Osdorp Posse.

Notable in the late '80s were All Star Fresh of [[King Bee (hip hop group)|King Bee]] topping charts with: &quot;Back by dope demand&quot; in early [[1990 in music|1990]] and Rudeboy of [[Urban Dance Squad]] who, at the time, were arguably more widely known in [[New York City]] than the Netherlands. DJ and Producer All Star Fresh Started as a Pro in 1979 made. After winning the Dutch Mixing Championships (DMC) in 1988, he was invited for The World Mix Championships in the London Royal Hall and won third place in a fierce competition. He was invited by Dave Funkenklein to enter the lions hole in New York. He made history in the Big Apple of Hiphop by being the first non -American to fly into the finals of The World Supremacy Battle of DJs. He gained the highly respected second place of this prestigious DJ contest). The impression that he made that year, resulted in many invitations to perform with world known artists like Public Enemy, Stetsasonic, Ice T and Ultra Magnetic MCs.

All Star Fresh. As performer and producer he is very well known as KING BEE.. With his second floor filler Back By Dope Demand he scored one of the biggest hiphop hits. In the Netherlands it resulted in a Top 3 position. Best Dance Product by The Edison Awards in the Netherlands. (The Edison Awards is an award by the Dutch Music Industry.) This also meant that with this title, he was the first black artist to win this highest to win award in the Netherlands. After that he appeared as supporting act for Madonnas show in the Netherlands. All Star Fresh kept entering the dance floors. The last titles mentioned were also world wide hits, selling over 2.4 million copies. He didnt only work within projects like King Bee or Capella, but also was featuring famous production teams like Snap (I Got the Power). This teamwork resulted in the single Lets Get Busy (Clubland Quarts feat Snap introductin King Bee). This record ended up No 01 in the Billboard Dance Charts (USA). Other productions were Deepzone &gt;It's Gonna Be All right&quot;, a straight up club anthem even until today. Kellee- my love, Ty Holden- you're my Inspiration and His Royal Freshness- They don't understand are a couple of other productions in this line. 

Urban Dance Squad was a Dutch rap rock band formed after what was originally intended as a one-time jam-session at a festival in Utrecht on December 20, 1986[1]. Band members were rapper Rudeboy Remmington (Patrick Tilon), guitarist Tres Manos (René van Barneveld), bassist Sil (Silvano Matadin), drummer Magic Stick (Michel Schoots) and DJ DNA (DoNotAsk) (Arjen de Vreede). The band's music is described as a blend of genres, including hard rock, funk, soul, hip hop, reggae, jazz and ska and is often compared to that of Rage Against the Machine, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone. They are widely known for their hit single &quot;Deeper Shade Of Soul&quot;, which charted at number 21 in the United States on Billboard Hot 100. It os well known fact that Rage Against the Machine was inspired by the Urban Dance Squad.  

In 1992, Osdorp Posse released their debut album ''Osdorp Stijl'', which was the first-ever Dutch hip hop .{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} They started out translating [[N.W.A]] songs to [[Dutch language|Dutch]], though later wrote their own rhymes in Dutch. Their beats, created by producer Seda on Amiga 500 with Protracker, have a familiar heavy sound and are similar to U.S. old-school hip hop. Frontman Def-P describes it as [[hardcore rap]]. In the 17 years of de Osdorp Posse's existence, the crew hasn't changed their style and are still making hardcore hip hop.

==Later days==
After the first Osdorp Posse demo cassette they toured around the Netherlands. In Deventer they found the first followers and the first Dutch language hip hop scene. The first hip hop groups after Osdorp Posse were Zuid-Oost Posse and Maasstraat Mannen. These groups did concerts all over the Netherlands. Maasstraat became famous as the first group combining reggae with Dutch lyrics, inspiring acts like Postmen, for example.

Another Dutch-language rapper is Extince, who in 1995 took Nederhop to a new commercial level. With two of his singles ''Spraakwater'' and ''Kaal of Kammen'' being major hits in the mid-1990s, Extince was the first Dutch rapper making the MegaCharts. Other notable acts include Ali B (who has been featured on other artists' tracks, most significantly with Marco Borsato on the song &quot;Wat zou je doen?&quot; for the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] who achieved solo success with &quot;Leipe mocro flavour&quot;. Together with his cousin Yes-R he made an international remix of &quot;[[Ghetto (Akon song)|Ghetto]]&quot; together with Akon.; the duo Lange Frans &amp; Baas B with their patriotic but introspective &quot;[[Het land van (song)|Het Land Van]]&quot;; and [[Yes-R]]. Other notable groups are &quot;Opgezwolle&quot; (consisting of rapper Sticky Steez, rapper Phreaco Rico and DJ Delic) and Brainpower.

There were two styles dominating the Dutch hip hop landscape: [[Extince]], known for his easy flows, catchy songs and funky tunes, while hardcore performers like [[Westklan]] and [[Osdorp Posse]] found their own niche group of fans.

In the mid 1990s [[The Postmen]] were topping the charts with their rap/[[reggae]] mix.

==Recently==
In the early 2000s the MC fronted band [[Relax (band)|Relax]] got much airplay, as did [[Spookrijders (band)|de Spookrijders]].

A combination of these two styles gave birth to de Spookrijders, a three-man hip-hop group founded in 1996. With MCs Stefan and Clyde rapping about their personal lives and life in Amsterdam as a black man, de Spookrijders even gained respect from non-hip-hop musicians and fans. Most people admired the work of producer/DJ Cliff 'the Jazz' Nille after releasing Spookrijders debut album ''De Echte Shit''. In 1999 de Spookrijders hit the charts twice with the hits &quot;Klokkenluiders&quot; and &quot;Ik ben de man.&quot; Both these songs appeared on the second album, ''Klokkenluiders van Amsterdam''. After some personal arguments among the three crewmembers, de Spookrijders split up in 2003, after releasing their and final third album ''Hee... Spookies!!''

[[Opgezwolle]], a group from [[Zwolle]]'s latest album, ''Eigen Wereld'' (Own World) appeared in the 'Album Top 100' at number 4; the highest notation of a Dutch rap album ever. [[Opgezwolle]] split up on November 30, 2007. Members Rico &amp; Sticks formed a new group, [[Fakkelbrigade]] with [[MC Typhoon]], [[MC James]] and beatmaker [[A.R.T.]]. In 2009, they released the album ''[[Colucci Era]]''.

In the mid 2000s [[Cilvaringz]], [[Ali B]] and [[Raymzter]] have commercially been successful and [[Lange Frans &amp; Baas B]] have had multiple #1 hits. In 2005, [[De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig]] (&quot;The youth of today&quot;) were successful with &quot;[[Watskeburt]]?!&quot; (&quot;Wuzhappenin?!&quot;).

Rapper [[Jawat]] won the &quot;[[Grote prijs van Nederland]]&quot; 2006.

Another Dutch hip-hop duo are [[Pete Philly and Perquisite]] who are already well known in the Netherlands, Germany, and even in Japan.

A famous Dutch rapper outside the Netherlands is Salah Edin. His album ''Nederlands Grootste Nachtmerrie'' won Best Album Award in 2007 and was fully produced by Dr. Dre's right hand man Focus... He also shot three of the most expensive music videos ever in the history of Dutch Hip Hop and through a management deal with [[Cilvaringz]], performed in 34 countries worldwide.

The year 2010 is considered an important year for Dutch hip-hop, with many albums and mixtapes released from the biggest Dutch rappers.

Also [[Mc Battles]] are having a large amount of popularity. The best battle rappers of Holland are [[Altijd Chill]] and [[Surya]].

===Conflicts===
The Dutch hip-hop scene also saw many conflicts between rappers, followed by dis-tracks. The following were the biggest Dutch feuds ever in hip-hop:

T.H.C. Vs Negativ, Kempi Vs Nino, Brainpower Vs Extince, Yukkie B Vs Negativ, T.H.C. Vs Lexxxus, Baas B Vs Kimo, Kempi Vs Mini, Kempi Vs Bloedserieus, Heist Rockah Vs Negativ, and Regga Vs Lexxxus.

The feud between T.H.C. and Lexxxus resulted in a fistfight on a hip-hop event, when T.H.C. frontman rocks got into an argument with Lexxxus and then started the fistfight. Also many Dutch rappers got shot/stabbed, wounding or killing them. Bloedserieus rapper Sane was fatally stabbed at Eindhoven Central Station. Kane (another rapper of Bloedserieus) made a song about this called &quot;Jonko voor Sane&quot; (Joint for Sane). Amsterdam rappers Lexxxus, Flex of T.H.C. and Mr. Probz got shot.

== Genres in Dutch hip hop ==
===Gangsta===
Dutch gangsta hip hop is currently a large scene together with underground hip-hop. Among the most notable groups are [[THC (Dutch band)|THC]], [[Fresku]], [[Heinek'n]], [[Keizer]], [[Kempi]], Steen, Hef, [[Adonis]] and [[Negativ]]. The rhythms are influenced by the [[United States|American]] rap scene, and the [[lyrics]] are often about [[crime]], [[drugs]],money,women and many criminal things.
All coming from Dutch [[Ghetto's]],they say what they see in their area.
Dutch gangsta hip hop mostly comes from [[Amsterdam]], [[den Haag]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Eindhoven]], the most criminal and dangerous cities of Holland.

===Commercial success===
The commercial success of Dutch hip hop is largely made by [[Brainpower]], [[Yes-R]], [[Ali B]], [[Lange Frans &amp; Baas B]] and [[Extince]]. For a large part of the Dutch hip hop community Yes-R, Ali B and Lange Frans &amp; Baas B are sometimes considered fake because they do a lot of work for children TV stations. [[Brainpower]] and [[Extince]] however both enjoy a great respect for bringing up hip hop in their native [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Other commercial rappers are [[De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig]], and one of the more popular artists in the Netherlands, Partysquad or The Partysquad.

===Dutch oldskool===
The Dutch [[Old school hip hop|oldskool]] exists out of three primary artists, [[Osdorp Posse]], [[Extince]] and [[Duvelduvel]]. [[Osdorp Posse]] make to what they themselves call hardcore rap and use beats that have much in common with [[N.W.A.]]. Their lyrics are about [[racism]], [[prostitution]] (not always negatively), [[police]] and other social subjects. Extince uses very different, more funky kind of beats than Osdorp Posse and uses a completely different rapstyle. Duvelduvel is known as a conceptual Hiphopgroup.

'''Anaïs Nin''' ({{IPA-es|anaˈiz ˈnin}}; born '''Angela Anaïs Juana Antolina Rosa Edelmira Nin y Culmell''', February 21, 1903 – January 14, 1977) was a [[French people|French]]-[[Cubans|Cuban]] author, based at first in France and later in the United States, who became famous for her published [[diary|journal]]s, which span more than 60 years, beginning when she was 11 years old and ending shortly before her death. Nin is also famous for her [[erotic literature]] and short stories. A great deal of her work, including ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' and ''[[Little Birds]]'', was published posthumously.

==Early life==
Anaïs Nin was born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]], [[France]], to two artistic parents. Her father, [[Joaquín Nin]], was a Spanish pianist and composer, living in Cuba when he met her mother Rosa Culmell,&lt;ref name=&quot;kir&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/anaisnin.htm |title=Anaïs Nin: 1903-1977|publisher=Kirjasto.sci.fi|year=2008|accessdate=2011-02-15|author=Liukkonen, Petri}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was  a classically trained singer in Cuba&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morbidoutlook.com/nonfiction/articles/2001_03_anaisnin.html The Unique Anais Nin]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  of [[French people|French]] and [[Danish people|Danish]] descent. Her father's grandfather had fled France during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], going first to [[Saint-Domingue]], then [[New Orleans]], and finally to Cuba where he helped build that country's first railway.&lt;ref&gt;''Diaries, Volume 1, 1931–1934''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nin was raised a [[Roman Catholic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Spy In The House Of Love (Foreward)|author=Stuhlmann, Gunther|pages=3|publisher=Swallow Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent her childhood and early life in [[Spain]]. After her parents separated, her mother moved Anaïs and her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and [[Joaquin Nin-Culmell]], from [[Barcelona]] to [[New York City]]. According to her diaries, ''Volume One, 1931&amp;ndash;1934'', Nin abandoned formal schooling at the age of sixteen years and later began working as a dancer and [[model (person)|model]]. After being in America for several years, Nin had forgotten how to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but retained her French and became fluent in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nin, Anaïs|title=The diary of Anaïs Nin: 1931-1934, Volume 1|publisher=Houghtin Mifflin Harcourt|year=1966|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 1923, in [[Havana, Cuba]], Nin married her first husband, [[Hugh Parker Guiler]] (1898–1985), a banker and artist, later known as &quot;Ian Hugo&quot; when he became a maker of [[experimental film]]s in the late 1940s. The couple moved to [[Paris]] the following year, where Guiler pursued his [[banking]] career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing; in her diaries she also mentions having trained as a [[flamenco]] dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s. Her first published work was a critical evaluation of [[D. H. Lawrence]] called ''[[D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study]]'', which she wrote in sixteen days.&lt;ref name=&quot;kir&quot; /&gt; She also explored the field of [[psychotherapy]], studying under the likes of [[Otto Rank]], a disciple of [[Sigmund Freud]]. Nin was briefly a patient of [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/anaisnin/a/anais_nin.htm|work=Women's History: About.com|title=Biography of Anais Nin|accessdate=2011-02-16|author=Lewis, Jone Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nin left Paris in the late summer of 1939, when residents from overseas were urged to leave France due to the upcoming war and returned to New York City with Guiler (who was, on his own wish, all but edited out of her diaries published in her lifetime and whose role in her life is therefore difficult to gauge).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Several persons, when faced with the question of whether they wanted to remain in the diary 'as is'... chose to be deleted altogether from the manuscript (including her husband and some members of her family).&quot; ''The Diary of Anais Nin'', ed. by Gunther Stuhlmann. Harcourt, 1966, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Nin sent her books to Frances Steloff of the [[Gotham Book Mart]] in New York for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anaisnin.com/history/Steloff.html |title=Frances Steloff |publisher=Anaisnin.com |date=1920-01-01 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
According to her diaries,''Vol.1, 1931–1934'', Nin shared a [[bohemian style|bohemian]] lifestyle with [[Henry Miller]] during her time in Paris. Her husband Guiler is not mentioned anywhere in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol.1–2) although the opening of Vol.1 makes it clear that she is married, and the introduction suggests her husband refused to be included in the published diaries. Nin appeared in the [[Kenneth Anger]] film ''[[Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome]]'' (1954) as [[Astarte]]; in the [[Maya Deren]] film ''Ritual in Transfigured Time'' (1946); and in ''Bells of Atlantis'' (1952), a film directed by Guiler under the name &quot;Ian Hugo&quot; with a soundtrack of [[electronic music]] by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]].
The diaries edited by her second husband, after her death, tell that her union with Henry Miller was very passionate and physical, and that she believed that it was his fetus that she aborted.

In 1947, at the age of 44, she met former actor [[Rupert Pole]] in a Manhattan elevator on her way to a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/magazine/31pole.t.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=The Lover Who Always Stays|date=2006-12-31|accessdate=2011-02-16|author=Corbett, Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5591676|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|title=Anais Nin Husband, Rupert Pole, Dies in L.A.|date=2006-07-29|accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two ended up dating and moved in together; Pole was sixteen years her junior. On March 17, 1955, she married him at [[Quartzsite, Arizona]], returning with Pole to live in California.&lt;ref&gt;Bair biography, 1995 and IMDB.&lt;/ref&gt; Guiler remained in New York City and was unaware of Nin's second marriage until after her death in 1977, though biographer [[Deirdre Bair]] alleges that Guiler knew what was happening while Nin was in California, but consciously &quot;chose not to know&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot; /&gt; 

Nin referred to her simultaneous marriages as her &quot;bicoastal trapeze&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot; /&gt; According to Deidre Bair:  {{c quote|[Anaïs] would set up these elaborate facades in Los Angeles and in New York, but it became so complicated that she had to create something she called the lie box. She had this absolutely enormous purse and in the purse she had two sets of checkbooks. One said Anaïs Guiler for New York and another said Anaïs Pole for Los Angeles. She had prescription bottles from California doctors and New York doctors with the two different names. And she had a collection of file cards. And she said, &quot;I tell so many lies I have to write them down and keep them in the lie box so I can keep them straight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot; /&gt;}}

In 1966, Nin had her marriage with Pole annulled, due to the legal issues arising from both Guiler and Pole having to claim her as a dependent on their federal [[tax returns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2006/07/27/rupert_pole_executor_of_exotic_works_by_anas_nin/|work=Boston Globe|title=Rupert Pole, executor of exotic works by Anaïs Nin|author=Woo, Elaine|date=2006-07-27|accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the marriage was annulled, Nin and Pole continued to live together as if they were married, up until her death in 1977.

After Guiler's death in 1985, the [[expurgation|unexpurgated]] versions of her journals were commissioned by Pole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-pole26jul26,0,7114784.story?coll=la-home-headlines The Ranger Who Told All About Anais Nin's Wild Life]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pole died in July 2006.

Nin often cited authors [[Djuna Barnes]] and D. H. Lawrence as inspirations.  She states in Volume One of her diaries that she drew inspiration from [[Marcel Proust]], [[André Gide]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Valéry]], and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].

Nin once worked at Lawrence R. Maxwell Books located at [[45 Christopher Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Recollections of Anaïs Nin, Ohio University Press, 1996, &amp;lrm; p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
===Journals===
Anaïs Nin is perhaps best remembered as a [[diarist]]. Her journals, which span several decades, provide a deeply explorative insight into her personal life and relationships. Nin was acquainted, often quite intimately, with a number of prominent authors, artists, [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], and other figures, and wrote of them often, especially [[Otto Rank]]. Moreover, as a female author describing a primarily masculine constellation of celebrities, Nin's journals have acquired importance as a counterbalancing perspective.

Previously unpublished works are coming to light in ''A Café in Space, the Anais Nin Literary Journal'', which most recently includes &quot;Anais Nin and Joaquín Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a Symphony—Letters between a father and daughter.&quot;

===Erotic writings===
Nin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest writers of female erotica. She was one of the first women to  explore fully the realm of erotic writing, and certainly the first prominent woman in the modern West to write erotica. Before her, erotica written by women was rare, with a few notable exceptions, such as the work of [[Kate Chopin]].

According to Volume I of her diaries, 1931–1934, published in 1966 (Stuhlmann), Nin first came across erotica when she returned to Paris with her [husband,] mother and two brothers in her late teens. They rented the apartment of an American man who was away for the summer, and Nin came across a number of French paperbacks: &quot;One by one, I read these books, which were completely new to me.  I had never read erotic literature in America… They overwhelmed me.  I was innocent before I read them, but by the time I had read them all, there was nothing I did not know about sexual exploits… I had my degree in erotic lore.&quot; [[Image:Anais Nin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Anaïs Nin in the 1970s.]]

Faced with a desperate need for money, Nin, Miller and some of their friends began in the 1940s to write erotic and pornographic narratives for an anonymous &quot;collector&quot; for a dollar a page, somewhat as a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DELTA OF VENUS, by Anaïs Nin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://www.geocities.com/arsenio_grilo/a_nin_1.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5knBgSwxc|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is not clear whether Miller actually wrote these stories or merely allowed his name to be used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noël Riley Fitch]], ''Anaïs: The Erotic Life of Anaïs Nin'' (Boston: [[Little, Brown and Company]], 1993) ISBN 0-316-28428-9&lt;/ref&gt;)  Nin considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricatures and never intended the work to be published, but changed her mind in the early 1970s and allowed them to be published as ''[[Delta of Venus]]''&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace, ''Encyclopedia of feminist literary theory'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1997, ISBN 0815308248, p.190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gibson, ''Postmodernity, ethics and the novel: from Leavis to Levinas'', Routledge, 1999, ISBN 041519895X, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Little Birds]]''.

Nin was a friend, and in some cases lover, of many leading literary figures, including [[Henry Miller]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[James Agee]], [[James Leo Herlihy]], and [[Lawrence Durrell]]. Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller strongly influenced her both as a woman and an author. Nin wrote about her infatuation with the [[Surrealist]] artist [[Bridget Bate Tichenor]] in her diaries.&lt;ref&gt;''Diaries, Volume 3, 1939-1944''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.bridgetbatetichenor.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.bridgetbatetichenor.com Bridget Bate Tichenor Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The rumor that Nin was [[bisexual]] was given added circulation by the [[Philip Kaufman]] film ''[[Henry &amp; June]]''. This rumor is dashed by at least two encounters Nin writes about in her third unexpurgated journal, ''Fire''. The first is with a patient of Nin's (Nin was working as a psychoanalyst in [[New York]] at the time), Thurema Sokol, with whom nothing physical occurs. She also describes a ménage à trois in a hotel, and while Nin is attracted to the other woman, she does not respond completely (229–31). Nin confirms that she is not bisexual in her unpublished 1940 diary when she states that although she could be attracted erotically to some women, the sexual act itself made her uncomfortable. What is irrefutable is her sexual attraction to men.

Nin's first unexpurgated journal, ''[[Henry and June]]'', makes it clear, despite the notion to the contrary, that she did not have sexual relations with Miller's wife, June. While Nin was stirred by June to the point where she says (paraphrasing), &quot;I have become June,&quot; she did not consummate her erotic feelings for her. Still, to both Anais and Henry, June was a femme fatale—irresistible, cunning, erotic. Nin gave June money, jewelry, clothes, oftentimes leaving herself broke. In her second unexpurgated journal, ''Incest'', she wrote that she had an [[incest]]uous relationship with her father, which was graphically described (207–15). When Nin's father learned of the title of her first book of fiction, ''[[House of Incest]]'', he feared that the true nature of their relationship would be revealed, when, in fact, it was heavily veiled in Nin's text.

==Later life and legacy==
The explosion of the [[feminist movement]] in the 1960s gave feminist perspectives on Nin's writings of the past twenty years, which made Nin a popular lecturer at various universities; contrarily, Nin disassociated herself from the political activism of the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;kir&quot; /&gt;

In 1973 Anaïs Nin received an honorary [[doctorate]] from the [[Philadelphia College of Art]]. She was elected to the United States [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1974.  She died in [[Los Angeles, California]] on January 14, 1977 after a three year battle with [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Nin, Anaïs. Rauner Library Letters (September 1975): &quot;I suppose you know I have been fighting cancer for 9 months - just recovering very slowly.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was [[cremation|cremated]], and her ashes were scattered over [[Santa Monica Bay]] in Mermaid Cove. Her first husband, Hugh Guiler, died in 1985, and his ashes were scattered in the cove as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;pole&quot; /&gt; Rupert Pole was named Nin's [[literary executor]], and he arranged to have new unexpurgated editions of Nin's books and diaries published between 1985 and his death in 2006.

[[Philip Kaufman]] directed the 1990 film ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' based on Nin's novel ''[[Henry and June|Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin]]''. She was portrayed in the film by [[Maria de Medeiros]].

'''AOL Instant Messenger''' (''abbreviated '''AIM''''') is an [[instant messaging]] and [[Presence information|presence]] [[computer program]] which uses the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[OSCAR protocol|OSCAR instant messaging protocol]] and the [[TOC protocol]] to allow registered users to communicate in real time. It was released by [[AOL]] in May 1997. Stand-alone official AIM client software includes advertisements and is available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[Mac OS]], [[Mac OS X]], [[iPhone OS]], [[Android OS]], [[BlackBerry OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://products.aim.com/products |title=Products AIM |publisher=Products AIM |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software, maintained by AOL, Inc., has the largest share of the instant messaging market in North America, especially in the [[United States]] (with 52% of the total reported as of 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigblueball.com/forums/general-other-im-news/34413-im-market-share.html |title=IM Market Share - BigBlueBall Forums |publisher=Bigblueball.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include other instant messaging software related to or developed by AOL, such as [[ICQ]] and [[iChat]].

==History==
{{update|type=section|date=November 2010}}
In September 1995, the &quot;Buddy List&quot; precursor to AIM was launched internally to AOL employees. In March 1996, the Buddy List was opened up to AOL subscribers. The standalone AIM became available to non-subscribers in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~rposner/wallst2.htm |title=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Home.uchicago.edu |date=2001-03-23 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of AIM came over a decade after AOL's previous [[QuantumLink]] incarnation had offered &quot;On-Line Messages&quot; (OLMs) to its subscribers.

Since version 2.0, AIM has included person-to-person instant messaging, chatroom messaging, and the ability to share files [[Peer-to-peer]] with one's buddies. Version 4.3 introduced the storing of one's contact list on AOL's servers and allowed for a maximum of 200 buddies to be stored. In addition, in the 4.x versions, the AIM client for [[Microsoft Windows]] added the ability to play games against one another using the [[Wild Tangent]] engine. The first version released with [[WildTangent]] did not warn the user that it was going to be installed. Newer versions do, because many spyware scanners flag the WildTangent software as spyware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Machrone |first=Bill |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1601598,00.asp |title=Spyware or Slyware? |publisher=Pcmag.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The successor to AIM version 5.9 was originally named AIM Triton. Compared with version 5.9, Triton's programming code was [[Rewrite (programming)|rewritten]] and featured a brand new UI engine called [[Boxely (Layout engine)|Boxely]]. The first [[Software testing#Post Release|beta]] version of Triton (0.1.12) supported only [[Windows XP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.aol.com/projects/tritonbeta/  |title=AIM Triton Beta Test |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-04-29 |accessdate=2010-12-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050429015433/http://beta.aol.com/projects/tritonbeta/ |archivedate = 2005-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon its release. For the first time in the development of a new version of AIM, these preliminary versions were made publicly available on the AIM home page for any user to test and provide feedback.

In September 2006, Triton was renamed to AIM 6 and a new beta version was made available. This version slightly changed the UI.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The [[Development stage#Stable.Gold/general availability release|final]] [[Development stage#Stable/unstable|stable]] version of AIM 6.0 was released on December 15; new features included connection to [[AIM Pages]], additional customization, and compatibility with [[address book]] programs and sites through a &quot;Universal Address Book&quot; powered by [[Plaxo]]. Additionally, the upgrade unified &lt;!--doesn't make sense: profile, --&gt;away messages and general user updates into [[RSS feeds]] and added the ability to send messages to offline users. Certain features that were missing from the previous version were also re-added, such as global font customization and a smaller cache usage, although the Get File function has yet to return&lt;!-- no version of AIM since 5.9 has get file --&gt;. Also new in this release was the [http://developer.aim.com opening of AIM to developers], which allowed anyone to create plug-ins or custom AIM clients for Windows, Macintosh, or Linux.

The next version, 6.1, added Buddy List docking, support for inserting images into Buddy Info, the ability to change the highlight colors of the UI, improvements to the displaying of Linked Screen Names, several bug fixes, and improved [[Windows Vista]] support.

Version 6.5.11.1 supports status messages (similar to away messages), and has improved cell phone integration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.aim.com/client/65 AIM Download 6.5 - AIM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In version 7.4 for Windows and version 2.1 for Mac OS, AIM added support for [[Facebook]], allowing users to login using their Facebook ID and chat with their Facebook friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shankland |first=Stephen |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000060-264.html |title=Facebook opens chat, and AIM plugs in - Cnet |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Version 7.x no longer supports Windows 2003 Server (which is newer than XP).

==Protocol==
The standard protocol that AIM clients use to communicate is called [[OSCAR protocol|OSCAR]]. Most AOL-produced versions of AIM and popular third party AIM clients use this protocol. However, AOL also created a simpler protocol called [[TOC2 protocol|TOC]] that lacks many of OSCAR's features but is sometimes used for clients that only require basic chat functionality. The TOC/TOC2 protocol specifications were made available by AOL, while OSCAR is a closed protocol that third parties have had to reverse-engineer.

In January 2008, AOL introduced experimental [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] support for AIM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://florianjensen.com/2008/01/17/aol-adopting-xmpp-aka-jabber/|title=AOL adopting XMPP aka Jabber|date=2008-01-17|accessdate=2008-01-17|author=Florian Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing AIM users to communicate using the standardized, open-source [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]]. However, in March 2008 this service was discontinued{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. As of May 2011, AOL offers limited XMPP support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.com/xmpp|title=AOL XMPP Gateway|date=2011-05-14|accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
AIM and AOL use several terms for elements of their instant messaging that are different from other messengers. These include:
* '''[[Status message (instant messaging)|Away message]]''': A function of some instant messaging applications whereby a user may post a message that appears automatically to other users if they attempt to make contact when the user is unavailable. It is analogous to the voice message on an answering machine or voice mail system.&lt;!-- Away messages are stored on the local hard drive, so if there are multiple computers with multiple instances of AIM, when an away message is added to one instance, AIM does not automatically update the other instances. (Advanced users may want to check out the [http://www.aim.com/help_faq/using/win/away.adp?aolp=#backup FAQs] to see how to export away messages from the registry.)--&gt;
* '''Block''': An AIM user may block a specific screen name on their buddy list. The blocked user cannot contact or see the status of the blocker. Both users in this case will always see each other as offline until the blocker &quot;unblocks&quot; them.
* '''Buddy Info''': Information about the user that may be edited by the user. The user's buddies are able to view the information as a pop-up. There is a character limit that cannot be exceeded.
* '''Buddy List''': The centerpiece of AIM, a list containing the status of up to 1000 buddies stored on an AIM server so the user can access this list from any instance of AIM. The status of the buddies can be seen as &quot;online&quot;, &quot;away&quot;, &quot;idle&quot;, &quot;mobile&quot;, or &quot;offline&quot;.
* '''Direct connection''': AIM users can, instead of relaying messages through the AIM server, connect to each other's computers directly via this method and send various forms of media.
* '''[[User (computing)|Screen name]]''': Term for [[user name]] with AOL origins. These are available for free with registration at the AIM website, and range from [[3]] to [[16]] [[characters]] in length.
* '''Rate limiting''', which prevents a user from sending too many messages in a short amount of time. Once a user is rate limited, they are unable to send messages for about 10 seconds, though they may still receive messages during this time period.
* '''Warning''': If a user feels a received instant message is inappropriate, the recipient can &quot;warn&quot; the sender, which increases the sender's warning level. Warning levels reduce the rate at which users can send messages and can eventually cause a given screen name to be unable to sign on for a period of time. Since it was often abused, the feature is no longer supported in AIM Triton or AIM 6. For a while, warnings had not been disabled [[Server (computing)|serverside]], meaning that older AIM clients, third-party clients, or user-written add-ons may still allow users to bypass the &quot;soft&quot; removal of warning capabilities. This is no longer the case, and warning ability has been completely removed.
* '''AIM Closed List''', '''Allow Only''', '''Buddies Only''', or '''Privacy''' refers to the option on the AOL Instant Messenger client to allow only users on a user's buddy list to contact them. This is to prevent [[harassment]] or [[spam (electronic)|spamming]] and is also a secure way to chat.
* '''Icon''': A small, personalized picture that a user can set up to appear whenever they message another user. Also referred to as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]].

==Privacy==
AIM is different from other clients such as [[Yahoo! Messenger|Yahoo Messenger]] in that it does not require approval from one buddy to be added to another's buddy list. As a result, it is possible for users to keep other unsuspecting users on their buddy list to see when they are online, read their status and away messages, and read their profiles. In fact, there is a web API to display one's status, away message as a widget on one's webpage.&lt;ref&gt;http://dev.aol.com/data_sheets/WebAIM_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf, page 2 &quot;Integrate Your Site with AIM in 3 Easy Steps&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, one can block another user from communicating and seeing one's status; though this does not prevent the user from creating a new account that is not blocked and therefore can still track the first user's status. A more complete privacy option is to select a menu option allowing communication only with those on one's buddy list; this causes one to block (thus appear offline to) all users not on one's buddy list.

==Robots==
AOL and various other companies supply robots on AIM that can receive messages and send a response based on the bot's purpose. For example, bots can help with studying, like StudyBuddy. Some are made to relate to children and teenagers, like [[Spleak]], others give advice, and others are for more general purposes, such as [[SmarterChild]]. Prior to the inclusions of such bots, the bots DoorManBot and AIMOffline provided features that are provided today by AOL for those who needed it. [[ZolaOnAOL]] and [[ZoeOnAOL]] were short lived bots that ultimately retired their features in favor of SmarterChild.

==URI scheme==
AOL Instant Messenger's installation process automatically installs an extra [[URI scheme]] (&quot;protocol&quot;) handler into some web browsers, so URIs beginning &quot;&lt;tt&gt;aim:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; can open a new AIM window with specified parameters. This is similar in function to the &lt;tt&gt;mailto:&lt;/tt&gt; URI scheme, which creates a new e-mail message using the system's default mail program. For instance, a web page might include a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the AIM user ''notarealuser'':
 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser&quot;&amp;gt;Send Message&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

To specify a message body, the &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; parameter is used, so the link location might look like this:
 &lt;code&gt;aim:goim?screenname=notarealuser&amp;message=This+is+my+message&lt;/code&gt;

To specify an away message, the message parameter is used, so the link location might look like this:
 &lt;code&gt;aim:goaway?message=Hello,+my+name+is+Bill&lt;/code&gt;
When placing this inside a URL link, an AIM user could click on the URL link and the away message &quot;Hello, my name is Bill&quot; would instantly become their away message.

To add a buddy, the addbuddy message is used, with the screenname parameter
 &lt;code&gt;aim:addbuddy?screenname=notarealuser&lt;/code&gt;
This type of link is commonly found on forum profiles, for easy adding of contacts

==Vulnerabilities==
AIM is known for security weaknesses that have enabled [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] to be created that use third-party software to perform malicious acts on users' computers. Although most are relatively harmless, such as being kicked off the AIM service, others perform potentially dangerous actions such as harvesting [[IP address|IP Addresses]] and the sending of [[computer virus|viruses]]. Some of these exploits rely on [[social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]] to spread by automatically sending instant messages that contain a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] accompanied by text suggesting the receiving user click on it, an action which leads to infection. These messages can easily be mistaken as coming from a friend and contain a link to a web address that installs software on the user's computer to restart the cycle.

==Extra features==
===iPhone application===
On March 6, 2008, during [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPhone SDK]] event, AOL announced that they would be releasing an AIM application for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] users. The application is available for free from the App Store, but the company also provides a paid version which displays no advertisements. Both are available from the [[App Store]]. The AIM client for [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] supports standard [[AIM]] accounts as well as [[MobileMe]] accounts.  There is also an express version of AIM accessible through the [[Safari (web browser)]] browser on the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2008/03/06/apple-releases-iphone-sdk-demos-spore-instant-messaging/ |title=Apple Releases iPhone SDK, Demos Spore, Instant Messaging |publisher=Mac Rumors |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIM Express===
AIM Express runs in a pop-up browser window. It is intended for use by people who are unwilling or unable to install a standalone application or those at computers that lack the AIM application. AIM Express supports many of the standard features included in the stand-alone client, but does not provide advanced features like file transfer, audio chat, video conferencing, or buddy info. It is implemented in [[Adobe Flash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.com/products/express |title=www.aim.com/products/express |publisher=Aim.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an upgrade to the previous AOL Quick Buddy, which was later available for older systems that cannot handle Express before being discontinued. Express and Quick Buddy are similar to [[MSN Messenger#MSN Web Messenger|MSN Web Messenger]] and [[Yahoo! Messenger#Web Messenger|Yahoo! Web Messenger]].

===AIM Pages===
{{Main|AIM Pages}}
[[AIM Pages]] was released in May 2006, allowing the 63 million AIM users to create an online, dynamic profile. The buddy list serves as the basis for the AIM Page [[social network]]. An AIM Page is built using modules following the ModuleT [[microformat]]. AIM Pages was discontinued in late 2007.

===AIM for Mac===
AOL released an all-new AIM for the [[Macintosh]] on September 29, 2008 and the final build on December 15, 2008. The redesigned AIM for Mac is a full [[universal binary]] [[Cocoa API]] application that supports both Tiger and Leopard – [[Mac OS X]] 10.4.8 (and above) or [[Mac OS X]] 10.5.3 (and above). On October 1, 2009, AOL released AIM 2.0 for Mac.

===AIM Phoneline===
AIM Phoneline was a [[Voice over IP]] PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1194787,00.html AOL Launches AIM Phoneline]&lt;/ref&gt; provided via the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) application. It was also known to work with Apple's iChat Client. The service was officially closed to its customers on January 13, 2009.

===AIM Call Out===
AIM Call Out is a discontinued [[Voice over IP]] PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service provided by AOL via its AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) application that replaced the defunct AIM Phoneline service in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimphoneline.com/?promo=784114&amp;flv=1&amp;ncid=oyjqUzrKfk0000000465&amp;icid=one_click.M|title=Looking for AIM Phoneline?|publisher=Aimphoneline.com|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not depend on the AIM client and could be used with only an AIM screenname via the WebConnect feature or a dedicated SIP device. The AIM Call Out service was shut down on March 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voice.aol.com/help/aim-call-out/help/when-is-aim-call-out-closing|title=When is AIM Call Out closing? |publisher=AOL Voice Services FAQ|accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computability theory]], the '''Ackermann function''', named after [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], is one of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] that is not [[Primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]]. All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.

After Ackermann's publication&lt;ref name=&quot;Ack&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wilhelm Ackermann | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] | title=''Zum Hilbertschen Aufbau der reellen Zahlen'' | year=1928 | volume=99 | pages=118–133 | doi=10.1007/BF01459088}}&lt;/ref&gt; of his function (which had three nonnegative integer arguments), many authors modified it to suit various purposes, so that today &quot;the Ackermann function&quot; may refer to any of numerous variants of the original function. One common version, the two-argument '''Ackermann–Péter function''', is defined as follows for nonnegative integers ''m'' and ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt; A(m, n) =
\begin{cases}
n+1 &amp; \mbox{if } m = 0 \\
A(m-1, 1) &amp; \mbox{if } m &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\
A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) &amp; \mbox{if } m &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n &gt; 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Its value grows rapidly, even for small inputs.  For example ''A''(4,2) is an integer of 19,729 decimal digits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosara.net/thoughts/ackermann42.html Decimal expansion of A(4,2)] {{Wayback|url=http://www.kosara.net/thoughts/ackermann42.html|date =20080317104411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1920s, the mathematicians [[Gabriel Sudan]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], students of [[David Hilbert]], were studying the foundations of computation.  Both Sudan and Ackermann are credited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cristian Calude, [[Solomon Marcus]] and Ionel Tevy | journal = Historia Math. | title=The first example of a recursive function which is not primitive recursive | month=November | year=1979 | pages=380–84 | volume=6 | issue=4 | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(79)90024-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with discovering [[total function|total]] [[computable function]]s (termed simply &quot;recursive&quot; in some references) that are not [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]].  Sudan published the lesser-known [[Sudan function]], then shortly afterwards and independently, in 1928, Ackermann published his function &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Ackermann's three-argument function, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, p)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is defined such that for ''p'' = 0, 1, 2, it reproduces the basic operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation as
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, 0) = m+n,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, 1) = m\cdot n,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, 2) = m^n,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
and for ''p'' &gt; 2 it extends these basic operations in a way that happens to be expressible in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] as
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, p) = m\uparrow^{p - 1}(n + 1)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
(Aside from its historic role as a total-computable-but-not-primitive-recursive function, Ackermann's original function is seen to extend the basic arithmetic operations beyond exponentiation, although not as seamlessly as do variants of Ackermann's function that are specifically designed for that purpose — such as [[Reuben Goodstein|Goodstein's]] [[hyperoperation]] sequence.)

In ''On the Infinite'', David Hilbert hypothesized that the Ackermann function was not primitive recursive, but it was Ackermann, Hilbert’s personal secretary and former student, who actually proved the hypothesis in his paper ''On Hilbert’s Construction of the Real Numbers''. ''On the Infinite'' was Hilbert’s most important paper on the foundations of mathematics, serving as the heart of [[Hilbert's program]] to secure the foundation of [[transfinite number]]s by basing them on finite methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ack&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Heijenoort. [http://mathgate.info/cebrown/notes/vonHeijenoort.php From Frege To Gödel], 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Raphael Robinson]] later developed a two-variable version of the Ackermann function that became preferred by many authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Raphael M. Robinson | title=Recursion and Double Recursion | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | year=1948 | volume=54 | pages=987–93 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183512393&amp;page=record | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1948-09121-2 | issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and properties==
Ackermann's original three-argument function &lt;math&gt;\varphi(m, n, p)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is defined [[recursion|recursively]] as follows for nonnegative integers ''m'', ''n'', and ''p'':

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
\varphi(m, n, 0) = m + n \\
\varphi(m, 0, 1) = 0 \\
\varphi(m, 0, 2) = 1 \\
\varphi(m, 0, p) = m \text{ for } p &gt; 2 \\
\varphi(m, n, p) = \varphi(m, \varphi(m, n-1, p), p - 1) \text{ for } n &gt; 0 \text{ and } p &gt; 0.
\end{cases}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Of the various two-argument versions, the one developed by Péter and Robinson (called &quot;the&quot; Ackermann function by some authors) is defined for nonnegative integers ''m'' and ''n'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; A(m, n) =
\begin{cases}
n+1 &amp; \mbox{if } m = 0 \\
A(m-1, 1) &amp; \mbox{if } m &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\
A(m-1, A(m, n-1)) &amp; \mbox{if } m &gt; 0 \mbox{ and } n &gt; 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

It may not be immediately obvious that the evaluation of &lt;math&gt; A(m, n)&lt;/math&gt; always terminates. However, the recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either ''m'' decreases, or ''m'' remains the same and ''n'' decreases. Each time that ''n'' reaches zero, ''m'' decreases, so ''m'' eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair (''m'', ''n'') decreases in the [[lexicographic order]], which preserves the [[well-order]]ing of the non-negative integers.) However, when ''m'' decreases there is no upper bound on how much ''n'' can increase — and it will often increase greatly.

The Péter-Ackermann function can also be expressed in terms of various other versions of the Ackermann function:
* the indexed version of [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] (extended to integer indices ≥ -2):
::''A''(''m'', ''n'') = &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow^{m-2} (n+3) - 3.&lt;/math&gt;
:The part of the definition ''A''(''m'', 0) = A(''m''-1, 1) corresponds to &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow^{m+1} 3=2\uparrow^m 4.&lt;/math&gt;

* [[hyper operator]]s:
::''A''(''m'', ''n'') = hyper(2, m, n + 3) − 3.

* [[Conway chained arrow]] notation:
::''A''(''m'', ''n'') = (2 → (''n''+3) → ''(m'' − 2)) − 3 for ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2
:hence
::2 → ''n'' → ''m'' = ''A''(''m''+2,''n''-3) + 3 for ''n''&gt;2.
:(''n''=1 and ''n''=2 would correspond with ''A''(''m'',−2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1 and ''A''(''m'',−1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, which could logically be added.)

For small values of ''m'' like 1, 2, or 3, the Ackermann function grows relatively slowly with respect to ''n'' (at most [[exponential growth|exponentially]]). For ''m'' ≥ 4, however, it grows much more quickly; even ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;2) is about 2{{e|19728}}, and the decimal expansion of ''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;3) is very large by any typical measure.

If we define the function ''f''&amp;nbsp;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n''), which increases both ''m'' and ''n'' at the same time, we have a function of one variable that dwarfs every primitive recursive function, including very fast-growing functions such as the [[exponential function]], the factorial function, multi- and [[superfactorial]] functions, and even functions defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation (except when the indexed up-arrow is used).

This extreme growth can be exploited to show that ''f'', which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a [[Turing machine]] and so is a [[computable function]], grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.  In a category with exponentials, using the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;A \times B \rightarrow C \cong A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C)&lt;/math&gt; (in computer science, this is called [[currying]]), the Ackermann function may be defined via primitive recursion over higher-order functionals as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
\operatorname{Ack}(0) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{Succ} \\
\operatorname{Ack}(m+1) &amp; = &amp; \operatorname{Iter}(\operatorname{Ack}(m))
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Succ'' is the usual [[successor function]] and ''Iter'' is defined by primitive recursion as well:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
\operatorname{Iter}(f)(0) &amp; = &amp; f(1) \\
\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n+1) &amp; = &amp; f(\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n)).
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

One interesting aspect of the Ackermann function is that the only arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1. Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.

==Table of values==
Computing the Ackermann function can be restated in terms of an infinite table. We place the natural numbers along the top row. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken. If there is no number to its left, simply look at the column headed &quot;1&quot; in the previous row. Here is a small upper-left portion of the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Values of ''A''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')
|-
! ''m''\''n''
! 0
! 1
! 2
! 3
! 4
! n
|-
! 0
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || &lt;math&gt;n + 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-

|-

| 3 || 5 || 7 || 9 || 11 || &lt;math&gt;2n + 3 = 2\cdot(n + 3) - 3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 3
| 5 || 13 || 29 || 61 || 125 || &lt;math&gt;2^{(n+3)} - 3&lt;/math&gt;
|-

| 13 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=&lt;math&gt;{2^{2^{2}}}-3&lt;/math&gt;|| 65533 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=&lt;math&gt;{2^{2^{2^{2}}}}-3&lt;/math&gt;
| 2&lt;sup&gt;65536&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=&lt;math&gt;{2^{2^{2^{2^{2}}}}}-3&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;{2^{2^{65536}}} - 3&lt;/math&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=&lt;math&gt;{2^{2^{2^{2^{2^{2}}}}}}-3&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;{2^{2^{2^{65536}}}} - 3&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=&lt;math&gt;{2^{2^{2^{2^{2^{2^{2}}}}}}}-3&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\underbrace{{2^2}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^{{\cdot}^2}}}} - 3 \\n\mbox{ + 3}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The numbers listed here in a recursive reference are very large and cannot be easily notated in some other form.

Despite the large values occurring in this early section of the table, some even larger numbers have been defined, such as [[Graham's number]], which cannot be written with any small number of [[Knuth's up-arrow notation|Knuth arrows]]. This number is constructed with a technique similar to applying the Ackermann function to itself recursively.

This is a repeat of the above table, but with the values replaced by the relevant expression from the function definition to show the pattern clearly:

==Expansion==
To see how the Ackermann function grows so quickly, it helps to expand out some simple expressions using the rules in the original definition. For example, we can fully evaluate &lt;math&gt;A(1, 2)&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A(1,2) &amp; = A(0, A(1, 1))       \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, A(1, 0))) \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, A(0, 1))) \\
&amp; = A(0, A(0, 2))       \\
&amp; = A(0, 3)             \\
&amp; = 4.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

To demonstrate how &lt;math&gt;A(4, 3)&lt;/math&gt;'s computation results in many steps and in a large number:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A(4, 3) &amp; = A(3, A(4, 2))                                     \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(4, 1)))                               \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(4, 0))))                         \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(3, 1))))                         \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(3, 0)))))                   \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(2, 1)))))                   \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(2, 0))))))             \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(1, 1))))))             \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(1, 0)))))))       \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(0, 1)))))))       \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, 2))))))             \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, 3)))))                   \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(1, 2))))))             \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(1, 1)))))))       \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(1, 0)))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(0, 1)))))))) \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, 2))))))        \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, 3)))))              \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, 4)))))                   \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, 5))))                         \\
&amp; = ...                                               \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, A(3, 13)))                              \\
&amp; = ...                                               \\
&amp; = A(3, A(3, 65533))                                 \\
&amp; = ...                                               \\
&amp; = A(3, 2^{65536} - 3)                               \\
&amp; = ...                                               \\
&amp; = 2^{2^{ \overset{65536}{} }} - 3.                  \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Written as a power of 10, this is roughly equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;6.031{{e|19727}}&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Inverse==
Since the function &amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') considered above grows very rapidly, its [[inverse function]], ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, grows very slowly. This '''inverse Ackermann function''' ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is usually denoted by '''α'''. In fact, α(n) is less than 5 for any practical input size ''n'', since A(4,&amp;nbsp;4) is on the order of &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{10^{19729}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

This inverse appears in the time [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of some [[algorithm]]s, such as the [[disjoint-set data structure]] and [[Bernard Chazelle|Chazelle]]'s algorithm for [[minimum spanning tree]]s. Sometimes Ackermann's original function or other variations are used in these settings, but they all grow at similarly high rates. In particular, some modified functions simplify the expression by eliminating the ''−3'' and similar terms.

A two-parameter variation of the inverse Ackermann function can be defined as follows, where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(m,n) = \min\{i \geq 1 : A(i,\lfloor m/n \rfloor) \geq \log_2 n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This function arises in more precise analyses of the algorithms mentioned above, and gives a more refined time bound. In the disjoint-set data structure, ''m'' represents the number of operations while ''n'' represents the number of elements; in the minimum spanning tree algorithm, ''m'' represents the number of edges while ''n'' represents the number of vertices.
Several slightly different definitions of α(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') exist; for example, log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' is sometimes replaced by ''n'', and the floor function is sometimes replaced by a [[ceiling function|ceiling]].

Other studies might define an inverse function of one where m is set to a constant, such that the inverse applies to a particular row.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15618233 An inverse-Ackermann style lower bound for the online minimum spanning tree verification problem] November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as benchmark==
The Ackermann function, due to its definition in terms of extremely deep recursion, can be used as a benchmark of a [[compiler]]'s ability to optimize recursion.  The first use of Ackermann's function in this way was by Yngve Sundblad, ''The Ackermann function. A Theoretical, computational and formula manipulative study.'' (BIT 11 (1971), 107119).

This seminal paper was taken up by Brian Wichmann (co-author of the [[Whetstone (benchmark)|Whetstone benchmark]]) in a trilogy of papers written between 1975 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ackermann's Function: A Study In The Efficiency Of Calling Procedures | year = 1975 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/ack.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How to Call Procedures, or Second Thoughts on Ackermann's Function | year = 1977 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/ackpe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Latest results from the procedure calling test, Ackermann's function | year = 1982 | url=http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/Imp_Benchmarks/acklt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a compiler which, in analyzing the computation of ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;30), is able to save intermediate values like ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;''n'') and ''A''(2,&amp;nbsp;''n'') in that calculation rather than recomputing them, can speed up computation of ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;30) by a factor of hundreds of thousands. Also, if ''A''(2,&amp;nbsp;''n'') is computed directly rather than as a recursive expansion of the form ''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;''A''(1,...''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;0)...))), this will save significant amounts of time. Computing ''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;''n'') takes linear time in ''n''. Computing ''A''(2,&amp;nbsp;''n'') requires quadratic time, since it expands to [[Big O notation|O]](''n'') nested calls to ''A''(1,&amp;nbsp;''i'') for various ''i''. Computing ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;''n'') requires time proportionate to 4&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;. The computation of ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;1) in the example above takes 16 (4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) steps.

''A''(4,&amp;nbsp;2) cannot possibly be computed by simple recursive application of the Ackermann function in any tractable amount of time. Instead, shortcut formulas such as ''A''(3,&amp;nbsp;''n'') = 8×2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;−3 are used as an optimization to complete some of the recursive calls.

A practical method of computing functions similar to Ackermann's is to use [[memoization]]&lt;!--NOT memorization--&gt; of intermediate results. A compiler could apply this technique to a function automatically using [[Donald Michie]]'s &quot;[[memo function]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtoal.com/plsql/ackerman-memo.pls.html Example: Explicit memo function version of Ackermann's function] implemented in PL/SQL&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Ackermann numbers==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Googolplex]] --&gt;
In ''The Book of Numbers'', [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]] define the sequence of '''Ackermann numbers''' to be 1↑1, 2↑↑2, 3↑↑↑3, etc.;&lt;ref&gt;John Horton Conway and Richard K. Guy. [http://books.google.com/books?id=0--3rcO7dMYC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=%22Ackermann%20number%22&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ackermann%20number%22&amp;f=false ''The Book of Numbers'']. New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 60-61, 1996. ISBN 978-0-387-97993-9&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the n-th Ackermann number is defined to be n↑&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;n (''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...), where m↑&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;n is [[Knuth's up-arrow notation|Knuth's up-arrow]] version of the Ackermann function.

The first few Ackermann numbers are:
:* 1↑1 = 1&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,
:* 2↑↑2 = 2↑2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4,
:* 3↑↑↑3 = 3↑↑3↑↑3 = 3↑↑(3↑3↑3) = &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow\uparrow3^{3^3} = 3\uparrow\uparrow7625597484987 = \underbrace{3^{3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.^{3}}}}}}}}_{7625597484987{\rm\ threes}}&lt;/math&gt;

The fourth Ackermann number, 4↑↑↑↑4, can be written in terms of [[tetration]] towers as follows:

:4↑↑↑↑4 = 4↑↑↑4↑↑↑4↑↑↑4 = 4↑↑↑4↑↑↑(4↑↑4↑↑4↑↑4)
:::&lt;math&gt; = \underbrace{~~^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4}4}4}4~~}_{\underbrace{~^{^{^{^{^{4}.}.}.}4}4~}_{^{^{^{^4}4}4}4 {\rm\ fours}} {\rm fours}}&lt;/math&gt;

Explanation: in the middle layer, there is a tower of tetration whose full height is &lt;math&gt;^{^{^{^4}4}4}4&lt;/math&gt; and the final result is the top layer of tetrated 4's whose full height equals the calculation of the middle layer. Note that by way of size comparison, the simple expression &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;4 already exceeds a [[googolplex]], so the fourth Ackermann number is quite large.

Alternatively, this can be written in terms of [[exponentiation]] towers as
:&lt;math&gt;4\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix} 4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\dots
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
4,
&lt;/math&gt;
:where the number of towers on the previous line (including the rightmost &quot;4&quot;) is
:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\dots
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
4,
&lt;/math&gt;
:where the number of towers on the previous line (including the rightmost &quot;4&quot;) is
:&lt;math&gt;
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
\left.
\begin{matrix}4^{4^{4^4}}\end{matrix}
\right \}
4,
&lt;/math&gt;
where the number of &quot;4&quot;s in each tower, on each of the lines above, is specified by the value of the next tower to its right (as indicated by a brace).

The '''Antarctic''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɑr|k|t|ɪ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|icon|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɑr|t|ɪ|k}}&lt;ref&gt;The word was originally pronounced without /k/, but the [[spelling pronunciation]] has become the more common one. The &quot;c&quot; was originally added for etymological reasons and was then misunderstood as not being silent.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[region]] around the [[Earth]]'s [[South Pole]], opposite the [[Arctic]] region around the [[North Pole]].  The Antarctic comprises the [[continent]] of [[Antarctica]] and the [[ice shelf|ice shelves]], waters and [[island]] territories in the [[Southern Ocean]] situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scar.org/ Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The region covers some 20% of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], of which 5.5% (14 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the surface area of the continent itself.

== Geography ==

The maritime part of the region constitutes the area of application of the international [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), where for technical reasons the Convention uses an approximation of the Convergence line by means of a line joining specified points along [[Circle of latitude|parallels of latitude]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridians of longitude]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/bd/pt1.pdf Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;  The implementation of the Convention is managed through an international Commission headquartered in [[Hobart]], [[Australia]] by an efficient system of annual [[fishing]] quotas, licenses and international inspectors on the fishing vessels, as well as [[satellite]] surveillance.

Most of the Antarctic region is situated south of 60°S latitude parallel, and is governed in accordance with the international legal regime of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp Antarctic Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Treaty area covers the continent itself and its immediately adjacent islands, as well as the [[archipelago]]s of the [[South Orkney Islands]], [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Peter I Island|Peter&amp;nbsp;I Island]], [[Scott Island]] and [[Balleny Islands]].

The islands situated between 60°S latitude parallel to the south and the [[Antarctic Convergence]] to the north, and their respective 200-[[nautical mile|mile]] [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]s fall under the national [[jurisdiction]] of the countries that possess them: [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] ([[United Kingdom]]; also an [[EU]] [[Overseas Countries and Territories#Overseas countries and territories|Overseas territory]]), [[Bouvet Island]] ([[Norway]]), and [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard and McDonald Islands]] ([[Australia]]).  

[[Kerguelen Islands]] ([[France]]; also an [[EU]] [[Overseas Countries and Territories#Overseas countries and territories|Overseas territory]]) are situated in the Antarctic Convergence area, while the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Isla de los Estados]], [[Hornos Island]] with [[Cape Horn]], [[Diego Ramírez Islands]], [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]], [[Macquarie Island]], [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] and [[Île Saint-Paul|Saint Paul]] Islands, [[Crozet Islands]], [[Prince Edward Islands]], and [[Gough Island]] and [[Tristan da Cunha|Tristan da Cunha group]] remain north of the Convergence and thus outside the Antarctic region.

== Society ==

The first Antarctic land discovered was the island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#Geography|South Georgia]], visited by the [[Kingdom of England|English]] merchant [[Anthony de la Roché]] in 1675.  The first human born in the Antarctic was [[Solveig Gunbjörg Jacobsen]] born on 8 October 1913 in [[Grytviken]], South Georgia.  

The Antarctic region had no [[indigenous population]] when first discovered, and its present inhabitants comprise a few thousand transient [[science|scientific]] and other personnel working on tours of duty at the several dozen [[List of research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] maintained by various countries.  However, the region is visited by more than 40,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.zenn.net/REPLACE/CLIENT/1000037/1000116/application/pdf/touristsbynationality_total2.pdf IAATO tourist statistics 2007/08]&lt;/ref&gt; tourists annually, the most popular destinations being the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] area (especially the [[South Shetland Islands]]) and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#Geography|South Georgia Island]].

In December 2009, the growth of [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], with consequences for both the ecology and the safety of the travellers in its great and remote wilderness, was noted at a conference in New Zealand by experts from signatories to the [[Antarctic Treaty]]. The definitive results of the conference would be presented at the Antarctic Treaty states' meeting in Uruguay in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/09/travel/main5950735.shtml &quot;Antarctic Nations Consider New Controls On Ships - Antarctic Nations Considering New Controls On Ships Amid Tourism Explosion&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Albanians}}
'''Albanians''' ({{lang-sq|Shqiptarët}}) are an [[ethnic group]] from the [[Balkans]], who live in [[Albania]] and neighboring countries. They speak the [[Albanian language]]. More than half of all Albanians live in [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]]{{ref label|status|a|}} with other large groups residing in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Italy]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Greece]]. The [[Albanian diaspora]] also exists in a number of other countries.

While the exonym ''Albania'' for the general region inhabited by the Albanians does hark back to Classical Antiquity, and possibly to an [[Illyrians|Illyrian tribe]], the name was lost within the Albanian language, the Albanian endonym being ''shqiptar'', from the term for the Albanian language, ''shqip'', a derivation of the verb ''shqiptoj'' &quot;to utilize a correct Albanian pronunciation &quot;. This theory pertains to Hahn and it holds that perhaps the word is ultimately a loan from Latin ''excipio''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elsie, ''A dictionary of Albanian religion, mythology and folk culture'', C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 2001, ISBN 978-1-85065-570-1, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Albanian endonym, like ''[[Slav (ethnonym)|Slav]]'' [[Endonym#Tendencies in the development of exonyms|and others]], is in origin a term for &quot;those who speak [intelligibly, the same language]&quot;. However another plausible theory has been advanced by Maximilian Lambertz to explain the endonym as derived from the Albanian noun ''shqype'' or ''shqiponjë'' (eagle), which, according to Albanian [[folk etymology]], denoted a bird [[totem]] dating from the times of [[Skanderbeg]], as displayed on the [[Albanian flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ej2-s&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=ALBANCI | encyclopedia =[[Enciklopedija Jugoslavije]] 2nd ed. | volume=Supplement | pages=1 | publisher=[[JLZ]] | location=[[Zagreb]] | year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''History'' written in 1079–1080, the Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]] referred to the ''Albanoi'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the duke of [[Durrës|Dyrrachium]]. It is disputed, however, whether that refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxbyz&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Pritsak | first=Omeljan | title=Albanians | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | volume=1 | pages=52–53 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=New York/Oxford | year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaliates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078, is undisputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balkan Peninsula p. 25&quot;&gt;The wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins  G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series  Authors Alexandru Madgearu, Martin Gordon  Editor Martin Gordon  Translated by Alexandru Madgearu  Edition illustrated  Publisher Scarecrow Press, 2008  ISBN 0-8108-5846-0, 9780810858466 ''It was supposed that those Albanoi from 1042 were Normans from Sicily, called by an archaic name (the Albanoi were an independent tribe from Southern Italy).

The Albanians are and have been referred to by other terms as well. Some of them are:
*[[Arbëreshë|Arbër]], [[Arbëreshë|Arbën]], [[Arbëreshë]]; the old native term denoting ancient and medieval Albanians and sharing the same root with the latter. At the time the country was called Arbër ([[Gheg]]: Arbën) and Arbëria ([[Gheg]]: Arbënia). This term is still used for the Albanians that migrated to Italy during the Middle Ages.
*[[Arnauts]] (ارناود); old term used mainly from Turks and by extension by European authors during the Ottoman Empire. A derivate of the Turkish ''Arvanid'' (اروانيد), which derives from the Greek ''Arvanites''.
*[[Skipetar]]s; the historical rendering of the ethnonym ''Shqiptar'' (or ''Shqyptar'' by French, Austrian and German authors) in use from the 18th century (but probably earlier) to the present, the literal translation of which is ''subject of the eagle''. The term ''Šiptari'' is a derivation used by Yugoslavs which the Albanians consider derogatory, preferring ''Albanci'' instead.

===Albanians in the Middle Ages===
What is possibly the earliest written reference to the Albanians is that to be found in an old Bulgarian text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;R. Elsie: Early Albania, a Reader of Historical Texts, 11th - 17th Centuries, Wiesbaden 2003, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in a Serbian manuscript dated 1628 and was first published in 1934 by Radoslav Grujic. This fragment of a legend from the time of [[Tsar Samuel]] endeavours, in a catechismal 'question and answer' form, to explain the origins of peoples and languages. It divides the world into seventy-two languages and three religious categories: Orthodox, half-believers (i.e. non-Orthodox Christians) and non-believers. The Albanians find their place among the nations of half-believers. If we accept the dating of Grujic, which is based primarily upon the contents of the text as a whole, this would be the earliest written document referring to the Albanians as a people or language group.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from: ''Grujic, Radoslav'': Legenda iz vremena Cara Samuila o poreklu naroda. in: Glasnik skopskog naucnog drustva, Skopje, 13 (1934), p. 198 200. Translated from the Old Church Slavonic by Robert Elsie. First published in R. Elsie: Early Albania, a Reader of Historical Texts, 11th - 17th Centuries, Wiesbaden 2003, p. 3.''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''It can be seen that there are various languages on earth. Of them, there are five Orthodox languages: Bulgarian, Greek, Syrian, Iberian (Georgian) and Russian. Three of these have Orthodox alphabets: Greek, Bulgarian and Iberian. There are twelve languages of half-believers: Alamanians, Franks, Magyars (Hungarians), Indians, Jacobites, Armenians, Saxons, Lechs (Poles), '''Arbanasi''' (Albanians), Croatians, Hizi, Germans.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first undisputed mention of Albanians in the historical record is attested in Byzantine source for the first time in 1079-1080, in a work titled ''History'' by Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], who referred to the ''Albanoi'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the duke of [[Durrës|Dyrrachium]]. It is disputed, however, whether the &quot;Albanoi&quot; of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether &quot;Albanoi&quot; is a reference to [[Normans]] from [[Sicily]] under an archaic name (there was also tribe of Italy by the name of &quot;Albanoi&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;The wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins  G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series  Authors Alexandru Madgearu, Martin Gordon  Editor Martin Gordon  Translated by Alexandru Madgearu  Edition illustrated  Publisher Scarecrow Press, 2008  ISBN 0-8108-5846-0, 9780810858466 ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=EOIhpIu8KAQC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22origin+of+the+albanians%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=W4K3TJySNIyqsAOc1dCdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22origin%20of%20the%20albanians%22&amp;f=falseIt was supposed that those Albanoi from 1042 were Normans from Sicily, called by an archaic name (the Albanoi were an independent tribe from Southern Italy)], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaliates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078, is undisputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balkan Peninsula p. 25&quot;/&gt; At this point, they are already fully Christianized, although [[Albanian mythology]] and folklore are part of the [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Paleo-Balkan]] pagan mythology,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonnefoy1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonnefoy|first=Yves|title=American, African, and Old European mythologies|url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=GYjc5POwJjAC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=Although+Albanian+mythology+has+not+yet+been+the+subject+of+a+monograph&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QBwVTdPyGYOh8QPZ3rWFBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=Although%20Albanian%20mythology%20has%20not%20yet%20been%20the%20subject%20of%20a%20monograph%2C%20it%20has%20been%20treated%20in%20many%20essays%20and%20articles%20on%20linguistics%2C%20folklore%2C%20and%20ethnology.%20This%20mythology%20can%20be%20considered%20part%20of%20the%20of%20the%20Balkan%20pagan%20tradition&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 December 2010|date=1993-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06457-4|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular showing Greek influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], Charles J.

In 1271 [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] after he captured Durrës from [[Despotate of Epirus]], created the [[Kingdom of Albania]]. In 14th century a number of [[Albanian principalities]] were created.

===Albanians under the Ottoman Empire===
[[File:Albanians (1904) Dibra.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Some Albanians in Dibra]]
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] supremacy in the [[Balkan]] region began in 1385 with the [[Battle of Savra]] but was briefly interrupted in the 15th century, when [[Skanderbeg|Gjergj Kastrioti]], an Albanian warrior known as [[Skanderbeg]], allied with some Albanian chiefs, formed the [[League of Lezhe]] and fought-off Turkish rule from 1443–1478 (although Kastrioti died in 1468). Kastrioti's strongholds included [[Kruja]], [[Shkodra]], [[Durres]], [[Lezha]], [[Petrela]], [[Koxhaxhik]] and [[Berat]].

Upon the Ottomans' return, a large number of Albanians fled to Italy, Greece and [[Egypt]] and maintained their [[Arbëresh]] identity.

===Albanian national awakening===
{{See|Albanian national awakening}}
By the 1870s, the [[Sublime Porte]]'s reforms aimed at checking the Ottoman Empire's disintegration had clearly failed. The image of the &quot;Turkish yoke&quot; had become fixed in the nationalist mythologies and psyches of the empire's Balkan peoples, and their march toward independence quickened. The Albanians, because of the higher degree of Islamic influence, their internal social divisions, and the fear that they would lose their Albanian-populated lands to the emerging Balkan states—[[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Greece]]—were the last of the Balkan peoples to desire division from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth of Albania&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

==Distribution==
===Balkans===
Approximately 7 million Albanians are to be found within the Balkan peninsula{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} with only about half this number residing in Albania and the other divided between [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Greece]] and to a much smaller extent [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]].

Rights to use the [[Albanian language]] in education and government were given and guaranteed by the 1974 Constitution of [[SFRY]] and were widely utilized in Macedonia and in Montenegro before the [[Dissolution of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OTW9XKUmrxsC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Kosovo+1990#v=onepage&amp;q=tito&amp;f=false Civil resistance in Kosovo] By Howard Clark, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====

[[File:Tosk Albanians.jpg|thumb|right|200px|left|Tosk Albanians wearing traditional costumes from southern Albania.]]

Due to different waves of migration, Albanians and groups of Albanian descent are generally divided into three distinct groups.

The first group is that of [[Arvanites]] and [[Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace]], who retain a distinct ethnic identity, but self-identify nationally as Greeks. The [[Arvanites]] are descended from Tosk Albanians that migrated to Greece during the Middle Ages.  They are Greek Orthodox Christians, and though they traditionally speak a dialect of Tosk Albanian known as [[Arvanitika]], they have fully assimilated into the Greek nation and do not identify with the modern Albanian nation.  They reportedly resent the designation &quot;Albanians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;GHM (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arvanitika]] is in a state of attrition due to [[language shift]] towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.

The second group is that of the [[Cham Albanians]] and their descendants, in [[Epirus (periphery)|Epirus]], in northwestern Greece. [[Islam|Muslim]] Chams were [[Expulsion of Cham Albanians|expelled]] from Epirus during [[World War II]], by an [[EDES|anti-communist resistance group]], as a result of their participation in a [[EAM-ELAS|communist resistance group]] and the [[Axis-Cham Albanian collaboration|collaboration]] with the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].

Alongside these two Albanian-descended groups, about 10 percent of the population of Albania entered Greece after the fall of Communism, forming the [[Albanian immigrants in Greece|third community of Albanian origin]] in Greece, the largest single expatriate group in the country today and the country's largest population group after the ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]] majority.  Their numbers are thought to range between 200,000 and 500,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Diaspora===
{{Main|Albanian diaspora}}
{{Citations missing|section|date=November 2009}}

The largest Albanian diasporic communities outside of the Balkans are found in [[Turkey]] (about 1.3 million, 13% of Albanians, 1.7% of host population), [[Arbëreshë people|Italy]] (260,000), the [[Albanian American|United States]] (201,118; 0.09% of the total US population), [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]]  (ca. 200,000; about 2.5% of the total Swiss population), and [[Germany]] (over 300,000).

====Europe====
{{See|Albanians in Germany|Albanians in Italy|Albanians in Sweden|Albanians in Switzerland}}
Approximately 3 million are dispersed throughout the rest of Europe, most of these in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and France.

Italy has a historical Albanian minority known as the [[Arbëreshë]] which are scattered across [[Southern Italy]], but the majority of Italo-Albanians have arrived since 1991 to surpass that of the older populations of Arbëreshë.

====Turkey====
According to a 2008 report prepared for the National Security Council of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia, there were approximately 1,300,000 people of Albanian descent living in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Milliyet, Türkiyedeki Kürtlerin Sayısı. 2008-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt; A part of these people have assimilated to the culture of Turkey, and consider themselves more Turkish than Albanian. Nonetheless, more than 500,000 families of Albanian descents still recognize their ancestry like their languages, culture and traditions.

====Egypt====

In [[Egypt]] there are 18,000 Albanians, mostly [[Tosk]] speakers. Many are descendants of the soldiers of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], an Albanian who became [[Wāli]], and self-declared [[Khedive]] of Egypt and [[Sudan]]. In addition to the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|dynasty]] that he established, a large part of the former Egyptian and Sudanese [[aristocracy]] was of Albanian origin.

====Overseas====
According to data from the 2008 Census of the United States Government, there are 201,118 [[Albanian Americans]] (US citizens of full or partial Albanian descent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-_geoSkip=0&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G2000_C04003&amp;-tree_id=403&amp;-_skip=0&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-all_geo_types=N&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;-_showChild=Y&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_toggle=ACS_2008_1YR_G2000_C04003&amp;-SubjectID=14595646,|title=TOTAL ANCESTRY CATEGORIES TALLIED FOR PEOPLE WITH ONE OR MORE ANCESTRY CATEGORIES REPORTED|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] 22,000 in total. Albanians are also known to reside in China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan and Singapore, but the numbers are generally small. 200,000 in all these countries. Albanians have been present in [[Arab world|Arab]] countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria for about 5 centuries as a legacy of [[Ottoman Turk]]ish rule.

==Language==
{{Main|Albanian language}}

The Albanian language forms a separate branch of [[Indo-European]] languages family tree. A traditional view links the origin of Albanian with Illyrian, though this theory is broadly contested and challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Henrich Hock, Brian D. Joseph: [http://books.google.com/books?id=oGH-RCW1fzsC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=albanian+illyrian+language+linguistic&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=albanian%20illyrian%20language%20linguistic&amp;f=true Language history, language change, and language relationship], pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Unattested prior to the second half of the 15th century, the Albanian language is one of the youngest languages of Europe in terms of [[List of languages by first written accounts|first written account]].

Albanian in a revised form of the [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] dialect is the [[official language]] of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]]{{ref label|status|a|}}; and is official in the municipalities where there are more than 20% ethnic Albanian inhabitants in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It is also an official language of [[Montenegro]] where it is spoken in the municipalities with ethnic Albanian populations.

==Religion==
{{See also|Religion in Albania|Christianity in Albania|Islam in Albania|Judaism in Albania}}
The Albanians first appear in the historical record in [[Byzantine]] sources of the late 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Comnena, Anna. The Alexiad, Book IV.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Christianity was later overtaken by [[Islam]], which kept the scepter of the major religion during the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish rule from the 15th century until year 1912. [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] and [[Roman Catholicism]] continued to be practiced with less frequency.

During the 20th century the [[monarchy]] and later the [[totalitarian state]] followed a systematic [[State atheism|secularization]] of the nation and the national culture. This policy was chiefly  applied within the borders of the current Albanian state.  It produced a secular majority in the population. All forms of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and other religious practices were prohibited except for old non-institutional [[Pagan]] practices in the rural areas, which were seen as identifying with the national culture.  The current Albanian state has revived some pagan festivals,  such as the lunar [[Spring Day|Spring]] festival ({{lang-sq|Dita e Verës}}) held yearly on March 14 in the city of [[Elbasan]]. It is a national holiday.

A recent [[Pew Research Center]] demographic study put the percentage of [[Muslim]]s in Albania at 79.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = Tracy | month = October | year = 2009 | publisher = [[Pew Research Center]] | title = Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Muslim Population | format = PDF | url=http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf | accessdate = 2009-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} Most of the Muslims in Albania are [[Sunni Muslim]]s and [[Bektashi|Bektashi Shi'a Muslims]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/al.html Albania]. ''The World Factbook''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm#albania Muslims in Europe: Country guide: Albania]. [[BBC]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], predominantly in Southern Albania, bordering [[Greece]], and [[Albanian Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] is the main religion among those Albanians living predominantly in northern Albania, bordering the [[Republic of Montenegro]]. After 1992 an influx of foreign missionaries has brought more religious diversity with groups such as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormons]], [[Hindus]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], a variety of [[Christian]] denominations and others. This rich blend of religions has however rarely caused religious strife. People of different religions freely intermarry. For part of its history, Albania has also had a Jewish community. Some of the members of the Jewish community were saved by a group of Albanians during the Nazi occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juedisches-archiv-chfrank.de/kehilot/albania/alban-resc.htm Rescue in Albania: One Hundred Percent of Jews in Albania Rescued from Holocaust]&quot;. &quot;The Jews of Albania&quot;.

Retrieved on 29 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many left for Israel circa 1990-1992 after borders were open due to fall of communist regime in Albania, while in modern times about 200 Albanian Jews still live in Albania.

==Culture==
{{See|Culture of Albania|Albanian folklore|Albanian literature}}

[[Albanian music]] displays a variety of influences. Albanian folk music traditions differ by region, with major stylistic differences between the traditional music of the [[Ghegs]] in the north and [[Tosks]] in the south. Modern popular music has developed around the centers of [[Korca]], [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]]. Since the 1920s, some composers such as [[Fan S. Noli]] have also produced works of Albanian [[classical music]].

The '''Association for Computing Machinery''' ('''ACM''') is a [[learned society]] for [[computing]]. It was founded in 1947 as the world's first scientific and educational [[computing]] society.  Its membership is more than 92,000 as of 2009.  Its headquarters are in [[New York City]].

==Activities==
[[Image:Twopennplaza.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street view of top half of skyscraper against the sky; its outside is dominated by vertical black and white lines|Two Penn Plaza site of the ACM headquarters in New York City]]
ACM is organized into over 170 local chapters and 35 [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities.  Additionally, there are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]].

Many of the SIGs, like [[ACM SIGGRAPH|SIGGRAPH]], [[SIGPLAN]], [[SIGCSE]] and [[SIGCOMM]], sponsor regular conferences which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting new innovations in certain fields.  The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.

ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] (ICPC), and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between [[Garry Kasparov]] and the [[IBM Deep Blue]] computer.

==Services==
ACM Press publishes a prestigious academic journal,
''[[Journal of the ACM]]'', and general magazines for computer professionals, ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' (also known as ''Communications'' or ''CACM'') and ''[[ACM Queue|Queue]]''.  Other publications of the ACM include:
*''[[XRDS (magazine)|ACM XRDS]]'', formally &quot;Crossroads&quot; and renamed and designed in 2010, the most popular student computing magazine in the US.
*A number of journals, specific to subfields of computer science, titled ''ACM Transactions''.  Some of the more prominent transactions include:
**''[[ACM Transactions on Computer Systems]]'' (TOCS)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Database Systems]]'' (TODS)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Graphics]]'' (TOG)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software]]'' (TOMS)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems]]'' (TOPLAS)

Although ''Communications'' no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.

ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid subscribers online at its [[#Digital Library|Digital Library]] and also has a [[ACM Guide to Computing Literature|Guide to Computing Literature]]. Individual members additionally have access to [[Safari Books Online]] and [[Books24x7]]. The ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.

==Digital Library==
The ACM Digital Library, a part of the [[ACM Portal]], contains a comprehensive archive of the organization's journals, magazines, and conference proceedings.  Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest.

ACM requires the copyright of all submissions to be assigned to the organization as a condition of publishing the work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/ ACM Copyright Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors may post the documents on their own websites, but they are required to link back to the digital library's reference page for the paper.  Though authors are not allowed to charge for access to copies of their work, downloading a copy from the ACM site requires a paid subscription.

==Competition==
ACM's primary historical competitor has been the [[IEEE Computer Society]], which is the largest subgroup of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].  The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical [[computer science]], but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda.  They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joint Task Force of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), [[Association for Information Systems]] (AIS) and [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE-CS) |url=http://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf |title=Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the major awards in [[Computer science]] are given jointly by ACM and the [[IEEE Computer Society|IEEE-CS]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Ken Kennedy Award]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement.  Some authors see a centralized peer-review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like [[arXiv]].  Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as [[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)]], [[Journal of Machine Learning Research|Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)]] and the [[Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology]].

==Membership grades==
In addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and &quot;demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ ACM Senior Members-An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fellows===
{{See also|Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery}}
The '''ACM Fellows Program''' was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 &quot;to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM.&quot;

There are presently about 500 Fellows&lt;ref&gt;[http://fellows.acm.org/ List of ACM Fellows]&lt;/ref&gt; out of about 60,000 professional members.

===Other membership grades===
In 2006 ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades. Senior Members have ten or more years of membership and demonstrated performance.  Distinguished Engineers and Distinguished Scientists have at least 15 years of membership who &quot;have made a significant impact on the computing field&quot;.

==Chapters==

ACM has three kinds of chapters: [[Special Interest Group]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/sigs | title=ACM Special Interest Groups | accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Professional Chapters, and Student Chapters.

==Leadership==
The President of the ACM for 2010&amp;ndash;2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/acm-leaders-2010 ACM Elects New Leaders Committed to Expanding International Initiatives]&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Alain Chesnais]], a French citizen living in [[Toronto]] where he runs his company named Visual Transitions. He is the successor of [[Wendy Hall]] of the [[University of Southampton]].

ACM is led by a Council consisting of the President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Past President, SIG Governing Board Chair, Publications Board Chair, three representatives of the SIG Governing Board, and seven Members-At-Large.  This institution is often referred to simply as &quot;Council&quot; in ''Communications of the ACM''.

==Infrastructure==
ACM has five “Boards” that make up various committees and subgroups, to help Headquarters staff maintain quality services and products. These boards are as follows:

# Publications Board
# SIG Governing Board
# Education Board
# Membership Services Board
# Professions Board

==Council on women in computing (ACM-W)==
ACM-W, the ACM's council on [[women in computing]], is set up to support, inform, celebrate, and work with women in computing. Dr. [[Anita Borg]] was a great supporter of ACM-W. ACM-W provides various resources for women in computing as well as high school girls interested in the field. ACM-W also reaches out internationally to those women who are involved and interested in computing.

'''Anabaptists''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''ανα'' (again, twice) +''βαπτιζω'' (baptize), thus [[rebaptism|&quot;re-baptizers&quot;]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/anabaptist Anabaptist] at answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;) are [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christians]] of the [[Radical Reformation]] of 16th-century [[Europe]], and their direct descendants, particularly the [[Amish]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]].

Anabaptists rejected conventional Christian practices such as wearing wedding rings, taking oaths, and participating in civil government. They adhered to a [[Sermon on the Mount#Interpretation|literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount]] and [[Believer's baptism]]. 

The name ''Anabaptist'' is derived from the Latint term anabaptista, or &quot;one who baptizes over again&quot;, in reference to  practicing adult baptism, because, as a new faith, they baptized converts who already had been baptized (as infants) in the older Christian churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anabaptist Online Eytmological Dictionary], © 2001-2010 Douglas Harper, retrieved April 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Credobaptism]] (&quot;believers' baptism&quot;) was considered [[heresy]] by all other major Christian denominations at the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|reformation period]],  as many of them saw baptism as necessary for salvation and thus wrong to delay baptism until later in life.  Anabaptists required that candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so refused baptism to infants. As a result, Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both other [[Protestants]] and [[Roman Catholics]].

==Origins==
[[File:Spread of the Anabaptists 1525-1550.png|thumb|Spread of the early anabaptists in Central Europe]]

===Forerunners===
Though opinion is that Anabaptists, by name, began with the Radical Reformers in the 16th century, certain people and groups may still legitimately be considered their forerunners. [[Petr Chelčický]], 15th century [[Bohemia]]n ''Reformer'', taught most of the beliefs considered integral to Anabaptist theology. Medieval antecedents may include the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], the [[Hussite]]s, Dutch Sacramentists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/S2384.html|author= van der Zijpp, Nanne|title= Sacramentists|publisher= Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last = Fontaine | first = Piet F.M. | title = The Light and the Dark A cultural history of dualism  | place= Utrecht | publisher = Gopher Publishers | year = 2006 | volume = XXIII Postlutheran Reformation [http://home.wanadoo.nl/piet.fontaine/volumes/vol23/index1.htm?vol23_ch1_part1.htm Chapter I - part 1 Radical Reformation - Dutch Sacramentists] | url = http://home.wanadoo.nl/piet.fontaine/volumes/overview.htm | id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some forms of [[monasticism]]. The [[Waldensian]]s also represent a faith similar to the Anabaptists{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

In the following points Anabaptists resembled the medieval dissenters:

* They condemned oaths, and also the reference of disputes between believers to law-courts in accordance with {{Bibleref2|1Co|6:1-11|NIV|1 Corinthians 6:1-11}}.
* The believer must not bear arms or offer forcible resistance to wrongdoers, nor wield the sword.  No Christian has the [[jus gladii]] (the right of the sword).
* Civil government (''i.e.'', &quot;[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]&quot;) belongs to the world.  The believer, who belongs to God's kingdom, must not fill any office, nor hold any rank under government, which is to be passively obeyed.
* Sinners or unfaithful ones are to be excommunicated, and excluded from the sacraments and from intercourse with believers unless they repent, according to {{Bibleref2|1Co|5:9-13|NIV|1 Corinthians 5:9-13}}  and {{Bibleref2|Matt|18:15||Matthew 18:15 seq.}}  But no force is to be used towards them.
* Only some Anabaptists followed [[Menno Simons]] in teaching that Jesus did not take the flesh from his mother, but either brought his body from heaven or had one made for him by the Lord.  Some even said that he passed through his mother, as water through a pipe, into the world.  We often find this idea, originated by [[Marcion]] in the 2nd century, represented in pictures and sculptures of the 15th century and earlier.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}{{Dubious|date=September 2010}}  The Anabaptists were accused of denying the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of Christ, a charge that Menno Simons repeatedly rejected.

[[John Longland|Bishop Longland]] in [[England]] condemned an Anabaptist for repeating one of its maxims &quot;that alms should not be given before they did sweat in a man's hand.&quot; This was between 1518 and 1521.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historymedren.about.com/od/aentries/a/11_anabaptists_4.htm About.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views===
Research on the origins of the Anabaptists has been tainted both by the attempts of their enemies to slander them and the attempts of their supporters to vindicate them. It was long popular to simply lump all Anabaptists as Munsterites and radicals associated with the [[Zwickau prophets|Zwickau Prophets]], [[Jan Matthys]], [[John of Leiden]] (also Jan Bockelson van Leiden, Jan of Leyden), and [[Thomas Müntzer]]. Those desiring to correct this error tended to over-correct and deny all connections between the larger Anabaptist movement and this most radical element.

The modern era of Anabaptist historiography arose with the work of Roman Catholic scholar [[Carl Adolf Cornelius]]' publication of ''Die Geschichte des Münsterischen Aufruhrs'' in 1855 (The history of the Münster riot). Baptist historian [[Albert Henry Newman]] (1852–1933), who Bender{{who|reason=What Bender?! Bender the Robot?|date=May 2011}} said occupied &quot;first position in the field of American Anabaptist historiography,&quot; made a major contribution with his ''A History of Anti-Pedobaptism.'' Though a number of theories exist concerning origins, the three main ideas are:

* that Anabaptists began in a single expression in [[Zürich]] and spread from there (Monogenesis);
* that Anabaptists began through several independent movements ([[polygenism|polygenesis]]); and
* that Anabaptists are a continuation of New Testament Christianity ([[apostolic succession]] or church perpetuity).

====Monogenesis====
A number of scholars (''e.g.'', Bender, Estep, Friedmann {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}) have seen all the Anabaptists as rising out of the [[Swiss Brethren]] movement of [[Conrad Grebel]], [[Felix Manz]], [[George Blaurock]], et al.  The older view among Mennonite historians generally held that Anabaptism had its origins in [[Zürich]], and that the Anabaptism of the Swiss Brethren was transmitted to southern Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, where it developed into its various branches.  The monogenesis theory usually rejects the Münsterites and other radicals from the category of true Anabaptists.  In this view the time of origin is January 21, 1525, when Grebel baptized George Blaurock, and Blaurock baptized other followers.  This remains the most popular single time posited for the establishment of Anabaptism.  But in the last quarter of the 20th century, Deppermann, Packull, and others suggested that February 24, 1527 at Schleitheim is the proper date of the origin of Anabaptism. That day the Anabaptists made a declaration of belief called the [[Schleitheim Confession]]. This correlates with the following polygenesis theory.

====Polygenesis====
[[James M. Stayer]], [[Werner O. Packull]], and [[Klaus Deppermann]] disputed the idea of a single origin of Anabaptists in a 1975 essay entitled &quot;From Monogenesis to Polygenesis&quot;. That article, emphasizing distinctive characteristics and distinct sources, has become a widely accepted treatment of the plural origins of Anabaptism. The authors noted the agreement among previous Anabaptist historians on polygenesis even when disputing the date for a single starting point: &quot;Hillerbrand and Bender (like Holl and Troeltsch) were in agreement that there was a single dispersion of Anabaptism-..., which certainly ran through Zurich. The only question was whether or not it went back further to Saxony.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James M. Stayer, Werner O. Packull, and Klaus Deppermann, &quot;From Monogenesis to Polygenesis: the historical discussion of Anabaptist origins,&quot; Mennonite Quarterly Review 49.2 (Ap 1975): 83.&lt;/ref&gt; After criticizing the standard polygenetic history, the authors found six groups in early Anabaptism which could be collapsed into three originating &quot;points of departure&quot;: &quot;South German Anabaptism, the Swiss Brethren and the Melchiorites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stayer, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; South German–Austrian Anabaptism &quot;was a diluted form of [[Rhineland mysticism]],&quot; Swiss Anabaptism &quot;arose out of Reformed [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalism]]&quot;, and Dutch Anabaptism was formed by &quot;Social unrest and the apocalyptic visions of [[Melchior Hoffman]]&quot;. [[Pilgram Marpeck|Pilgram Marpeck's]] ''Vermanung'' of 1542 was deeply influenced by the ''Bekenntnisse'' of 1533 by Münster theologian [[Bernhard Rothmann]]. The Hutterites used Melchior Hoffman's commentary on the Apocalypse shortly after he wrote it. [[David Joris]], a disciple of Hoffman, was the most important Anabaptist leader in the Netherlands before 1540. Grete Mecenseffy and Walter Klaassen established links between Thomas Müntzer and Hans Hut, and the work of Gottfried Seebaß and Werner Packull clearly showed the influence of Thomas Müntzer on the formation of South German Anabaptism. Steven Ozment's work linked [[Hans Denck]] and [[Hans Hut]] with Thomas Müntzer, [[Sebastian Franck]], and others. Calvin Pater has shown that [[Andreas Karlstadt]] influenced Swiss Anabaptism in areas including his view of Scripture, doctrine of the church, and views on baptism.

====Apostolic succession====
[[Baptist successionism|Baptist successionists]] have, at times, pointed to 16th century Anabaptists as part of an [[apostolic succession]] of churches (&quot;church perpetuity&quot;) from the time of Christ{{Citation needed|reason=POSS. A CONFUSION WITH AN OBSOLETE BAPTIST STANCE|date=May 2010}}.

The opponents of this theory emphasize that these non-Catholic groups clearly differed from each other, that they held some heretical views (that is, heretical even by baptist standards, such as the Adoptionism of the [[Paulicianists]]; some of the other groups often cited were in fact little different from the Catholics and not at all similar to the Baptists), are not successors of the Apostles, or that they had no connection with one another with origins that are separate both in time and place. This view is held by some Baptists, some Mennonites, and a number of &quot;true church&quot; movements.&lt;ref&gt;A &quot;''true church''&quot; movement is a part of the Protestant or Reformed group of Christianity that claims to represent the true faith and order of New Testament Christianity. Most only assert this in relation to their church doctrines, polity, and practice (e.g., the ordinances), while a few hold they are the only true Christians. Some examples of ''Anabaptistic'' true church movements are the [[Landmark Baptist Church|Landmark Baptists]] and the [[Church of God in Christ, Mennonite]]. The [[Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee)]], the Stone-Campbell [[restoration movement]], and others represent a variation in which the &quot;true church&quot; apostatized and was restored, in distinction to this idea of apostolic or church succession. These groups trace their &quot;true church&quot; status through means other than those generally accepted by Roman Catholicism or Orthodox Christianity, both of which likewise claim to represent the true faith and order of New Testament Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat related to this is the theory that the Anabaptists are of Waldensian origin. Some hold the idea that the Waldenses are part of the apostolic succession, while others simply believe they were an independent group out of whom the Anabaptists arose. Estep asserts &quot;the Waldenses disappeared in Switzerland a century before the rise of the Anabaptist movement.&quot; Ludwig Keller, Thomas M. Lindsay, H. C. Vedder, Delbert Grätz, [[John T. Christian]] and [[Thieleman J. van Braght]] all held, in varying degrees, the position that the Anabaptists were of Waldensian origin.

==Types==
{{Protestantism}}
{{Main|Theology of Anabaptism}}
Different types exist among the Anabaptists, although the categorizations tend to vary with the scholar's viewpoint on origins. Estep claims that in order to understand Anabaptism, one must &quot;distinguish between the Anabaptists, inspirationists, and rationalists.&quot; He classes the likes of Blaurock, Grebel, [[Balthasar Hubmaier]], Manz, Marpeck, and Simons as Anabaptists. He groups Müntzer, Storch, et al. as inspirationists, and anti-trinitarians such as [[Michael Servetus]], [[Juan de Valdes|Juan de Valdés]], [[Sebastian Castellio]], and [[Faustus Socinus]] as [[rationalism|rationalists]]. Mark S. Ritchie follows this line of thought, saying, &quot;The Anabaptists were one of several branches of 'Radical' reformers (i.e. reformers that went further than the mainstream Reformers) to arise out of the Renaissance and Reformation. Two other branches were Spirituals or Inspirationists, who believed that they had received direct revelation from the Spirit, and rationalists or anti-Trinitarians, who rebelled against traditional Christian doctrine, like Michael Servetus.&quot;

Those of the polygenesis viewpoint use ''Anabaptist'' to define the larger movement, and include the inspirationists and rationalists as true Anabaptists. James M. Stayer used the term ''Anabaptist'' for those who ''rebaptized'' persons already baptized in infancy. Walter Klaassen was perhaps the first Mennonite scholar to define ''Anabaptists'' that way in his 1960 Oxford dissertation. This represents a rejection of the previous standard held by Mennonite scholars such as Bender and Friedmann.

Another method of categorization acknowledges regional variations, such as Swiss Brethren (Grebel, Manz), Dutch and [[Frisia]]n Anabaptism (Menno Simons, [[Dirk Philips]]), and South German Anabaptism (Hübmaier, Marpeck).

Historians and sociologists have made further distinctions between radical Anabaptists, who were prepared to use violence in their attempts to build a [[New Jerusalem]], and their pacifist brethren, later broadly known as [[Mennonites]]. Radical Anabaptist groups included the Münsterites, who occupied and held the German city of [[Münster]] in 1534–5, and the [[Batenburgers]], who persisted in various guises as late as the 1570s.

===Charismatic manifestations===
Within the inspirationist wing of the Anabaptist movement, it was not unusual for charismatic manifestations to appear, such as dancing, falling under the power of the Holy Spirit, &quot;prophetic processions&quot; (at Zurich in 1525, at Munster in 1534 and at Amsterdam in 1535),&lt;ref&gt;Walter Klaassen, Anabaptism: Neither Catholic Nor Protestant (Waterloo, Ontario: Conrad Press, 1973), 63&lt;/ref&gt; and speaking in tongues.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin H. Little, The Origins of Sectarian Protestantism (New York: Beacons, 1964), 19&lt;/ref&gt;  In Germany some Anabaptists, &quot;excited by mass hysteria, experienced healings, glossolalia, contortions and other manifestations of a camp-meeting revival&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;George Williams, The Radical Reformation (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1962), 443&lt;/ref&gt;  The Anabaptist congregations that later developed into the Mennonite and Hutterite churches tended not to promote these manifestations, but did not totally reject the miraculous. [[Pilgram Marpeck]], for example, wrote against the exclusion of miracles: &quot;Nor does Scripture assert this exclusion...God has a free hand even in these last days.&quot; Referring to some who had been raised from the dead, he wrote: &quot;Many of them have remained constant, enduring tortures inflicted by sword, rope, fire and water and suffering terrible, tyrannical, unheard-of deaths and martyrdoms, all of which they could easily have avoided by recantation. Moreover one also marvels when he sees how the faithful God (who, after all, overflows with goodness) raises from the dead several such brothers and sisters of Christ after they were hanged, drowned, or killed in other ways. Even today, they are found alive and we can hear their own testimony...Cannot everyone who sees, even the blind, say with a good conscience that such things are a powerful, unusual, and miraculous act of God? Those who would deny it must be hardened men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;William Klassen and Walter Klassen, ed. and trans&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Writings of Pilgram Marpeck (Scottdale, PA: Herald, 1978), 50&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hutterite]] Chronicle and The Martyr's Mirror record several accounts of miraculous events, such as when a man named Martin prophesied while being  led across a bridge to his execution in 1531: &quot;...this once yet the pious are led over this bridge, but no more hereafter.&quot; Just &quot;a short time afterwards such a violent storm and flood came that the bridge was demolished&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Martyrs' Mirror (Scottdale: Herald Press, 1950), 440&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holy Spirit leadership===
The Anabaptists insisted upon the &quot;free course&quot; of the Holy Spirit in worship, yet still maintained it all must be judged according to the Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Oyer, Lutheran Reformers Against Anabaptists (The Hague: M. Nijhoff, 1964), 86&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss Anabaptist document  titled &quot;Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana-)Baptists - Why They Do Not Attend the Churches&quot;. One reason given for not attending the state churches was that these institutions forbade the congregation to exercise spiritual gifts according to &quot;the Christian order as taught in the gospel or the Word of God in 1 Corinthians 14.&quot; &quot;When such believers come together, &quot;Everyone of you (note every one) hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation,&quot; and so on..When someone comes to church and constantly hears only one person speaking, and all the listeners are silent, neither speaking nor prophesying, who can or will regard or confess the same to be a spiritual congregation, or confess according to 1 Corinthians 14 that God is dwelling and operating in them through His Holy Spirit with His gifts, impelling them one after another in the above-mentioned order of speaking and prophesying&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Peachey and Shem Peachey, trans., &quot;Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana-)Baptists - Why They Do Not Attend the Churches,&quot; Mennonite Quarterly Review 45, no. 1 (1971): 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1520s and 1530s===
In the 1520s and 1530s Anabaptist preachers spread the movement throughout central Europe, and authorities, either from a lack of knowledge about the new sect, desire to maintain orthodox doctrine, or a variety of other nuanced reasons, usually responded with executions and banishment although a few leaders did exercise moderation in dealing with the Anabaptists.

====Zwickau prophets and the Peasants' War====
{{Main|Thomas Müntzer|Zwickau prophets|Peasants' War}}
On December 27, 1521, [[Zwickau prophets|three &quot;prophets&quot;]], influenced by and in turn influencing [[Thomas Müntzer]], appeared in [[Wittenberg]] from [[Zwickau]]: Thomas Dreschel, [[Nicolas Storch]] and Mark Thomas Stübner. The crisis came in the Peasants' War in southern [[Germany]] in 1525. In its origin a revolt against feudal oppression, it became, under the leadership of Müntzer, a war against all constituted authorities, and an attempt to establish by revolution an ideal Christian commonwealth, with absolute equality and the community of goods. There were some common points between the Zwickau prophets and the later-developed Anabaptists.  Although Anabaptist were executed during this time in history, there is no known evidence that the Anabaptist practiced this on other Christian groups.

===Münster Rebellion===
{{Main|Münster Rebellion|Münster}}
A second and more determined attempt to establish a theocracy was made at Münster in [[Westphalia]] (1532–5), led by [[Bernhard Rothmann]], [[Bernhard Knipperdolling]], [[Jan Matthys]] and [[John of Leiden]].

===Persecutions and migrations===
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2009}}
[[Image:Dirk.willems.rescue.ncs.jpg|thumb|Dirk Willems saves his pursuer.]]
Much of the historic [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] literature has represented the Anabaptists as groups who preached false doctrine and led people into apostasy. That negative historiography remained popular for about four centuries. The Roman Catholics and Protestants alike persecuted the Anabaptists, resorted to torture and other types of physical abuse, in attempts to curb the growth of the movement. The Protestants under [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]] were the first to persecute the Anabaptists. Felix Manz became the first martyr in 1527. The Anabaptists were the most persecuted sect throughout the Catholic Reformation, mainly because they broke away from the Catholic Church and questioned many of the main Catholic beliefs.

On May 20, 1527, Roman Catholic authorities executed [[Michael Sattler]]. King Ferdinand declared drowning (called the ''third baptism'') &quot;the best antidote to Anabaptism&quot;. The Tudor regime, even those that were Protestant ([[Edward VI of England]] and [[Elizabeth I of England]]) persecuted Anabaptists as they were deemed too radical and therefore a danger to religious stability.   The persecution of Anabaptists was condoned by ancient laws of [[Theodosius I]] and [[Justinian I]] that were passed against the [[Donatists]] which decreed the death penalty for any who practiced rebaptism.

Thieleman J. van Braght's ''[[Martyrs Mirror]]'' describes the persecution and execution of thousands of Anabaptists, such as [[Dirk Willems]],  in Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other parts of Europe between 1525 and 1660. Continuing persecution in [[Europe]] was largely responsible for the mass immigrations to North America by Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites.
There is no known account in history of persecution of other Christians by Anabaptists as a group.

==Today==
===Anabaptists===
Several existing denominational bodies may be regarded as the successors of the continental Anabaptists: [[Amish]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Brethren]], [[Hutterite]]s, [[Mennonite]]s and to some extent the [[Bruderhof Communities]]. Some historical connections have been demonstrated for all of these spiritual descendants, though perhaps not as clearly as the noted institutionally lineal descendants. Although many see the more well-known Anabaptist groups (Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites) as ethnic groups, the Anabaptist bodies of today are no longer composed mostly of descendants of the continental Anabaptists. Total worldwide membership of the Mennonite, [[Brethren in Christ]] and related churches totals 1,616, and 126 (as of 2009) with about 60 percent in Africa, Asia and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mennonite World Conference]] [http://www.mwc-cmm.org/en15/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=384:08-oct-2009-2009-new-global-map-locates-16-million-anabaptists&amp;catid=28:news-releases-current&amp;Itemid=108 2009 New global map locates 1.6 million Anabaptists]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
The [[Bruderhof Communities]] were founded in Germany by [[Eberhard Arnold]] in 1920, establishing and organisationally joining the Hutterites in 1930. The group moved to England after Gestapo confiscated their property in 1933, and subsequently to Paraguay to avoid military conscription, and by settlements moved to USA after the [[World War II]]. They are not recognized by more conservative Hutterites.

Groups deriving from the [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], often called [[German Baptist]]s, while not directly descended from the 16th-century Anabaptists, are usually considered Anabaptist because of an almost identical doctrine and practice. The modern-day Brethren movement is a combination of Anabaptism and [[Radical Pietism]].

[[Puritan]]s of England and their [[Baptist]] branch arose independently, but were influenced by the Anabaptist movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/bc1644.htm London Baptist Confession of Faith A.D. 1644, &quot;Of those Churches which are commonly (though falsely) called ANABAPTISTS;&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anabaptist characters exist in popular culture, most notably [[Chaplain Tappman]] in [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel ''[[Catch-22]]'', James in [[Voltaire]]'s novella ''[[Candide]]'', [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]’s opera ''[[Le prophète]]'' (1849), and the central character in the novel ''[[Q (novel)|Q]]'', by the collective known as &quot;Luther Blissett&quot;.

==Later influences==
*[[Bible]] as the [[sola scriptura|sole rule of faith and practice]] - The Authority of the Scripture
*[[Freedom of religion]] - Liberty of Conscience
*[[Separation of church and state]]
*[[Pacifism]] or [[Nonresistance]]
*Separation or Nonconformity to the World
*Voluntary Church Membership and Believer's Baptism
*Evangelistic Zeal
*[[Priesthood of all believers]]

The Anabaptists were early promoters of a free church and freedom of religion (sometimes associated with separation of church and state).&lt;ref&gt;The origins of religious freedom in the [[United States]] is traced back to the Anabaptists in Verduin, Leonard ''That First Amendment and The Remnant'' published by [[The Christian Hymnary]] Publishers (1998) ISBN 1-890050-17-2&lt;/ref&gt;  When it was introduced by the Anabaptists in the 15th and 16th centuries, religious freedom independent of the state was unthinkable to both clerical and governmental leaders. Religious liberty was equated with anarchy; Kropotkin&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Anarchism''&quot; from The Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910 By Peter Kropotkin.&lt;/ref&gt; traces the birth of anarchist thought in Europe to these early Anabaptist communities.

According to Estep:{{quote|Where men believe in the freedom of religion, supported by a guarantee of separation of church and state, they have entered into that heritage. Where men have caught the Anabaptist vision of discipleship, they have become worthy of that heritage. Where corporate discipleship submits itself to the New Testament pattern of the church, the heir has then entered full possession of his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Anabaptist Story'' &amp;ndash; see Bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Southeast Alaska''', sometimes referred to as the '''Alaska Panhandle''', is the southeastern portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]], which lies west of the northern half of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]]. The majority of Southeast Alaska's area is part of the [[Tongass National Forest]], the United States' largest [[United States National Forest|national forest]]. In many places, the [[international border]] runs along the crest of the [[Boundary Ranges]] of the [[Coast Mountains]] (see [[Alaska boundary dispute]]). The region is noted for its mild rainy climate and beautiful scenery.

[[Image:TongassForest1.jpg|thumb|right|The Tongass National Forest, near [[Ketchikan]]]]
[[Image:CruiseShipsKetchikan.jpg|thumb|right|Cruise ships at Ketchikan]]

==Geography==
Southeast Alaska is the northern terminus of the [[Inside Passage]], a protected waterway of convoluted passages between islands and fjords, beginning in [[Puget Sound]] in [[Washington state]]. This was an important travel corridor for native canoeists, as well as gold-rush steam ships, and in modern times is an important route for ferries and cruise ships.  
Southeast Alaska has a land area of {{convert|35138|mi|km}}, comprising six entire [[county-equivalent|borough]]s and three [[census area]]s, in addition to the part of [[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat Borough]] lying east of [[141st meridian west|141° West]] longitude. Although it has only 6.14 percent of Alaska's land area, it is larger than the state of [[Maine]], and almost as large as the state of [[Indiana]]. The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] population of Southeast was 72,954 inhabitants, about 42 percent of whom were concentrated in the city of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]].
*[[Haines Borough, Alaska|Haines Borough]]
*[[Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska|Hoonah-Angoon Census Area]]
*[[Juneau City and Borough, Alaska|Juneau Borough]]
*[[Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska|Ketchikan Gateway Borough]]
*[[Petersburg Census Area, Alaska|Petersburg Census Area]]
*[[Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Alaska|Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area]]
*[[Sitka City and Borough, Alaska|Sitka Borough]]
*[[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway Borough]]
*[[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell Borough]]
*[[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat Borough]] (the part east of [[141st meridian west|141° W]]  longitude; 12,506.53&amp;nbsp;km² / 4,828.80&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi, or about 63.12 percent of the borough)
It includes the [[Tongass National Forest]], [[Glacier Bay National Park]], [[Admiralty Island National Monument]], [[Misty Fjords National Monument]], [[Alaska's Inside Passage]], and myriad large and small islands. The largest islands are, from North to South, [[Chichagof Island]], [[Admiralty Island]], [[Baranof Island]], [[Kupreanof Island]], [[Revillagigedo Island]] and [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]. Major bodies of water of Southeast Alaska include [[Glacier Bay]], [[Lynn Canal]], [[Icy Strait]], [[Chatham Strait]], [[Stephens Passage]], [[Frederick Sound]], [[Sumner Strait]], and [[Clarence Strait]].

On August 20, 1902, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the [[Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve]], which formed the heart of the [[Tongass National Forest|Tongass]] [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] that covers most of the region.

==National Parks and Monuments==
*[[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve]]
*[[Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park]]
*[[Sitka National Historical Park]]
*[[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve]] (part, the southeasternmost section only)
*[[Admiralty Island National Monument]]
*[[Misty Fjords National Monument]]

==Ecology==
Southeast Alaska is a [[temperate rain forest]] within the [[Pacific temperate rain forest]] zone, as classified by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[ecoregion]] system, which extends from northern [[California]] to [[Prince William Sound]]. The most common tree species are [[sitka spruce]] and [[western hemlock]].
Wildlife includes [[brown bear]]s, [[American Black Bear|black bears]], [[wolf|wolves]], [[Sitka deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[orca]]s, five species of [[salmon]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[harlequin duck]]s, [[scoter]]s, and [[Marbled Murrelet|marbled murrelet]]s.

==Cities and towns==
Major cities are [[Juneau City and Borough, Alaska|Juneau]], [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], and [[Sitka City and Borough, Alaska|Sitka]]. Other towns are [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]], [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]], [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hoonah, Alaska|Hoonah]], [[Angoon, Alaska|Angoon]], [[Kake, Alaska|Kake]], [[Craig, Alaska|Craig]], [[Klawock, Alaska|Klawock]], [[Thorne Bay, Alaska|Thorne Bay]], [[Yakutat, Alaska|Yakutat]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], and [[Gustavus, Alaska|Gustavus]]. There are also many tiny (under 100 people) towns and villages, such as [[Baranof Warm Springs, Alaska|Baranof Warm Springs]], [[Edna Bay, Alaska|Edna Bay]], [[Elfin Cove, Alaska|Elfin Cove]], [[Excursion Inlet, Alaska|Excursion Inlet]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]], [[Meyers Chuck, Alaska|Meyers Chuck]], [[Pelican, Alaska|Pelican]], [[Port Alexander, Alaska|Port Alexander]], [[Port Frederick, Alaska|Port Frederick]], [[Port Protection, Alaska|Port Protection]], and [[Tenakee Springs, Alaska|Tenakee Springs]].

==Culture==
[[File:Raventotemsitka.jpg|thumb|right|Totem pole at [[Sitka National Historical Park]]]]
This area is the traditional homeland of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people, and home of a historic settling of [[Haida people|Haida]] as well as a modern settlement of [[Tsimshian]]. The region is closely connected to [[Seattle]] and the American [[Pacific Northwest]] economically and culturally.

==Industry==
Major industries in Southeast Alaska include [[commercial fishing]] and [[tourism]] (primarily the cruise ship industry).  [[Logging]] has been an important industry in the past, but has been steadily declining with competition from other areas and the closure of the region's major pulp mills.

==Transportation==
Due to the extremely rugged, mountainous nature of Southeastern Alaska, almost all communities (with the exception of Hyder, Skagway, and Haines) have no road connections outside of their locale, so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport. The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] passes through this region.

===Air transportation===
[[Alaska Airlines]] is by far the largest air carrier in the region, with Juneau's [[Juneau International Airport]] serving as the aerial hub for all of Southeast and Ketchikan's [[Ketchikan International Airport]] serving as a secondary hub for southern Southeast Alaska. However, Alaska Airline's [[Boeing 737]]s can only be handled by a few airports in the region and Alaska's [[Alaska Bush|bush]] airlines and [[air taxi]]s serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions. 

===Marine transportation===
Southeast Alaska is primarily served by the state-run Alaska Marine Highway and secondarily by the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]-based [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]]. Small companies like Sitka-based Allen Marine and other independent operators in the [[Lynn Canal]] occasionally also offer marine passenger service. Ship traffic in the area is seasonally busy with [[cruise ship]]s.

The '''[[Alaska]] Interior''' covers most of the [[U.S. state]]'s territory. It is largely [[wilderness]]. Mountains include [[Mount McKinley]] (Denali) in the [[Alaska Range]], the [[Wrangell Mountains]], and the [[Ray Mountains]].

The largest city in the interior is [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]]'s second-largest city, in the [[Tanana Valley]]. Other towns include [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]], just southeast of Fairbanks, [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]], [[Tok, Alaska|Tok]], [[Glennallen, Alaska|Glennallen]], [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]], [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], [[Anderson, Alaska|Anderson]], [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] and [[Cantwell, Alaska|Cantwell]].

== Climate ==
[[File:Big Dipper and Aurora.jpg.jpg|thumb|Northern Lights &amp; Big Dipper at Fairbanks, AK during September.]]

Interior Alaska experiences extreme seasonal temperature variability. Winter temperatures in Fairbanks average −12 °F (−24 °C) and summer temperatures average +62 °F (+17 °C). Temperatures there have been recorded as low as −65 °F (−54 °C) in mid-winter, and as high as +99 °F (+37 °C) in summer. Both the highest and lowest temperature records for the state were set in the Interior, with 100 °F (38 °C) in [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] and −80 °F (−64 °C) in [[Prospect Creek, Alaska|Prospect Creek]].&lt;ref name=DRI&gt;{{cite web | title = State Extremes | publisher = Western Regional Climate Center, [[Desert Research Institute]] | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures within a given winter are highly variable as well; extended cold snaps of forty below zero can be followed by unseasonable warmth with temperatures above freezing due to [[chinook wind]] effects.

Summers can be warm and dry for extended periods creating ideal fire weather conditions. Weak thunderstorms produce mostly dry lightning, sparking wildfires that are mostly left to burn themselves out as they are often far from populated areas. The [[2004 Alaska fire season|2004 season]] set a new record with over {{convert|6600000|acre|km2}} burned.
[[File:Lakesalaskarange.JPG|thumb|left|Lakes and peaks of the Alaska Range seen from the [[Denali Highway]]]]
The average annual precipitation in Fairbanks is 11.3&amp;nbsp;inches (28.7&amp;nbsp;cm).  Most of this comes in the form of snow during the winter.  Most storms in the interior of Alaska originate in the [[Gulf of Alaska]], south of the state, though these storms often have limited precipitation due to a [[rain shadow]] effect caused by the [[Alaska Range]]. 

On clear winter nights, the [[aurora borealis]] can often be seen dancing in the sky.  Like all subarctic regions, the months from May to July in the summer have no night, only a twilight during the night hours. The months of November to January have little daylight.  Fairbanks receives an average 21 hours of daylight between May 10 and August 2 each summer, and an average of less than four hours of daylight between November 18 and January 24 each winter.

The interior of Alaska is largely underlined by discontinuous [[permafrost]], which grades to continuous permafrost as the [[Arctic Circle]] is approached.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''And did those feet in ancient time'''&quot; is a short [[poetry|poem]] by [[William Blake]] from the preface to his epic ''[[Milton a Poem]]''. The date on the title page of 1804 for ''Milton'' is probably when the plates were begun but the poem was printed c. 1808.&lt;ref name=cocel&gt;Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', &quot;1808&quot;, p 289, Oxford University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-19-860634-6&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is best known as the [[anthem]] &quot;'''Jerusalem'''&quot;, with music written by Sir [[Hubert Parry]] in 1916.

The poem was inspired by the [[apocryphal]] story that a young [[Jesus]], accompanied by his uncle [[Joseph of Arimathea]], travelled to the area that is now England and visited [[Glastonbury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICONS1&quot;&gt;ICONS - a portrait of England. Icon: Jerusalem (hymn) [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/features/and-did-those-feet Feature: And did those feet?] Accessed 2008-08-07&lt;/ref&gt; The legend is linked to an idea in the [[Book of Revelation]] (3:12 and 21:2) describing a [[Second Coming]], wherein Jesus establishes a new [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Christianity|Christian]] church in general, and the [[Church of England|English Church]] in particular, used Jerusalem as a metaphor for [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], a place of universal love and peace.&lt;ref&gt;The hymn 'Jerusalem the Golden with milk and honey blessed... I know not oh I know not what joys await me there....' uses Jerusalem for the same metaphor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehope.org/RHJ4.htm Realising the Heavenly Jerusalem ''The Academy of Jerusalem Monographs'' - Vol 3 March 95 Yitzhak I. Hayut-Man]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake implies that a visit of Jesus would briefly create heaven in England, in contrast to the &quot;dark Satanic Mills&quot; of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Analysts note that Blake asks four questions rather than stating a visit to be true. According to this view, the poem says that there may, or may not, have been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England. But that was then; now, we are faced with the challenge of creating such a country once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/onepassions/2008/10/whats-your-anthem.html |title= '&amp;#39;The One Show'&amp;#39; |publisher=BBC |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/bring-no-spears-to-jerusalem-1347934.html John Walsh ''[[The Independent]]'' 18 May 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
And did those feet in ancient time.
Walk upon England's mountains green:
And was the holy Lamb of God,
On Englands pleasant pastures seen!&lt;!-- This is the original text. Please do not &quot;correct&quot; it to &quot;England's&quot; --&gt;

And did the Countenance Divine,
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here,

Bring me my Bow of burning gold;
Bring me my Arrows of desire:
Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my Chariot of fire!

I will not cease from Mental Fight,

===''Dark Satanic Mills''===
[[File:Albion Flour Mills Bankside.jpg|thumb|Albion Flour Mills.]]
The term &quot;dark [[Satan]]ic Mills&quot;, which entered the [[English language]] from this poem, is interpreted as referring to the early [[Industrial Revolution]] and its destruction of nature and human relationships.&lt;ref&gt; Lienhard, John H.  1999 [http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1413.htm Poets in the Industrial Revolution.]  [[The Engines of Our Ingenuity]] No. 1413: (Revised transcription)&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been linked to the fate of the Albion Flour Mills, which was the first major factory in [[London]], designed by [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]] and [[Samuel Wyatt]] and built on land purchased by Wyatt in [[Southwark]]. This was a rotary steam-powered flour mill by  [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]], with grinding gears by Rennie,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southbanklondon.com/walkthisway/BuildingDetails.php?building=87 Walk This Way] from southbanklondon.com. Retrieved 7 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; producing 6,000 [[bushel]]s of flour a week.  The factory could have driven independent traditional millers out of business, but it was destroyed, perhaps deliberately, by fire in 1791. London's independent millers celebrated with placards reading, &quot;Success to the mills of [[Albion|ALBION]] but no Albion Mills.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICONS1&quot;/&gt; Opponents referred to the factory as satanic, and accused its owners of adulterating flour and using cheap imports at the expense of British producers. An illustration of the fire published at the time shows a [[devil]] squatting on the building.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Maidment, ''Reading Popular Prints, 1790-1870'', Manchester University Press, 2001, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; The mills were a short distance from Blake's home.

The phrase was especially poignant for the millions of workers employed in mills, who adopted the poem as a [[Socialist]] hymn.&lt;ref name=&quot;PortKaz&quot;&gt;[[Alfred Kazin]], Introduction to a volume of Blake. 1946&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop of Durham, [[N. T. Wright]], speaking in a [[homily]] given before the singing of the hymn, proposed the view that the &quot;dark satanic mills&quot; refers to the &quot;great churches&quot;.&lt;ref name=DurhBish&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], Bishop of Durham. 23 June 2007 &quot;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:licQ-BDcBNQJ:www.ntwrightpage.com/sermons/Durham_Wisdom.htm+churches+satanic+mills&amp;cd=41&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk Where Shall Wisdom be Found?]&quot; 175th anniversary of the founding of the University of Durham&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's phrase resonates with a wider theme in his works, what he envisioned as a physically and spiritually [[Political repression|repressive]] [[ideology]] based on a quantifiable reality.  Blake saw the [[cotton mill]]s and [[collieries]] of the period as a mechanism for the enslavement of millions, but the concepts underpinning the works had a wider application:&lt;ref name=&quot;PortKaz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HallGen&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.21learn.org/archive/articles/hall_genius.php|title=In Defense of Genius | last=Hall| first=Ernest| date=8 February 1996|work=Annual Lecture to the Arts Council of England|publisher=21st Century Learning Initiative|accessdate=2009-09-19}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|&quot;And all the Arts of Life they changed into the Arts of Death in Albion./...&lt;ref&gt;[[Incipit]] of citation given in Hall, 1996:  &quot;And all the Arts of Life they changed into the Arts of Death in Albion.
The hour-glass contemned because its simple workmanship
Was like the workmanship of the Plowman and the water-wheel

That raises water into cisterns, broken and burned with fire
Because its workmanship was like the workmanship of the shepherd;
And in their stead intricate wheels invented, wheel without wheel
To perplex youth in their outgoings and to bind to labours in
Albion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;|''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]'' Chapter 3. [[William Blake]]}}

===''Chariot of fire''===
The line from the poem, &quot;Bring me my Chariot of fire!&quot; draws on the story of [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2 Kings 2:11]], where the [[Old Testament]] prophet [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]] is taken directly to heaven: &quot;And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.&quot;  The phrase has become a byword for divine energy, and inspired the title of the 1981 film, ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.

===''Green and pleasant Land''===
Blake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of ''Milton'' when he was living in the village of [[Felpham]] in [[Sussex]]. Amanda Gilroy argues that the poem is informed by Blake's &quot;evident pleasure&quot; in the Felpham countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Amanda | last=Gilroy | title=Green and Pleasant Land: English Culture and the Romantic Countryside | publisher=Peeters Publishers | year=2004 | page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase &quot;green and pleasant land&quot; has become a [[collocation]] for identifiably English landscape or society.  It appears as a headline, title or sub-title in dozens{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} of articles and books.  Sometimes it refers, whether with appreciation, nostalgia or critical analysis, to idyllic or enigmatic aspects of the English countryside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/eric-ravilious-green-and-pleasant-land-2025022.html &quot;Eric Ravilious: Green and Pleasant Land,&quot; by Tom Lubbock, ''The Independent,'' 13 July 2010.]  Retrieved 7 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In other contexts it can suggest the perceived habits and aspirations of rural middle-class life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/06/britishidentity.features11 &quot;This green and pleasant land,&quot; by Tim Adams, ''The Observer,'' 10 April 2005.] Retrieved 7 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes it is used ironically.&lt;ref&gt;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/06/britishidentity.features11 &quot;Green and pleasant land?&quot; by Jeremy Paxman, ''The Guardian,'' 6 March 2007.]  Retrieved 7 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution===
Several of Blake's poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: &quot;As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)&quot;. He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in [[Protestant]] mystical [[allegory]]. Even though the poem was written during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Blake was an outspoken supporter of the [[French Revolution]], whose successor [[Napoleon]] claimed to be.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}&lt;!-- according to a drunk soldier, Blake found in his garden --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRblake.htm William Blake] Spartacus Educational (schoolnet.co) - Accessed 2008-08-07&lt;/ref&gt; The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. (In 1803 Blake was charged at [[Chichester]] with high treason for having 'uttered seditious and treasonable expressions' but was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/wblake.htm |title=William Blake (1757-1827)| accessdate= 2008-08-07 |publisher= Kirjasto.sci.fi }}&lt;/ref&gt;) The poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] ch. 11, v. 29: &quot;Would to God that all the Lord's people were prophets.&quot; [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland]], a Professor of Theology at [[Oxford University]], has argued that this includes

&lt;blockquote&gt;everyone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an &quot;honest persuasion&quot; that with personal struggle, things could be improved. A human being observes, is indignant and speaks out: it's a basic political maxim which is necessary for any age. Blake wanted to stir people from their intellectual slumbers, and the daily grind of their toil, to see that they were captivated in the grip of a culture which kept them thinking in ways which served the interests of the powerful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowland&quot;&gt;Rowland, C. 2007 [http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/arts_culture/literature/william_blake_visionary William Blake: a visionary for our time] openDemocracy.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of the poem &quot;stress the importance of people taking responsibility for change and building a better society 'in England's green and pleasant land.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowland&quot;/&gt;

==Popularisation==
The poem, which was little known during the century which followed its writing,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} was included in a patriotic anthology of verse published in 1916, a time when morale had begun to decline due to the high number of casualties in [[World War I]] and the perception that there was no end in sight.

Under these circumstances, the poem came to symbolise what England was fighting for. Therefore, [[Robert Bridges]], the [[Poet Laureate]], asked Sir Hubert Parry to put it to music at a Fight for Right campaign meeting in London's [[Queen's Hall]]. The aims of this organisation were &quot;to brace the spirit of the nation that the people of Great Britain, knowing that they are fighting for the best interests of humanity, may refuse any temptation, however insidious, to conclude a premature peace, and may accept with cheerfulness all the sacrifices necessary to bring the war to a satisfactory conclusion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilt&quot;&gt;Christopher Wiltshire (Former archivist, British Federation of Festivals for Music, Speech and Dance), [http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,3604,408355,00.html Guardian newspaper 8 December 2000 Letters: Tune into Jerusalem's fighting history] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 8 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Bridges asked Parry to supply the verse with &quot;suitable, simple music that an audience could take up and join in&quot;.

The poem's idealistic [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or [[subtext]] accounts for its popularity across the philosophical spectrum. It was used as a campaign slogan by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]]; [[Clement Attlee]] said they would build &quot;a new Jerusalem&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/tr_show01.html |title=Link to PBS script quoting Attlee in 1945 - Accessed 2008-08-07 |publisher=Pbs.org |date=1929-10-24 |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been sung at conferences of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], at the [[Glee Club (British politics)|Glee Club]] of the British [[Liberal Assembly]], the British Labour Party and by the British [[Liberal Democrats]].

== Parry's anthem &quot;Jerusalem&quot; ==
In adapting Blake's poem as an anthem, Parry deployed a two-[[stanza]] format, each taking up eight lines of Blake's original poem. He also provided a four-bar musical introduction and coda, echoing melodic [[motif (music)|motif]]s of the song.  And the word &quot;those&quot; was substituted for &quot;these&quot; (before &quot;dark satanic mills&quot;.) The [[sheet music| score]] was conducted by Parry's student [[Walford Davies]]; Parry afterward released it to him, saying &quot;There you are, my boy, do what you like with it.&quot;  Davies had it published by [[Curwen Press|Curwen]] and began teaching the tune.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilt&quot;/&gt; Originally Parry intended the first verse to be sung by a solo female voice, but this is rare in contemporary performances. The most famous version was [[orchestration | orchestrated]] by Sir [[Edward Elgar]] in 1922 for a large orchestra at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music) |Leeds Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICONS2&quot;&gt;ICONS - a portrait of England. Icon: Jerusalem (hymn) [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/biography/sir-hubert-parry Sir Hubert Parry], Jerusalem and Elgar's orchestration.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing the orchestral version for the first time, [[George V of the United Kingdom| King George V]] said that he preferred &quot;Jerusalem&quot; over &quot;[[God Save the King]]&quot;, the National Anthem.

''Jerusalem'' is considered to be [[England]]'s most popular [[patriotism|patriotic]] song; ''[[The New York Times]]'' said it was &quot;Fast becoming an [[Proposed English National Anthems|alternative national anthem]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/theater/20time.html?ref=arts | work=The New York Times | title=Time, and the Green and Pleasant Land | first=Ben | last=Brantley | date=20 July 2009 | accessdate= 23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have even been calls to give it official status.&lt;ref&gt; [http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=31408&amp;SESSION=875 Parliamentary Early Day Motion 2791, 18.10.2006]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; England has no official anthem and so uses the British National Anthem &quot;[[God Save the Queen]]&quot;, also an unofficial anthem, for some national occasions, such as before English international football matches. However, some sports, including [[rugby league]] use &quot;Jerusalem&quot; as the English anthem. Jerusalem is the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]]'s official hymn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthem4england.co.uk/category/correspondence/ |title= Correspondence |publisher=Anthem 4 England | place = UK |date= 8.5.2007 |accessdate= 2011-4-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; although God Save the Queen was the anthem sung before England's games in [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2010–11 Ashes series]]. Questions in [[British Parliament | Parliament]] have not clarified the situation, as answers from the relevant minister say that since there is no official national anthem, each sport must make its own decision.

As Parliament has not clarified the situation, Team England, the English Commonwealth team held a public poll in 2010 to decide which anthem should be played at medal ceremonies to celebrate an English win at the Commonwealth Games.  Jerusalem was selected by 52% of voters over Land of Hope and Glory (used since 1930) and God Save the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Sir Andrew Foster |url=http://www.weareengland.org/news.asp?itemid=327&amp;itemTitle=England+announce+victory+anthem+for+Delhi+chosen+by+the+public%21&amp;section=115&amp;sectionTitle=News |title=England announce victory anthem for Delhi chosen by the public! - Commonwealth Games England |publisher=Weare England |date=2010-5-30 | accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as a hymn===
Although the music was composed for an anthem or song, &quot;Jerusalem&quot; has been adopted by the Church and is frequently sung as an office or recessional hymn in English cathedrals, churches and chapels on [[St George's Day]].  It is also sung in some churches on Jerusalem Sunday, a day set aside to celebrate the holy city, in [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Churches]] throughout the world and even in some [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Churches]] in the US.

However, some vicars in the [[Church of England]], according to the [[BBC TV]] programme &quot;Jerusalem: An Anthem for England&quot;, have said that the song is not technically a [[hymn]], as it is not a prayer to God (which hymns always are).  Consequently, it is not sung in some churches in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Parry's tune is so well liked that the song is not only sung in many schools, especially [[Public school (UK)|public school]]s in [[Great Britain]] (it was used as the title music for the [[BBC]]'s 1979 series 'Public School' at [[Radley College]]) , but also at several private schools in [[Australia]], [[New England]] and [[Canada]]. Some attempts have also been made to increase its use elsewhere with other words.  The established [[Church of Scotland]] debated altering the words of the hymn to read &quot;[[Albion]]&quot; instead of England to make it more locally relevant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A widely published alternative hymn text for the tune is [[Carl P. Daw Jr.|Carl P. Daw]]'s ''O day of peace that dimly shines'' of 1982.

The popularity of Parry's setting has resulted in many hundreds of recordings being made, too numerous to list, of both traditional choral performances and new interpretations by popular music artists. Consequently only its most notable performances are listed below.

*It is sung every year by an audience of thousands at the end of the [[Last Night of the Proms]] in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and simultaneously in the ''Proms in the Park'' venues throughout the country.

*Each year it, along with [[The Red Flag]], is sung at the closing of the annual [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference.

*The song was used by the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=8553 |title=Link to SongFacts - Accessed 2008-08-07 |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, many [[Women's Institutes]] (WI) started closing meetings by singing it, and this caught on nationally. Although it has never actually been adopted as the WI's official anthem, in practice it holds that position, and is an enduring element of the public image of the WI.&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;Jam and ''Jerusalem''&quot; caricature of the WI is still current enough that they have a [[FAQ]] about it on their site at [http://www.thewi.org.uk/standard.aspx?id=12466]&lt;/ref&gt;

*It is traditionally sung before [[rugby league]]'s [[Challenge Cup]] Final, along with &quot;[[Abide with Me]]&quot;, and before the [[Super League Grand Final]].

*Since 2004, it has been the anthem of the [[England cricket team|England]] [[cricket]] team and is regularly sung by [[rugby union]] crowds.

*A recording by the [[Grimethorpe Colliery Band]] was performed in medal ceremonies when an [[England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games|English competitor at the 2010 Commonwealth Games]] was awarded gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.weareengland.org/page.asp?section=210&amp;sectionTitle=Nation+has+chosen+anthem+for+England%27s+medallists|title=Nation has chosen anthem for England's medallists: And did those feet in Ancient times walk upon England’s mountains green.....|publisher=[[Commonwealth Games England]]| quote=Now we can reveal that the anthem has been recorded for us by The Grimethorpe Colliery Band...The new official anthem of the England Team will be played for English athletes on the podium in Delhi when a Gold medal is won.|date=May/June 2010|accessdate=13 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/the-paralympian-taking-on-ablebodied-athletes-2095333.html|title=The Paralympian taking on able-bodied athletes|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 Oct 2010|accessdate=13 Oct 2010 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Turnbull}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO LIST PERFORMANCES OF JERUSALEM ON RECORD, FILM, TV OR THEATRE. LINKS TO MONTY PYTHON, BILLY BRAGG AND EMERSON, LAKE &amp; PALMER HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED--&gt;
&quot;Bring me my chariot of fire&quot; inspired the title of the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;welland&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/trivia IMDB trivia - Origin of title] - Accessed 11 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A church congregation sings &quot;Jerusalem&quot; at the close of the film and a performance appears on the ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' soundtrack performed by the [[Ambrosian Singers]] overlaid partly by a composition by [[Vangelis]]. The film's working title was &quot;Running&quot; until [[Colin Welland]] saw a TV programme, ''[[Songs of Praise]]'', featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;welland&quot; /&gt;

The hymn has featured in many other films and TV programmes including ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]'',''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'', ''[[Calendar Girls]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Goodnight Mister Tom (1998 film)|Goodnight Mr. Tom]]'', ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1969 film), ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', ''[[Circle]]'' (2000 Eddie Izzard stand-up tour), ''[[Shameless]]'', and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. A punk version is heard in [[Derek Jarman]]'s [[1977 in film|1977]] film ''[[Jubilee (film)|Jubilee]]''. In the theatre it appears in ''[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; ''[[Calendar Girls]]'' and in ''[[Time and the Conways]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; Punk band [[Bad religion|Bad Religion]] have borrowed the opening line of Blake's poem in their song &quot;God Song&quot;, from the 1990 album ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]''.

Blake's lyrics have also been set to music by other composers without reference to Parry's melody. The words, with some variations, are used in the track ''Jerusalem'' on [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s album ''[[The Chemical Wedding]]'', which also includes lines from book two of ''Milton''. [[Finn Coren]] also created a different musical setting for the poem on his album ''[[The Blake Project: Spring]]''.

'''''A Little Night Music''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and book by [[Hugh Wheeler]]. Inspired by the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English translation of the German name for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Eine kleine Nachtmusik|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], ''Eine kleine Nachtmusik''. The musical includes the popular song &quot;[[Send in the Clowns]]&quot;.

Since its original 1973 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, the musical has enjoyed professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]], by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups.  It was [[A Little Night Music (1977 film)|adapted for film in 1977]], with [[Harold Prince]] directing and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]] and [[Diana Rigg]] starring.

==Synopsis==
===Act One===
The setting is Sweden, around the year 1900. One by one, the Liebeslieders – five singers who comment like a  [[Greek chorus]] throughout the show – enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of &quot;Remember,&quot; &quot;Soon,&quot; and &quot;The Glamorous Life,&quot; leading into the first &quot;Night Waltz&quot;. The other characters enter [[waltz]]ing, each uncomfortable with their particular partner. After they drift back off, the aging and severe Madame Armfeldt and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night &quot;smiles&quot; three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur. Middle aged Fredrik Egerman is a successful lawyer. He has recently married an 18-year-old [[trophy wife]], Anne, a vain girl who is in love with Fredrik, but too immature to grasp the concept of marriage. The two have been married for eleven months, but Anne still protects her [[virginity]]. Fredrik laments his inability to [[sexual intercourse|make love]] to his wife (&quot;Now&quot;). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a year older than his stepmother, is feeling extremely frustrated. He is a [[seminary]] student and everyone is always teasing him, never taking him seriously or letting him talk (&quot;Later&quot;). Anne is intrigued by him, but fails to understand his real meaning. Anne promises her husband that she will consent to have sex shortly (&quot;Soon&quot;). Anne's [[maidservant]] Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.

Desiree Armfeldt is a prominent and glamorous actress who is now reduced to touring in small towns. Madame Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually puts off going to see her, preferring, somewhat ironically, &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;. She is performing near Fredrik's home, and he brings Anne to see the play. While there, Desiree notices Fredrik; the two were lovers years before. Anne, suspicious and annoyed because of Desiree's amorous glances, demands that Fredrik bring her home immediately. Meanwhile, Petra has been trying to seduce Henrik.

That night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her; the two share a happy but strained reunion, as they &quot;Remember&quot;. They reflect on their new lives, and Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne (&quot;You Must Meet My Wife&quot;). Desiree responds sarcastically, boasting of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married [[dragoon]], Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.

Madame Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past, and wonders what happened to her refined &quot;Liaisons&quot;. Back in Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his typical booming voice. Fredrik and Desiree fool the gullible Count into believing that their disheveled appearance was entirely innocent, but he is still suspicious. He instantly dislikes Fredrik and returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte is quite aware of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her (&quot;In Praise of Women&quot;). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed&amp;mdash;Charlotte's little sister is a school friend of Anne's.

Charlotte visits Anne, who is talking with Petra. Charlotte describes Fredrik's meeting with Desiree; Anne reacts with shock and horror. The older woman explains to Anne that such is the lot of a wife, and that marriage brings pain (&quot;Every Day A Little Death&quot;). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madame Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne, and Henrik. Though reluctant, Madame Armfeldt agrees. She sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends the women into a frenzy, imagining &quot;A Weekend in the Country&quot;. Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older woman and the young teenager. Meanwhile, the Count has plans of his own — as a birthday present to his wife, the pair will attend the party uninvited. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a [[duel]], while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The day of the party dawns.

===Act Two===
Armfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude (&quot;Night Waltz One and Two&quot;). Everyone arrives, each carrying their own amorous purposes and desires&amp;mdash;even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching [[manservant]], Frid. The women begin to act against each other. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses his deep love for Anne to her. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on how difficult it is to be annoyed with Desiree, agreeing &quot;It Would Have Been Wonderful&quot; had she not been quite so wonderful. Dinner is served, and the characters' &quot;Perpetual Anticipation&quot; enlivens that meal.

At dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik, while Anne and Desiree trade insults. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally stands up for himself. He shrieks at them for being completely [[amorality|amoral]], and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love, and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be &quot;rescued&quot; from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree, but only as a dream. Hurt and bitter, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life (&quot;Send in the Clowns&quot;). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him that she has feelings for him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid thinks of the joy and freedom that she longs for before becoming trapped in marriage (&quot;The Miller's Son&quot;). Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and the two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to romance Desiree, sees this and challenges Fredrik to [[Russian Roulette]], in which he grazes Fredrik's ear. Victorious, Carl-Magnus begins to romance Charlotte, granting her wish at last.

After the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madame Armfeldt discuss the chaos of the recent turns-of-events. The elderly woman then asks Fredrika a surprising question: &quot;What is it all for?&quot; Fredrika thinks about this, and decides that it &quot;must be worth it&quot;. Madame Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.

Fredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledges that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together (&quot;Finale&quot;). Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika. Fredrika tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully, but still has not seen the night smile. Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: Henrik and Anne, the young, and Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the &quot;third smile&quot;. Armfeldt closes her eyes, and dies peacefully.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|A Little Night Music (1977 film)}}
In 1977, a film version of ''[[A Little Night Music (1977 film)|A Little Night Music]]'' was released, starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]] and [[Diana Rigg]], with [[Len Cariou]], [[Hermione Gingold]] and [[Laurence Guittard]] reprising their Broadway roles.  The setting for the film was moved from Sweden to Austria. [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote lyrics for the &quot;Night Waltz&quot; theme (&quot;Love Takes Time&quot;) and wrote an entirely new version of &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot;, which has been incorporated into several subsequent productions of the stage musical. However, other songs, including &quot;In Praise of Women&quot;, &quot;The Miller's Son&quot; and &quot;Liaisons&quot;, were cut and remain heard only as background orchestrations. The film marked Broadway director [[Hal Prince]]'s second time as a motion picture director. Critical reaction to the film was mostly negative, with much being made of Taylor's wildly fluctuating weight from scene to scene.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent. [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEEDA1F3EE632A2575BC0A9659C946990D6CF &quot;Review: A Little Night Music (1977)&quot;], ''The New York Times'', March 8, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics talked more positively of the film, with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' calling it &quot;an elegant looking, period romantic charade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792646.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1] variety.com&lt;/ref&gt; There was praise for Diana Rigg's performance, and orchestrator [[Jonathan Tunick]] received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for his work on the score.  A soundtrack recording was released on LP, and a DVD release was issued in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDB title|id=0076319|title=A Little Night Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music analysis==
The score for ''A Little Night Music'' has elements not often found in musical theater, presenting challenges for performers, with complex meters, pitch changes, polyphony, and high notes for both males and females. The difficulty is heightened when songs merge, as in &quot;Now&quot;/&quot;Later&quot;/&quot;Soon&quot;, because all three have to be performed in the same key, limiting the ability to pick a comfortable key for each singer. Critic [[Rex Reed]] noted that &quot;The score of 'Night Music' ...contains patter songs, contrapuntal duets and trios, a quartet, and even a dramatic double quintet to puzzle through. All this has been gorgeously orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick; there is no rhythm section, only strings and woodwinds to carry the melodies and harmonies aloft.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Didier C.[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-little-night-music &quot;'A Little Night Music' Liner Notes, Song List and Synopsis&quot;] masterworksbroadway.com, retrieved June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondheim's engagement with threes extends to his lyrics. He organizes trios with the singers separated, while his duets are sung together, about a third person.&lt;ref name=tunick/&gt;

Another of the show's signature elements is that many songs end on a single brief note played by one or more instruments.

The work is performed as an [[operetta]] in many professional opera companies. For example, it was added to the [[New York City Opera]] Company repertoire in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Kay. &quot;Broadway Musicals, Show By Show&quot; (1996). Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 0-7935-7750-0, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

===3/4 time===
Virtually all of the music in the show is written in [[waltz time]] (3/4). Some parts adopt [[Compound meter (music)|compound meter]], with a [[time signature]] such as 12/8.&lt;ref name=tunick&gt;

===Counterpoint and polyphony===
At several points, Sondheim has multiple performers each sing a different song simultaneously. This use of [[counterpoint]] maintains coherence even as it extends the notion of a [[round (music)|round]], familiar in songs such as the traditional &quot;[[Frère Jacques]]&quot;, into something more complex. Sondheim said: &quot;As for the three songs... going together well, I might as well confess. In those days I was just getting into contrapuntal and choral writing...and I wanted to develop my technique by writing a trio. What I didn't want to do is the [[quodlibet]] method...wouldn't it be nice to have three songs you don't think are going to go together, and they do go together... The trick was the little [[vamp (music)|vamp]] on &quot;Soon&quot; which has five-and six-note chords.&quot;&lt;ref name=swayne&gt;Swayne, Steve. ''How Sondheim Found His Sound'', University of Michigan Press, 2007, ISBN 0-472-03229-1, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Swayne comments that the &quot;contrapuntal episodes in the extended ensembles... stand as testament to his interest in Counterpoint.&quot;&lt;ref name=swayne/&gt;

[[Polyphony]] is very different from [[harmony]], which Sondheim rarely employs in this work. When multiple singers sing the same phrases, he has them sing mostly in unison.

===&quot;Send In The Clowns&quot;===
The show's best-known and Sondheim's biggest hit song was almost an afterthought, written several days before the start of out of town tryouts.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;  Sondheim initially conceived Desiree as a role for a more-or-less non-singing actress.  When he discovered that the original Desiree, [[Glynis Johns]], was able to sing (she had a &quot;small, silvery voice&quot;&lt;ref name=secrest&gt;Secrest, Meryle. &quot;Stephen Sondheim: A Life&quot; (1998). Dell Publishing. ISBN 0-385-33412-5, pp. 251-252&lt;/ref&gt;) but could not &quot;sustain a phrase&quot;, he devised the song &quot;[[Send in the Clowns]]&quot; for her in a way that would work around her vocal weakness, e.g., by ending lines with consonants that made for a short cut-off.&lt;ref name=secrest/&gt; &quot;It is written in short phrases in order to be acted rather than sung...tailor-made for Glynis Johns, who lacks the vocal power to sustain long phrases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, S., Shevelove, B., Gelbart, L., Wheeler, H., and Lapine, J.  &quot;Four by Sondheim, Wheeler, Lapine, Shevelove and Gelbart&quot; (2000). Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 1-55783-407-5, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In analyzing the text of the song, [[Max Cryer]] wrote that it &quot;is not intended to be sung by the young in love, but by a mature performer who has seen it all before. The song remains an anthem to regret for unwise decisions in the past and recognition that there's no need to send in the clowns-they're already here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cryer, Max. ''Love Me Tender: The Stories Behind the World's Best-loved Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2008, ISBN 0-7112-2911-2, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
There is a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] reference in the title&amp;mdash;''A Little Night Music'' is an occasionally used translation of ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', the nickname of Mozart's [[Serenade No. 13 (Mozart)|Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major]], [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 525. The elegant, [[harmony|harmonically]]-advanced music in this musical pays indirect homage to the compositions of [[Maurice Ravel]], especially his ''[[Valses nobles et sentimentales (Ravel)|Valses nobles et sentimentales]]''&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. pp. 200, 203&lt;/ref&gt; (whose opening chord is &quot;borrowed&quot; for the opening chord of the song &quot;Liaisons&quot;); part of this effect stems from the style of orchestration that [[Jonathan Tunick]] used.

==Critical response==
In his review of the original 1973 Broadway production, [[Clive Barnes]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' called the musical &quot;heady, civilized, sophisticated and enchanting.&quot; He noted that &quot;the real triumph belongs to Stephen Sondheim...the music is a celebration of 3/4 time, an orgy of plaintively memorable waltzes, all talking of past loves and lost worlds...There is a peasant touch here.&quot; He commented that the lyrics are &quot;breathtaking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Clive, &quot;The Theater:'A Little Night Music&quot;, ''The New York Times'', February 26, 1973, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review of the 1989 London revival, the reviewer for ''The Guardian'' wrote that the &quot;production also strikes me as infinitely superior to Harold Prince's 1975 version at the Adelphi. Mr Judge's great innovation is to transform the Liebeslieder Singers from the evening-dressed, after-dinner line-up into 18th century ghosts weaving in and out of the action...But Mr Judge's other great realisation is that, in Sondheim, the lyrics are not an adornment to a song but their very essence: understand them and the show will flow. Thus Dorothy Tutin as Desiree, the touring thesp eventually reunited with her quondam lover, is not the melting romantic of previous productions but a working mother with the sharpness of a hat-pin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Billington, Michael. &quot;Arts: Night of the short memories - 'A Little Night Music'&quot;, ''The Guardian'' (London)., October 23, 1989 (no page number)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Independent'' review of the 1995 National Theatre revival praised the production, writing &quot;For three hours of gloriously barbed bliss and bewitchment, Sean Mathias's production establishes the show as a minor miracle of astringent worldly wisdom and one that is haunted by less earthy intimations.&quot; The review went on to state that &quot;The heart of the production, in both senses, is Judi Dench's superb Desiree Armfeldt...Her husky-voiced rendering of &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; is the most moving I've ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Paul and Seckerson, Edward.[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/double-take-reviews-a-little-night-music-1603205.html &quot;Double Take: Reviews: 'A Little Night Music'&quot;]''Independent', September 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the 2008 Menier Chocolate Factory production, ''The Telegraph'' reviewer wrote that &quot;Sondheim's lyrics are often superbly witty, his music here, mostly in haunting waltz-time, far more accessible than is sometimes the case. The score positively throbs with love, regret and desire.&quot; But of the specific production, the reviewer went on to note: &quot;But Nunn's production, on one of those hermetic sets largely consisting of doors and tarnished mirrors that have become such a cliché in recent years, never penetrates the work's subtly erotic heart. And as is often the case with this director's work, the pace is so slow and the mood so reverent, that initial enchantment gives way to bored fidgeting.&quot;&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The ''Times'' reviewer gave the Menier Chocolate Factory production four stars and wrote: &quot;The tiny Menier, and the hazy glass panels surrounding a mostly bare stage, suit the composer's intimate ode to the frustrations of love better than the vast acreage of the Olivier, where the musical last received a major outing.&quot; He went on to say &quot;There's something about the overall tone that subverts anything upbeat. Minor-key numbers merge into songs, and sometimes patter-songs, which largely consist of wry reverie and ravelled internal debate. Add ruefully sardonic lyrics and wickedly adroit rhymes and you’ve as sharply sophisticated a musical as even Sondheim has written or, indeed, Nunn has staged. That means it's well worth seeing, despite some uneven acting.&quot;&lt;ref name=night/&gt;

In his ''[[New York Times]]'' review of the 2009 Broadway production, [[Ben Brantley]] noted that &quot;the expression that hovers over Trevor Nunn's revival...feels dangerously close to a smirk...It is a smirk shrouded in shadows. An elegiac darkness infuses this production.&quot;  The production is &quot;sparing on furniture and heavy on shadows&quot;, with &quot;a scaled-down orchestra at lugubriously slowed-down tempos...&quot; He goes on to write that &quot;this somber, less-is-more approach could be effective were the ensemble plugged into the same rueful sensibility. But there is only one moment in this production when all its elements cohere perfectly. That moment, halfway through the first act, belongs to Ms. Lansbury, who has hitherto been perfectly entertaining, playing Madame Armfeldt with the overripe aristocratic condescension of a Lady Bracknell. Then comes her one solo, &quot;Liaisons&quot;, in which her character thinks back on the art of love as a profession in a gilded age, when sex 'was but a pleasurable means to a measurable end.' Her face, with its glamour-gorgon makeup, softens, as Madame Armfeldt seems to melt into memory itself, and the wan stage light briefly appears to borrow radiance from her. It's a lovely example of the past reaching out to the present...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/theater/reviews/14little.htm &quot;A Weekend in the Country With Eros and Thanatos&quot;] ''The New York Times'', December 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Trevor Nunn's production felt murky and undernourished when it opened back in December.

Bernadette Peters steps into the six-month-old revival of 'A Little Night Music' with a transfixing performance, playing it as if she realizes her character's onstage billing -- &quot;the one and only Desiree Armfeldt&quot; -- is cliched hyperbole. By figuratively rolling her eyes at the hype, Peters gives us a rich, warm and comedically human Desiree, which reaches full impact when she pierces the facade with a nakedly honest, tears-on-cheek 'Send in the Clowns.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, Steven. &quot;'A Little Night Music' Review&quot;, ''Variety'', August 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The AP reviewer wrote &quot;Devotees of Stritch, who earned her Sondheim stripes singing, memorably, &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot; in &quot;Company&quot; 40 years ago, will revel in how the actress, who earned a huge ovation before her very first line at a recent preview, brings her famously salty, acerbic style to the role of Madame Armfeldt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Noveck, Jocelyn.[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=11302213 &quot;Send in the Stars: Peters, Stritch in B'way Return&quot;] abcnews.go.com, AP National Writer, August 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' review, while positive for Peters and Stritch, was not favorable for the production: &quot;The nuanced truth Ms. Peters brings to this scene is not, unfortunately, the overall hallmark of this production, originally seen at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London. For long stretches Mr. Nunn’s staging, on a minimal set by David Farley that suggests a hallway in a dreary summer hotel, seems to be waltzing in cement shoes. The coarser elements in Mr. Wheeler’s book are underscored with an off-putting snigger, as if this romantic roundelay were little more than a galumphing sex farce.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, Charles.[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/theater/02night.html?_r=2 &quot;Desirée, Making Her Entrance Again&quot;]''New York Times'', August 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dual wielding''' is to hold a [[weapon]] in each hand. In [[Computer and video game|gaming]] a dual wield may also be called '''[[akimbo]]''' style, though it has little resemblance to the [[human position]] of that name. This most commonly refers to matched pairs of [[handgun]]s but can refer to any other weapon that can be held in one hand such as [[machine pistol]]s and even melee weapons, although this is more common in [[role-playing video game]]s.

==History==

Historically, the use of two guns at once, one in each hand, is most associated with the [[American Old West]], where [[revolver]]s holding only six rounds of ammunition were the highest capacity handguns available and reloading was a slow process. Being single action weapons, they needed to be cocked for each shot, so the [[rate of fire]] was also low, and while a shooter could [[Fanning (firearms)|fan]] his gun, this expended all his shots even faster and made him even more inaccurate than normal. Use of two guns was therefore a reasonable compromise, as this allowed one gun to be cocked as the other is being fired, in practical terms doubling the rate of fire and the available number of bullets.

There is some evidence that gunfighters of the Old West did not actually shoot two-handed.  They would draw and fire with their strong hand, and when they had emptied the first gun, they drew the second gun with their weak hand and passed it over to their strong hand.  In modern firearms terminology this is often called a &quot;New York reload&quot; after the practice of New York Police Department officers carrying second (and even third) guns as backup.

A possible example of actual use of two guns firing at the same time is &quot;Dual wield&quot;, practiced by [[Spetsnaz|Russian special forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woin.ru/pages/magazine/speznaz/2_2001/19-22.htm|title=''Macedonian Duel''|accessdate=2007-02-24|publisher=''Center &quot;Zdorovye Naroda&quot;''|month=February | year=2001|language=Russian|first=Nikolay|last=Simonov}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This also evolved as a method of increasing rate of fire, more in order to force the enemy to take cover than to try to accurately hit them, and was generally practiced by [[NKVD]] officers issued a pair of revolvers.  However, the invention of smaller, cheaper submachineguns around the 1950s rendered the tactic largely obsolete and it fell into relative obscurity.

With modern shooting techniques, there is very little value to shooting with a weapon in each hand.  Using modern full capacity firearms, a shooter can fire more shots with greater accuracy using a single gun in a two-handed grip than two guns with one-handed grips. Also, modern semi-automatic pistols take only a few seconds to reload.  At best, the technique is only effective at extremely close ranges of five to ten feet, since the recoil would make it hard to keep both weapons straight, and using the sights on the guns is next to impossible. Among the majority of professional firearms instructors{{Who|date=July 2010}}, this practice is dismissed as extremely ineffective.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Media===

It is unknown when dual wielding was first used in fiction, but it was likely from early western novels before spilling over into other works. In the early 20th century, numerous examples abound of heroes and heroines of [[pulp]] novels, [[paperback]]s and [[comic]]s depicted wielding two pistols, most notably the pulp hero, [[the Shadow]].

The use of two pistols simultaneously was even used in the movie adaptation of the Spider character (a contemporary of the Shadow), [[the Spider's Web]]. It is unknown when the style came out of fashion until being resurrected by Hong Kong cinema, notably movies directed by [[John Woo]] and often featuring [[Chow Yun Fat]].

The use of this tactic was initially a rarity in [[Western (genre)|Western films]], as up till then it was thought to look cumbersome.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The use of akimbo became more acceptable and achieved somewhat of a cult status after much influence from [[Hong Kong action cinema]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Naturally, action films have been a major influence on [[action game|action gaming]]. ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' and ''[[Marathon (computer game)|Marathon]]'', both released on December 21, [[1994 in video gaming|1994]], were the earliest [[first-person shooters]] to integrate akimbo pistols.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In ''[[Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.²]]'' and [[Shadow Man (video game)|Shadow Man]], this tactic was developed further, allowing the player to wield two dissimilar weapons at once, firing each one independently.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Dual wielded weapons have become the trademark of some game characters, most notably [[Lara Croft]].

===Etymology===
[[file:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Portret van een man met de handen in de zij 1658.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of a man with arms akimbo, painting by [[Rembrand van Rijn|Rembrandt]], 1658]]
There is some confusion over the origin of this usage of the word ''[[akimbo]]''. Technically, it is inaccurate, since the word literally refers to a stance where a person stands with their elbows bent and their hands on their hips (''arms akimbo'')- not a posture well suited to shooting. While this does bear some similarity with the classic posture of [[cowboy]]s firing their twin revolvers from the hip, in games this posture is almost never reflected, with almost all game characters firing twin guns at shoulder level, straight-armed. ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' is a notable exception, in that the player models are seen externally to fire akimbo Berettas from the hip, but appear to be firing from shoulder level from the first-person perspective.  There is no conformity on whether the word should precede or follow the name of the object it describes: both &quot;akimbo pistols&quot; and &quot;pistols akimbo&quot; are used.

The book ''Hong Kong Action Cinema (ISBN 0-87951-663-1)'' by [[Bey Logan]] suggests the word originated in [[Hong Kong]] action movies and eventually migrated to the gaming lexicon.

It is also possible that the phrase predates both of these and refers instead to [[Cowboy action shooting]] techniques.

'''Ariel Sharon ''' ({{lang-he|{{Audio|help=no|He-Ariel Sharon.ogg|אריאל שרון}}}}, also known by his [[diminutive]] Arik, אַריק, born '''Ariel Scheinermann''', אריאל שיינרמן on 26 February 1928) is an [[Israel]]i statesman and retired general, who served as Israel’s 11th [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]]. He has been in a [[persistent vegetative state|permanent vegetative state]] since suffering a [[stroke]] on 4 January 2006.

Sharon was a commander in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Army]] since its inception in 1948. As an army officer, he participated in the [[1948 War of Independence]], the [[Qibya massacre]] of 1953, the [[1956 Suez War]], the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, and the [[Yom-Kippur War]] of 1973. After retiring from the army, Sharon joined the right-wing [[Likud]] party, and served in a number of ministerial posts in Likud-led governments in 1977-1992 and 1996-1999. He became the leader of the Likud in 2000, and served as Israel’s Prime Minister from 2001 to 2006.

During his long military and political career, Sharon was considered a controversial and polarizing figure. In 1983 a [[Kahan Commission|commission established by the Israeli Government]] found that as [[Defense Minister of Israel|Minister of Defense]] during the [[1982 Lebanon War]] Sharon bore personal, but indirect, responsibility for the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|massacre by Lebanese militias of Palestinian civilians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila]]. In 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Sharon championed construction of [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. However, as Prime Minister, in 2004-2005 Sharon orchestrated [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip]]. Facing stiff opposition to this policy within the Likud, in November 2005 he left Likud to form a new [[Kadima]] party. In January 2006 Sharon suffered a major stroke that left him in a permanent vegetative state. In March [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]], Kadima, led by [[Ehud Olmert]] following Sharon's stroke, went on to win plurality of [[Knesset]] seats, becoming the senior coalition partner in [[Thirty-first government of Israel|Israel's 31st government]].

==Early life==
Sharon was born in [[Kfar Malal]], then in the [[Mandate Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], to a family of [[Lithuanian Jews]] - Shmuel Sheinerman, of Brest-Litovsk (now [[Brest, Belarus]]) and Dvora (formerly Vera), of [[Mogilev]]. His father was studying [[agronomy]] at the university of [[Tbilisi]], Georgia ([[Georgian SSR]]) and his mother had just started her fourth year of medical studies when the couple married. They [[immigration|immigrated]] to the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]] from [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], fleeing the early Pogroms associated with the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. Apart from [[Hebrew]], Sharon's father spoke [[Yiddish]] and his mother spoke [[Russian language|Russian]]; their son also learned to speak Russian as a young boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The family arrived in the [[Second Aliyah]] and settled in a [[socialism|socialist]], [[secularism|secular]] community where, despite being [[Mapai]] supporters, they were known to be contrarians against the prevailing community consensus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Scheinermans' eventual ostracism... followed the 1933 [[Haim Arlosoroff|Arlozorov]] murder when Dvora and Shmuel refused to endorse the Labor movement's anti-Revisionist calumny and participate in [[bolshevism|Bolshevic]]-style public revilement rallies, then the order of the day. Retribution was quick to come. They were expelled from the local health-fund clinic and village [[synagogue]]. The cooperative's truck wouldn't make deliveries to their farm nor collect produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.netanyahu.org/antacyonsche.html|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|title=Another tack: Yoni &amp; the Scheinermans|first=Sarah|last=Honig|date=15 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Four years after their arrival at [[Kfar Malal]], the Sheinermans had a daughter, Yehudit (Dita), and two years after, they had a son, Ariel. At age 10, Sharon entered the Zionist youth movement Hassadeh. In 1942 at the age of 14, Sharon joined the [[Gadna (Israel)|Gadna]], a [[paramilitary]] youth [[battalion]], and later the [[Haganah]], the underground paramilitary force and the Jewish military precursor to the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF).

==Military career==
===From 1948 War to Suez Crisis===
[[File:Sharon22.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sharon as a young soldier]]

At the creation of Israel (and [[Haganah]]'s transformation into the Israel Defense Forces), Sharon became a [[platoon]] commander in the [[Alexandroni Brigade]]. He was severely wounded in the groin by the [[Jordan]]ian [[Arab Legion]] in the first [[Battle of Latrun]], an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the [[Siege|besieged]] [[Jew]]ish community of [[Jerusalem]]. In September 1949, Sharon was promoted to [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander (of the [[Golani Brigade]]'s reconnaissance unit) and in 1950 to [[Espionage|intelligence officer]] for Central Command. He then took leave to begin studies in history and [[Middle Eastern studies|Middle Eastern culture]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. A year and a half later, he was asked to return to active service in the rank of [[major]] and as the leader of the new [[Unit 101]], Israel's first [[special forces]] unit.

Unit 101 undertook a series of military raids against [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] and neighboring [[Arab]] states that helped bolster Israeli morale and fortify its [[Deterrence theory|deterrent]] image. The unit was known for raids against Arab civilians and military,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ariel-sharon-life-story.com/03-Ariel-Sharon-Biography-1953-Retribution-Acts-Peulot-Tagmul.shtml |title=Ariel Sharon&amp;nbsp;— Biography: 1953 Retribution Acts (Pe'ulot Tagmul) |publisher=Ariel-sharon-life-story.com |date= |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the widely condemned [[Qibya massacre]] in the fall of 1953, in which 69 Palestinian civilians, some of them children, were killed by Sharon's troops in a reprisal attack on their [[West Bank]] village. In the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Israel and the Arabs: 50 Year War'', Sharon recalls what happened after the raid, which was heavily condemned by many Western nations, including the U.S.:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was summoned to see [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]. It was the first time I met him, and right from the start Ben-Gurion said to me: &quot;Let me first tell you one thing: it doesn't matter what the world says about Israel, it doesn't matter what they say about us anywhere else. The only thing that matters is that we can exist here on the land of our forefathers. And unless we show the Arabs that there is a high price to pay for murdering Jews, we won't survive.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few months after its founding, Unit 101 was merged with the 890 Paratroopers Battalion to create the [[Paratroopers Brigade (IDF)|Paratroopers Brigade]] (Sharon eventually became the latter's commander). It continued to attack military, culminating with the attack on the [[Qalqilyah]] police station in the autumn of 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israeli Special Forces History&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/special.html|title=Jewish Virtual Library&amp;nbsp;— Israeli Special Forces History|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info &quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.specwar.info/special_forces/Unit_101/history.php|title=Unit 101 (history) - Specwar.info |publisher=Specwar.info |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952-53, Sharon attended the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], taking History and [[Oriental]] studies.

Sharon was widowed twice. Shortly after becoming a [[Drill instructor|military instructor]], he married Margalit, with whom he had a son, Gur. Margalit died in a [[car accident]] in May 1962. Their son, Gur, died in October 1967 after a friend accidentally shot him while they were playing with a [[rifle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/Middle-East-Conflict/Sharon-mourns-slain-son/2005/02/14/1108229937965.html

From 1958 to 1962, Sharon served as commander of an infantry brigade and studied law at [[Tel Aviv University]].

===Mitla incident===
In the [[Suez Crisis|1956 Suez War]] (the British &quot;[[Operation Musketeer (Suez Crisis)|Operation Musketeer]]&quot;), Sharon commanded Unit 202 (the Paratroopers Brigade), and was responsible for taking ground east of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai's]] [[Mitla Pass]] and eventually taking the pass itself. Having successfully carried out the first part of his mission (joining a battalion parachuted near Mitla with the rest of the brigade moving on ground), Sharon's unit was deployed near the pass. Neither [[surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]] nor [[Reconnaissance|scouts]] reported enemy forces inside the Mitla Pass. Sharon, whose forces were initially heading east, away from the pass, reported to his superiors that he was increasingly concerned with the possibility of an enemy thrust through the pass, which could attack his brigade from the flank or the rear.

Sharon asked for permission to attack the pass several times, but his requests were denied, though he was allowed to check its status so that if the pass was empty, he could receive permission to take it later. Sharon sent a small scout force, which was met with heavy fire and became bogged down due to vehicle [[malfunction]] in the middle of the pass. Sharon ordered the rest of his troops to attack in order to aid their comrades.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} In the ensuing successful battle to capture the pass, 38 Israeli soldiers were killed. Sharon was criticized by his superiors and he was damaged by allegations several years later made by several former subordinates, who claimed that Sharon tried to provoke the [[Egyptians]] and sent out the scouts in bad faith, ensuring that a battle would ensue.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War===
{{Main|Six-Day War|Yom Kippur War}}

The Mitla incident hindered Sharon's military career for several years. In the meantime, he occupied the position of an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] commander and received a [[law degree]] from [[Tel Aviv University]]. However, when [[Yitzhak Rabin]] became [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]] in 1964, Sharon began again to rise rapidly in the ranks, occupying the positions of Infantry School Commander and Head of Army Training Branch, eventually achieving the rank of [[Aluf]] ([[Major General]]). In the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Sharon commanded the most powerful [[armored division]] on the [[Sinai]] [[Front (military)|front]] which made a breakthrough in the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area (see [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|Battle of Abu-Ageila]]). In 1969, he was appointed the Head of IDF's [[Southern Command (Israel)|Southern Command]]. He had no further promotions before retiring in August 1973. Soon after, he joined the [[Likud]] (&quot;Unity&quot;) [[political party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/ariel-sharon.shtml|title=Israel's generals: Ariel Sharon|date=17 June 2004|accessdate=15 April 2006|publisher=[[BBC Four]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]] on 6 October 1973, Sharon was called back to active duty along with his assigned reserve [[armored division]]. His forces did not engage the [[Egyptian Army]] immediately, despite his requests. Under cover of darkness Sharon's forces moved to a point on the [[Suez Canal]] that had been prepared before the war. Bridging equipment was thrown across the canal on 17 October. The [[bridgehead]] was between two Egyptian Armies. He then headed north towards Ismailia, intent on cutting the Egyptian second army's supply lines, but his division was halted south of the [[Fresh Water Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. George W. Gawrych [http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/download/csipubs/gawrych/gawrych_pt6.pdf The Alabatross of Decisive Victory: The 1973 Arab-Israeli War] p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham Adan|Abraham (Bren) Adan's]] division  passed over the bridgehead into [[Africa]] advancing to within 101 kilometers of [[Cairo]]. His division managed to encircle [[Suez]], cutting off and [[Encirclement|encircling]] the Third Army, but did not force its surrender before the [[ceasefire]]. Tensions between the two generals followed Sharon's decision, but a [[military tribunal]] later found his action was militarily effective. This move was regarded by many Israelis as the turning point of the war in the Sinai front. Thus, Sharon is widely viewed as a war hero who saved Israel from defeat in Sinai. A photo of Sharon wearing a head bandage on the Suez Canal became a famous symbol of Israeli military prowess.

Sharon's political positions were controversial and he was relieved of duty in February 1974.

==Early political career==
===Beginnings of political career===
In the 1940s and 1950s, Sharon seemed to be personally devoted to the ideals of [[Mapai]], the predecessor of the modern [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]]. However, after retiring from military service, he was instrumental in establishing [[Likud]] in July 1973 by a merger of [[Herut]], the [[Liberalism in Israel|Liberal Party]] and independent elements. Sharon became chairman of the campaign staff for [[Israeli legislative election, 1973|that year's elections]], which were scheduled for November. Two and a half weeks after the start of the election campaign, the [[Yom Kippur War]] erupted and Sharon was called back to reserve service. In the elections Sharon won a seat, but a year later he resigned.

From June 1975 to March 1976, Sharon was a special aide to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]]. He planned his return to politics for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]]; first he tried to return to the Likud and replace [[Menachem Begin]] at the head of the party. He suggested to [[Simha Erlich]], who headed the Liberal Party bloc in the Likud, that he was more fitting than Begin to win an election victory; he was rejected, however. He then tried to join the Labor Party and the [[centrism|centrist]] [[Democratic Movement for Change]], but was rejected by those parties too. Only then did he form his own list, [[Shlomtzion (political party)|Shlomtzion]], which won two Knesset seats in the subsequent elections. Immediately after the elections he merged Shlomtzion with the Likud and became [[Agriculture Minister of Israel|Minister of Agriculture]].

When Sharon joined Begin's government he had relatively little political experience. During this period, Sharon supported the [[Gush Emunim]] settlements movement and was viewed as the patron of the settlers' movement. He used his position to encourage the establishment of a network of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories to prevent the possibility of [[Palestinian Arab]]s' return of these territories. Sharon doubled the number of Jewish settlements on the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] during his tenure.

On his settlement policy, Sharon said while addressing a meeting of the [[Tzomet]] party: &quot;Everybody has to move, run and grab as many (Judean) hilltops as they can to enlarge the (Jewish) settlements because everything we take now will stay ours... Everything we don't grab will go to them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Presse, November 15, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ariel Sharon 1982 HD-SC-98-07543.JPEG|thumb|250px|right|[[Defense Minister of Israel|Minister of Defense]] Sharon (right) and [[Caspar Weinberger]], 1982]]
After the 1981 elections, Begin rewarded Sharon for his important contribution to Likud's narrow win, by appointing him [[Defense Minister of Israel|Minister of Defense]].

===Sabra and Shatila massacre===
{{Main|Sabra and Shatila massacre}}
During the [[1982 Lebanon War]], while Sharon was Defense Minister, the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] occurred between September 16 and 18. Between 800 and 3,500 Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatila [[refugee camp]]s were killed by the [[Kataeb Party|Phalanges]]—Lebanese Maronite Christian militias. The Security Chief of the Phalange militia, [[Elie Hobeika]], was the ground commander of the militiamen who entered the Palestinian camps and killed the Palestinians. The Phalange had been sent into the camps to clear out [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] fighters while Israeli forces surrounded the camps, blocking camp exits and providing [[Logistics|logistical]] support. The killings led some to label Sharon &quot;the Butcher of [[Beirut]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1156796.stm|title=Sharon victory: An Arab nightmare|date=6 February 2001|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An [[Associated Press]] report on 15 September 1982 stated:

:''Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, in a statement, tied the killing [of the Phalangist leader Gemayel] to the PLO, saying: &quot;It symbolises the terrorist murderousness of the PLO terrorist organisations and their supporters.&quot; Habib Chartouni, a Lebanese [[Christian]] from the [[Syrian Socialist National Party]] confessed to the murder of Gemayel, and no Palestinians were involved. Sharon had used this to instigate the entrance of the Lebanese militias into the camps.''

Robert Maroun Hatem, [[Elie Hobeika]]'s bodyguard, stated in his book ''From Israel to Damascus'' that Hobeika ordered the massacre of civilians in defiance of Israeli instructions to behave like a &quot;dignified&quot; army.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Maroun Hatem, ''From Israel to Damascus'', Chapter 7: The Massacres at Sabra and Shatilla [http://www.free-lebanon.com/News/Documents_of_Note/DOC_chap8/doc_chap8.html online]. Accessed 24 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigative [[Kahan Commission]] found the [[Israeli Defence Forces]] indirectly responsible for the massacre and that no Israeli was directly responsible for the events which occurred in the camps. The commission also asserted that Israel had indirect responsibility for the massacre since the I.D.F. held the area.

In their recommendations and closing remarks, the Commission determined that the massacre at Sabra and Shatilla was carried out by a Phalangist unit, acting on its own but its entry was known to Israel and approved by Sharon. Mr. Begin was found responsible for not exercising greater involvement and awareness in the matter of introducing the Phalangists into the camps. [[Defence Minister]] Ariel Sharon was found to bear ''personal responsibility &quot;for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge&quot;'' and ''&quot;not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed&quot;''. Sharon's negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control amounted to a ''non-fulfillment of a duty with which the Defence Minister was charged''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

:''We have found...that the Minister of Defense [Ariel Sharon] bears personal responsibility. In our opinion, it is fitting that the Minister of Defense draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office&amp;nbsp;— and if necessary, that the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] consider whether he should exercise his authority...to... remove [him] from office.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=8 February 1983|accessdate=15 April 2006|title=Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the events at the refugee camps in Beirut - 8 February 1983|url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1982-1984/104%20Report%20of%20the%20Commission%20of%20Inquiry%20into%20the%20e }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon initially refused to resign as Defense Minister and Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] refused to fire him. After a grenade was tossed into a dispersing crowd of an Israeli [[Peace Now]] march, killing [[Emil Grunzweig]] and injuring 10 others, a compromise was reached: Sharon agreed to forfeit the post of Defense Minister but stayed in the cabinet as a [[Minister without Portfolio]].

Sharon's resignation as Defense Minister is listed as one of the important events of the Tenth Knesset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSubjects/EngSElections/EngSEKnessets/EngSE9-11 Knesset 9-11&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2001 relatives of the victims of the Sabra massacre began proceedings in [[Belgium]] to have Sharon indicted on [[war crime]]s charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Complaint Against Ariel Sharon for his involvement in the massacres at Sabra and Shatila|url= http://www.caabu.org/campaigns/complaint-against-sharon.html|accessdate=15 April 2006|publisher=The Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elie Hobeika]], the leader of the Phalange militia who carried out the massacres, was assassinated in January 2001, several months before he was scheduled to testify against Sharon for the trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_obit&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jan/25/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon Mostyn, Trevor, Guardian.co.uk, Friday January 25 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arab Press have widely speculated that Hobeika's assassination was ordered by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/mideast/0402lebanon.htm Campagna, Joel World Press Review, April 2002 Issue]&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2002, a [[Brussels]] Appeals Court rejected the lawsuit because the law was subsequently changed to disallow such lawsuits unless a Belgian citizen is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.droit.fundp.ac.be/cours/pen/JC032C1.pdf|title=Cour de cassation de Belgique|publisher=La faculté de Droit de Namur|date=12 February 2003|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- In November 2010, a [[Dutch]] paper published an interview with the well-known Dutch-Jewish&lt;ref name=&quot;Sluizer&quot;/&gt; director [[George Sluizer]]. During the interview Sluizer stated that during [[1982 Lebanon War|War in Lebanon in 1982]] he witnessed 'Sharon killing two Palestinian toddlers with a pistol near the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imemc.org/article/59956 &quot;Dutch Film Director Accuses Ariel Sharon of Killing Two Palestinian Children in 1982&quot;] [[IMEMC]].&lt;/ref&gt; Former officials who worked with Sharon said the allegations were false, noting among other things that protocol does not allow ministers to carry arms, that Sharon was not in Lebanon during the time of the alleged incident, and that the accusation was not supported by &quot;a single shred of evidence&quot;. The Israeli foreign ministry called the claim &quot;a modern blood libel&quot;. Sluizer said that in 1983 he filed complaints with the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) in the Hague and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) in Strasbourg. Neither organization has any record of such complaints. When asked why he didn't pursue the matter further at the time, Sluizer said he began thinking more about the incident after surviving a near-fatal aneurysm in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sluizer&quot;&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/i-saw-ariel-sharon-murder-2-palestinian-toddles-in-lebanon-1.325540 'I saw Ariel Sharon murder 2 Palestinian toddles in Lebanon'] by Cnaan Liphshiz. Haaretz.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Political downturn and recovery===
After his dismissal from the Defense Ministry post, Sharon remained in successive governments as a [[Minister without Portfolio]] (1983—1984), [[Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel|Minister for Trade and Industry]] (1984—1990), and [[Housing and Construction Minister of Israel|Minister of Housing Construction]] (1990—1992). In the Knesset, he was member of the Foreign Affairs and Defence committee from (1990–1992) and Chairman of the committee overseeing [[aliyah|Jewish immigration]] from the [[Soviet Union]]. During this period he was a rival to then prime minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]], but failed in various bids to replace him as chairman of Likud. Their rivalry reached a head in February 1990, when Sharon grabbed the microphone from Shamir, who was addressing the Likud central committee, and famously exclaimed: &quot;Who's for wiping out [[terrorism]]?&quot; The incident was widely viewed as an apparent [[Coup d'état|coup]] attempt against Shamir's leadership of the party.

In [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s 1996–1999 government, Sharon was [[National Infrastructure Minister of Israel|Minister of National Infrastructure]] (1996—1998), and [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Minister]] (1998—1999). Upon the election of the [[Ehud Barak|Barak]] Labor government, Sharon became leader of the Likud party.

===Campaign for Prime Minister, 2000-2001===
On 28 September 2000, Sharon and an escort of over 1,000 Israeli police officers visited the [[Temple Mount]] complex, site of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], the holiest place in the world to Jews (observant Jews will not actually walk inside the enclosure but they pray at the outside wall) and the third holiest site in [[Islam]]. Sharon declared that the complex would remain under perpetual Israeli control. Palestinian commentators accused Sharon of purposely inflaming emotions with the event to provoke a violent response and obstruct success of delicate ongoing peace talks. On the following day, a large number of Palestinian demonstrators and an Israeli police contingent confronted each other at the site. According to the [[U.S. State Department]], “Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.” According to the GOI, 14 policemen were injured.

Sharon's visit, a few months before his election as Prime Minister, came after [[archeology|archeologists]] claimed that extensive building operations at the site were destroying priceless antiquities. Sharon's supporters point out that [[Yasser Arafat]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]] planned the intifada months prior to Sharon's visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Khaled Abu Toameh|date=19 September 2002|url=http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/111P55.htm|title=How the war began}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/charleskrauthammer/ck20010520.shtml|title=Middle East Troubles|date=20 May 2001|publisher=Townhall.com|author=Charles Krauthammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|title=Myths &amp; Facts Online: The Palestinian Uprisings|author=Mitchell G. Bard|url= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf19.html#a1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that Palestinian security chief Jabril Rajoub provided assurances that if Sharon did not enter the mosques, no problems would arise. They also often quote statements by Palestinian Authority officials, particularly Imad Falouji, the P.A. Communications Minister, who admitted months after Sharon's visit that the violence had been planned in July, far in advance of Sharon's visit, stating the intifada &quot;was carefully planned since the return of (Palestinian President) Yasser Arafat from [[Camp David 2000 Summit|Camp David]] negotiations rejecting the U.S. conditions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishweek.org/news/newscontent.php3?artid=3846|title=PA: Intifada Was Planned|author=Stewart Ain|date=20 December 2000|publisher=The Jewish Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Mitchell Report,
:''the government of Israel asserted that the immediate catalyst for the violence was the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations on 25 July 2000 and the “widespread appreciation in the international community of Palestinian responsibility for the impasse.” In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at “provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative.”''
The Mitchell Report found that
:''the Sharon visit did not cause the Al-Aqsa Intifada. But it was poorly timed and the provocative effect should have been foreseen; indeed, it was foreseen by those who urged that the visit be prohibited. More significant were the events that followed: The decision of the Israeli police on 29 September to use lethal means against the Palestinian demonstrators.''
In addition, the report stated,
:''Accordingly, we have no basis on which to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the PA to initiate a campaign of violence at the first opportunity; or to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the GOI to respond with lethal force.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/Mitchellrep.html|title=The Mitchell Report|date=4 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Or Commission, an Israeli panel of inquiry appointed to investigate the October 2000 events,
:''criticised the Israeli police for being unprepared for the riots and possibly using excessive force to disperse the mobs, resulting in the deaths of 12 Arab Israeli, one Jewish and one Palestinian citizens.''

Palestinians doubt the existence of popular support for Sharon's actions. Polls published in the media, as well as the 140% call-up of reservists (as opposed to the 60% in regular periods) seem to indicate that the Israeli public is quite supportive of Sharon's policies. A survey conducted by Tel Aviv University's Jaffe Center in May 2004 found that 80% of Jewish Israelis believe that the Israel Defense Forces have succeeded in militarily countering the Al-Aqsa Intifada.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} {{Cite web|url=http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2004/data/may2004d.pdf|title=מדד השלום |publisher=The Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research|month=May | year=2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of Barak's government, Sharon was elected Prime Minister in February 2001.

On 20 July 2004, Sharon called on [[French people|French]] Jews to emigrate from [[France]] to Israel immediately, in light of an increase in French [[anti-Semitism]] (94 anti-Semitic [[assault]]s reported in the first six months of 2004 compared to 47 in 2003). France has the fourth largest Jewish population (about 600,000 people), after the [[United States]], Israel, and [[Russia]]. Sharon observed that an &quot;unfettered anti-Semitism&quot; reigned in France. The French government responded by describing his comments as &quot;unacceptable&quot;, as did the French representative Jewish organization [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], which denied Sharon's claim of intense anti-Semitism in French society. An Israeli spokesperson later claimed that Sharon had been misunderstood. France then postponed a visit by Sharon. Upon his visit, both Sharon and French President [[Jacques Chirac]] were described as showing a willingness to put the issue behind them.

===Unilateral disengagement===
{{Main|Israel's unilateral disengagement plan}}

In May 2003, Sharon endorsed the [[Road Map for Peace]] put forth by the United States, [[European Union]], and Russia, which opened a dialogue with [[Mahmud Abbas]], and announced his commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state in the future.

He has embarked on a course of unilateral withdrawal from the [[Gaza Strip]], while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. Sharon's plan has been welcomed by both the [[Palestinian Authority]] and Israel's [[left wing]] as a step towards a final peace settlement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} However, it has been greeted with opposition from within his own Likud party and from other [[right wing]] Israelis, on [[national security]], military, and religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ariel-sharon-life-story.com/18-Ariel-Sharon-Biography-2004-Disengagement-Plan.shtml |title=Ariel Sharon&amp;nbsp;— Biography: 2004 Disengagement Plan |publisher=Ariel-sharon-life-story.com |date= |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disengagement from Gaza===
On 1 December 2004, Sharon dismissed five ministers from the Shinui party for voting against the government's 2005 budget. In January 2005 Sharon formed a [[national unity government]] that included representatives of Likud, Labor, and [[Meimad]] and [[Degel HaTorah]] as &quot;out-of-government&quot; supporters without any seats in the government ([[United Torah Judaism]] parties usually reject having ministerial offices as a policy). Between 16 and 30 August 2005, Sharon controversially expelled 9,480 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank. Once it became clear that the evictions were definitely going ahead a group of conservative [[Rabbi]]s, led by Rabbi [[Yosef Dayan]], placed an ancient curse on him known as the [[Pulsa diNura]], calling on the [[Angel of Death]] to intervene and kill him. After Israeli soldiers bulldozed every settlement structure except for several former [[synagogue]]s, Israeli soldiers formally left Gaza on 11 September 2005 and closed the border fence at [[Kissufim]]. While his decision to withdraw from Gaza sparked bitter protests from members of the Likud party and the settler movement, opinion polls showed that it was a popular move among most of the Israeli electorate with more than 80% of Israelis backing the plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/12/09/israel.government/index.html |title=Sharon party agrees coalition plan&amp;nbsp;— Dec 9, 2004 |publisher=CNN.com |date= 10 December 2004|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 2005, Sharon narrowly defeated a leadership challenge by a 52-48 percent vote. The move was initiated within the central committee of the governing Likud party by Sharon's main rival, [[Binyamin Netanyahu]], who had left the cabinet to protest Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza. The measure was an attempt by Netanyahu to call an early primary in November 2005 to choose the party's leader.

===Founding of Kadima===
{{Main|Kadima}} 
On 21 November 2005, Sharon resigned as head of Likud, and dissolved parliament to form a new [[centrist]] party called [[Kadima]] (&quot;Forward&quot;). November polls indicated that Sharon was likely to be returned to the prime ministership. On 20 December 2005, Sharon's longtime rival Benjamin Netanyahu was elected his successor as leader of Likud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sharon recovers as chief rival wins control of Likud|date=20 December 2005|work=The Guardian|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1671030,00.html | location=London | first=Conal | last=Urquhart | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Sharon's incapacitation, Ehud Olmert replaced Sharon as Kadima's leader, for the nearing general elections. Netanyahu, along with [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor's]] [[Amir Peretz]], were ''Kadima'''s chief rivals in the [[Israel legislative election, 2006|March 2006 elections]].

In the elections, which saw Israel's lowest-ever voter turnout of 64%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idi.org.il/sites/english/parliament/Pages/ElectionsfortheLocalAuthority.aspx |title=Elections for the Local Authority&amp;nbsp;– Who, What, When, Where and How? - The Israel Democracy Institute |publisher=Idi.org.il |date= |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the number usually averages on the high 70%), Kadima, headed by Olmert, received the most Knesset seats, followed by Labor. The new governing coalition installed in May 2006 included Kadima, with Olmert as Prime Minister, Labor (including Peretz as Defense Minister), the Gil (Pensioner's) Party, the Shas religious party, and [[Israel Beytenu|Yisrael Beiteinu]].

===Financial scandals===
During the latter part of his career Sharon was investigated for alleged involvement in a number of financial scandals, in particular, the [[Greek Island Affair]] and irregularities of fundraising during 1999 election campaign. In the Greek Island Affair, Sharon was accused of promising (during his term as Foreign Minister) to help an Israeli businessman [[David Appel (businessman)|David Appel]] in his development project on a Greek island in exchange for large consultancy payments to Sharon's son [[Gilad Sharon|Gilad]]. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. In the 1999 election fundraising scandal, Sharon was not charged with any wrongdoing, but his son [[Omri Sharon|Omri]], a Knesset member at the time, was charged and sentenced in 2006 to nine months in prison.

To avoid a potential conflict of interest in relation to these investigations, Sharon in his role as Prime Minister was not involved in the confirmation of the appointment of a new [[Attorney General of Israel|Attorney General]] [[Menahem Mazuz]] in 2005.

On 10 December 2005 Israeli police raided [[Martin Schlaff]]'s apartment in Jerusalem. Another suspect in the case was [[Robert Nowikovsky]], an Austrian involved in Russian state-owned company [[Gazprom]]'s business activities in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP Schlaff&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hF2cuPKuthlnLDUja9QFzqUv1CzQ |title=Austrian tycoon may face Israel charges: report |date=7 September 2010 |publisher=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillel Fendel.[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/95989 &quot;Police Say There´s Evidence Linking Sharon to $3 Million Bribe&quot;] Arutz Sheva, 01/03/06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gazoviki&quot;&gt;[http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/09/the_gazoviki_in_germany.htm A tale of gazoviki, money and greed].

According to Hareetz, &quot;The $3 million that parachuted into Gilad and Omri Sharon's bank account toward the end of 2002 was transferred there in the context of a consultancy contract for development of kolkhozes (collective farms ) in Russia. Gilad Sharon was brought into the campaign to make the wilderness bloom in Russia by Getex, a large Russian-based exporter of seeds (peas, millet, wheat ) from Eastern Europe. Getex also has ties with Israeli firms involved in exporting wheat from Ukraine, for example. The company owns farms in Eastern Europe and is considered large and prominent in its field. It has its Vienna offices in the same building as Jurimex, which was behind the $1-million guarantee to the [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/special-report-the-schlaff-saga/the-schlaff-saga-money-flows-into-the-sharon-family-accounts-1.312801 |title=The Schlaff Saga / Money flows into the Sharon family accounts |date=22 December 2010 |publisher=Haaretz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December police announced that they had found evidence of a 3 million dollar bribe paid to Sharon's sons.  Just 24 hours after the announcement, Sharon suffered a stroke, went to coma, and never recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP Schlaff&quot;/&gt;

==Incapacitation and end of political career==
===First stroke===
On 18 December 2005 Sharon was sent to [[Hadassah Medical Center]] after suffering a mild stroke, specifically a relatively unusual type called a [[paradoxical embolism]], in which a clot from the venous circulation crosses over into the arterial circulation through a hole between the right and left atria called an [[atrial septal defect]] (or a [[patent foramen ovale]]) and goes to the brain, causing a transient speech and motor disturbance.

Sharon often joked about his own weight; in October 2004 when asked why he did not wear a [[ballistic vest]] despite frequent death threats, Sharon smiled and replied, &quot;There is none that fits my size&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmafp/is_200410/ai_n6866062 |title=No flak jacket in Sharon's size &amp;#124; AFP &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2 June 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his way to the hospital he lost [[consciousness]] but regained it shortly thereafter. He reportedly wanted to leave the hospital the evening after his arrival but the hospital wanted him to stay another day. He spent two days in the hospital and was to have had the small hole in his heart repaired by a [[cardiac catheterization]] procedure in early January.

===Second stroke===
On 4 January 2006, in the evening before his catheterization, Sharon suffered a second, different and far more serious stroke at his [[Havat Hashikmim|Sycamore Ranch]] in the [[Negev|Negev region]]. A &quot;massive [[cerebral haemorrhage]]&quot; led to bleeding in his brain which doctors eventually brought under control the following morning after performing two separate operations. After the first operation, lasting seven hours, Hadassah Director Shlomo Mor-Yosef reported Sharon's bleeding had stopped and his brain was functioning without artificial support.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Jeffery. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1678355,00.html Sharon's condition critical after surgery], ''[[The Guardian]] '', 5 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After a second, 14-hour surgery, Sharon was placed on a [[ventilator]] and some reports suggested that he was suffering from [[paralysis]] in his lower body, while others said he was still fighting for his life. He was placed in an [[induced coma]] and his Prime Ministerial duties were handed over to his deputy, [[Ehud Olmert]]. On Friday, 6 January, Sharon was brought back into the [[operating theatre]] after doctors reviewed the results of a [[brain scan]]. Hospital officials declined to comment on these reports.

On the night of Sharon's stroke, in the wake of his serious illness and following consultations between Government Secretary [[Israel Maimon]] and Attorney General [[Menachem Mazuz]], Sharon was declared &quot;temporarily incapable of discharging his powers.&quot; As a result, [[Ehud Olmert]], the Deputy Prime Minister, was officially confirmed as the Acting Prime Minister of Israel. Olmert and the Cabinet announced that the [[Israel legislative election, 2006|elections]] would take place on 28 March as scheduled.

On 9 January, ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported that while performing tests on Sharon while treating his second stroke, doctors had discovered he was suffering from undiagnosed [[Congophilic angiopathy|cerebral amyloid angiopathy]] (CAA), a brain disorder which, in conjunction with [[anticoagulant]] medication prescribed after his first stroke, greatly increased his risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Although some have insinuated that this news represents a failure on the part of Hadassah Medical Center to provide adequate care for Sharon, CAA can be very difficult to diagnose accurately, and is often discovered only after an individual suffers a brain hemorrhage. The following day, newspapers reported that Sharon's CAA had actually been diagnosed following his first stroke in December. This was confirmed by hospital director Mor-Yosef who commented &quot;Hadassah physicians were aware of the brain diagnosis, and no new diagnosis has been made during the current hospitalization.&quot; Mor-Yosef declined to respond to criticism of the combination of blood thinners and a CAA diagnosis, though ''Haaretz'' quoted some doctors as saying the medication led to the second stroke and that it would never have been given if doctors had known about his brain condition.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Willacy, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/01/10/1545220.htm Israeli PM Sharon moves left side], ''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]'', 10 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon underwent subsequent surgeries the following month. On 11 February 2006, doctors performed emergency surgery to remove 50&amp;nbsp;cm of his [[large intestine]] that had become [[necrosis|necrotic]], probably because of a blood clot.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Siegel-Itzkovich, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1139395387057&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull PM 'stable' after emergency surgery], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', 11 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February, he underwent an additional procedure to drain excess fluid from his stomach, discovered during a [[computed tomography|CT]] scan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/22/sharon.procedure/index.html Comatose Sharon has stomach drained], [[CNN]], 23 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Treatment===
Several commentators have criticised Sharon's care. Most seriously, after his second stroke, Sharon was transported by ground ambulance to the hospital, a trip that took approximately one hour. Helicopter transport was not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4582574.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Israeli PM suffers serious stroke |publisher=BBC News |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, other commentators have said that the dose of blood thinner given to Sharon was potentially problematic for someone who had recently suffered a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sabin Russell, Chronicle Medical Writer |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/01/05/MNGL8GHN051.DTL |title=Sharon felled by medicine side effect / Rare consequence of blood-thinner to prevent new stroke |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement by Ehud Olmert===
According to Israeli law, an Acting Prime Minister can remain in office 100 days after the Prime Minister has become incapacitated. After 100 days, the Israeli President must appoint a new Prime Minister. At the time of his stroke, Sharon enjoyed considerable support from the general public in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4585686.stm| date=5 January 2006| title=Can Kadima survive without Sharon?| first=Jonathan| last=Marcus| accessdate=28 March 2006|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Centrism|centrist]] political party that he founded, [[Kadima]], won the largest number of seats in the [[Israeli legislative elections, 2006|Knesset elections]] held on 28 March 2006. (Since Sharon was unable to sign a nomination form, he was not a candidate and therefore ceased to be a Knesset member.)

On 6 April, President of Israel [[Moshe Katsav]] formally asked Ehud Olmert to form a government, making him Prime Minister-Designate. Olmert had an initial period of 28 days to form a governing [[coalition government|coalition]], with a possible two-week extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Although Sharon's replacement was to be named within 100 days of his becoming incapacitated, the replacement deadline was extended due to the Jewish festival of [[Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/705050.html| title=Cabinet approves appointment of Ehud Olmert as interim PM| first=Nir| last=Hasson| publisher=Ha'aretz| date=6 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A provision was made that, should Sharon's condition improve between 11 April and 14 April, the declaration would not take effect. Therefore, the official declaration took effect on 14 April, formally ending Sharon's term as Prime Minister and making [[Ehud Olmert]] the country's new Prime Minister.

===Subsequent care===
On 28 May 2006, Sharon was transferred from the hospital in Jerusalem to a long-term care unit of the [[Sheba Medical Center]] in [[Tel HaShomer]], a large civilian and military hospital. ''Ha'aretz'' reported that this move was an indication that Sharon's doctors did not expect him to emerge from his coma in the foreseeable future. Dr. Yuli Krieger, a physician not involved in Sharon's case, told [[Israel Radio]] that the chances of waking up after such a lengthy coma were small. &quot;Every day that passes after this kind of event with the patient still unconscious the chances that he will gain consciousness get smaller,&quot; said Krieger, Deputy Head of Levinstein House, another long-term care facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtVty.jhtml?sw=sharon&amp;itemNo=720578| title=Ariel Sharon transferred to long-term treatment in Tel HaShomer

On 3 November 2006, it was reported that Sharon had been admitted to intensive care after contracting an infection, though doctors insisted that his condition was 'stable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6113330.stm| title=Sharon admitted to intensive care| date=3 November 2006|publisher=BBC News| accessdate=5 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was moved out of the intensive care unit on 6 November 2006 after treatment for a heart infection.

On 21 October 2010 artist [[Noam Braslavsky]] unveiled a life-sized sculpture of Sharon in a hospital bed with an IV drip at the [[Kishon Gallery]] in Tel-Aviv. The exhibition has caused some controversy, with Knesset member Yoel Hasson describing the work as &quot;sickening voyeurism&quot; and saying, &quot;I think it's a cheap way for the artist to get attention for his exhibition.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/10/20/sharon.sculpture.israel/index.html?hpt=C1 Sculpture of Ariel Sharon in coma to go on show in Israel], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2010 Ariel Sharon was moved to his home in the Sycamore Ranch for a 48 hour period the first of a series of planned &quot;visits&quot; home.

{{Sexual orientation}}

'''Affectional orientation''' (or '''romantic orientation''') is used both alternatively and side-by-side with [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;Crethar, H. C. &amp; Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire &amp; C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-5684-6. p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the perspective that sexual attraction is but a single component of a larger dynamic. To holders of this view, one's orientation is defined by whom one is predisposed to fall in love with, whether or not one desires that person sexually. Lately, the predominant use of the term &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is considered to reduce a whole category of desires and emotions, as well as power and connection, to sex.

This is an important concept amongst the [[Asexuality|asexual]] community where it is often referred to as '''romantic''' orientation and the term '''affectional''' orientation is rarely used. It does however retain its separation from sexual attraction and as such is seen by many as an orientation within an orientation amongst the asexual community. Taking from the fact that amongst this community this is known as the romantic orientation, the prefixes of homo-, hetero-, bi-, pan-, and a- have been used to form terms such as heteroromantic, biromantic and so on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asexuality.org/en/index.php?showtopic=44350&amp;st=60&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common term and part of every day conversation on the [[Asexual Visibility and Education Network|Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN)]] forums, and many members will refer to themselves as &quot;[romantic orientation] asexuals&quot;.

However some asexuals who identify as straight, gay, lesbian, or bi before asexual, or simply prefer that terminology, will sometimes refer to themselves as &quot;straight asexual&quot; or &quot;asexual lesbian&quot;.

'''Anoa''', or '''Dwarf Buffalo''', are a subgenus of ''[[Bubalus]]'' comprising two species native to [[Indonesia]]: the '''Mountain Anoa''' (''Bubalus quarlesi'') and the '''Lowland Anoa''' (''Bubalus depressicornis''). Both live in undisturbed rainforest, and are essentially miniature [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]]. They are similar in appearance to a deer, weighing 150&amp;ndash;300&amp;nbsp;kg (330&amp;ndash;660&amp;nbsp;lb).  

Both are found on the island of [[Sulawesi]] in [[Indonesia]]; the Mountain Anoa is also found on the nearby island of [[Buton]]. They apparently live singly or in pairs, rather than herds, except when the cows are about to give birth. One young is born per year.
[[Image:Lowland Anoa.JPG|thumb|left|A Lowland Anoa]]

Both species of anoa have been classified as endangered since the 1960s and the population continues to decrease.  It is believed unlikely that there are more than 5000 animals of each species remaining.  Reasons for the decline of the anoa include hunting for hide, horns and meat by the local peoples and loss of habitat due to the advancement of settlement.  Currently, hunting is the more serious factor in most areas. 

Mountain Anoa are also known as Anoa de Montana, Anoa de Quarle, Anoa des Montagnes, Anoa Pegunungan, and Quarle's Anoa. Lowland Anoa are also known as Anoa de Ilanura or Anoa des Plaines. They are also called sapiutan (or sapi utan/sapi outan).
[[Image:AnoaLyd.jpg|left|thumb]]
Lowland Anoa stand barely over 90 cm at the shoulder, and is the most diminutive of all [[Bovini|wild cattle]]. It is most closely allied to the larger Asiatic buffaloes, showing the same reversal of the direction of the hair on the back. The horns are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes, and there may be white markings on the legs and back; and the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct races. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct buffaloes, of which the remains are found in the Siwalik Hills of northern India. In habits the animal appears to resemble the Indian buffalo.It is usually solitary,they live in lowland forests and wet lands,it feeds on plants and understory.

'''Agner Krarup Erlang''' (January 1, 1878 &amp;ndash; February 3, 1929) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[engineer]], who invented the fields of [[teletraffic engineering|traffic engineering]] and [[queueing theory]].

Erlang created the field of [[PSTN|telephone network]]s analysis. His early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community, to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the [[Erlang formula]], which became a foundational element of present day [[telecommunication|telecommunication network]] studies. 

== Life ==

Erlang was born at [[Lonborg, Denmark|Lonborg]] (Lønborg), near [[Tarm]], in [[Jutland]].  He was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of [[Thomas Fincke]] on his mother's side.  At age 14, he passed the Preliminary Examination of the [[University of Copenhagen]] with distinction, after receiving dispensation to take it because he was younger than the usual minimum age.  For the next two years he taught alongside his father.

A distant relative provided free board and lodging, and Erlang prepared for and took the University of [[Copenhagen]] entrance examination in 1896, and passed with distinction.  He won a scholarship to the University and majored in [[mathematics]], and also studied [[astronomy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].  He graduated in 1901 with an MA and over the next 7 years taught at several schools including the Milton House School of Statistics and the St John's Centre for Resource Planning.{{where}}  He maintained his interest in mathematics, and received an award for a paper that he submitted to the University of Copenhagen. 

He was a member of the Danish Mathematicians' Association (TBMI) and through this met amateur mathematician [[Johan Jensen (mathematician)|Johan Jensen]], the Chief Engineer of the [[Copenhagen Telephone Company]] (KTAS in Danish), an offshoot of the [[Bell System|International Bell Telephone Company]].  Erlang worked for the CTC (KTAS) from 1908 for almost 20 years, until his death in Copenhagen after an abdominal operation.

He was an associate of the British [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]].

== Contributions ==

While working for the CTC, Erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service.  His thinking went further by finding how many [[telephone operator]]s were needed to handle a given volume of calls.  Most [[telephone exchange]]s then used human operators and [[telephone switchboard|cord boards]] to switch [[telephone call]]s by means of jack plugs.

Out of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher.  He would conduct measurements and was prepared to climb into street [[manhole]]s to do so. &lt;!-- He famously said that this was a &quot;no brainer.&quot;{{Fact|date=April 2008}} The actual quote in Danish w/translation would be desired. --&gt; He was also an expert in the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly [[logarithm]]s.  He devised new calculation methods for certain forms of tables.

He developed his theory of telephone traffic over several years.  His significant publications include: 
* In 1909 - &quot;The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations&quot; - which proves that the [[Poisson distribution]] applies to random telephone traffic.
* In 1917 - &quot;Solution of some Problems in the Theory of Probabilities of Significance in Automatic Telephone Exchanges&quot; - which contains his classic formulae for loss and waiting time.

These and other notable papers were translated into English, French and German.  His papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field.  One researcher from [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] is said to have learned Danish to study them.

The [[BT Group plc|British Post Office]] accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities. 

A unit of measurement, statistical distribution and programming language listed below have been named in his honour.

'''''Anyone Can Whistle''''' is a [[Musical theater|musical]] with a book by [[Arthur Laurents]] and music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]]. The story concerns a corrupt mayoress, an idealistic nurse, a man who may be a doctor, and various officials, patients and townspeople, all fighting to save a bankrupt town. This musical was [[Angela Lansbury]]'s first stage musical role.

==Productions==
Eager to work with both Laurents and Sondheim, Angela Lansbury accepted the lead role as Mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, despite her strong misgivings about the script and her ability to handle the score. Also signed were [[Lee Remick]] as Nurse Fay Apple and [[Harry Guardino]] as Hapgood. Laurents had wanted [[Barbra Streisand]] for the role of Fay, but she turned it down to star in [[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurents, Arthur. ''Original Story By -: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2001, ISBN 1-55783-467-9, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;  Following several weeks of rehearsal in [[New York City]], the company moved to [[Philadelphia]] for a pre-Broadway tryout period. The reviews were brutal and the audiences hostile, talking back to the cast and walking out in droves. Director Laurents, ignoring criticism about the show's message being trite and its absurdist style difficult to comprehend, poured his energies into restaging rather than dealing with the crux of the problem. Also hampering the production was the fact that Lansbury was being overshadowed by actor Henry Lascoe (whose sudden death of a heart attack on stage, in California while taping a TV episode of &quot;Day in Court&quot;, resolved that problem in an unexpected way).

After multiple revisions, the show opened on Broadway on April 4, 1964 at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where it closed after 9 performances and 12 previews, unable to overcome the generally negative reviews it had received. Scenic design was by [[William and Jean Eckart]], costume design by [[Theoni V. Aldredge]], and lighting design by [[Jules Fisher]].[[Choreographer]] [[Herbert Ross]] received the show's sole [[Tony Award]] nomination. 

The show became a cult favorite, and a truncated original cast recording released by [[Columbia Records]] sold well among Sondheim fans and musical theatre buffs. &quot;There Won't Be Trumpets,&quot; a song cut during previews, has become a favorite of [[cabaret]] performers.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. &quot;Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical&quot; (2001). Oxford University Press US. ISBN 0-19-509601-0, pp. 128, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 1995, a staged concert was held at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City as a benefit for the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]]. The concert was recorded by [[Columbia Records]], preserving for the first time musical passages and numbers not included on the original Broadway cast recording. (For example, the cut song &quot;It's Always A Woman&quot; was included at this concert.) Lansbury served as narrator, with [[Madeline Kahn]] as Cora, [[Bernadette Peters]] as Fay, and [[Scott Bakula]] as Hapgood. Additional cast included [[Chip Zien]], [[Ken Page (Actor)|Ken Page]], and Harvey Evans, the only original cast member to reprise his role.

In 2003, [[Sony]] reissued the original Broadway cast recording on [[compact disc]]. Two revivals were staged that year, one in London, at the Bridewell Theatre, and one in Los Angeles, at the Matrix Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/whistle.html#London Sondheim Guide Listing] sondheimguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ravinia Festival]], [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], Illinois presented a staged concert on August 26 and 27, 2005, with [[Audra McDonald]] (Fay), [[Michael Cerveris]] (Hapgood) and [[Patti LuPone]] (Cora).&lt;ref&gt;Olson, John.[http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/chicago/ch72.html Anyone Can Whistle, Ravinia Festival] talkinbroadway.com, August 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 11, 2008, Talk Is Free Theatre presented the Canadian professional premiere (in concert) at the Gryphon Theatre in [[Barrie]], [[Ontario]], with a fundraiser performance on January 13 at the Diesel Playhouse in Toronto, Ontario. It starred Adam Brazier as Hapgood, Kate Hennig as Cora, [[Blythe Wilson]] as Fay, and [[Richard Ouzounian]] as Narrator, who also served as director. Choreography was by Sam Strasfeld. Additional cast included Juan Chioran as Comptroller Shub, Jonathan Monro as Treasurer Cooley, and Mark Harapiak as Chief Magruder. Musical direction was provided by Wayne Gwillim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tift.ca Talk Is Free Theatre] tift.ca &lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City Center]] [[Encores!]] presented a staged concert from April 8 through April 11, 2010, with [[Sutton Foster]] as Nurse Fay Apple, [[Donna Murphy]] as Mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, and [[Raul Esparza]] as Hapgood, with direction and choreography by [[Casey Nicholaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138539-Is-a-Parade-in-Town-Anyone-Can-Whistle-Plays-City-Center-April-8-11 &quot;Is a Parade in Town?&quot;: 'Anyone Can Whistle' Plays City Center April 8-11] playbill.com, April 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The production was the second most attended in ''Encores!'' history, and Stephen Sondheim was present at the post-matinee talkback on April 10.&lt;ref&gt;Finkle, David.[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-finkle/first-nighter-anyone-can_b_533475.html &quot;Talk back with Sondheim&quot;] huffingtonpost.com, April 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
===Act 1===
The story is set in an imaginary American town that has gone bankrupt.  The only place in town doing good business is the local sanitarium, known as “The Cookie Jar,” whose inmates look much healthier than the disgruntled townspeople. (&quot;I'm Like the Bluebird&quot;)  All the money is in the hands of Cora Hoover Hooper, the stylish, ruthless mayoress and her cronies - Comptroller Schub, Treasurer Cooley, and Police Chief Magruder. Cora appears carried in a litter by her backup singers, and admits that she can accept anything except unpopularity (“Me and My Town”). The scheming Comptroller Schub, tells her that he has a plan to save her administration, and the town, promising “It's highly unethical.” He tells her to meet him at the rock on the edge of town.  At the rock, a local mother, Mrs. Schroeder, tries to tell her child, Baby Joan, to come down from the rock, when Baby Joan licks it - and a spring of water begins flowing from it. The town instantly proclaims a miracle, and Cora and her council eagerly anticipate tourist dollars as they boast of the water's curative powers. (&quot;Miracle Song&quot;)  It is soon revealed to Cora that the miracle is a fake, controlled by a pump inside the rock.  The only person in town who doubts the miracle is Fay Apple, an eternally skeptical young nurse from the Cookie Jar who refuses to believe in miracles.  She appears at the rock with all forty-nine of the inmates, or “Cookies” in tow, intending to let them take some of the water. Schub realizes that if they drink the water and do not change, people will discover the fake. As he tries to stop Fay, the inmates mingle with the townspeople, until no one can guess who is who. Fay disappears, and hiding from the police, admits that she hopes for one miracle - for a hero who can come and deliver the town from the madness (“There Won't Be Trumpets”).  Cora arrives on the scene with the Cookie Jar's manager, Dr. Detmold, but he says that Fay has taken the records to identify the inmates. He tells Cora that he is expecting a new assistant who might help them. At that moment a mysterious stranger, J. Bowden Hapgood, arrives asking for directions to the Cookie Jar. He is instantly taken for the new assistant.  Asked to identify the missing Cookies, Hapgood begins questioning random people and sorting them into two groups, group A, and group one, but refuses to divulge which group is which.  The town council becomes suspicious of this and try to force the truth out, but Hapgood questions them until they begin to doubt their own sanity. Cora is too caught up with his logic to care. (“Simple”) As the extended musical sequence ends, the lights black out except for a spotlight on Hapgood, who announces to the audience, “You are all mad!” Seconds later, the stage lights are restored.  The stage set has vanished, and the cast is revealed in theater seats, holding programs, applauding the audience.

===Act 2===
As act two opens, the two groups are now in bitter rivalry over who is the normal group (“A-1 March”) Another stranger, a French woman in a feathered coat appears.  It is really Fay Apple in disguise. She introduces herself as the Lady from Lourdes, a professional Miracle Inspector, come to investigate the miracle. As Schub runs off to warn Cora, Fay seeks out Hapgood in his hotel, and the two seduce each other in the style of a French romantic film. (“Come Play Wiz Me”) Fay tries to get Hapgood's help in exposing the miracle. Hapgood, however, sees through her disguise and wants to question her first.  Fay refuses to take her wig off, and confesses to him that this disguise, left over from a college play, is the only way she can break out of her rigid and cynical persona. She begins to hope, however, that Hapgood may be the one who can help her learn to be free. (“Anyone Can Whistle”) Meanwhile, the two groups continue to march, and Cora, trying to give a speech, realizes that Hapgood has stolen her limelight. (“A Parade in Town”) She and Schub plan an emergency meeting at her house.  Back at the hotel, Hapgood comes up with an idea, telling Fay to destroy the inmates' records. That way Fay can be free of them and they can stop pretending. When Fay is reluctant, Hapgood produces a record of his own - he is her fiftieth Cookie. He is a practicing idealist who, after years of attempted heroism, is tired of crusading and has come to the Cookie Jar to retire. Inspired by his record, Fay begins to tear the records up.  As she does, the Cookies appear and begin to dance (“Everybody Says Don't”).

===Act 3===
Act three begins with Cora at her house with her council. Schub has put the miracle on hiatus, but announces that they can easily turn the town against Hapgood by blaming him for it.  The group celebrates their alliance. (“I've Got You to Lean On”)  A mob quickly forms outside the hotel, and Hapgood and Fay, still disguised, take refuge under the rock, discovering the fraud.  Cora and the council confront them.  At that moment, Cora receives a telegram from the governor warning that if the quota of forty-nine cookies is not filled, she will be impeached. Schub tells her that since Hapgood never said who is normal or not, they can arrest anyone at random until the quota is filled.  Fay tries to get Hapgood to expose the miracle, but he warns her no one will believe it is a fake, because it works as a miracle should.  Fay wants his help stopping the Mayoress, but he refuses, since he is through with crusading. Although she knows she still isn't out of her shell, Fay angrily swears to go it alone. (“See What it Gets You”) As Cora and the police force begin rounding up Cookies, Fay tries to get the key away from the guards in an extended ballet sequence. (“The Cookie Chase”) As it ends, Fay is captured, and Dr. Detmold suddenly recognizes her. Fay tells the townspeople about the fake miracle, but the town refuses to believe her.  Detmold tells Cora that even without the records, Fay can identify the inmates from memory.  Cora warns that she will arrest forty-nine people, normal or not, and Fay, helplessly, identifies all the Cookies, except Hapgood.  She tells him the world needs people like him, and Hapgood can't turn himself in. He asks Fay to come with him, but she still can't bring herself to break free.  Parting ways, they reflect on what they briefly shared. (“With So Little to be Sure Of”) Word comes of a new miracle, two towns over, of a statue with a warm heart. Soon the town is all but deserted, and Cora is again upstaged. Again, Schub has the answer - since the Cookie Jar is still successful, they can turn the entire town into one big Cookie Jar! Cora realizes she and Schub are meant for each other, and they dance off together. As Fay resumes work, Detmold's real new assistant arrives, and Fay is horrified to realize that she is even more practical, rigid and disbelieving than Fay herself, and the new nurse marches the Cookies off to the next town to disprove the new miracle. Horrified at seeing what she might become, Fay returns to the rock calling for Hapgood. When he doesn't answer, she tries to whistle - and succeeds in blowing a shrill, ugly whistle. Hapgood appears again, saying 'That's good enough for me.' As they embrace, the water begins flowing from the rock - a true miracle this time. (Finale)

==Critical response==
Steven Suskin wrote: The &quot;fascinating extended musical scenes, with extended choral work, ... immediately marked Sondheim as the most distinctive theatre composer of his time. The first act sanity sequence ... and the third act chase ... are unlike anything that came before.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Z_usBBxC_TQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=rodgers+%22the+mad+show%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7zevwJ-Ydh&amp;sig=_9YhHbF8XUK1a9YtH9_rrZGzz50 &quot;Show Tunes: The Songs, Shows, and Careers of Broadway's Major Composers&quot; (2000), Steven Suskin, p. 278, ISBN 0-19-512599-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Taubman]] in his ''[[New York Times]]'' review wrote that Laurents' &quot;book lacks the fantasy that would make the idea work, and his staging has not improved matters. Mr. Sondheim has written several pleasing songs but not enough of them to give the musical wings. The performers yell rather than talk and run rather than walk. The dancing is the cream.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Taubman, Howard. &quot;Review&quot;, ''The New York Times'', April 6, 1964, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Unsuccessful attempts to change laws to discourage &quot;alcopops&quot; */ Who said this, and when and where did they say it?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:RevDrink.JPG|thumb|Two bottles of blue [[Rev (drink)|Rev]], an '''alcopop''' from Canada.]]
'''Alcopop''' is a derogatory term describing certain flavored [[alcoholic beverage]]s, including:
#[[malt beverage]]s to which various fruit juices or other flavorings have been added
#beverages containing wine to which ingredients such as fruit juice or other flavorings have been added ([[wine coolers]])
#beverages containing distilled alcohol and added ingredients such as fruit juices or other flavorings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=51&amp;GA=95&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=1625&amp;GAID=9&amp;LegID=29771&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= Illinois General Assembly 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'alcopop' (a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''alcohol'' and ''[[soft drink|pop]]'') is used by advocates of tighter restrictions on alcoholic beverage sales, who argue that the beverages are especially appealing to [[Legal drinking age|underage drinkers.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marininstitute.org/alcopops/resources/Alcopop_QA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms include '''FAB''' (flavored alcoholic beverage), '''FMB''' (flavored malt beverage),&lt;ref name=&quot;CBE&quot;&gt;
[http://www.boe.ca.gov/sptaxprog/pdf/fmbpaper2.pdf California Board of Equalization. Flavored Malt Beverages, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; '''PPS''' (pre-packaged spirit or premium packaged spirits), and '''RTD''' (Ready To Drink - [[Australia|Aus]] &amp; [[New Zealand|NZ]]). The alcohol industry does not use the term &quot;alcopop.&quot;

== Description ==

Alcopops tend to be [[sweetness|sweet]] and served in small [[bottle]]s (typically 330 ml in Europe and 355 ml, the normal size of a soda pop can, in North America), and between 4% and 7% [[alcohol by volume]]. In Europe and Canada, alcopops tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g. [[Smirnoff Ice]]) or rum (e.g. [[Bacardi Breezer]]). In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as [[hop (plant)|un-hopped]] [[beer]]s, depending on the state in which they are sold. Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring. Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can thus be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks. There are, however, stronger ones that ''are'' simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g. Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can only be sold where hard liquor is available.

[[File:Bacardibreezer.jpg|thumb|left| Two [[Bacardi Breezer]]s]]

In the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, though some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

According to the U.S. [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that differ from traditional malt beverages such as beer, ale, lager, porter, stout, or malt liquor in several respects. Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage character. Their flavor is derived primarily from added flavors rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. At the same time, flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer-type bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers, and their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages in the 4-6% alcohol by volume range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although flavored malt beverages are produced at breweries, their method of production differs significantly from the production of other malt beverages and beer. In producing flavored malt beverages, brewers brew a fermented base of beer from malt and other brewing materials. Brewers then treat this base using a variety of processes in order to remove malt beverage character from the base.
For example, they remove the color, bitterness, and taste generally associated with beer, ale, porter, stout, and other malt beverages. This leaves a base product to which brewers add various flavors, which typically contain distilled spirits, to achieve the desired taste
profile and alcohol level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the alcohol content of flavored malt beverages is similar to that of most traditional malt beverages, the alcohol in many of them is derived primarily from the distilled spirits component of the added flavors rather than from fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; (70 Fed. Reg. 194 et seq. ( January 3, 2005).)&lt;ref name=&quot;CBE&quot;/&gt;

In some [[Continental Europe]]an countries, such as [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], bottled [[beer cocktail]]s and [[Shandy|shandies]] are available, which are being marketed the same way like alcopops. However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.

Alcopop is also the name of a horse participating in the 2009 Melbourne Cup.

== History ==
Wine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when Bartles and Jaymes began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when [[Bacardi]] introduced the [[Bacardi Breezer|Breezer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.distell.co.za/runtime/popcontentrun.aspx?pageidref=1900 General&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with [[Two Dogs]], DNA Alcoholic Spring Water, [[Hooper's Hooch]] and [[Zima]], which was marketed under the title of &quot;malternative beverage&quot;. [[Wine coolers]] were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard. Later, [[Mike's Hard Lemonade]] was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called &quot;violence against lemons&quot;. [[Smirnoff]] also came out with another [[citrus]]-[[flavor]]ed [[malt beverage]] in the United States in the late 1990s called [[Smirnoff Ice]], which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places. (In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by [[Diageo]] as a PPS.)

Some have expressed concern that such drinks might appeal to children as they tend to be sweet and brightly colored. Many [[Alcohol advertising|alcopop advertising campaigns]] have been criticized as trying to make alcopops appeal to young drinkers. In the United Kingdom, that led to a media outcry during the mid-1990s as the [[tabloid]] press associated alcopops with &quot;under-age&quot; drinking which damaged sales and would lead to [[off-licence]]s withdrawing them from their stores.

In response to a complaint from the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI), the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001. The agency &quot;found no evidence of intent to target minors with the FMB products, packaging, or advertising. Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data.&quot;

The Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, [[product placement]], and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. &quot;The Commission’s investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs. Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission.

In December 2003, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] raised the tax on alcopops to equal that of  spirits, the second highest in [[Europe]]. [[Germany]] has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 [[euro]] per bottle effective August 1, 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to [[wine coolers]], which are being marketed the same way. Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States). On May 11, 2008, the [[Australia]]n Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it inline with the tax on spirits. There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives. This tax was revoked during March 2009 meaning the government had to pay back the 290 million collected on the tax.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The Federal Trade Commission report states, &quot;Further, industry-conducted research on consumers over the age of 21 who use FMBs shows that these consumers generally view the FMBs as substitutes for beer, ... This research also concludes that consumers are not likely to consume more than two or three FMBs on any occasion because of the products’
sweetness.&lt;ref name=FTC/&gt;

== Alcopop brands ==
Alcopop brands are numerous and their alcoholic base vary greatly.&lt;ref name=&quot;cocktailtimes.com&quot;&gt;http://www.cocktailtimes.com/indepth/rtd/rtd.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
Some notable brands include: [[Smirnoff Ice]], [[Mike's Hard Lemonade]],  [[Bacardi Breezer]], [[Skyy Blue]], [[Jack Daniel's]] Hard Cola, [[WKD Original Vodka]], and Six Degrees.

== Unsuccessful attempts to change laws to discourage &quot;alcopops&quot; ==
California's state assembly recently{{When|date=April 2011}} passed AB 346, a bill which requires manufacturers of &quot;alcopops&quot; to carry a 'warning' label stating &quot;ATTENTION: THIS DRINK CONTAINS ALCOHOL.&quot; This bill was praised by groups advocating against alcohol use by minors and younger adults,&lt;ref name=AssemblyPraised&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/california-assembly-praised-for-passing-ab-346---the-alcopops-warning-label-bill-57979997.html California Assembly Praised for Passing AB 346 - The Alcopops Warning Label Bill&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; since these drinks are sometimes favored by young people due to their flavor.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} However, passage of a bill by the state assembly alone does not change the law and the state senate and governor had not yet{{When|date=April 2011}} endorsed the bill.&lt;ref name=AssemblyPraised/&gt;

The Australian government attempted to increase the tax on these drinks to the same rate as spirits, volumetrically, in an effort to stop [[binge drinking]]. The tax was criticized by the opposition as a tax grab, and voted down in the Senate on March 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/national/alcopops-tax-fails-to-pass-senate-20090318-91zw.html Alcopops tax fails to pass Senate], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a tax was in effect for some period of time,{{When|date=April 2011}} raising at least $AU 290 million after April 2008.&lt;ref name=TryAgain/&gt; In April 2009, some Labor party members said that they planned to resubmit the tax to the Senate, where this time it was expected to pass.&lt;ref name=TryAgain&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25337669-421,00.html Government to try again with alcopops tax], news.com.au, 15 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], alcopops were criticised as &quot;insidious means by which the brewing companies seduce young people into the evils of drinking.&quot;{{cn|date=April 2011}} [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Patricia Hewitt]] called for a tax increase on such products, although this had not yet happened as of December 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyandpolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-62.html|title=Binge drinking and moral panics: historical parallels??|last=Borsay|first=Peter|date=September 2007|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|language=[[English language|English]]|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}

In [[chemistry]], an '''alkali''' ({{IPA-en|ˈælkəlaɪ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Al-Qaly'' القلي, القالي ) is a [[Base (chemistry)|basic]], [[Ionic compound|ionic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of an [[alkali metal]] or [[alkaline earth metal]] [[Chemical element|element]]. Some authors also define an alkali as a [[Base (chemistry)|base]] that dissolves in [[water]]. A solution of a soluble [[Base (chemistry)|base]] has a [[pH]] greater than 7. The [[adjective]] '''alkaline''' is commonly used in [[English language|English]] as a [[synonym]] for base, especially for [[soluble]] bases. This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the [[Acid-base reaction theories|Arrhenius]] definition of a base and are still among the more common bases.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;alkali&quot; is derived from Arabic '''al qalīy''' = ''the calcined ashes'', referring to the original source of alkaline substance. Ashes were used in conjunction with animal fat to produce [[soap]], a process known as [[saponification]].

== Common properties ==
Alkalis are all [[Acid-base reaction theories|Arrhenius]] bases, which form hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) when dissolved in water. Common properties of alkaline aqueous [[solution]]s include:
* Moderately concentrated solutions (over 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; M) have a pH of 7.1 or greater. This means that they will turn [[phenolphthalein]] from colorless to pink.
* Concentrated solutions are [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] (causing chemical burns).
* Alkaline solutions are slippery or soapy to the touch, due to the [[saponification]] of the fatty acids on the surface of the skin.
* Alkalis are normally [[solubility|water soluble]], although some like [[barium carbonate]] are only soluble when reacting with an acidic aqueous solution.
*Acids and alkalis are measured on a pH scale
*Turns Universal Indicator Blue-Dark Purple.

== Difference between alkali and base ==

The terms &quot;base&quot; and &quot;alkali&quot; are often used interchangeably, particularly outside of a scientific context.

There are various definitions for alkali. Alkali is often defined as a subset of base. However, two subsets are commonly chosen.
* A basic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=alkali&lt;/ref&gt; (This includes Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but excludes NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.)
* Any base that is water-soluble and forms hydroxide ions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029936.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/alkali&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wahyan.edu.hk/paulsir/handout/form4/4-05_Characteriscs_of_alkali.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or the solution of a base in water&lt;ref&gt;http://www.krysstal.com/acidbase.html&lt;/ref&gt;. (This excludes Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but includes NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.)

The second subset of base is also called an [[Acid-base reaction theories|Arrhenius base]].

== Salts ==

Most [[basic salts]] are alkali salts, of which common examples are:

* [[sodium hydroxide]] (often called &quot;caustic soda&quot;)
* [[potassium hydroxide]] (commonly called &quot;caustic potash&quot;)
* [[wikt:lye|lye]] (generic term, for either of the previous two, or even for a mixture)
* [[calcium carbonate]] (sometimes called &quot;free lime&quot; or &quot;limewater&quot;)
* [[magnesium hydroxide]] is an example of an atypical alkali since it has low solubility in water (although the dissolved portion is considered a strong base due to complete dissociation of its ions).

== Alkaline soil ==
Soil with a pH value higher than 7.3 is normally referred to as alkaline. This soil property can occur naturally, due to the presence of alkali salts. Although some plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including vegetables like [[cabbage]] and fodder like [[buffalograss]]), most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (pH between 6.0 and 6.8), and [[alkaline soil]]s can cause problems.

== Alkali lakes ==
In alkali lakes (a type of [[salt lake (geography)|salt lake]]), evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring alkali salts, often forming a crust of mildly basic salt across a large area.

Examples of alkali lakes:
*[[Alkali Lake (Oregon)]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]]
*[[Baldwin Lake (San Bernardino County, California)]]
*[[Mono lake]], [[California]], United States
*[[Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]] &lt;!-- Not Blueberry lake, ref see http://www.pnr-rpn.ec.gc.ca/nature/whp/sanctuaries/dc01s12.en.html --&gt;
*[[Spotted Lake]], [[British Columbia]], Canada
*[[Summer Lake (Oregon)|Summer Lake]], Oregon, United States
*[[Tramping Lake, Saskatchewan]], Canada
*[[Lake Magadi]], Kenya
*[[Lake Turkana]], [[Kenya]] (the largest alkali lake in the world)

'''''Ain't I a Woman?: Black women and feminism''''' is a 1981 book by [[bell hooks]] titled after [[Sojourner Truth]]'s &quot;[[Ain't I a Woman?]]&quot; speech, ISBN 0-89608-129-X. hooks examines the effect of [[racism]] and [[sexism]] on black women, the [[civil right]]s movement, and [[feminist]] movements from [[suffrage]] to the seventies. She argues that the convergence of sexism and racism during slavery contributed to black women having the lowest status and worst conditions of any group in American society. White female [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]] and suffragists were often more comfortable with black male abolitionists such as [[Frederick Douglass]], while southern [[Racial segregation|segregationalists]] and stereotypes of black female promiscuity and immorality caused protests whenever black women spoke. hooks points out that these white female reformers were more concerned with white morality than the conditions these morals caused black Americans.

Further, she argues that the stereotypes that were set during slavery still affect black women today. She argues that slavery allowed white society to [[stereotype]] white women as the pure goddess [[virgin]] and move black women to the seductive whore stereotype formerly placed on all women. This has justified the devaluation of black femininity and rape of black women which continues to this day. The work which black women have been forced to perform, either in slavery or in a discriminatory work place, that would be non-gender conforming for white women has been used against black women as a proof of their emasculating behaviour. bell hooks argues that [[black nationalism]] was largely a patriarchical and [[misogynist]] movement, seeking to overcome racial divisions by strengthening sexist ones, and that it readily latched onto the idea of the emasculating black ''[[matriarch]]'' proposed by [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], whose theories [[bell hooks]] often criticizes. 

Meanwhile, she says, the &quot;feminist movement&quot;, a largely white middle and upper class affair, did not articulate the needs of poor and non-white women, thus reinforcing sexism, racism, and [[classism]]. She suggests this explains the low numbers of black women who participated in the feminist movement in the 1970s, pointing to [[Louis Harris]]' [[Virginia Slims]] poll done in 1972 for [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] that she says showed 62 percent of black women supported &quot;efforts to change women's status&quot; and 67 percent &quot;sympathized with the women's rights movement&quot;, compared with 45 and 35 percent of white women (also Steinem, 1972). &lt;!-- Please verify the quoted sections are the exact phrasing of the survey. --&gt;

'''AMOS BASIC''' is a dialect of the [[BASIC]] [[programming language]] implemented on the [[Amiga]] computer. AMOS BASIC was published by [[Europress Software]] and originally written by [[François Lionet]] with [[Constantin Sotiropoulos]].

== History ==

AMOS is a descendant of [[STOS BASIC]] for the [[Atari ST]]. AMOS BASIC was first produced in 1990. 

AMOS competed on the Amiga platform with Acid Software's [[Blitz BASIC]]. Both BASICs differed from other dialects on different platforms, in that they allowed the easy creation of fairly demanding multimedia software, with full structured code and many high-level functions to load images, animations, sounds and display them in various ways.

The original AMOS version was [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] which, whilst working fine, suffered from performance problems. Later, an AMOS [[compiler]] was developed, that reduced this problem.

To speed up the animation of sprites, AMOS later included the AMOS Animation Language (AMAL), a [[compiler (computing)|compiled]] sprite scripting language which runs independently of the main AMOS BASIC program.[http://grove.ufl.edu/~cwarner/computers.html] It was also possible to control screen and &quot;rainbow&quot; effects using AMAL scripts.

After the original version of AMOS, Europress released two other versions: '''Easy AMOS''', a simpler version for beginners, and '''AMOS Professional''', a more advanced version with added features, such as a better [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[ARexx]] support, a new [[user interface|UI]] sublanguage and new flow control constructs. Neither of these new versions was significantly more popular than the original AMOS.

AMOS was mostly used to make [[video game]]s (platformers and graphical adventures) and educational software.

The language was mildly successful within the Amiga community. Its ease of use made it especially attractive to beginners.

Perhaps AMOS BASIC's biggest disadvantage was its incompatibility with the Amiga's [[AmigaOS|operating system]] functions and interfaces. Instead, AMOS BASIC controlled the computer directly, which caused programs written in it to have a non-standard user interface, and also caused compatibility problems with newer versions of the operating system.

Today the language has declined in popularity along with the Amiga computer for which it was written. Despite this, a small community of enthusiasts are still using it. The [[source code]] to AMOS has since been released under a [[BSD licenses|BSD style license]] by [[Clickteam]] - a company that includes the original programmer.

The '''Arcadia 2001''' is a second-generation [[8-bit]] console released by [[Emerson Radio Corporation|Emerson Radio Corp]]. The game library was composed of 51 unique games and about 10 variations. The graphic quality is similar to that of the [[Intellivision]] and the [[Magnavox Odyssey²|Odyssey²]].

The Arcadia was not named after the company of the same name. Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the 2600 [[Starpath Supercharger|supercharger]], was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to [[Starpath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;starpath&quot;&gt;[http://www.emuunlim.com/doteaters/play4sta3.htm The Dot Eaters - Player4 Stage3 - Classic Video Game History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 worldwide, and over 30 Arcadia clones exist.

==Description==
The Arcadia is much smaller than its contemporary competitors and is powered by a standard 12-volt power supply so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. This portability feature, however, requires a portable television, which was extremely rare in the early 1980s. It also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.

The system came with two [[Intellivision]]-style control pads, but with a lighter touch on the side 'fire' buttons. The control pads have screw holes in their centers, so that one could transform them into a joystick, as with the later [[Sega Master System]]'s controller. Most games came with mylar overlays which could be applied to the controllers. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.

There are at least three different types of cartridge case styles and artwork, with variations on each.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Emerson-family carts come in two different lengths of black plastic cases; the short style is similar to Atari 2600 carts in overall size. This family uses a unique &quot;sketch&quot; type of picture label. MPT-03 family cart cases (see below) resemble Super NES carts in size and shape, except that they are molded in brown plastic. Their labels look much more modern and stylized, with only a minimal picture on each. There is also a family of what seems pirate carts, that look nothing like the others in shape, size or label artwork. The different labeled versions, however, all used the same cartridges.

==Market Failure==
The Emerson version of the console was essentially considered dead on arrival in the [[United States|USA]]. The system came out at nearly the same time as the [[Atari 5200]] and the [[ColecoVision]] were released. In addition, Atari's use of exclusive rights to many games made it virtually impossible for Emerson to get popular games to the console.

Emerson actually created many popular arcade titles including ''[[Pac-Man]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Defender (game)|Defender]]'' for the Arcadia and had them manufactured. However, Atari started to sue its competitor companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and Emerson was left with thousands of manufactured games that could no longer be sold{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.

==Variants==
The Arcadia 2001 was licensed to many different companies and sold under different names. However, not all consoles are compatible due to differences in cart slots and cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.png|320px|thumb|The ''alternated cubic honeycomb'' is one of 28 space-filling uniform tessellations in Euclidean 3-space, composed of alternating yellow [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] and red [[octahedron|octahedra]].]]
In [[geometry]], a '''convex uniform honeycomb''' is a [[uniform polytope|uniform]] [[tessellation]] which fills three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] with non-overlapping [[convex polyhedron|convex]] [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedral]] cells.

Twenty-eight such honeycombs exist:
* the familiar [[cubic honeycomb]] and 7 truncations thereof;
* the [[alternated cubic honeycomb]] and 4 truncations thereof;
* 10 prismatic forms based on the [[#Prismatic_stacks|uniform plane tilings]] (11 if including the cubic honeycomb);
* 5 modifications of some of the above by elongation and/or gyration.

They can be considered the three-dimensional analogue to the [[List of uniform planar tilings|uniform tilings of the plane]].

== History ==
* '''1900''': [[Thorold Gosset]] enumerated the list of semiregular convex polytopes with regular cells ([[Platonic solid]]s) in his publication ''On the Regular and Semi-Regular Figures in Space of n Dimensions'', including one regular cubic honeycomb, and two semiregular forms with tetrahedra and octahedra.
* '''1905''': [[Alfredo Andreini]] enumerated 25 of these tessellations.
* '''1991''': [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]]'s manuscript ''Uniform Polytopes'' identified the complete list of 28.
* '''1994''': [[Branko Grünbaum]], in his paper ''Uniform tilings of 3-space'', also independently enumerated all 28, after discovering errors in Andreini's publication. He found the 1905 paper, which listed 25, had 1 wrong, and [[Convex uniform honeycomb#Nonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated)|4 being missing]]. Grünbaum states in this paper that Norman Johnson deserves priority for achieving the same enumeration in 1991. He also mentions that [[I. Alexeyev]] of Russia had contacted him regarding a putative enumeration of these forms, but that Grünbaum was unable to verify this at the time.
* '''2006''': [[George Olshevsky]], in his manuscript ''Uniform Panoploid Tetracombs'', along with repeating the derived list of 11 convex uniform tilings, and 28 convex uniform honeycombs, expands a further derived list of 143 convex uniform tetracombs (Honeycombs of [[uniform polychoron]]s in 4-space).

Only 14 of the convex uniform polyhedra appear in these patterns:
* three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s,
* six of the thirteen [[Archimedean solid]]s, and
* five of the infinite family of [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s.

=== Names ===
This set can be called the '''regular and semiregular honeycombs'''. It has been called the '''Archimedean honeycombs''' by analogy with the convex uniform (non-regular) polyhedra, commonly called [[Archimedean solid]]s. Recently [[John Horton Conway|Conway]] has suggested naming the set as the '''Architectonic tessellations''' and the dual honeycombs as the '''Catoptric tessellations'''.

The individual honeycombs are listed with names given to them by [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]]. (Some of the terms used below are defined in [[Uniform polychoron#Geometric derivations]].)

For cross-referencing, they are given with list indices from [A]ndreini (1-22), [W]illiams(1-2,9-19), [J]ohnson (11-19, 21-25, 31-34, 41-49, 51-52, 61-65), and [G]runbaum(1-28).

== Compact Euclidean uniform tessellations (by their infinite Coxeter group families) ==
[[File:Coxeter-Dynkin 3-space groups.png|400px|thumb|Fundamental domains in a cubic element of three groups.]]

The fundamental infinite [[Coxeter group]]s for 3-space are:
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{C}}_3&lt;/math&gt;, [4,3,4], cubic, {{CDD|node|4|node|3|node|4|node}} (8 unique forms plus one alternation)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{B}}_3&lt;/math&gt;, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;], alternated cubic, {{CDD|nodea|3a|branch|3a|4a|nodea}} (11 forms, 3 new)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_3&lt;/math&gt; cyclic group, [(3,3,3,3)], {{CDD|branch|3ab|branch}} (5 forms, one new)

In addition there are 5 special honeycombs which don't have pure reflectional symmetry and are constructed from reflectional forms with ''elongation'' and ''gyration'' operations.

The total unique honeycombs above are 18.

The prismatic stacks from infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{C}}_2&lt;/math&gt;x&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;, [4,4]x[∞] prismatic group, {{CDD|node|4|node|4|node|2|node|infin|node}} (2 new forms)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{H}}_2&lt;/math&gt;x&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;, [6,3]x[∞] prismatic group, {{CDD|node|6|node|3|node|2|node|infin|node}} (7 unique forms)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_2&lt;/math&gt;x&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;, (3 3 3)x[∞] prismatic group, {{CDD|node|split1|branch|2|node|infin|node}} (No new forms)
# The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;x&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;x&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{I}}_1&lt;/math&gt;, [∞]x[∞]x[∞] prismatic group, {{CDD|node|infin|node|2|node|infin|node|2|node|infin|node}} (These all become a ''cubic honeycomb'')

In addition there is one special ''elongated'' form of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.

The total unique prismatic honeycombs above (excluding the cubic counted previously) are 10.

Combining these counts, 18 and 10 gives us the total 28 uniform honeycombs.

=== The C&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [4,3,4] group (cubic) ===
The regular cubic honeycomb, represented by Schläfli symbol {4,3,4}, offers seven unique derived uniform honeycombs via truncation operations. (One redundant form, the ''runcinated cubic honeycomb'', is included for completeness though identical to the cubic honeycomb.)

=== B&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, [4,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] group ===

The &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{B}}_4&lt;/math&gt; group offers 11 derived forms via truncation operations, four being unique uniform honeycombs.

The honeycombs from this group are called ''alternated cubic'' because the first form can be seen as a ''cubic honeycomb'' with alternate vertices removed, reducing cubic cells to tetrahedra and creating octahedron cells in the gaps.

Nodes are indexed left to right as ''0,1,0',3'' with 0' being below and interchangeable with ''0''. The ''alternate cubic'' names given are based on this ordering.

=== Nonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated) ===
Three more uniform honeycombs are generated by breaking one or another of the above honeycombs where its faces form a continuous plane, then rotating alternate layers by 60 or 90 degrees (''gyration'') and/or inserting a layer of prisms (''elongation'').

The elongated and gyroelongated alternated cubic tilings have the same vertex figure, but are not alike.  In the ''elongated'' form, each prism meets a tetrahedron at one triangular end and an octahedron at the other.  In the ''gyroelongated'' form, prisms that meet tetrahedra at both ends alternate with prisms that meet octahedra at both ends.

The gyroelongated triangular prismatic tiling has the same vertex figure as one of the plain prismatic tilings; the two may be derived from the gyrated and plain triangular prismatic tilings, respectively, by inserting layers of cubes.

=== Prismatic stacks ===
Eleven '''prismatic''' tilings are obtained by stacking the eleven [[tiling by regular polygons|uniform plane tilings]], shown below, in parallel layers.  (One of these honeycombs is the cubic, shown above.)  The [[vertex figure]] of each is an irregular [[bipyramid]] whose faces are [[isosceles triangle]]s.

There's only 3 unique honeycombs from the square tiling, but all 6 tiling truncations are listed below for completeness, and tiling images are shown by colors corresponding to each form.

The [[tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb|alternated cubic honeycomb]] is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic [[close-packing]] of spheres. The space-filling [[truss]] of packed octahedra and tetrahedra was apparently first discovered by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and independently re-discovered by [[Buckminster Fuller]] (who called it the [[octet truss]] and patented it in the 1940s).
[http://tabletoptelephone.com/~hopspage/Fuller.html]

[http://www.n55.dk/MANUALS/DISCUSSIONS/OTHER_TEXTS/CM_TEXT.html]
[http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-2.html]. Octet trusses are now among the most common types of truss used in construction.

FIXME: move this discussion of octet truss to [[Buckminster Fuller]] or perhaps [[octet truss]], leaving behind a link to where it went.

== Hyperbolic forms ==
[[File:Hyperbolic orthogonal dodecahedral honeycomb.png|thumb|The [[Order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb|{5,3,4} honeycomb]] in 3D hyperbolic space, viewed in perspective]]
{{main|Convex uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space}}

There are 9 [[Coxeter group]] families of compact uniform honeycombs in [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]], generated as [[Wythoff construction]]s, and represented by ring permutations of the [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]]s for each family. 

From these 9 families, there are a total of 76 unique honeycombs generated:
* [3,5,3] : {{CDD|node|3|node|5|node|3|node}} - 9 forms
* [5,3,4] : {{CDD|node|5|node|3|node|4|node}} - 15 forms
* [5,3,5] : {{CDD|node|5|node|3|node|5|node}} - 9 forms
* [5,3&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;] : {{CDD|nodes|split2|node|5|node}} - 11 forms (7 overlap with [5,3,4] family, 4 are unique)
* (4 3 3 3) : {{CDD|label4|branch|3ab|branch}} - 9 forms
* (4 3 4 3) : {{CDD|label4|branch|3ab|branch|label4}} - 6 forms
* (5 3 3 3) : {{CDD|label5|branch|3ab|branch}} - 9 forms
* (5 3 4 3) : {{CDD|label5|branch|3ab|branch|label4}} - 9 forms
* (5 3 5 3) : {{CDD|label5|branch|3ab|branch|label5}} - 6 forms

The full list of hyperbolic uniform honeycombs has not been proven and an unknown number of [[non-Wythoffian]] exist. One known example is in the {3,5,3} family.

There are also 23 noncompact Coxeter groups of rank 4. These families can produce uniform honeycombs with unbounded facets or vertex figure, including ideal vertices at infinity:

An '''assassination''' is &quot;to murder (a usually prominent person) by a sudden and/or secret attack, often for political reasons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Other definitions include:
* [[The American Heritage Dictionary]]: &quot;To murder (a prominent person) by surprise attack, as for political reasons.&quot; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/assassinate Thefreedictionary.com]
* [[Collins English Dictionary]]:  &quot;to murder (a person, esp a public or political figure), usually by a surprise attack.&quot; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/assassinate Thefreedictionary.com]

* [[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]] 2008: assassinate-&quot;murder (a political or religious leader).&quot; [http://www.wordreference.com/definition/assassinate Wordreference.com]
* [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: &quot;The action of assassinating; the taking the life of any one by treacherous violence, esp. by a hired emissary, or one who has taken upon him to execute the deed.&quot;
* [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assassination?show=1&amp;t=1286329706 assassination]: 1) &quot;to injure or destroy unexpectedly and treacherously&quot;. 2) to murder (a usually prominent person) by sudden or secret attack often for political reasons

Assassinations may be prompted by [[religion|religious]], [[ideology|ideological]], [[politics|political]], or [[military]] motives. Additionally, assassins may be prompted by [[contract killing|financial gain]], [[revenge]] for perceived grievances, a desire to acquire fame or notoriety (that is, a psychological need to garner  [[celebrity|personal public recognition]]), a wish to form some kind of &quot;relationship&quot; with the public figure, a wish or at least willingness  to be killed or commit suicide in the attack.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Hashshashin}}
The word ''assassin'' is derived from the word ''[[Hashshashin]]'' (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also Hashishin, Hashashiyyin, or Assassins),&lt;ref&gt;American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77–83&lt;/ref&gt;  and shares its etymological roots with ''[[hashish]]'' ({{IPAc-en|icon|h|æ|ˈ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}}; from [[Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|حشيش}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥashīsh}}'').&lt;ref name=&quot;The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam&quot;&gt;[''The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam'' – Bernard Lewis, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to the [[Nizari]] branch of the [[Ismā'īlī]] [[Shia]] founded by the Persian [[Hassan-i Sabbah|Hassan aṣ-Ṣabbaḥ]] during the Middle Ages. They were active in the fortress of [[Alamut]] in [[Iran]] from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and also controlled the castle of [[Masyaf]] in [[Syria]]. The group killed members of the Muslim [[Abbasid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]], and Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] élite for political and religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Altair Cassell Illustrated, 2005. ISBN 978-1-84403-416-1&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is commonly believed that assassins were under the influence of [[hashish]] during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate whether these claims have merit.&lt;ref name=&quot;C:AH&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cannabis:+A+History#v=onepage&amp;q=hashishiyya&amp;f=false | author= Martin Booth | title= Cannabis: A History |year= 2004 | publisher= Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hashshashin were eradicated by the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1275.

The earliest known literary use of the word ''assassination'' is in ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (1605).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Assassination.&quot; Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford University Press, second edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inventing English: A Portable History of the Language, Seth Lerer, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in history==
{{Main|History of assassination}}

===Ancient to medieval times===
[[File:Jacques Clément.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination of King [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]]]
Assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]].  It dates back at least as far as recorded history.

Perhaps the earliest-recorded instance is the murder of [[Moab]]ite King [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]], by [[Ehud]] around 1337&amp;nbsp;BC, described in the ''[[Book of Judges]]''. [[Philip II of Macedon]] (336&amp;nbsp;BC), the father of [[Alexander the Great]], and Roman consul [[Julius Caesar]] (44&amp;nbsp;BC) are famous victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kloWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=famous+assassinations&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kpnHTK-8FsP78AaH2eDYDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Famous assassinations of history ... |publisher= |date=March 3, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperors of Rome]] often met their end in this way, as did many of the [[Shia Imam]]s. The practice was also well known in ancient China, as in [[Jing Ke]]'s failed assassination of King [[Qin Shi Huang]] (227&amp;nbsp;BC). In ancient India [[Chanakya]] wrote about assassinations in his political treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]''. In 1192, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the ''[[de facto]]'' [[King of Jerusalem]], was assassinated by hashshashin.

[[File:GersonWojciech.1881.ZabojstwoPrzemyslawaIIWRogoznie.jpg|thumb|right|Assassination of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland]]
The [[Old Testament]] story of [[Book of Judith|Judith]] illustrates how a woman frees the Israelites by tricking and assassinating [[Holofernes]], a war-lord of the rival [[Assyria]]ns with whom the Israelites were at war.

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].  Blinding and strangling in the bathtub were the most commonly used procedures. With the [[Renaissance]], [[tyrannicide]]—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe. The reigns of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland (1296), [[William the Silent]] of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1589) and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1610) ended with assassination. High medieval sources also mention the assassination of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] (1089), dying at the hands of his own people who objected to a proposition by the Pope to go on a campaign to aid the [[Byzantine]]s against the [[Seljuk]] Turks. This is, however, broadly debated among historians since most do not accept this view of his death; it is most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the &quot;Curse of King Zvonimir&quot; is based on the legend of his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffzg.hr/pov/pov2/files/3zavod/radovi38/nemet38.pdf FFZG.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
As the world moved into the modern day, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the [[propaganda of the deed]]. In [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] alone, four emperors were assassinated within less than 200 years: [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], and [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].

[[File:Assassination of President Lincoln.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Assassination of President Abraham Lincoln]]; 1865 depiction. Assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]] on the right.]]

In the United States, within 100 years, four presidents, [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Abraham Lincoln]], [[James A. Garfield assassination|James Garfield]], [[William McKinley assassination|William McKinley]], and [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy]], died at the hands of assassins. There have been at least [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts|20 known attempts]] on U.S. presidents' lives.

In Europe the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] by [[Serbia]]n nationalist [[Insurgency|insurgents]] ([[Black Hand|The Black Hand]]) is blamed for igniting [[World War I]] after a succession of minor conflicts, while belligerents on both sides in [[World War II]] used operatives specifically trained for assassination. [[Reinhard Heydrich]] was killed by [[Operation Anthropoid|Czech partisan]] killers, and knowledge from decoded transmissions allowed the U.S. to carry out [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|a targeted attack]], killing Japanese [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] while he was travelling by plane. The Polish [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] conducted a regular [[Operation Heads|campaign of assassinations]] against top Nazi German officials in occupied Poland. [[Adolf Hitler]], meanwhile, was almost [[July 20 Plot|killed by his own officers]], and survived various attempts by other persons and organizations (such as [[Operation Foxley]], though this plan was never put into practice).

During the 1930s and 1940s [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[NKVD]] carried out numerous assassinations outside of the Soviet Union, such as the killings of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] leader [[Yevhen Konovalets]], [[Ignace Poretsky]], [[Fourth International]] secretary Rudolf Klement, [[Leon Trotsky]], and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]) leadership in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ellman.

===Cold War and beyond===
{{See also|Cold War|War on Terrorism}}
During the [[Cold War]], there was a dramatic new increase in the number of political assassinations{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

[[Liaquat Ali Khan]], the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], was assassinated by [[Saad Akbar]], a lone assassin, in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistani military (Rawalpindi conspiracy) or suppression of [[Communist]]s and antagonism towards the [[Soviet Union]], were potential reasons for his assassination.

In 1960, [[Inejiro Asanuma]], Chairman of the [[Japan Socialist Party|Japanese Socialist Party]], was assassinated in a stabbing by an extreme rightist.

The U.S. Senate Select Committee chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]] (the [[Church Committee]]) reported in 1975 that it had found &quot;concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro from 1960 to 1965.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0043a.htm Church Committee – Interim Report: Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders Part III.B, page 71] (from the 'history-matters.com' website. Retrieved 2008-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major powers repudiated Cold War assassination tactics, though many allege that this was merely a smokescreen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with Russia, [[Israel]], the U.S., [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Chile]], and other nations accused of still regularly engaging in such operations.&lt;ref&gt;John Dingles (2004) The Condor Years ISBN 978-1-56584-764-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (who survived an assassination attempt himself) ordered the [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] air raid on [[Libya]] in which one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler [[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Muammar Gaddafi]]. Gaddafi escaped unharmed; however, his adopted daughter [[Bombing of Libya (April 1986)#Casualties|Hanna]] was one of the civilian casualties.

In the [[Philippines]], the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] triggered the eventual downfall of the 20-year autocratic rule of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Aquino, a former [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] and a leading figure of the political opposition, was assassinated in 1983 at the [[Manila]] [[International Airport]] (now the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]) upon returning home from [[exile]]. His death thrust his widow, [[Corazon Aquino]], into the limelight and, ultimately, the presidency following the peaceful [[1986 EDSA Revolution]].

After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, the new Islamic government of Iran began an international campaign of assassination that lasted into the 1990s. At least 162 killings in 19 countries have been linked to the senior leadership of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/No-Safe-Haven_May08.pdf |title=English front cover - No Safe Haven  |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This campaign came to an end after the [[Mykonos restaurant assassinations]], because a German court publicly implicated senior members of the government and issued arrest warrants for [[Ali Fallahian]], the head of the Iranian Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/Murder-at-Mykonos_Mar07.pdf |title=Mykonos front cover |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence indicates that Fallahian’s personal involvement and individual responsibility for the murders were far more pervasive than his current indictment record represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranhrdc.org/httpdocs/English/pdfs/Reports/Condemned-by-Law_Nov08.pdf |title=Condemned by Law – Report 11-10-08.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 1988, President of [[Pakistan]] Gen. M. [[Zia ul Haq]] died along with his staff and the American Ambassador to Pakistan when his [[C-130]] transport plane exploded in mid-air after taking off from [[Bahawalpur]] because of an on-board bomb.

In post-Saddam [[Iraq]], the Shiite-dominated government used death squads to perform [[Extra-judicial killing|extrajudicial executions]] of radical [[Sunni]] Iraqis, with some alleging that the death squads were trained by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newsweek.com/id/47986 &quot;The Salvador Option&quot; – The Pentagon may put Special-Forces-led assassination or kidnapping teams in Iraq]'' – ''[[Newsweek]]'', Friday January 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/04/eveningnews/main2064668.shtml CBS: Death Squads In Iraqi Hospitals]'' – ''[[CBS|CBS Evening News]]'', Wednesday October 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Concrete allegations have since surfaced that the Iranian government has actively armed and funded Shia death-squads in post-Saddam Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.scotsman.com/world/Iran-training-Shia-death-squads.3356296.jp Iran 'training Shia death squads']'' – ''[Scotsman.com News]'', 22 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indira gandhi's saree at the time of her death.JPG|thumb|left|[[Indira Gandhi]]'s blood-stained ''[[sari]]'' and belongings at the time of her assassination. She was the [[Prime Minister of India]].]]
In India, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Ministers]] [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi]] (neither of whom were related to [[Mohandas Gandhi]], who was assassinated in 1948), were assassinated in 1984 and 1991. The assassinations were linked to [[separatist]] movements in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and northern [[Sri Lanka]], respectively.

In [[Israel]], [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]] was assassinated on November 4, 1995. [[Yigal Amir]] confessed and was convicted of the crime.

Israeli tourist minister [[Rehavam Ze'evi]] was assassinated on October 17, 2001, by [[Hamdi Quran]] and three other members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)]]. The PFLP stated that the assassination was in retaliation for the August 27, 2001, killing of [[Abu Ali Mustafa]], the Secretary General of the PFLP, by the [[Israeli Air Force]] under its policy of [[Israeli targeted killings|targeted killings]].

In [[Lebanon]], the assassination of former Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] on February 14, 2005, prompted an investigation by the [[United Nations]]. The suggestion in the resulting ''[[Mehlis report]]'' that there was [[Syria]]n involvement, prompted the [[Cedar Revolution]], which drove Syrian troops out of Lebanon.

In [[Pakistan]], former prime minister and opposition leader [[Benazir Bhutto]] was [[Benazir Bhutto assassination|assassinated in 2007]], while in the process of running for re-election. Bhutto's assassination drew unanimous [[International reaction to the Benazir Bhutto assassination|condemnation]] from the international community.&lt;ref&gt;''Benazir Bhutto shot dead at suicide bombing of rally; 20 feared dead'' – ''[[The Canadian Press]]'', Thursday December 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Guinea Bissau]], President [[João Bernardo Vieira]] was assassinated in the early hours of March 2, 2009, in the capital, [[Bissau]]. Unlike typical assassinations his death was not swift; he first survived an explosion at the Presidential Villa, was then shot and wounded, and finally was butchered with machetes. His assassination was carried out by renegade soldiers who were apparently revenging the killing of General [[Tagme Na Waie]], the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Guinea Bissau, who had been killed in a bomb explosion the day before.

==Further motivations==
===As military doctrine===
{{See also|Manhunt (military)}}

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused – [[Sun Tzu]], writing around 500&amp;nbsp;BC, argued in favor of using assassination in his book ''[[The Art of War]]''. Nearly 2000 years later [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also argued assassination could be useful in his book ''[[The Prince]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In medieval times, an army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war. However, in modern warfare a soldier's mindset is generally considered to surround ideals far more than specific leaders, while command structures are more flexible in replacing officer losses.

There is also the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader or such a killing (or a failed attempt) will &quot;[[martyr]]&quot; a leader and support his cause (by showing the moral ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a military tool at both tactical and strategic levels:

* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Isoroku Yamamoto's]] plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.

* The American perception that [[Otto Skorzeny|Skorzeny's]] [[commando]]s were planning to assassinate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] played havoc with Eisenhower's personal plans for some time, though it did not affect the battle itself. Skorzeny later denied in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that he had ever intended to assassinate Eisenhower during [[Operation Greif]], and said that he could prove it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skor&quot;&gt;''Commando Extraordinary'' – Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as &quot;The Desert Fox&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Skor&quot;/&gt;

Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:

* During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the U.S. engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and killed between 6,000 and 41,000 persons, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month.

===As tool of insurgents===
Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.

The [[Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919–21 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit – [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] – for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] (1969–present). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of RUC politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.

The [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

[[Israel]] has assassinated [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]] leaders.

In the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''Viet Cong'' – Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
A major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested for (not necessarily related) offenses, that 44% had a history of serious [[depression (mood)|depression]], and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

==Techniques==
[[File:Amanita phalloides 1.JPG|thumb|95px|[[Death cap]] mushrooms]]

===Ancient methods===
It seems likely that the first assassinations would have been direct and simple: [[stabbing]], [[strangle|strangling]] or [[bludgeon (weapon)|bludgeoning]].  The key technique was likely [[Infiltration tactics|infiltration]], with the actual assassination by stabbing, [[smothering]] or [[strangulation]]. [[Poison]]s also started to be used in many forms.

[[Death cap]] mushrooms and similar plants became a traditional choice of assassins especially if they could not be perceived as poisonous by taste, and the symptoms of the poisoning did not show until after some time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In ancient Rome, paid mobs were sometimes used to beat political enemies to death.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Modern methods===
[[File:Moordwillemzwijger2.jpg|thumb|Assassination of [[William the Silent]], Prince of Orange]]
With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584.  [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' – [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|left|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]
A [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austria&quot;&gt;''[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' – [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Deringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]
Despite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;/&gt;

In the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, it was learned that after fall of the USSR, the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella]. [[BBC]] World Service, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CIA]] has allegedly made several attempts to assassinate [[Fidel Castro]], many of the schemes involving poisoning his cigars. In the late 1950s, KGB assassin [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] killed Ukrainian nationalist leaders [[Lev Rebet]] and [[Stepan Bandera]] with a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed [[cyanide]] ampule, making their deaths look like heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]]. ''The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB.'' [[Basic Books]], 1999. ISBN 978-0-465-00312-9 p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 case in the UK concerned the [[Alexander Litvinenko poisoning|assassination of Alexander Litvinenko]] who was given a lethal dose of radioactive [[polonium]]-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent, had been granted asylum in the UK in 2000 after citing persecution in Russia. Shortly before his death he issued a statement accusing then-[[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] of involvement in his assassination. President Putin denies he had any part in Litvinenko's death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20082851241951 Putin 'Deplores' Spy Death]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}'' – [[Sky News]] Friday November 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

James Bell proposed &quot;Assassination Politics&quot; both as a political idea and as a logical consequence of anonymous cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/ap.htm |title=Cryptome.org |publisher=Cryptome.org |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially anonymous contributors fund those who can predict the time and manner of a given person's death; the &quot;predictor&quot; is also paid anonymously.

==Targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
[[File:081131-F-7734Q-001.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]; sometimes used in targeted killings]]
Targeted killing is the intentional killing–by a government or its agents–of a civilian or &quot;[[unlawful combatant]]&quot; targeted by the government, who is not in the government's custody.  The target is a person taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; Note that this is a different term and concept from that of &quot;targeted violence&quot; as used by specialists who study [[violence]].

Ibrahim Nafie, writing in Egypt's ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'' in 2001, criticized the U.S. for agreeing with &quot;the Israeli spin that calls ... its official policy of assassinating Palestinian leaders 'targeted killing.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ibrahim Nafie |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/557/op1.htm |title=Opinion &amp;#124; The very model of a rogue state |publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly  |date=October 31, 2001 |accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law]] Professor [[Gary D. Solis|Gary Solis]], in his 2010 book entitled ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Law+of+Armed+Conflict:+International+Humanitarian+Law+in+War&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KXz_S522EIOclgfB-8n6CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War]'', writes: &quot;Assassinations and targeted killings are very different acts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt;  The use of the term assassination is opposed, as it denotes [[murder]], whereas the terrorists are targeted in self-defense, and thus it is viewed as a killing, but not a crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOV&quot;&gt;''[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/26/EDGK65QPC41.DTL Targeted killing is a necessary option]'', Sofaer, Abraham D., [[Hoover Institution]], March 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge [[Abraham D. Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], former federal judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], wrote on the subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When people call a targeted killing an &quot;assassination,&quot; they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States.... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests.... But killings in self-defense are no more &quot;assassinations&quot; in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers.

==Counter-measures==
===Early forms===
[[File:Sattar Bodyguard.JPG|thumb|left|120px|Bodyguard of [[Sheikh|Sheik]] [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha]], who was killed by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]] in the Sheik's [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha#Death|assassination]] in 2007]]
One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing  [[bodyguard]]s. Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,&lt;ref name=&quot;SS&quot;&gt;''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study]'' – Fein, Robert A. &amp; Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).

Another notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Notable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]—though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.

===Modern strategies===
[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a [[brigade|small army]] trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars]'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  – so they only tended to be worn during high-profile public events, if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;&gt;[http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as [[communication]] became better and [[information technology]] more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during [[transport]], both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President  [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Patrice Lumumba]] and likely [[Salvador Allende]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080328190835/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554059/Allende_Gossens_Salvador.html Salvador Allende Gossens] (biography from the [[Encarta]] website).

[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] Popemobile in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]]]
The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[Popemobile]] of  [[Pope John Paul II]] – built following an attempt at his life. Politicians  often resent this need for separation –  sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report&quot;/&gt;

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]]  a person built similar to the person he is expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.   According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993–97, [[Fidel Castro]] used body doubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOX&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden ... or Is It? |publisher= [[Fox News]] |date=Thursday December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Secret Service]] protective agents receive training in the psychology of assassins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Pelley |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/14/60II/main171812.shtml |title=Mind Of The Assassin |publisher= CBS 60&amp;nbsp;Minutes II |date=August 15, 2000 |accessdate= March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcoholism''' is a disabling [[Substance use disorder|addictive disorder]]. It is characterized by compulsive and uncontrolled consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] despite its negative effects on the drinker's health, relationships, and social standing. Like other drug [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]s, alcoholism is medically defined as a treatable [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/388/alcoholism_treatable.pdf |title=DEFINITIONS |first= |last= |author=American Medical Association |authorlink=American Medical Association |publisher=AMA |location=USA |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''alcoholism'' is widely used, and was first coined in 1849 by Magnus Huss, but in medicine the term was replaced by the concepts of &quot;[[alcohol abuse]]&quot; and &quot;[[alcohol dependence]]&quot; in the 1980s [[DSM III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDiagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Abuse and Dependence - Alcohol Alert No. 30-1995&quot;/&gt; (The term ''alcohol dependence'' is sometimes used as a synonym for alcoholism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000944.htm |title=Alcoholism |author=MedlinePlus |coauthors=National Library of Medicine |date=15 January 2009 |publisher=National Institute of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/about/researchresultsforthepublic/AlcoholDependenceAlcoholism.pdf |title=Alcohol Dependence (Alcoholism) |author=Department of Health and Human Services |authorlink=Department of Health and Human Services |publisher=National Institutes of Health |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes in a narrower sense.) Similarly in 1979 an expert World Health Organisation committee disfavoured the use of &quot;alcoholism&quot; as a diagnostic entity, preferring the category of &quot;alcohol dependence syndrome&quot;.&lt;ref name=ladtpwho/&gt; In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, alcohol dependence was called [[dipsomania]] before the term &quot;alcoholism&quot; replaced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Tracy | first1 = Sarah J. | title = Alcoholism in America: from reconstruction to prohibition | url = http://books.google.com/?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&amp;pg=PA31 | date = 25 May 2005 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | isbn = 978-0-8018-8119-0 | pages = 31–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;alcoholism&quot; is commonly used, but poorly defined. The WHO calls alcoholism &quot;a term of long-standing use and variable meaning&quot;, and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO Expert Committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic, but does not define what is meant by the term &quot;alcoholic&quot; in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of AA, said:

:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Therefore we always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]] -- a far safer term for us to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovernWhite2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Thomas F. McGovern|author2=William L.

In professional and research contexts, the term &quot;alcoholism&quot; sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence.

In psychology and psychiatry, the DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, the standard is ICD. The terms they recommend are similar but not identical:

Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word &quot;alcoholism&quot; should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence|NCADD]] and [[American Society of Addiction Medicine|ASAM]] as &quot;a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Morse RM, Flavin DK |title=The definition of alcoholism.

A 1960 study by [[E. Morton Jellinek]] is considered the foundation of the modern [[disease theory of alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=OCTOBER 22 DEATHS|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/10/10_22.htm|publisher=todayinsci.com|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jellinek's definition restricted the use of the word &quot;alcoholism&quot; to those showing a particular [[natural history of disease|natural history]]. The modern medical definition of alcoholism has been revised numerous times since then. The [[American Medical Association]] currently uses the word alcoholism to refer to a particular chronic primary disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/388/sci_drug_addiction.pdf |title=Science of Addiction |author=Nora Volkow |publisher=American Medical Association |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting opinion===

See [[Disease theory of alcoholism]].

Some physicians, scientists and others within the field reject the theory of alcoholism as a disease. Critics of the disease model tend to use the term &quot;problem&quot; or &quot;heavy drinking&quot; when discussing the negative effects of alcohol consumption. A significant publication called 'Problem Drinking'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heather, Robertson|first=Nick, Ian|title=Problem Drinking|year=1997|publisher=OUP Oxford; 3 edition (14 Aug 1997)|isbn=0192628615|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Problem-Drinking-Oxford-Medical-Publications/dp/0192628615}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to 'bridge the wide gap that exists between the modern, scientific account of the nature of alcohol problems, and the popular understanding of the subject. In particular, it presents detailed evidence and arguments against the commonly accepted view that 'alcoholism' is best regarded as a disease.'

{{Main|Long-term effects of alcohol}}

Alcoholism is characterised by an increased [[tolerance]] of and [[physical dependence]] on alcohol, affecting an individual's ability to control alcohol consumption safely. These characteristics are believed to play a role in impeding an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman-1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hoffman | first1 = PL. | last2 = Tabakoff | first2 = B. | title = Alcohol dependence: a commentary on mechanisms. | journal = Alcohol Alcohol | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | month = Jul | year = 1996 | pmid = 8879279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders to develop and an increased risk of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=10476237 |year=1999 |month= March|last1=Dunn |first1=N |last2=Cook |title=Psychiatric aspects of alcohol misuse. |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=169–72 |issn=1462-3935 |journal=Hospital medicine (London, England : 1998) |author2=Cook }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;drug_abuse_prevention_a03&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Wilson | first1 = Richard | last2 = Kolander | first2 = Cheryl A. | title = Drug abuse prevention: a school and community partnership | year = 2003 | publisher = Jones and Bartlett | location = Sudbury, Mass. | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Cm1MfcBSucUC | isbn = 978-0-7637-1461-1 | pages = 40–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical====
[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|351px|right|Some of the possible [[long-term effects of ethanol]] an individual may develop. Additionally, in pregnant women, alcohol can cause [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].]]

Long term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[pancreatitis]], [[epilepsy]], [[polyneuropathy]], [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome|alcoholic dementia]], heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, and [[sexual dysfunction]], and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing [[cardiovascular disease]], [[malabsorption]], [[alcoholic liver disease]], and [[cancer]]. Damage to the [[central nervous system]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] can occur from sustained alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Müller D, Koch RD, von Specht H, Völker W, Münch EM |title=[Neurophysiologic findings in chronic alcohol abuse] |language=German |journal=Psychiatr Neurol Med Psychol (Leipz) |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=129–32 |year=1985 |month=March |pmid=2988001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Testino G |title=Alcoholic diseases in hepato-gastroenterology: a point of view |journal=Hepatogastroenterology |volume=55 |issue=82–83 |pages=371–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18613369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women develop long-term complications of alcohol dependence more rapidly than do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870&quot;/&gt; Examples of long term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268&quot; /&gt; and an [[alcohol and breast cancer|increased risk of breast cancer]]. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to have a negative effect on reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as [[anovulation]], decreased [[ovarian mass]], problems or irregularity of the [[menstrual cycle]], and early [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870&quot; /&gt; Alcoholic [[ketoacidosis]] can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of [[binge drinking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mihai-&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Mihai | first1 = B. | last2 = Lăcătuşu | first2 = C. | last3 = Graur | first3 = M. | title = [Alcoholic ketoacidosis] | journal = Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–6 | month = April–June | year = 2008 | pmid = 19294998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sibaï-2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sibaï | first1 = K. | last2 = Eggimann | first2 = P. | title = [Alcoholic ketoacidosis: not rare cause of metabolic acidosis] | journal = Rev Med Suisse | volume = 1 | issue = 32 | pages = 2106, 2108–10, 2112–5 | month = Sep | year = 2005 | pmid = 16238232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances.

Psychiatric disorders differ depending on gender. Women who have alcohol-use disorders often have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis such as major depression, anxiety, panic disorder, [[bulimia]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), or [[borderline personality disorder]]. Men with alcohol-use disorders more often have a co-occurring diagnosis of [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] or [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], schizophrenia, impulse disorders or [[attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356&quot; /&gt;
Women with alcoholism are more likely to have a history of physical or sexual assault, abuse and domestic violence than those in the general population,&lt;ref name=&quot;Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356&quot; /&gt; which can lead to higher instances of psychiatric disorders and greater dependence on alcohol.

====Social effects====
{{See also|Drug-related crime}}
The social problems arising from alcoholism are serious, caused by the pathological changes in the brain and the intoxicating effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name=aamaibnc /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&quot;/&gt; Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including [[child abuse]], [[domestic violence]], [[rape]], [[burglary]] and [[assault]].&lt;ref name=&quot;drug_use_a_reference_handbook&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Isralowitz | first1 = Richard | title = Drug use: a reference handbook | url = http://books.google.com/?id=X0mxxfbIbp4C | year = 2004 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, Calif. | isbn = 978-1-57607-708-5 | pages = 122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism is associated with [[termination of employment|loss of employment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Langdana | first1 = Farrokh K. | title = Macroeconomic Policy: Demystifying Monetary and Fiscal Policy | url = http://books.google.com/?id=GCYWQn79JYwC | date = 27 March 2009 | publisher = Springer | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-387-77665-1 | page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can lead to financial problems.

An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly impact those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to [[relational disorder|marital conflict]] and [[divorce]], or contribute to [[domestic violence]]. Alcoholism can also lead to [[child neglect]], with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children.&lt;ref name=tcemh2006&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Schadé | first1 = Johannes Petrus | title = The Complete Encyclopedia of Medicine and Health |date = October 2006| publisher = Foreign Media Books | url = http://books.google.com/?id=j8DuEHxSCU4C | isbn = 978-1-60136-001-4 | pages = 132–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol withdrawal===
{{Main|Alcohol withdrawal syndrome}}
As with similar substances with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as [[barbiturates]] and [[benzodiazepines]], withdrawal from alcohol dependence can be fatal if it is not properly managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Galanter |first1=Marc |last2=Kleber |first2=Herbert D. |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6wdJgejlQzYC |edition=4th |date=1 July 2008 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing Inc |location=United States of America |isbn=978-1-58562-276-4 |page=58 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], promoting [[central nervous system]] depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]]. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled [[synapse]] firing. This can result in symptoms that include [[anxiety]], life threatening [[seizure]]s, [[delirium tremens]], hallucinations, shakes and possible [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medical toxicology&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dart |first1=Richard C. |title=Medical Toxicology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qDf3AO8nILoC |edition=3rd |date=1 December 2003 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7817-2845-4 |pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Idemudia SO, Bhadra S, Lal H |title=The pentylenetetrazol-like interoceptive stimulus produced by ethanol withdrawal is potentiated by bicuculline and picrotoxinin |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=115–22 |year=1989 |month=June |pmid=2742726 |doi= 10.1016/0893-133X(89)90014-6|url= |issn=0893-133X |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially [[dopamine]], [[NMDA]] and [[glutamate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman-1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17128954 |date= October 2006|author=Chastain, G |title=Alcohol, neurotransmitter systems, and behavior. |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=329–35 |issn=0022-1309 |journal=The Journal of general psychology |doi=10.3200/GENP.133.4.329-335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic variation===
{{See also|Human genetic variation}}

Genetic differences exist between different racial groups which affect the risk of developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore-2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Moore | first1 = S. | last2 = Montane-Jaime | first2 = LK. | last3 = Carr | first3 = LG. | last4 = Ehlers | first4 = CL. | title = Variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes in people of East Indian and African descent from Trinidad and Tobago. | journal = Alcohol Res Health | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–30 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eng-2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Eng | first1 = MY. | last2 = Luczak | first2 = SE. | last3 = Wall | first3 = TL. | title = ALDH2, ADH1B, and ADH1C genotypes in Asians: a literature review. | journal = Alcohol Res Health | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol.

==Pathophysiology==
Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], promoting [[central nervous system]] depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medical toxicology&quot;/&gt; The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes.

A given amount of alcohol, therefore becomes more highly concentrated in a woman's body. A given amount of alcohol causes greater intoxication for women due to different hormone release compared to men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268&quot; /&gt;

===Social barriers===
Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870&quot; &gt;{{Cite journal|author=Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., ''et all'' |title=Alcoholism and alcohol abuse among women: report of the council on scientific affairs |journal=Journal of women's health |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=861–870 |year=1998 |doi= 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.861|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to publicly display their drinking, and to drink in groups.

===Screening===
Several tools may be used to detect a loss of control of alcohol use. These tools are mostly [[self report study|self report]]s in questionnaire form. Another common theme is a score or tally that sums up the general severity of alcohol use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahan-1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kahan | first1 = M. | title = Identifying and managing problem drinkers. | journal = Can Fam Physician | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 661–71 | month = Apr | year = 1996 | doi = | pmid = 8653034 | pmc = 2146411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CAGE questionnaire]], named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

:The CAGE questionnaire has demonstrated a high effectiveness in detecting alcohol related problems; however, it has limitations in people with less severe alcohol related problems, white women and college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Dhalla | first1 = S. | last2 = Kopec | first2 = JA. | title = The CAGE questionnaire for alcohol misuse: a review of reliability and validity studies. | journal = Clin Invest Med | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–41 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17716538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the [[Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire]], which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the [[CAGE questionnaire]]. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |title=Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire (SADD) |author=Raistrick, D. |coauthors=Dunbar, G.

The [[Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test]] (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the [[World Health Organization]], is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally.

===Genetic predisposition testing===
Psychiatric geneticists John I. Nurnberger, Jr., and Laura Jean Bierut suggest that alcoholism does not have a single cause—including genetic—but that genes do play an important role &quot;by affecting processes in the body and brain that [[Gene-environment interaction|interact with]] one another and with an individual's life experiences to produce protection or susceptibility&quot;. They also report that fewer than a dozen alcoholism-related genes have been identified, but that more likely await discovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nurnberger&quot;&gt;Nurnberger, Jr., John I., and Bierut, Laura Jean. [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;colID=1&amp;articleID=5C303E5F-E7F2-99DF-315ADC8A107AE976 &quot;Seeking the Connections: Alcoholism and our Genes.&quot;] ''[[Scientific American]]'', Apr 2007, Vol. 296, Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one genetic test exists for an [[allele]] that is correlated to alcoholism and opiate addiction.&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily News (William Sherman) [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2006/02/12/2006-02-12_test_targets_addiction_gene.html Test targets addiction gene] 11 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Human dopamine receptor genes have a detectable variation referred to as the DRD2 TaqI polymorphism. Those who possess the A1 allele (variation) of this polymorphism have a small but significant tendency towards addiction to opiates and endorphin-releasing drugs like alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Berggren U, Fahlke C, Aronsson E |title=The taqI DRD2 A1 allele is associated with alcohol-dependence although its effect size is small |journal=Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire) |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=479–85 |year=2006 |pmid=16751215 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agl043 |url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/41/5/479 |month= September|issn=0735-0414 |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this allele is slightly more common in alcoholics and opiate addicts, it is not by itself an adequate predictor of alcoholism, and some researchers argue that evidence for DRD2 is contradictory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nurnberger&quot; /&gt;

===DSM diagnosis===
The [[DSM-IV]] diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents one approach to the definition of alcoholism. In part this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared to one another. According to the DSM-IV, an alcohol dependence diagnosis is:&lt;ref name=DSMIV&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV | url = http://books.google.com/?id=W-BGAAAAMAAJ | date = 31 July 1994 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: tolerance; withdrawal; taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological [[sequela]]e.}}

===Urine and blood tests===
There are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol, one common test being that of [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Jones | first1 = AW. | title = Urine as a biological specimen for forensic analysis of alcohol and variability in the urine-to-blood relationship. | journal = Toxicol Rev | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–35 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16856767 | doi = 10.2165/00139709-200625010-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non-alcoholics; however, long-term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Das | first1 = SK. | last2 = Dhanya | first2 = L. | last3 = Vasudevan | first3 = DM. | title = Biomarkers of alcoholism: an updated review. | journal = Scand J Clin Lab Invest | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–92 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1080/00365510701532662 | pmid = 17852805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Macrocytosis]] (enlarged [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]])
* Elevated [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|GGT]]
* Moderate elevation of [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and an AST: ALT ratio of 2:1
* High [[carbohydrate deficient transferrin]] (CDT)

However, none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires.

==Prevention==
The [[World Health Organization]], the [[European Union]] and other regional bodies, [[national governments]] and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=alchwho2010&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |title=Alcohol |author=World Health Organisation |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apitwhoer&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |title=Alcohol policy in the WHO European Region: current status and the way forward |date=12 September 2005 |publisher=World Health Organisation |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, [[evidence based]] educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.&lt;ref name=acdacpovfa&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Crews | first1 = F. | last2 = He | first2 = J. | last3 = Hodge | first3 = C. | title = Adolescent cortical development: a critical period of vulnerability for addiction. | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–99 | month = Feb | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2006.12.001 | pmid = 17222895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments than, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support in order to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed in order to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, there are some who promote a harm-reduction approach as well.&lt;ref name=Gabbard/&gt;

===Detoxification===
{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}
[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]]. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow-up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse in order to reduce the risk of relapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blondell-2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Blondell | first1 = RD. | title = Ambulatory detoxification of patients with alcohol dependence. | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–502 | month = Feb | year = 2005 | pmid = 15712624 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group therapy and psychotherapy===
[[Image:Alcoholics Anonymous Regional Service Center by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A regional service center for [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].]]

Various forms of [[group therapy]] or [[psychotherapy]] can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan-Lopez-2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Morgan-Lopez | first1 = AA. | last2 = Fals-Stewart | first2 = W. | title = Analytic complexities associated with group therapy in substance abuse treatment research: problems, recommendations, and future directions. | journal = Exp Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 265–73 | month = May | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1037/1064-1297.14.2.265 | pmid = 16756430 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soyka-2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Soyka | first1 = M. | last2 = Helten | first2 = C. | last3 = Scharfenberg | first3 = CO. | title = [Psychotherapy of alcohol addiction—principles and new findings of therapy research] | journal = Wien Med Wochenschr | volume = 151 | issue = 15–17 | pages = 380–8; discussion 389 | month = | year = 2001 | doi = | pmid = 11603209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include [[LifeRing Secular Recovery]], [[SMART Recovery]], [[Women For Sobriety]], and [[SOS- Secular Organization for Sobriety]].

===Rationing and moderation===
Rationing and moderation programs such as [[Moderation Management]] and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 U.S. study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAWSON2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Recovery from DSM-IV alcohol dependence: United States, 2001–2002 |url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00964.x |year=2005 |last1=Dawson |first1=Deborah A. |last2=Grant |first2=Bridget F. |last3=Stinson |first3=Frederick S. |last4=Chou |first4=Patricia S. |last5=Huang |first5=Boji |last6=Ruan |first6=W.

===Medications===
A variety of medications may be prescribed as part of treatment for alcoholism.

'''Medications currently in use'''

* ''[[Antabuse]]'' ([[disulfiram]]) prevents the elimination of [[acetaldehyde]], a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself is the cause of many [[hangover]] symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine. A recent nine-year study found that incorporation of supervised disulfiram and the related compound [[Calcium carbimide|carbimide]] into a comprehensive treatment program resulted in an abstinence rate of over 50 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krampe-2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Krampe H, Stawicki S, Wagner T |title=Follow-up of 180 alcoholic patients for up to 7 years after outpatient treatment: impact of alcohol deterrents on outcome |journal=Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=86–95 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16433735 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2006.00013.x |url= |issn=0145-6008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Temposil]]'' ([[calcium carbimide]]) works in the same way as Antabuse; it has an advantage in that the occasional adverse effects of disulfiram, [[hepatotoxicity]] and drowsiness, do not occur with calcium carbimide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krampe-2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Ogborne | first1 = AC. | title = Identifying and treating patients with alcohol-related problems. | journal = CMAJ | volume = 162 | issue = 12 | pages = 1705–8 | month = June | year = 2000 | pmid = 10870503 | pmc = 1232509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Naltrexone]]'' is a [[competitive antagonist]] for opioid receptors, effectively blocking the effects of [[endorphin]]s and [[opiate]]s. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence when naltrexone is in the body there is a reduction in the pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2174/1874473710801030280| last1 = Soyka | first1 = M. | last2 = Rösner | first2 = S. | title = Opioid antagonists for pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence – a critical review. | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 280–91 | month = Nov | year = 2008 | pmid = 19630726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naltrexone is also used in an alcoholism treatment method called the [[Sinclair Method]], which treats patients through a combination of Naltrexone and continued drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 4882335 | y = 1989 | m = 11 | d = 21 | inventor = John D. Sinclair | title = Method for treating alcohol-drinking response}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Campral]]'' ([[acamprosate]]) stabilises the brain chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising the actions of [[glutamate]], a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the [[post-withdrawal]] phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Mason | first1 = BJ. | last2 = Heyser | first2 = CJ. | title = The neurobiology, clinical efficacy and safety of acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence. | journal = Expert Opin Drug Saf | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 177–88 | month = Jan | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1517/14740330903512943 | pmid = 20021295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review of medical studies demonstrated that acamprosate reduces the incidence of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Rösner S, Hackl-Herrwerth A, Leucht S, Lehert P, Vecchi S, Soyka M |title= Acamprosate for alcohol dependence |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=9 |pages= CD004332 |year=2010 |pmid= 20824837 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004332.pub2 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004332/frame.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of a large number (&gt;27,000) of alcohol dependence-related insurance claims suggested that healthcare utilization, such as  the number of inpatient detoxification days, alcoholism-related inpatient days, and alcoholism-related emergency department visits was significantly reduced in the patient population receiving alcoholism medications (naltrexone, naltrexone XR [an injectable sustained-release form of naltrexone], disulfiram [Antabuse], acomprosate) when compared to the patient population that did not take any medications.&lt;ref&gt;Mark TL, Montejano LB, Kranzler HR, Chalk M, Gastfriend DR. 2010.  Comparison of healthcare utilization among patients treated with alcoholism medications.  Am J Manag Care. Dec;16(12):879-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Experimental medications'''

* ''[[Topamax]]'' ([[topiramate]]), a derivative of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, has been found effective in helping alcoholics quit or cut back on the amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Olmsted CL, Kockler DR |title=Topiramate for alcohol dependence |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=1475–80 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18698008 |doi=10.1345/aph.1L157 |issn=1060-0280}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kenna | first1 = GA. | last2 = Lomastro | first2 = TL. | last3 = Schiesl | first3 = A. | last4 = Leggio | first4 = L. | last5 = Swift | first5 = RM. | title = Review of topiramate: an antiepileptic for the treatment of alcohol dependence | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–42 | month = May | year = 2009 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710902020135| pmid = 19630744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medications which may worsen outcome'''

* [[Benzodiazepines]], whilst useful in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs are commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=S.J.E. |editor1-last=Lindsay |editor2-first=Graham E. |editor2-last=Powell |title=The Handbook of Clinical Adult Psychology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=a6A9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA380 |edition=2nd |date=28 July 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07215-1 |page=402 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting more than a quarter of people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics.  Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gitlow |first1=Stuart |title=Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rbrSdWVerBUC |edition=2nd |date=1 October 2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7817-6998-3 |pages=52 and 103–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kushner MG, Abrams K, Borchardt C |title=The relationship between anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorders: a review of major perspectives and findings |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=149–71 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10721495 |doi= 10.1016/S0272-7358(99)00027-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272-7358(99)00027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual addictions===
Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic drug addictions. The most common dual addiction in alcohol dependence is a [[benzodiazepine dependence]], with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines increase cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Poulos CX, Zack M |title=Low-dose diazepam primes motivation for alcohol and alcohol-related semantic networks in problem drinkers |journal=Behav Pharmacol |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=503–12 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15472572 |doi= 10.1097/00008877-200411000-00006|url= |issn=0955-8810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] and other health consequences.

Dependence on other sedative hypnotics such as [[zolpidem]] and [[zopiclone]] as well as [[opiate]]s and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics.

Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics  such as [[barbiturate]]s, benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of [[psychosis]] or [[seizure]]s if not managed properly.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpdaa&quot;/&gt;

Within the medical and scientific communities, there is broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that &quot;drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Walter | first1 = H. | last2 = Gutierrez | first2 = K. | last3 = Ramskogler | first3 = K. | last4 = Hertling | first4 = I. | last5 = Dvorak | first5 = A. | last6 = Lesch | first6 = OM. | title = Gender-specific differences in alcoholism: implications for treatment. | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 253–8 | month = Nov | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1007/s00737-003-0014-8 | pmid = 14628177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dick DM, Bierut LJ |title=The genetics of alcohol dependence |journal=Current psychiatry reports |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=151–7 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16539893 |doi= 10.1007/s11920-006-0015-1|url= |issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enoch-2006&quot;/&gt;

==Prognosis==
A 2002 study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] surveyed a group of 4,422 adults meeting the criteria for [[alcohol dependence]] and found that after one year, some met the authors' criteria for low-risk drinking, even though only 25.5 percent of the group received any treatment, with the breakdown as follows: 25 percent were found to be still dependent, 27.3 percent were in partial remission (some symptoms persist), 11.8 percent asymptomatic drinkers (consumption increases chances of relapse) and 35.9 percent were fully recovered — made up of 17.7 percent low-risk drinkers plus 18.2 percent abstainers.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIAAA2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jan2005/niaaa-18.htm |title=2001–2002 Survey Finds That Many Recover From Alcoholism |author=The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism |coauthors=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH News |date=18 January 2005 |publisher=National Institutes of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, however, the results of a long term (60 year) follow-up of two groups of alcoholic men by George Vaillant at Harvard Medical School indicated that &quot;return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Vaillant GE | title= A 60-year follow-up of alcoholic men | journal=Addiction. | year=2003 | volume=98 |pages=1043–51 |pmid=12873238 | doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.2003.00422.x | month= August| issue=8 | issn=0965-2140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaillant also noted that &quot;return-to-controlled drinking, as reported in short-term studies, is often a mirage.&quot;

The most common cause of death in alcoholics is from cardiovascular complications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zuskin-2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Zuskin | first1 = E. | last2 = Jukić | first2 = V. | last3 = Lipozencić | first3 = J. | last4 = Matosić | first4 = A. | last5 = Mustajbegović | first5 = J. | last6 = Turcić | first6 = N. | last7 = Poplasen-Orlovac | first7 = D. | last8 = Bubas | first8 = M. | last9 = Prohić | first9 = A. | title = [Alcoholism—how it affects health and working capacity] | journal = Arh Hig Rada Toksikol | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–26 | month = Dec | year = 2006 | doi = | pmid = 17265681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high rate of suicide in chronic alcoholics, which increases the longer a person drinks.

==History==
Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognised as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed [[prohibition]] of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 the cost of alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the USA economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.&lt;ref name=soa2008&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Potter |first1= James V. |volume=2 |title=Substances of Abuse |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WU73eJAIDI4C&amp;pg=PA1 |date=14 January 2008 |publisher=AFS Publishing Co |isbn=978-1-930327-46-7 |pages=1–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs, and secondary treatment costs. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s, violence, and assaults. Beyond money, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=McCully |first1=Chris |title=Goodbye Mr. Wonderful.

Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=World Health Organization | url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_status_report_2004_overview.pdf | format=PDF | title=Global Status Report on Alcohol 2004 | accessdate=3 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=World Health Organization Global Alcohol Database | url=http://www.who.int/globalatlas/dataQuery/objectInterface.asp?objID=359&amp;boCat=&amp;p=null&amp;lvl=0&amp;catID=520700000000&amp;level=2 | accessdate=3 January 2007 | title=Economic cost of alcohol consumption }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study quantified the cost to the UK of ''all'' forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion.&lt;ref name=cosu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3122244.stm | title=Q&amp;A: The costs of alcohol | date=19 September 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stereotype]]s of alcoholics are often found in [[fiction]] and [[popular culture]]. The '[[town drunk]]' is a [[stock character]] in Western popular culture. Stereotypes of drunkenness may be based on [[racism]] or [[xenophobia]], as in the depiction of the [[Irish people|Irish]] as heavy drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.finfacts.ie/Private/bestprice/alcoholdrinkconsumptionpriceseurope.htm | title=World/Global Alcohol/Drink Consumption |year=2009 |publisher=Finfacts Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by social psychologists Stivers and Greeley attempt to document the perceived prevalence of high alcohol consumption amongst the Irish in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Stivers | first1 = Richard | title = Hair of the dog: Irish drinking and its American stereotype |date = May 2000| publisher = Continuum | location = New York |url=http://books.google.com/?id=MH3aAAAAMAAJ | isbn = 978-0-8264-1218-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near as high as it is in other countries like the United States. It also inversely seen, with countries that have very low gross domestic product showing high alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiao-Chicy|first=Chen|coauthors=Shih-Jiun Yin|title=Alcohol abuse and related factors in Asia|journal=International Review of Psychiatry|year=2008|volume=20|issue=5|pages=425–433|doi=10.1080/09540260802344075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada, they reported alcohol was even an integral part of their meal, and is the only time solo drinking should occur.  They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start.&lt;ref&gt;Wooksoo, K. (2009). Drinking Culture of Elderly Korean Immigrants in Canada: A Focus Group Study. Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology, 24(4), 339-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caucasians have a much lower abstinence rate (11.8%)and much higher tolerance to symptoms (3.4±2.45 drinks) of alcohol than Chinese (33.4% and 2.2±1.78 drinks respectively).  Also, the more acculturation there is between cultures, the more influenced the culture is to adopt Cuacasians drinking practices.&lt;ref&gt;Li, H. Z., &amp; Rosenblood, L. (1994). Exploring factors influencing alcohol consumption patterns among Chinese and Caucasians. Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 55(4), 427. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason alcoholism is so rampant in Native American culture is that many attempts to solve the addiction don’t work.  Tribe leaders have suggested the use of native cultural beliefs.  Peyote, a psychoactive agent, has even shown promise in treating alcoholism.  This is interesting because alcohol replaced peyote as Native American’s psychoactive agent in rituals when peyote was outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;French, L. (2008). Psychoactive agents and Native American spirituality: Past and present. Contemporary Justice Review, 11(2), 155-163.

'''Abstraction''' is a process by which [[hierarchy|higher]] concepts are derived from the usage and [[classification]] of [[literal]] (&quot;real&quot; or &quot;concrete&quot;) concepts, [[first principle]]s, or  other methods.
An &quot;abstraction&quot; (noun) is a concept that acts as super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a ''[[group]], [[field]],'' or ''[[category]]''.

Abstractions may be formed by reducing the [[information]] content of a [[concept]] or an observable [[phenomenon]], typically to retain only information which is relevant for a particular purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a [[ball]] retains only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, eliminating the characteristics of that particular ball.

==Origins==
{{See also|Modern human behaviour}}
The first [[symbol]]s of abstract thinking in humans can be traced to fossils dating between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/january/ochre.htm Abstract Engravings Show Modern Behavior Emerged Earlier Than Previously Thought]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000629D0-B23F-1CCE-B4A8809EC588EEDF Ancient Engravings Push Back Origin of Abstract Thought]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[language]] itself, whether spoken or written, involves abstract thinking.

In [[philosophy|philosophical terminology]], ''abstraction'' is the [[thinking|thought process]] wherein [[idea]]s&lt;ref&gt;But an idea can be [[symbol]]ized. &quot;A symbol is any device whereby we are enabled to make an abstraction.&quot; -- p.xi and chapter 20 of [[Suzanne K. Langer]] (1953), ''Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from '''Philosophy in a New Key''''': New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 431 pages, index.&lt;/ref&gt; are distanced from [[object (philosophy)|object]]s.

Abstraction uses a [[strategy]] of simplification, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective [[communication]] about things in the abstract requires an [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.

[[File:JerryFelix.JPG|right|thumb|125px|Cat on Mat ''(picture 1)'']]
For example, many different things can be [[red]]. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in ''picture 1'', to the right). The property of ''[[red]]ness'' and the [[Relation of Ideas|relation]] ''[[sitting|sitting-on]]'' are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram ''graph 1'' identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their five labels), whereas the ''picture 1'' shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.

''Graph 1'' details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example the arrow between the ''agent'' and ''CAT:Elsie'' depicts an example of an ''[[is-a]]'' relationship, as does the arrow between the ''location'' and the ''MAT''. The arrows between the [[gerund]] ''SITTING'' and the [[noun]]s ''agent'' and ''location'' express the [[diagram]]'s basic relationship; ''&quot;agent is SITTING on location&quot;''; ''Elsie'' is an instance of ''CAT''.

[[File:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|250px|[[Conceptual graph]] for A Cat sitting on the Mat ''(graph 1)'']]
Although the description ''sitting-on'' (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:(1) a publication
::(2) a newspaper
:::(3) ''The San Francisco Chronicle''
::::(4) the May 18 edition of the ''Chronicle''
:::::(5) my copy of the May 18 edition of the ''Chronicle''
::::::(6) my copy of the May 18 edition of the ''Chronicle'' as it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no [[loss of generality]]. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about some thing, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.

==Referents==
Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous [[referent]]s; for example, &quot;[[happiness]]&quot; (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or [[being|states of being]] which make them happy. Likewise, &quot;[[architecture]]&quot; refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and [[innovation]] which aim at elegant solutions to [[construction]] problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an [[emotion|emotional response]] in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.&lt;!--See discussion pages 3 to 12 in Eugene Raskin, ''Architecturally Speaking, 2nd edition'', a Delta book, Dell (1966), trade paperback, 129 pages--&gt;

===Instantiation===
Things that do not exist at any particular place and time are often considered abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times. Those abstract things are then said to be ''multiply instantiated'', in the sense of ''picture 1'', ''picture 2'', etc., shown above.

It is not sufficient, however, to define ''abstract'' ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define ''abstraction'' as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;telephone&quot; abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept &quot;cat&quot; or the concept &quot;telephone&quot;. Although the concepts &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;telephone&quot; are ''abstractions'', they are not ''abstract'' in the sense of the objects in ''graph 1'' above.

&lt;!--What is the following paragraph trying to clarify?--&gt;
We might look at other graphs, in a progression from ''cat'' to ''mammal'' to ''animal'', and see that ''animal'' is more abstract than ''mammal''; but on the other hand ''mammal'' is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to ''[[marsupial]]'' or ''[[monotreme]]''.

===Physicality===
A physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered ''concrete'' (not abstract) if it is a ''particular individual'' that occupies a particular place and time.

Abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in [[reality]] or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color [[red]]. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like ''God'', ''the number three'', and ''goodness'' are real, abstract, or both.

An approach to resolving such difficulty is to use ''[[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s'' as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g. ''good''). Questions about the properties of things are then [[proposition]]s about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the ''graph 1'' above, the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates. Different levels of abstraction might be denoted by a progression of arrows joining boxes or ellipses in multiple rows, where the arrows point from one row to another, in a series of other graphs, say graph 2, etc.

==Abstraction used in philosophy==
Abstraction in [[philosophy]] is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in [[concept]]-formation of recognizing some set of common features in [[individual]]s, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding [[empiricism]] and the [[problem of universals]]. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under [[predicate abstraction]]. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is [[thought space]].

===Ontological status===
The way that physical objects, like rocks and trees, have [[category of being|being]] differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being, for example the way the [[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], [[particular]], [[individual]]s pictured in ''picture 1'' exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in ''graph 1'' exist. That difference accounts for the [[ontological]] usefulness of the word &quot;abstract&quot;. The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.

Perhaps confusingly, some [[philosophy|philosophies]] refer to ''[[trope (philosophy)|tropes]]'' (instances of properties) as ''[[abstract particular]]s''. E.g., the particular [[red]]ness of a particular [[apple]] is an ''abstract particular''. Akin to [[qualia]] and [[sumbebekos]].

===In linguistics===
{{Main|Abstraction (linguistics)}}
[[Reification]], also called ''hypostatization'', might be considered a [[formal fallacy]] whenever an abstract concept, such as &quot;society&quot; or &quot;technology&quot; is treated as if it were a concrete object. In [[linguistics]] this is called ''[[metonymy]]'', in which abstract concepts are referred to using the same sorts of [[noun]]s that signify concrete objects.  Metonymy is an aspect of the English language and of other languages. It can blur the distinction between abstract and concrete things:
:'''1805''': [[Horatio Nelson]] (''[[Battle of Trafalgar]]'') - &quot;[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]&quot;

===Compression===
&lt;!--Is this section common knowledge or original research?--&gt;
An abstraction can be seen as a process of mapping multiple different pieces of [[constituent]] data to a single piece of abstract data based on similarities in the constituent data, for example many different physical cats map to the abstraction &quot;CAT&quot;. This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]&quot;. In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is itself an object).
:For example, ''picture 1'' above illustrates the concrete relationship &quot;Cat sits on Mat&quot;.
Chains of abstractions can therefore be constructed moving from neural impulses arising from sensory [[perception]] to basic abstractions such as color or [[shape]] to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat to [[semantic]] abstractions such as the &quot;idea&quot; of a CAT to classes of objects such as &quot;mammals&quot; and even categories such as &quot;object&quot; as opposed to &quot;action&quot;.
:For example, ''graph 1'' above expresses the abstraction &quot;agent sits on location&quot;.

This conceptual scheme entails no specific [[hierarchical]] [[taxonomy]] (such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals), only a progressive exclusion of detail.

==The neurology of abstraction==
A recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts elicit greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts when concrete concepts elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Jing Wang, Julie A. Conder, David N. Blitzer, and Svetlana V. Shinkareva &quot;Neural Representation of Abstract and Concrete Concepts: A Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Studies&quot; ''Human Brain Mapping'' (2010). http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.20950&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research into the [[human brain]] suggests that the left and right hemispheres differ in their handling of abstraction. For example, one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Lewis &quot;Cortical Networks Related to Human Use of Tools&quot; '''12''' (3): 211-231 ''The Neuroscientist'' (June 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstraction in art==
Typically, ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] for [[abstract art]] in general. Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. ISBN 0-300-10826-5&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freed from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized the exploration of internal numeric relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstraction in psychology==
[[Carl Jung]]'s definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, opposing complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these opposing functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is [[concretism (psychology)|concretism]]. ''Abstraction'' is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of ''[[Psychological Types]]''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is an abstract ''thinking'', just as there is abstract ''feeling'', ''sensation'' and ''intuition''. Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous ''sensation'' and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic ''intuition''. (Jung, [1921] (1971):par. 678).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Abstraction in computer science==
{{Main|Abstraction (computer science)}}
[[Computer scientists]] use abstraction  and [[communication|communicate]] their solutions with the computer in some particular [[computer language]].  Abstraction allows program designers to separate categories and concepts from instances of implementation, so that they do not depend on software or hardware.

==Abstraction in mathematics==
{{Main|Abstraction (mathematics)}}
Abstraction in [[mathematics]] is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.

The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:
* it reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics
* known results in one area can suggest conjectures in a related area
* techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in a related area.

The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and require a degree of [[mathematical maturity]] and experience before they can be assimilated.

{{Basic notions in group theory}}
In [[abstract algebra]], an '''abelian group''', also called a '''commutative group''', is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which the result of applying the group [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] to two group elements does not depend on their order (the axiom of [[commutativity]]). Abelian groups [[generalization|generalize]] the [[arithmetic]] of addition of [[integer]]s. They are named after [[Niels Henrik Abel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate [[Algebra#Abstract algebra|abstract algebra]], with many other basic objects, such as a [[module (mathematics)|module]] and a [[vector space]], being its refinements. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their [[nonabelian group|non-abelian]] counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research.

== Definition ==
An abelian group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], ''A'', together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] &quot;•&quot; that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] ''a'' and ''b'' to form another element denoted {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}}. The symbol &quot;•&quot; is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, {{nowrap|(''A'', •)}}, must satisfy five requirements known as the ''abelian group axioms'':

;Closure: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'', the result of the operation ''a'' • ''b'' is also in ''A''.
;Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''A'', the equation (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'') holds.
;Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''A'', such that for all elements ''a'' in ''A'', the equation {{nowrap begin}}''e'' • ''a'' = ''a'' • ''e'' = ''a''{{nowrap end}} holds.
;Inverse element: For each ''a'' in ''A'', there exists an element ''b'' in ''A'' such that ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e'', where ''e'' is the identity element.
;Commutativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'', ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''.

More compactly, an abelian group is a [[commutative]] [[group (mathematics)|group]]. A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a &quot;non-abelian group&quot; or &quot;non-commutative group&quot;.

== Facts ==
=== Notation ===
There are two main notational conventions for abelian groups — additive and multiplicative.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|-
! Convention
! Operation
! Identity
! Powers
! Inverse
|-
! Addition
| ''x'' + ''y'' || 0 || ''nx'' || −''x''
|-
! Multiplication
| ''x'' * ''y'' or ''xy'' || ''e'' or 1
| ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
| ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Generally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered.

=== Multiplication table ===
To verify that a [[finite group]] is abelian, a table (matrix) - known as a [[Cayley table]] - can be constructed in a similar fashion to a [[multiplication table]]. If the group is ''G'' = {''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e'', ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} under the operation ⋅, the (''i'', ''j'')'th entry of this table contains the product ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. The group is abelian [[if and only if]] this table is symmetric about the main diagonal (i.e. if the matrix is a [[symmetric matrix]]).

This is true since if the group is abelian, then ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. This implies that the (''i'', ''j'')'th entry of the table equals the (''j'', ''i'')'th entry - i.e. the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.

== Examples ==
* For the [[integer]]s and the operation [[addition]] &quot;+&quot;, denoted ('''Z''',+), the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the [[additive identity]], every integer ''n'' has an [[additive inverse]], −''n'', and the addition operation is commutative since &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;''m'' + ''n'' = ''n'' + ''m''&lt;/span&gt; for any two integers ''m'' and ''n''.

* Every [[cyclic group]] ''G'' is abelian, because if ''x'', ''y'' are in ''G'', then ''xy'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m'' + ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''yx''. Thus the [[integer]]s, '''Z''', form an abelian group under addition, as do the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.

* Every [[Ring theory|ring]] is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a [[commutative ring]] the invertible elements, or [[unit (ring theory)|units]], form an abelian [[multiplicative group]]. In particular, the [[real number]]s are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication.

* Every [[subgroup]] of an abelian group is [[normal subgroup|normal]], so each subgroup gives rise to a [[quotient group]]. Subgroups, quotients, and [[Direct sum of groups|direct sums]] of abelian groups are again abelian.

In general, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication - one example is the group of 2x2 [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].

== Historical remarks ==
&lt;!-- This particular statement seems suspect, but the direction is right --&gt;
Abelian groups were named for [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Niels Henrik Abel]] by [[Camille Jordan]] because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of an equation implies its roots are [[solvability by radicals|solvable by radicals]]. See Section 6.5 of Cox (2004) for more information on the historical background.

== Properties ==
If ''n'' is a [[natural number]] and ''x'' is an element of an abelian group ''G'' written additively, then ''nx'' can be defined as ''x'' + ''x'' + ... + ''x'' (''n'' summands) and (−''n'')''x'' = −(''nx''). In this way, ''G'' becomes a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] '''Z''' of integers. In fact, the modules over '''Z''' can be identified with the abelian groups.

Theorems about abelian groups (i.e. [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over the [[principal ideal domain]] '''Z''') can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s which is a specialization of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]]. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form '''Z'''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z''' for ''p'' prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of '''Z'''.

If ''f'', ''g'' : ''G'' &amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp; ''H'' are two [[group homomorphism]]s between abelian groups, then their sum ''f'' + ''g'', defined by (''f'' + ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x''), is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if ''H'' is a non-abelian group.) The set Hom(''G'', ''H'') of all group homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''H'' thus turns into an abelian group in its own right.

Somewhat akin to the [[dimension]] of [[vector space]]s, every abelian group has a ''[[rank of an abelian group|rank]]''. It is defined as the [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of the largest set of [[linearly independent]] elements of the group. The integers and the [[rational number]]s have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals.

== Finite abelian groups ==
Cyclic groups of [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''', were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The [[automorphism group]] of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of [[Georg Frobenius]] and [[Ludwig Stickelberger]] and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of [[linear algebra]].

=== Classification ===
The '''fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups''' states that every finite abelian group ''G'' can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of [[prime number|prime]]-power order. This is a special case of the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] when ''G'' has zero [[rank of an abelian group|rank]].

The cyclic group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; of order ''mn'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]]. It follows that any finite abelian group ''G'' is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{k_u}&lt;/math&gt;

in either of the following canonical ways:
* the numbers ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; are powers of primes
* ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[divisor|divides]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which divides ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on up to ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{15}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{15}\cong\{0, 5, 10\}\oplus\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12\}&lt;/math&gt;. The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].

For another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_8&lt;/math&gt; (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_4\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

See also [[list of small groups]] for finite abelian groups of order 16 or less.

=== Automorphisms ===
One can apply the fundamental theorem to count (and sometimes determine) the [[Group isomorphism#Automorphisms|automorphisms]] of a given finite abelian group ''G''. To do this, one uses the fact (which will not be proved here) that if ''G'' splits as a direct sum ''H'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''K'' of subgroups of [[coprime]] order, then Aut(''H'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''K'') &lt;math&gt;\cong&lt;/math&gt; Aut(''H'') &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; Aut(''K'').

Given this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of ''G'' it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the [[Sylow theorems|Sylow]] ''p''-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of ''p''). Fix a prime ''p'' and suppose the exponents ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the cyclic factors of the Sylow ''p''-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:

:&lt;math&gt;e_1\leq e_2 \leq\cdots\leq e_n&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''n'' &amp;gt; 0. One needs to find the automorphisms of

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e_1}} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{p^{e_n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

One special case is when ''n'' = 1, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P''. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite [[cyclic group]] can be used. Another special case is when ''n'' is arbitrary but ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''. Here, one is considering ''P'' to be of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p,&lt;/math&gt;

so elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension ''n'' over the finite field of ''p'' elements &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(P)\cong\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{F}_p),&lt;/math&gt;

where GL is the appropriate [[general linear group]]. This is easily shown to have order

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathrm{Aut}(P)|=(p^n-1)\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

In the most general case, where the ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n'' are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines

:&lt;math&gt;d_k=\mathrm{max}\{r|e_r = e_k^{\,}\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;c_k=\mathrm{min}\{r|e_r=e_k^{\,}\}&lt;/math&gt;

then one has in particular ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''k'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''k'', and

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathrm{Aut}(P)| = \left(\prod_{k=1}^n{p^{d_k} - p^{k-1}}\right)\left(\prod_{j=1}^n{(p^{e_j})^{n-d_j}}\right)\left(\prod_{i=1}^n{(p^{e_i-1})^{n-c_i+1}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

One can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see [Hillar,Rhea]).

== Infinite abelian groups ==

Тhe simplest infinite abelian group is the [[infinite cyclic group]] '''Z'''. Any [[finitely generated abelian group]] ''A'' is isomorphic to the direct sum of ''r'' copies of '''Z''' and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many [[cyclic group]]s of primary orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number ''r'', called the [[Rank of an abelian group|'''rank''']] of ''A'', and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.

By contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. [[Divisible group]]s, i.e. abelian groups ''A'' in which the equation ''nx'' = ''a'' admits a solution ''x'' ∈ ''A'' for any natural number ''n'' and element ''a'' of ''A'', constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to '''Q''' and [[Prüfer group]]s '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; for various prime numbers ''p'', and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined.&lt;ref&gt;For example, '''Q'''/'''Z''' &amp;cong; &amp;sum;&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if a divisible group ''A'' is a subgroup of an abelian group ''G'' then ''A'' admits a direct complement: a subgroup ''C'' of ''G'' such that ''G'' = ''A'' ⊕ ''C''. Thus divisible groups are [[injective module]]s in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible ([[Baer's criterion]]). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called '''reduced'''. 

Two important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are ''torsion groups'' and ''torsion-free groups'', examplified by the groups '''Q'''/'''Z''' (periodic) and '''Q''' (torsion-free).

=== Torsion groups ===

An abelian group is called '''[[periodic group|periodic]]''' or '''[[torsion (algebra)|torsion]]''' if every element has finite [[order (group theory)|order]]. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second [[Prüfer theorems]] state that if ''A'' is a periodic group and either it has '''bounded exponent''', i.e. ''nA'' = 0 for some natural number ''n'', or if ''A'' is countable and the [[height (abelian group)|''p''-heights]] of the elements of ''A'' are finite for each ''p'', then ''A'' is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Countability assumption in the second Prüfer theorem cannot be removed: the torsion subgroup of the [[direct product]] of the cyclic groups '''Z'''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z''' for all natural ''m'' is not a direct sum of cyclic groups.&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to '''Z'''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z''' in such a decomposition is an invariant of ''A''. These theorems were later subsumed in the '''Kulikov criterion'''. In a different direction, [[Helmut Ulm]] found an extension of the second Prüfer theorem to countable abelian ''p''-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their [[Ulm invariant]]s.

=== Torsion-free and mixed groups ===

An abelian group is called '''torsion-free''' if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of torsion-free abelian groups have been extensively studied:

* [[Free abelian group]]s, i.e. arbitrary direct sums of '''Z'''
* [[Cotorsion group|Cotorsion]] and [[algebraically compact module|algebraically compact]] torsion-free groups such as the [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]
* [[Slender group]]s

An abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called '''mixed'''. If ''A'' is an abelian group and ''T''(''A'') is its torsion subgroup then the factor group ''A''/''T''(''A'') is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of ''A'', so the torsion-free factor cannot be realized as a subgroup of ''A'' and ''A'' is ''not'' isomorphic to ''T''(''A'') ⊕ ''A''/''T''(''A''). Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups.

=== Invariants and classification ===

One of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group ''A'' is its [[rank of an abelian group|rank]]: the cardinality of the maximal [[linearly independent]] subset of ''A''. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1]] are necessarily subgroups of '''Q''' and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank ''r'' is a subgroup of '''Q'''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, the group of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite '''Z'''-rank and the groups '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with different ''n'' are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups. 

The classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are [[pure subgroup|pure]] and [[basic subgroup|basic]] subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by [[Irving Kaplansky]], László Fuchs, [[Phillip Griffiths]], and David Arnold, as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in Lecture Notes in Mathematics for more recent results.

=== Additive groups of rings ===

The additive group of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:

* [[Tensor product]]
* Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups
* Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions

== Relation to other mathematical topics ==
Many large abelian groups possess a natural [[topology]], which turns them into [[topological group]]s.

The collection of all abelian groups, together with the [[homomorphism]]s between them, forms the [[category of abelian groups|category]] '''Ab''', the prototype of an [[abelian category]].

Nearly all well-known [[algebraic structure]]s other than [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]], are [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]]. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student Szmielew (1955) proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research:
*Amongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the [[torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1|rank 1]] case are well understood;
*There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups;
*While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the case of countable mixed groups is much less mature.
*Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable.
*Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in computational group theory.

Moreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the [[set theory]] commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the [[Whitehead problem]]: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also [[free abelian group]]s? In the 1970s, [[Saharon Shelah]] proved that the Whitehead problem is:
* [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|Undecidable in ZFC]], the conventional [[axiomatic set theory]] from which nearly all of present day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC;
* Undecidable even if [[ZFC]] is augmented by taking the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] as an axiom;
* Decidable if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of [[Constructible universe|constructibility]] (see [[statements true in L]]).

== A note on the typography ==
Among mathematical [[adjective]]s derived from the [[proper name]] of a [[mathematician]], the word &quot;abelian&quot; is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase '''a''', rather than an uppercase '''A''', indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_04_04.html Abel Prize Awarded: The Mathematicians' Nobel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty''' ('''ABM Treaty''' or '''ABMT''') was a treaty between the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Soviet Union]] on the limitation of the [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems used in defending areas against missile-delivered [[nuclear weapon]]s. 

Signed in 1972   , it was in force for the next 30 years until the US unilaterally withdrew from it in June 2002.

==Background==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2011}}
Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing a series of missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming [[ICBM]] warheads.  During this period the US considered the defense of the US as a part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange.  As part of this defense, [[Canada]] and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called North American Aerospace Defense Command [[NORAD]]).

By the early 1960s, US research on the [[Project Nike|Nike Zeus]] missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of a &quot;real&quot; ABM system. Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as the [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed '''Sentinel'''. However, due to political debate, '''Sentinel''' never expanded beyond defense of missile-bases.  

An intense debate broke out in public over the merits of such a system. A number of serious concerns about the technical abilities of the system came to light, many of which reached popular magazines such as ''[[Scientific American]]''. This was based on lack of intelligence information and reflected the American nuclear warfare theory and military doctrines. The Soviet doctrine called for development of their own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US. This was achieved with the operational deployment of the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system|A-35 ABM system]] and its successors, which remain operational to this day. 

As this debate continued, a new development in ICBM technology essentially rendered the points moot. This was the deployment of the Multiple Independently targetable Reentry Vehicle ([[MIRV]]) system, allowing a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time. This way, any ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer numbers of warheads. Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would be economically infeasible—the defenders required one rocket per incoming warhead, whereas the attackers could place 10 warheads on a single missile at a reasonable cost. To further protect against ABM systems, the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with electronic countermeasures and heavy decoys. [[R-36 (missile)|R-36M]] heavy missiles were carrying as many as 40 of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decoys&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,2763,777379,00.html|title=Moscow extends life of 144 cold war ballistic missiles| accessdate = 2006-10-24|work=The Guardian | location=London | date=August 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decoys would appear as warheads to ABM, effectively requiring engagement of 50 times more targets than before and rendering defense even less effective.

At about the same time, the USSR reached strategic parity with the US in terms of ICBM forces. A nuclear war would no longer be a favorable exchange for the US, but both countries would be devastated. This led in the West to the concept of [[mutually assured destruction]], '''MAD''', in which any changes to the strategic balance had to be carefully weighed. To the US, ABMs now seemed far too risky—it was better to have no defense than one that might trigger a war.

In the East however, the concept of MAD was almost entirely unknown to the public, studied only by those in the Soviet military and Government who analyzed Western military behavior. Soviet military theory fully involved the mass use of nuclear devices, in combination with massive conventional forces.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==ABM Treaty==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2011}}
As relations between the US and USSR warmed in the later years of the 1960s, the US first proposed an ABM treaty in 1967. This proposal was rejected. Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the [[SALT I|Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] began in November 1969 (SALT I). By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems. Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos (Art. III).   

The treaty was signed in Moscow on May 26, 1972 by the [[President of the United States]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; and ratified by the US Senate on August 3, 1972.

The 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site.  The sites were [[Moscow]] for the USSR and [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]], [[North Dakota]], since its [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]] facility was already under construction, for the US.

It was seen by many in the West as a key piece in nuclear arms control, being an implicit recognition of the need to ''protect'' the nuclear balance by ensuring neither side could hope to reduce the effects of retaliation to acceptable levels.

In the East, however, it was seen as a way to avoid having to maintain an anti-missile technology race at the same time as maintaining a missile race.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

For many years the ABM Treaty was, in the West, considered one of the landmarks in arms limitations. It was perceived as requiring two enemies to agree not to deploy a potentially useful weapon, deliberately to maintain the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] and as such, was also taken as confirmation of the Soviet adherence to the MAD doctrine.

===Missiles limited by the treaty===
The Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against &quot;strategic ballistic missiles&quot;, without attempting to define &quot;strategic&quot;. It was understood that both ICBMs and [[SLBM]]s are obviously &quot;strategic&quot;.&lt;ref name=Daalder&gt;{{cite journal|title=A tactical defence initiative for the Western Europe?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=May 1987|volume=43|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pgYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;ots=E2ow_Anysi&amp;dq=ICBM%20SDI%20ABM%20treaty%20%22strategic%20ballistic%20missiles%22%20or%20their%20elements%20in%20flight%20trajectory&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=ICBM%20SDI%20ABM%20treaty%20%22strategic%20ballistic%20missiles%22%20or%20their%20elements%20in%20flight%20trajectory&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 February 2011|author=Ivo H. Daalder|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries did not intended to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs. The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.&lt;ref name=Daalder /&gt;

==After the SDI announcement==
The treaty was undisturbed until [[Ronald Reagan]] announced his [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) on March 23, 1983. On the one hand, Reagan stated that SDI was &quot;consistent with... the ABM Treaty&quot;, but on the other hand, he viewed it as a defensive system that would help reduce the possibility that [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD) would become reality; he even suggested that the Soviets would be given access to the SDI technology. Nevertheless, SDI was against the spirit—if not the letter—of the ABM Treaty, which sought to pursue the principle of MAD.

The project was a blow to [[Yuri Andropov]]'s so-called &quot;peace offensive&quot;. Andropov said that &quot;It is time they [Washington] stopped... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pravda]], March 27, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result. SDI research was cut back following the end of Reagan's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that &quot;missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability.&quot;  This was reaffirmed in 1997.

Regardless of the opposition, Reagan gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system. The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible. ''The Nuclear Predicament'' explains that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI. A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a “ragged” Soviet retaliatory response. Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy.  The Soviets could not afford to ignore Reagan’s new endeavor, therefore they had to enter negotiations with the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Beckman et al., The Nuclear Predicament: Nuclear Weapons In The Cold War And Beyond, 2nd ed. (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc, 1992), 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US withdrawal==
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 the status of the treaty became unclear, debated by members of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] and professors of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesl.edu/intljournal/vol9/mccarty.pdf Succession of the ABM Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clw.org/pub/clw/coalition/laws050300.htm State Succession and the Legal Status of the ABM Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://missilethreat.com/reports/abm_memorandum.html Miron-Feith Memorandum]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a [[memorandum of understanding]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/acq/acic/treaties/abm/ad_mou.htm ABM Treaty: Memorandum of Understanding&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; between the US and four of the former USSR states was signed and subject to ratification by each signatory, but it was not presented to the US Senate for [[advice and consent]] by [[Bill Clinton]].

On December 13, 2001, [[George W. Bush]] gave [[Russia]] notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact—the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty. This led to the eventual creation of the American [[Missile Defense Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011213-2.html &quot;Announcement of Withdrawal from the ABM Treaty&quot;, White House press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited [[National Missile Defense]] to protect the United States from [[nuclear blackmail]] by a [[rogue state]]. The withdrawal had many critics as well as supporters. John Rhinelander, a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a &quot;fatal blow&quot; to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and would lead to a &quot;world without effective legal constraints on [[nuclear proliferation]].&quot; The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear first strike.

Reaction to the withdrawal by both the Russian Federation and the [[People's Republic of China]] was much milder than many had predicted{{Dubious|Mild reaction|date=August 2010}}, following months of discussion with both Russia and China aimed at convincing both that development of a National Missile Defense was not directed at them. In the case of Russia, the United States stated that it intended to discuss a bilateral reduction in the numbers of nuclear warheads, which would allow Russia to reduce its spending on missiles without decrease of comparative strength. Discussions led to the signing of the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] in Moscow on May 24, 2002. This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.

'''Austria-Hungary''' (also known as the '''Austro-Hungarian Empire''', '''Austro-Hungarian monarchy''' or '''[[Kaiserlich und königlich|k.u.k.]] Monarchy''') was a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[personal union|monarchic union]] between the crowns of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in [[Central Europe]]. The union was a result of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], under which the [[House of Habsburg]] agreed to share power with the separate Hungarian government, dividing the territory of the former Austrian Empire between them. The Austrian and the Hungarian lands became independent entities enjoying equal status.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Encarta: The height of the dual monarchy&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dual monarchy]] had existed for 51 years when it dissolved on 31 October 1918 before a military defeat on the [[Italian front]] of the [[World War I|First World War]].

Today, the territory it covered has a population of about 69 million.

{{Main|Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867}}

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], which inaugurated the empire's dual structure in place of the former unitary [[Austrian Empire]] (1804–67), originated at a time when Austria had declined in strength and in power—both in the [[Italian Peninsula]] (as a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War]] of 1859) and among the states of the [[German Confederation]] (where it had been replaced by [[Prussia]] as the dominant German power following the [[Austro-Prussian War]], also named the German War, of 1866). Other factors in the constitutional changes were continued Hungarian dissatisfaction with rule from Vienna and increasing national consciousness on the part of other nationalities of the Austrian Empire. Hungarian dissatisfaction arose partly from Austria's suppression, with [[Russian Empire|Russian]] support, of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Hungarian liberal revolution]] of 1848–1849. However, dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary, and had many other causes.

By the late 1850s, however, a large number of Hungarians who had supported the 1848-49 revolution were willing to accept the Habsburg monarchy. They took the line that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence, under the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] foreign affairs and defense were &quot;common&quot; to both Austria and Hungary.

After the Austrian defeat at Königgrätz, reconciliation with Hungary was needed to regain status of a great power, and the new foreign minister [[Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust]] wanted to successfully conclude the stalemated negotiations with the Hungarians. To shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nobility to ensure their support. In particular, Hungarian leaders demanded and received the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary, and the re-establishment of a separate parliament at [[Budapest]] with powers to enact laws for the lands of the [[Crown of St. Stephen|Hungarian crown]].

From 1867 onwards, the abbreviations heading the names of official institutions in Austria-Hungary reflected their responsibility:
*K. u. k. (&quot;kaiserlich und königlich&quot; or Imperial &amp; Royal) was the label for institutions common to both parts of the Monarchy, e.g. the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine (War Fleet) and, during the war, the k.u.k. Armee (Army). There were only three k.u.k. ministries:
**The Imperial &amp; Royal Ministry of the Exterior and the Imperial House
**The Imperial &amp; Royal War Ministry
**The Imperial &amp; Royal Ministry of Finance

The last of these was only responsible for financing the Imperial &amp; Royal household, the diplomatic service, the common army and the common war fleet. All other state functions were to be handled separately by each of the two states. From 1867 onwards, common expenditure was allocated 70% to Austria and 30% to Hungary. This split had to be negotiated every 10 years, and by 1907, the Hungarian share had risen to 36.4%.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Kronenbitter: &quot;Krieg im Frieden&quot;. Die Führung der k.u.k. Armee und die Großmachtpolitik Österreich-Ungarns 1906–1914. Verlag Oldenbourg, Munich 2003, ISBN 3-486-56700-4, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations in 1917 ended with the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy.

The common army changed its label from k.k. to k.u.k. only in 1889, at the request of the Hungarian government.

*K. k. (''kaiserlich-königlich'') or Imperial-Royal was the label for institutions of [[Cisleithania]] (Austria); &quot;royal&quot; in this label referred to the crown of Bohemia.
*K. u. (''königlich-ungarisch'') or M. k. (''Magyar királyi'') (&quot;Hungarian Royal&quot;) referred to [[Transleithania]], the lands of the Hungarian crown.

==Politics and government==
===Government===
Three distinct elements ruled the Austro-Hungarian Empire:

#common foreign, military and joint financial policy under the monarch
#the &quot;Austrian&quot; or Cisleithanian government
#the Hungarian government

Hungary and Austria maintained separate [[parliament]]s, each with its own [[prime minister]]. Linking/co-ordinating the two fell to a government under a monarch, wielding power absolute in theory but limited in practice. The monarch’s common government had responsibility for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|army]], for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|navy]], for foreign policy, and for the [[customs union]].

Within Cisleithania and Hungary certain regions, such as Galicia and Croatia enjoyed special status with their own unique governmental structures.

A common Ministerial Council ruled the common government: it comprised the three ministers for the joint responsibilities (joint finance, military, and foreign policy), the two prime ministers, some Archdukes and the monarch. Two delegations of representatives (60–60 members), one each from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Common Ministerial Council, giving the two governments influence in the common administration. However, the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch, and he had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy.

Overlapping responsibilities between the joint ministries and the ministries of the two halves caused friction and inefficiencies. The armed forces suffered particularly from overlap. Although the unified government determined overall military direction, the Austrian and Hungarian governments each remained in charge of &quot;the quota of recruits, legislation concerning [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], transfer and provision of the armed forces, and regulation of the civic, non-military affairs of members of the armed forces&quot;. Needless to say, each government could have a strong influence over common governmental responsibilities. Each half of the Dual Monarchy proved quite prepared to disrupt common operations to advance its own interests.

Relations over the half-century after 1867 between the two halves of the Empire (in fact the Cisleithan part contained about 57% of the combined realm's population and a rather larger share of its economic resources) featured repeated disputes over shared external tariff arrangements and over the financial contribution of each government to the common treasury. Under the terms of the &quot;Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867&quot;, an agreement, renegotiated every ten years, determined these matters. Each build-up to the renewal of the agreement saw political turmoil. The disputes between the halves of the Empire culminated in the mid-1900s in a prolonged [[constitutional crisis]]—triggered by disagreement over the language of command in [[Military of Hungary|Hungarian army]] units, and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest (April 1906) of a Hungarian [[Nationalist Coalition|nationalist coalition]]. Provisional renewals of the common arrangements occurred in October 1907 and in November 1917 on the basis of the ''status quo''.

===Politics===
Legally, besides the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] there were no common laws in Austria-Hungary. All laws, even the ones with identical content like the compromise of 1867, had to pass the parliaments both in Vienna and Budapest and were published in the respective official medium (in the Austrian half it was called ''[[Reichsgesetzblatt]]'' and was issued in eight languages). To conclude on identical texts, the two parliaments elected delegations of 60 of their members each, which discussed motions of the Imperial &amp; Royal ministries separately and tried to find a compromise.

The first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count Gyula Andrássy. The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph was crowned as King of Hungary. During this time Austria-Hungary was geographically the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire ({{convert|621537|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}), and the third most populous (after Russia and the German Empire).

The Empire relied increasingly on a cosmopolitan bureaucracy - in which Czechs played an important role - backed by loyal elements, including a large part of the German, Hungarian, Polish and Croat aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/629969.stm | work=BBC News | title=Analysis: Austria's troubled history | date=2000-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political struggles in the Empire====
The political opponents of the &quot;conservative liberal&quot; aristocracy and gentry class were the leftist liberal &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; political parties in the parliaments of Vienna and Budapest. These leftist liberal parliamentary parties were backed by the big industrialists, bankers, businessmen and the predominant majority of newspaper &quot;[[media moguls]]&quot;. During the war, they had a important functions in the organization of strikes, protests and civil unrest in the Empire. After the war (as consequent republicans)  that parties had key-role in the disintegration and collapse of the monarchy in Austria and Hungary, and proclamation of the republics in Vienna and Budapest. 

Like the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices. From the 1860s liberal businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the Empire, and prosperous members of the [[bourgeoisie]] erected conspicuously large homes, giving themselves a prominence in urban life that rivaled the aristocracy's. They persuaded the government to search out [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] to build up infrastructure such as railroads in the early period of the Empire.

Liberals in Austria, most of them ethnic Germans, saw their influence weaken under the leadership of [[Eduard Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe|Count Edouard von Taaffe]], Austrian prime minister from 1879-1893. Taaffe used a coalition of clergy, conservatives and Slavic parties to weaken the liberals. In Bohemia for example, he designated Czech as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system, thus breaking the German speakers' monopoly on holding office. Reforms motivated other [[ethnic group]]s to push for even greater autonomy. By playing nationalities off one another, the government ensured the monarchy's central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change.

===Foreign policy===
By the late 1860s, Austrian ambitions in both Italy and Germany had been choked off by the rise of new national powers. With the decline and failed reforms of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Slavic opposition in the occupied Balkans grew and both Russia and Austria-Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region. In 1876, Russia offered to partition the Balkans, but Andrássy declined for Austria-Hungary was already a &quot;saturated&quot; state and it could not cope with additional territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44183/Austria/33365/Austria-Hungary-1867-1918#toc=toc33365 Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; The whole monarchy was thus drawn into a new style of diplomatic brinkmanship, first conceived of by Andrássy, centering on the province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a predominantly Slavic area of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was transferred to Austro-Hungarian control in 1878, by the [[Congress of Berlin]]. It was a dangerous game to play in a dangerous place. A road was thus mapped out, with a [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|terminus at Sarajevo]] in 1914.

==Economy==
[[File:BanknoteA-H.jpg|thumb|left|A 20-[[Austro-Hungarian krone|crown]] banknote of the Dual Monarchy]]
[[File:Budapest andrassy ut 1875.jpg|thumb|left|Andrássy Avenue, [[Budapest]] (1875)]]
The Austro-Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the existence of the Dual Monarchy. The [[capitalism|capitalist]] way of production spread throughout the Empire during its 50-year existence replacing medieval institutions. [[Technological change]] accelerated [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. The [[Measures of national income and output|GNP]] per capita grew roughly 1.76% per year from 1870-1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%).&lt;ref&gt;Good, David. ''The Economic Rise of the Habsburg Empire''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a comparison with Germany and Britain: the Austro-Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later. In 1873, the old capital Buda and Óbuda (Ancient Buda) were officially merged with the third city, Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into Hungary's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. Economic growth centered on [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]], the Austrian lands (areas of modern Austria), the Alpine region and the Bohemian lands. In the later years of the 19th century, rapid economic growth spread to the central [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plain]] and to the Carpathian lands. As a result, wide disparities of development existed within the Empire. In general, the western areas became more developed than the eastern.

However, by the end of the 19th century, economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the Empire consistently surpassed that in the western. The strong agriculture and [[food industry]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] with the center of [[Budapest]] became predominant within the Empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around [[Prague]] and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This [[division of labour]] between the east and west, besides the existing [[economic and monetary union]], led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century.  The most important trading partner was Germay (1910: 48% of all exports, 39% of all imports), followed by Great Britain (1910: almost 10% of all exports, 8% of all imports). Trade with the geographically neighboring Russia, however, had a relatively low weight (1910: 3% of all exports /mainly machinery for Russia, 7% of all imports /mainly raw materials from Russia).

== Transport ==
=== Railways ===

{{Main|Imperial Austrian State Railways}}
{{Main|Hungarian State Railways}}

[[Rail transport]] expanded rapidly in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its [[predecessor state]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], had built a substantial core of railways in the west, originating from Vienna, by 1841. At that point, the government realized the military possibilities of rail and began to invest heavily in construction. [[Pozsony]] ([[Bratislava]]), [[Budapest]], [[Prague]], [[Kraków]], [[Graz]], Laibach ([[Ljubljana]]) and [[Venedig]] ([[Venice]]) became linked to the main network. By 1854, the empire had almost {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track, about 60-70% of it in state hands. The government then began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]] and of the [[Crimean War]].

From 1854-1879, private interests conducted almost all rail construction. What would become Cisleithania gained {{convert|7952|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track, and Hungary built {{convert|5839|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track. During this time, many new areas joined the railway system and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections. This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria-Hungary, and also the integration of transportation systems in the area. Railways allowed the Empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible, when transportation depended on rivers.

After 1879, the Austrian and the Hungarian governments slowly began to renationalize their rail networks, largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide [[depression (economics)|depression]] of the 1870s. Between 1879-1900, more than {{convert|25000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of railways were built in Cisleithania and Hungary. Most of this constituted &quot;filling in&quot; of the existing network, although some areas, primarily in the far east, gained rail connections for the first time. The railway reduced transportation costs throughout the Empire, opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy. In 1914, of a total of {{convert|22981|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} of railway tracks on Austrian part of the Empire, 18,859 (82%) were state owned. See [[Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways|Imperial Austrian State Railways]] for details in Austria. By 1910, the total length of the rail networks of Hungarian Kingdom reached 22,000&amp;nbsp;km (13,670&amp;nbsp;mi), the Hungarian network contained more than 1,490 railway stations.

Because of the Austrian possessions at the Littorals in many European countries and huge parts of the Balkan, Austria had several seaports.]]

The most significant seaport was [[Trieste]] (today part of Italy), where the Austrian merchant navy with their two most important navigation companies (Austrian Lloyd and Austro-Americana) and with several shipyards was settled. The K.U.K. navy used the port also for constructing new naval ships. The upturn started with the decline of Venice, which additionally could not be a rivalry for the Austrians from 1815 until 1866, because it was part of the monarchy. The merchant navy could not reach significance by the time Venice had been such a strong competitor. Also the navy became very significant during the time of the k.u.k. monarchy. For long time the establishment of a navy had failed because of lack of money at the Habsburg family.

The most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the k.u.k. was Fiume, where the Hungarian navigation companies like the famous Adria were operating from. The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz-Danubius.  Another significant seaport was Pola – especially for the navy.
In 1889 the Austrian merchant navy counted 10.022 ships, with 7.992 fishing vessels. Both 1.859 sailboats with crews of 6.489 men and a load capacity of 140.838 tons were used for the coast and sea trade and 171 steamers with a load capacity of  96.323 tons and a crew of 3.199 men.

The first Danubian steamer company (Donau-Dampfschifffahrt-Gesellschaft /DDSG) was the largest inland shipping company in the whole world until the collapse of the k.u.k. The Austrian Lloyd was one of the biggest ocean shipping companies of those time with voyages to the Orient and since the construction of the Suez-Chanel also to Asia. Until the beginning of the World War I the company owned 65 middle-sized and big steamers. The Austro-Americana owned one third of them and the biggest Austrian passenger ship, the SS ''Kaiser Franz Joseph I''. In comparison to the Austrian Lloyd the Austro-American concentrated on destinations in North- and South America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/essayunddiskurs/1318640&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/cosulich.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://members.dame.at/diverpeter/baron_gautsch.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.o/o755244.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stw.at/inhalt/Schifffahrt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddsg-blue-danube.at&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1849, the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament proclaimed and enacted the first laws on ethnic and minority rights in the world. (The next such laws were in Switzerland.) But these were overturned after the Russian and Austrian armies  crushed the Hungarian Revolution. When Hungary made a compromise with the dynasty in 1867 one of the first acts of the restored Parliament was to pass a Law on Nationalities (Act Number XLIV of 1868). It was a liberal piece of legislation, and offered rather extensive language and cultural rights, but refused to recognize the non-Hungarians as state forming elements with territorial autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suedosteuropa-gesellschaft.com/pdf_2010/doku/ungarn_slowakei/jan_gabor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867&quot; created semi-independent states of Hungary and Austria linked by personal union, and entailed the rise of an assertive Magyar identity within the Kingdom of Hungary. Nationalism prevalent in the Empire of Austria also created tension between [[ethnic German]] and Czech citizens. In addition, the emergence of [[nation|national identity]] in newly independent Romania and Serbia also contributed to ethnic issues in the empire.

Article 19 of the 1867 &quot;Basic State Act&quot; (''Staatsgrundgesetz''), valid only for the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria-Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/at/stgg67-2.htm Staatsgrundgesetz über die allgemeinen Rechte und Staatsbürger für die im Reichsrate vertretenen Königreiche und Länder (1867)]&lt;/ref&gt; said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;All races of the empire have equal rights, and every race has an inviolable right to the preservation and use of its own nationality and language. The equality of all customary languages (&quot;{{lang|de|landesübliche Sprache}}&quot;) in school, office and public life, is recognized by the state. In those territories in which several races dwell, the public and educational institutions are to be so arranged that, without applying compulsion to learn a second country language (&quot;{{lang|de|Landessprache}}&quot;), each of the races receives the necessary means of education in its own language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implementation of this principle led to several disputes, as it was not clear which languages could be regarded as &quot;customary&quot;. The Germans, the traditional bureaucratic, capitalist and cultural elite, demanded the recognition of their language as a customary language in every part of the Empire. Italian was regarded as an old &quot;culture language&quot; (''{{lang|de|Kultursprache}}'') by German intellectuals and had always been granted [[Social equality|equal rights]] as an [[official language]] of the Empire, but the Germans had difficulty in accepting the [[Slavic languages]] as equal to German. On one occasion [[Count Anton Alexander von Auersperg|Count A. Auersperg]] (Anastasius Grün) entered the diet of [[Carniola]] carrying what he claimed to be the whole [[text corpus|corpus]] of [[Slovene literature]] under his arm to provide evidence that the [[Slovene language]] could in his view not be substituted for German as a medium of higher education.

Nevertheless the following years saw an emancipation of several languages, at least in Cisleithania. From 1867, laws awarded [[Croatian language|Croatian]] equal status with Italian in [[Dalmatia]]. From 1882, there was a Slovene majority in the diet of Carniola and in the capital [[Ljubljana|Laibach (Ljubljana)]], thereby replacing German as the dominant official language. Polish was introduced instead of German in 1869 in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] as the normal language of government. The Poles themselves systematically disregarded the large [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] minority in the country, and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was not granted the status of an official language.

The language disputes were most fiercely fought in [[Bohemia]] where the Czech speakers formed a majority and sought equal status for their language. German speakers lost their majority in the Bohemian diet in 1880 and their dominating position in the cities of [[Prague]] and [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] (while retaining a slight numerical majority in the city of [[Brno|Brno (Brünn)]]) and found themselves in an unfamiliar minority position. The old [[Charles University in Prague]], hitherto dominated by the German speakers, was divided into German and Czech parts in 1882.

At the same time, Hungarian dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of [[Romanians]] in [[Transylvania]] and in the eastern [[Banat]], of [[Slovaks]] in today's [[Slovakia]], of [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] in the crown lands of [[Croatia]] and of [[Dalmatia]] (today's [[Croatia]]), in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and in the provinces known as the [[Vojvodina]] (today's northern [[Serbia]]). The Romanians and the Serbs also looked to union with their fellow nationalists in the newly-founded states of [[Romania]] (1859–78) and [[Serbia]].

Hungary's leaders were generally less willing than their Austrian counterparts to share power with their subject minorities, but they granted a large measure of autonomy to the [[Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia|Croatia]] in 1868, paralleling to some extent their own accommodation within the Empire the previous year. The [[Government of Croatia|Croatian government]], in spite of nominal autonomy, was in fact an economic and administrative arm of Hungary, which the Croatians resented.

Language was one of the most contentious issues in Austro-Hungarian politics. All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in deciding on the languages of government and of instruction. Each minorities the widest opportunities for education in their own language as well as in the &quot;dominant&quot; languages of Hungarian and German. On one notable occasion, the &quot;Ordinance of 5 April 1897&quot;, the Austrian Prime Minister [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni]] gave Czech equal standing with German in the internal government of [[Bohemia]], leading to a crisis because of nationalist German agitation throughout the Empire. In the end Badeni was dismissed. 

The Hungarian minority act of 1868 gave the minorities (Slovaks, Romanians, Serbs et al.) individual (but not also communal) rights to use their language in offices, schools (although in practice often only in those founded by them and not by the state), courts and municipalities (if 20% of the deputies demanded it). From June 1907 (Lex Apponyi), all  public and [[private school]]s in Hungary were obliged to ensure that after the fourth grade the pupils could express themselves fluently in Hungarian; which led to the closing of several minority schools, mostly Slovak and Rusyn.

It was not rare for the two kingdoms to divide [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. According to [[Misha Glenny]] (''The Balkans, 1804–1999''), the Austrians responded to Hungarian persecution of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in Zagreb.

Emperor Franz Joseph realised that he reigned in a multiethnic country, and spoke German, Hungarian and Czech fluently, and Polish and Italian to some degree.

The situation of Jews in the kingdom, who numbered about 2 million in 1914, was ambiguous. [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] parties and movements existed, but Vienna and Budapest did not initiate pogroms or implement official antisemitic policies - mainly for fear that such [[ethnic violence]] could ignite other [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] and result in violence that could spin out of control. The antisemitic parties remained on the periphery of political sphere due to their low popularity amongst voters in the parliamentary elections. The majority of Jews lived in small towns in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and rural areas in Hungary and Bohemia, although there were large communities in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and other large cities. Of the pre-World War military forces of the major European powers, the Austro-Hungarian army was almost alone in its regular promotion of Jews to positions of command.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=118}} While the Jewish population of the lands of the Dual Monarchy was about five percent, Jews made up nearly eighteen percent of the reserve officer corps.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=128}}

===Linguistic distribution===
In the Austrian Empire 36.8% of the total population spoke German as a mother tongue and more than 71% of the inhabitants spoke some German. In the Kingdom of Hungary 54.4% of the total population spoke Hungarian as a mother tongue. Not counting autonomous Croatia, more than 64% of the inhabitants of the Hungarian Kingdom spoke Hungarian.

==World War I==
===Preludes: Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Russian [[Pan-Slavic]] organizations sent aid to the Balkan rebels {{citation needed|date=February 2011}} and so pressured the tsar's government that Russia declared war on Turkey in 1877 in the name of protecting Orthodox Christians. Unable to mediate between Turkey and Russia over the control of Serbia, Austria-Hungary declared neutrality when the conflict between the two powers escalated into a [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; With help from Romania and Greece, Russia defeated the Ottomans and by the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] created a large pro-Russian{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Bulgaria. This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war. Austria-Hungary and Britain feared that an enlarged Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia in order to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean so close to Britain's route through the [[Suez Canal]].

The [[Congress of Berlin]] rolled back the Russian victory, by partitioning the large Bulgarian state that Russia had carved out of Ottoman territory, and denying any part of Bulgaria full independence from the Ottomans. Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as a way of gaining clout in the Balkans. Serbia and Montenegro became fully independent. Nonetheless the Balkans remained a site of political unrest, teeming ambition for independence and great power rivalries. At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, [[Gyula Andrássy]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs) managed to force Russia to retreat from further demands in the Balkans. As a result, [[Old Great Bulgaria|Great Bulgaria]] was broken up and Serbian independence was guaranteed.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; In that year, with Britain's support, Austria-Hungary stationed troops in Bosnia, to prevent the Russians from expanding into nearby Serbia. In another measure to keep the Russians out of the Balkans, Austria-Hungary formed an alliance, the Mediterranean Entente, with Britain and Italy in 1887 and concluded mutual defence pacts, with Germany in 1879 and with Romania in 1883, against possible Russian attack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKqzJwX&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Congress of Berlin the European powers attempted to guarantee stability through a complex series of alliances and treaties. 

Anxious about Balkan instability and Russian aggression, and to counter French interests in Europe, Austria Hungary forged a [[defensive alliance]] with Germany in October 1879 and in May 1882. In October 1882, Italy joined this partnership in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] largely because of Italy's imperial rivalries with France. Tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary remained high, so [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] replaced the [[League of the Three Emperors]] with the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia to keep the Habsburgs from recklessly starting a war over Pan-Slavism{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

On the heels of the Great Balkan Crisis, Austro-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1878 and the monarchy eventually [[Bosnian crisis|annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908]] as a common holding of Cis- and Transleithania under the control of the [[finance minister|Imperial &amp; Royal finance ministry]], rather than attaching it to either territorial government. This occupation was a response to Russia's advances into [[Bessarabia]]. The annexation in 1908 led some in Vienna to contemplate combining Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia to form a third, Slavic component of the Empire. The deaths of Franz Joseph's brother, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] (1867), and only son, [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Rudolf]], made the Emperor's nephew, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the throne. The Archduke was rumoured to have been an advocate for this [[trialism]], as a means to limit the power of the Magyar aristocracy.

===Decision for war===
On 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]], where [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] militants of the nationalist group [[Young Bosnia|Mlada Bosna]], supplied by the Serbian militant group [[Black Hand]], ambushed his convoy and [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated him]]. There were several members of the Black Hand in Sarajevo that day. Before Franz was shot, somebody had already tried to kill him and his wife. A member of the Black Hand threw a [[Hand grenade|grenade]] at the car, but missed. It injured some people nearby and Franz Ferdinand made sure they were given medical attention before the convoy could carry on. [[Gavrilo Princip]] was the man who shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. The convoy took a wrong turn into a street where Gavrilo Princip was. He took out a pistol from his pocket and shot Franz and his wife. The reaction among the Austrian common people was mild, almost indifferent. As historian Z.A.B. Zeman later wrote, &quot;the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday [June 28 and 29], the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine?as if nothing had happened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/european-powers-maintain-focus-despite-killings-in-sarajevo&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empire's [[military budget|military spending]] had not even doubled since the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], while German spending had risen fivefold, and British, Russian, and French threefold. The Empire had lost ethnic Italian areas to [[Piedmont]] owing to nationalist movements sweeping through Italy, and many Austro-Hungarians perceived the threat of losing the southern territories inhabited by Slavs to [[Serbia]] as imminent. Serbia had recently gained considerable territory in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913, causing much distress in government circles in Vienna and Budapest.

Some members of the government, such as [[Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]], had wanted to confront the resurgent Serbian nation for some years in a preventive war, but the Emperor, 84 years old and enemy of all adventures, disapproved. But now the leaders of Austria-Hungary, especially General [[Leopold Graf Berchtold|Count Leopold von Berchtold]], backed by its ally Germany, decided to confront Serbia militarily before it could incite a revolt; using the assassination as an excuse, they presented a list of ten demands called the [[July Ultimatum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/austrianultimatum.htm Primary Documents: Austrian Ultimatum to Serbia, 23 July 1914] Updated on 24 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; expecting Serbia would never accept. When Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the remaining one, Austria-Hungary [[Declaration of war|declared war]]. Franz Joseph I finally followed the urgent counsel of his top advisors.

Over the course of July and August 1914, these events caused the start of [[World War I]], as Russia mobilized in support of Serbia, setting off a series of countermobilizations. Italy initially remained neutral, although it had an alliance with Austria-Hungary. In 1915, it switched to the side of the [[Triple Entente|Entente powers]], hoping to gain territory from its former ally.

===Main events===
General von Hötzendorf was the Chief of the Austro-Hungarian [[Staff (military)|General Staff]]. Franz Joseph I, who was much too old to command the army, appointed Archduke Friedrich von Österreich-Teschen as Supreme Army Commander (Armeeoberkommandant), but asked him to give Von Hötzendorf freedom to take any decisions. The latter remained in effective command of the military forces until Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]] took the supreme command himself in late 1916 and dismissed Conrad von Hötzendorf in 1917.

'''Serbian front'''

At the start of the war, the army was divided in two: the smaller part attacked Serbia while the larger part fought against the formidable Russian army. The invasion of Serbia in 1914 was a disaster: by the end of the year, the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] had taken no territory but had lost 227,000 out of a total force of 450,000 men (see [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)]]). However in autumn 1915, the Serbian Army was defeated by the Central Powers, which led to the occupation of Serbia. Near the end of 1915, in a massive rescue operation involving more than 1,000 trips made by Italian, French and British steamers, 260,000 Serb soldiers were transported to [[Corfu]], where they waited for the chance of the victory of Allied Powers to reclaim their country. Corfu hosted the Serbian government in exile after the collapse of Serbia, and served as a supply base to the Greek front. In April 1916 a large number of Serbian troops were transported in British and French naval vessels from Corfu to mainland Greece. The contingent numbering over 120 000 relieved a much smaller army at the Salonika front and fought alongside British and French troops.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/french-forces-occupy-corfu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russian front'''

On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]], things started out equally poorly. The Austro-Hungarian Army was defeated at the [[Battle of Galicia|Battle of Lemberg]] and the great fortress city of [[Siege of Przemyśl|Przemyśl was besieged]] and fell in March 1915. The [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]] started as a minor German offensive to relieve the pressure of the Russian numerical superiority on the Austro-Hungarians, but the cooperation of the Central Powers resulted in huge Russian losses and the total collapse of the Russian lines, and their 100&amp;nbsp;km long retreat into Russia. The Russian Third Army perished. In summer 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Army, under a unified command with the Germans, participated in the successful [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]]. From June 1916, the Russians focused their attacks on the Austro-Hungarian army in the [[Brusilov Offensive]], recognizing the numerical inferiority of the Austro-Hungarian army. By the end of September 1916, Austria-Hungary could mobilise and concentrate new divisions, and the successful Russian advance was halted and slowly repelled; but the Austrian armies took heavy losses (about 1 million men) and never recovered. However the huge losses in men and material inflicted on the Russians during the offensive contributed greatly to their two revolutions of 1917, and it caused an economic crash in the Russian Empire. 

'''Italian Front'''

In May 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and attacked Austria-Hungary. Italy was the only military opponent of the Empire which had similar degree of industrialization and economic level. The bloody but indecisive fighting on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]] would last for the next three and a half years. It was only on this front that the Austrians proved effective in war, managing to hold back the numerically superior Italian armies in the [[Alps]] and at the [[Isonzo]] river, through alternating phases, until the last month of war. In 1917, the [[Battle of Caporetto]] was a decisive victory of the Central Powers: the Austro-Hungarian and German forces advanced more than {{convert|100|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} in the direction of Venice, but could not cross the Piave River. The military and economic crisis of Italy was resolved by enormous material supports from the Allied powers: by 1918, huge amounts of war materials and American, British, and French divisions arrived in the Italian battle zone to stop the advance of the Empire.

'''Romanian Front'''
On 27 August 1916, Romania proclaimed war against Austria-Hungary. The Romanian army crossed the borders of Eastern Hungary (Transylvania). By November 1916, the Central Powers had defeated the Romanian army and occupied Southern and Eastern parts of Romania. On 6 December the Central Powers captured Bucharest, the Romanian capital city.

The Austro-Hungarian war effort became more and more subordinated to the direction of German planners. The Austrians viewed the [[German Army|German army]] favorably, but by 1916 the general belief in Germany was that it was &quot;shackled to a corpse&quot;. The operational capability of the Austro-Hungarian army was seriously affected by supply shortages, low morale and a high casualty rate, as well by the army's composition of multiple ethnicities with different languages and customs.

The last two successes for the Austrians, the [[Romania during World War I|Romanian Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto Offensive]], were German-assisted operations. As the Dual Monarchy became more politically unstable, it became more and more dependent on German assistance. The majority of its people, other than Hungarians and German Austrians, became increasingly restless.

===Role of Hungary===
Austria-Hungary held on for years, as the Hungarian half provided sufficient supplies for the military to continue to wage war.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; This was shown in a transition of power after which the Hungarian prime minister, Count István Tisza, and foreign minister, Count István Burián, had decisive influence over the internal and external affairs of the monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; By late 1916, food supply from Hungary became intermittent and the government sought an armistice with the Entente powers. However, this failed as Britain and France no longer had any regard for the integrity of the empire because of Austro-Hungarian support for Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;

===Analysis of defeat===
The setbacks that the Austrian army suffered in 1914 and 1915 can be attributed to a large extent to Austria-Hungary becoming a military satellite of [[Imperial Germany]] from the first day of the war. They were made worse by the incompetence of the Austrian high command.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; After attacking Serbia, its forces soon had to be withdrawn to protect its eastern frontier against Russia's invasion, while German units were engaged in fighting on [[Western Front (World War I)|the Western Front]]. This resulted in a greater than expected loss of men in the invasion of Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; Furthermore it became evident that the Austrian high command had had no plans for a possible continental war and that the army and navy were also ill-equipped to handle such a conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;

Former ambassador and foreign minister Count [[Alois Aehrenthal]] had assumed that any future war would be in the Balkan region. In 1917, the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]] of the Allied (Entente) Powers completely collapsed. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. Despite great eastern successes, Germany suffered complete defeat in the more decisive western front. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated. Leftist and pacifist political movements organized strikes in factories, and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. During the Italian battles, the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs declared their independence. On 31 October Hungary ended the personal union officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. At the last Italian battles the Austro-Hungarian Army took to the field without any food and munition supply, and fought without any political supports for a [[de facto]] non-existent Empire. On the end of the decisive [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Italian British and French cooperating offensive at Vittorio Veneto]], the disintegrated Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in [[Padua]] on 3 November 1918.

==Dissolution==

In the autumn of 1918, as a political result of German defeat on the western front in World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest the leftist and liberal movements and politicians (the opposition parties) strengthened and supported the [[separatism]] of ethnic minorities. These leftist or left-liberal pro-Entente maverick parties opposed the monarchy as a [[form of government]] and considered themselves internationalist rather than patriotic. Eventually, the German defeat and the minor revolutions in Vienna and Budapest gave political power to the left/liberal political parties.
As it became apparent that the Allied powers of the [[British Empire]], France, Italy and the United States would win World War I, nationalist movements which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas started pressing for full independence.

As one of his [[Fourteen Points]], [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the nationalities of the empire have the &quot;freest opportunity to autonomous development&quot;. In response, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]] agreed to reconvene the imperial parliament in 1917 and allow the creation of a [[confederation]] with each national group exercising [[self-governance]]. However these national groups no longer trusted Vienna and were now dead set on independence.

On 14 October 1918 Foreign Minister [[István Burian|Baron István Burián von Rajecz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kum/en/bal/Ministry/minister/foreign_ministers.htm Hungarian foreign ministers from 1848 to our days]&lt;/ref&gt; asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points. In an apparent attempt to demonstrate [[good faith]], Karl I issued a proclamation (&quot;Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918&quot;) two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy. The Polish majority regions of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Lodomeria]] were granted independence, and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in forming a Polish state. The rest of [[Cisleithania]] was transformed into a federal union composed of four parts—German, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the Empire with Vienna, and Trieste was to receive a special status. No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary, where Magyar aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain the &quot;Holy Kingdom of St. Stephen&quot;.

It was all in vain: four days later, on 18 October [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities — the tenth of the Fourteen Points — was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points any more. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies on 14 October. The leaders of the South Slavs had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917 [[Corfu Declaration]] signed by members of the [[Yugoslav Committee]].

The Lansing note was, in effect, the death certificate of Austria-Hungary. The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries. With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] on 24 October Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October (later declared the birthday of Czechoslovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days. On 30 October, the Slovaks followed in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]. On 29 October, the Slovenes declared their independence from Austria and joined the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] as had the Croatians, who had been ignoring orders from Budapest since the beginning of October. The Hungarian government terminated the personal union with Austria by 31 October, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. There was now nothing left of the Habsburg realm except its majority-German Alpine and Danubian provinces.

===Consequences===
The last [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Emperor-King, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]] (Karl I in Austria and Károly IV in Hungary), was persuaded by his Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], that he was in an impossible situation. By this time, the German-Austrian state council was challenging his authority in the German-speaking areas of his realm. On 11 November, he issued a proclamation which recognized Austria's right to determine the form of the state and renounced the right to participate in Austrian affairs of state. He also released the officials in the Austrian half of the empire from their oath of loyalty to him. Two days later, he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary. However, he did not abdicate, remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him.

In Austria and Hungary, republics were declared at the end of the war in November. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (between the victors of World War I and Austria) and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (between the victors and Hungary) regulated the new borders of Austria and Hungary. The Allies assumed without question that the minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary, and also allowed them to annex significant blocks of German- and Hungarian-speaking territory. As a result, the [[German Austria|Republic of German Austria]] lost roughly 60% of the old [[Austrian Empire]]'s territory. It also had to drop its plans for union with Germany, as it was not allowed to unite with Germany without League approval. The [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]] lost roughly 72% of the pre-war territory of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

The decisions of the nations of the former Austria-Hungary and of the victors of the Great War, contained in the heavily one-sided treaties, had devastating political and economic effects. The previously rapid [[economic growth]] of the Dual Monarchy ground to a halt because the new borders became major economic barriers. All the formerly well established industries were designed to satisfy the needs of an extensive realm. As a result, the emerging countries were forced to make considerable sacrifices to transform their economies. The treaties created major political unease. As a result of these economic difficulties, extremist movements gained strength; and there was no regional superpower in central Europe.

The new Austrian state was, at least on paper, on shakier ground than Hungary. While what was left of Austria had been a single unit for over 700 years, it was united only by loyalty to the Habsburgs. By comparison, Hungary had been a nation and a state for over 900 years. However, after a brief period of upheaval and the allies' foreclosure of union with Germany, Austria established itself as a federal republic. Despite the temporary ''[[Anschluss]]'' with [[Nazi Germany]], it still survives today.

Hungary, however, was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The Hungarian Democratic Republic was short-lived and was temporarily replaced by the communist [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. [[Romania]]n troops ousted [[Béla Kun]] and his [[communist state|communist government]] during the [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919]]. In March 1920, a monarchist revival resulted in the restoration of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Royal powers were entrusted to a [[regent]], [[Miklós Horthy]], who had been the last commanding [[admiral]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] and had helped organize the counter-revolutionary forces.

In March and again in October 1921, ill-prepared attempts by [[Charles I of Austria|Károly IV]] ([[Charles I of Austria|Karl I in Austria]]) to [[Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary|regain the throne in Budapest]] collapsed. The initially wavering Horthy, after receiving threats of intervention from the [[Allies of World War I|allied powers]] and neighboring countries, refused his cooperation. Subsequently, the British took custody of Karl and removed him and his family to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he died the following year.

====Successor states====
{{Main|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint Germain}}

The following [[successor state]]s were formed (entirely or in part) on the territory of the former Austria-Hungary:
*[[German Austria]] and [[First Austrian Republic]]
*[[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]]
*[[Czecho-Slovakia]] (&quot;Czechoslovakia&quot; from 1920 to 1938)
*[[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (joined with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] on 1 December 1918 to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]])
*[[Second Polish Republic]], [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]

Austro-Hungarian lands were also ceded to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. The [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]], which had formerly looked to Vienna for protection, formed a customs and defense union with [[Switzerland]], and adopted the Swiss currency instead of the Austrian. In April 1919, [[Vorarlberg]] — the westernmost province of Austria — voted by a large majority to join Switzerland; however, both the Swiss and the Allies disregarded this result.

The following present-day countries and parts of countries were located within the boundaries of Austria-Hungary when the empire was dissolved:

'''[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]''' ('''[[Cisleithania]]'''):
*Austria (with the exception of [[Burgenland]])
*[[Czech Republic]] (with the exception of the [[Hlučín Region|Hlučínsko]] area)
*[[Slovenia]] (with the exception of [[Prekmurje]])
*Italy ([[Trentino]], [[South Tyrol]], parts of the [[province of Belluno]] and small portions of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]])
*[[Croatia]] (Dalmatia, Istria)
*Poland (voivodeships of [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser Poland]], [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Subcarpathia]], southernmost part of [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]] (Bielsko and Cieszyn)
*[[Ukraine]] (oblasts of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] (except its northern corner) and most of the oblast of [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]])
*[[Romania]] (county of [[Suceava County|Suceava]])
*[[Montenegro]] (bay of [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]], the coast and the immediate hinterland around the cities of [[Budva]], [[Petrovac (Montenegro)|Petrovac]] and [[Sutomore]])

'''[[Kingdom of Hungary]]''' ('''[[Transleithania]]'''):
*Hungary;
*[[Slovakia]]
*Austria ([[Burgenland]])
*[[Slovenia]] ([[Prekmurje]])
*[[Croatia]] ([[Slavonia]], [[Central Croatia]], southern parts of the pre-1918 [[Baranya County (former)|Baranya]] and [[Zala County (former)|Zala counties]] – today's Croatian part of Baranja and [[Međimurje County|Međimurje county]])
*[[Ukraine]] (oblast of [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]])
*[[Romania]] (region of [[Transylvania]] and [[Partium]])
*[[Serbia]] (autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]] and parts of the present-day [[Belgrade]] north of the [[Sava River]])
*[[Poland]] (Polish parts of [[Orava (region)|Orava]] and [[Spiš]])
*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the villages of Zavalje, Mali skočaj and Veliki skočaj including the immediate surrounding area west of the city of Bihać)

''Austro-Hungarian Condominium''
*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
*[[Montenegro]] ([[Sutorina]] – western part of the Municipality of [[Herceg Novi|Herceg–Novi]] between present borders with Croatia (SW) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (NW), [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]] (E) and the township of Igalo (NE))
*[[Sandžak|Raška region]]/[[Sandžak|Sandzak]] of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], under effective Austro-Hungarian occupation while formally part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1912

''Colonies of the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]''
*The [[empire]] was unable to gain and maintain large colonies owing to its geographical position. Its only small colony was in [[Tianjin]] (now [[China]]), which it was granted in return for supporting the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] in suppressing the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. However although the city was only an Austrian colony for 16 years, the [[Austro-Hungarians]] left their mark on that area of the [[city]], in the form of [[architecture]] that still stands in the city.&lt;ref&gt;For more information about the Austro-Hungarian concession, see: [[Concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession (1901-1917)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other parts of Europe had been part of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] monarchy once but had left it before its dissolution in 1918. Prominent examples are the regions of [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]] in Italy, [[Silesia]] in Poland, most of Belgium and [[Serbia]], and parts of northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany.

Like the German Empire, that of Austria-Hungary frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices. From the 1860s liberal businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the Empire and the prosperous [[middle class]]es erected conspicuously large homes, thus gaining a prominence in urban life that rivalled that of the aristocracy. They persuaded the government to search out [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] to build up infrastructure such as railroads. Despite these measures, Austria-Hungary remained resolutely monarchist and authoritarian.

Liberals in Austria, most of them ethnic Germans, saw their influence weaken under the leadership of Count Edouard von Taaffe, Austrian prime minister from 1879-1893. Building a coalition of clergy, conservatives and Slavic parties, Taaffe used its power to weaken the liberals. In Bohemia, for example, he designated Czech as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system, thus breaking the German speakers' monopoly on office holding. These reforms outraged the ethnic groups that lost out, while those who won concessions, such as Czechs, clamored for even greater autonomy. By playing nationalities off one against another, the government preserved the monarchy's central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change.

Russian Pan-Slavic organizations sent aid to the Balkan rebels and so pressured the tsar's government that Russia declared war on Turkey in 1877 in the name of protecting Orthodox Christians. With help from Romania and Greece, Russia defeated the Ottomans and by the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] created a large Pro-Russian Bulgaria. This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war. Austria-Hungary and Britain feared that an enlarged Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans. Austrian officials worried about an uprising of their own restless Slavs. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia in order to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean, so close to Britain's route through the [[Suez Canal]].

The public was drawn into foreign policy: the music halls and newspapers of England echoed a new [[jingoism]] or political sloganeering that throbbed with sentiments of war: &quot;We don't want to fight but by Jingo if we do / We've got the ships, we've got the men, We've got the money too.&quot; The other great powers, however, did not want a Europe-wide war and in 1878 they attempted to revive the [[concert of Europe]] by meeting at Berlin under the auspices of Bismarck, who was a calming presence on the diplomatic scene.

==Flags and heraldry==
===Flags===
Although Austria-Hungary did not have a common [[national flag|flag]] (a &quot;national flag&quot; could not exist since both halves of the Dual Monarchy consisted of inhabitants of several nationalities), a common [[civil ensign]] (introduced in 1869) did exist. The I. &amp; R. War Fleet until 1918 continued to carry the Austrian ensign it had used since 1786. The regiments of the I. &amp; R. Army until 1918 carried the double-eagle flags they had used before 1867, as they had a long history in many cases. New ensigns created in 1915 had not been implemented until 1918 due to the war. At state functions, in Austria black-yellow and in Hungary red-white-green were exposed.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The colours black-yellow were used as the flag of the Austrian part. The Hungarian part used a red-white-green [[Tricolour]] defaced with the Hungarian coat of arms.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Coat of arms===
The [[double-headed eagle]] of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was used as the [[Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary|coat of arms]] of the common institutions of Austria-Hungary between 1867 and 1915. In 1915 a new one was introduced, which combined the coat of arms of the two parts of the empire and that of the dynasty.

&lt;gallery&gt;

Additionally each of the two parts of Austria-Hungary had its own coat of arms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|an incantational word}}
'''''Abracadabra'''''  is an [[incantation]] used as a [[magic word]] in [[stage magic]] tricks, and historically was believed to have healing powers when inscribed on an [[amulet]]. The word is thought to have its origin in the [[Aramaic language]], in which ''abra'' (אברא) means &quot;to create&quot; and ''cadabra'' (כדברא) which means &quot;as I say&quot;,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} providing a translation of ''abracadabra'' as &quot;create as I say&quot;, thus its use in magic.

==History==
The first known mention of the word was in the second century AD in a book called ''Liber Medicinalis'' (sometimes known as  ''De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima'') by [[Serenus Sammonicus|Quintus Serenus Sammonicus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Vollmer&quot;&gt;Vollmer, Friedrich. ''Quinti Sereni Liber Medicinalis''. Leipzig: Teubner, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; [[physician]] to the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caracalla]], who prescribed that [[malaria]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704111704575354911834340450.html  The Tenacious Buzz of Malaria]&quot;. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. July 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html Bartleby]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2011|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

This, he explained, diminishes the hold over the patient of the spirit of the disease.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Other Roman emperors, including [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Alexander Severus]], were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vollmer&quot; /&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

It was used as a [[magical formula]] by the [[Gnostic]]s of the sect of [[Basilides]] in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']].&lt;/ref&gt; It is found on [[Abraxas stones]] which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.

The Puritan minister [[Increase Mather]] dismissed the word as bereft of power.  But [[Aleister Crowley]] regarded it as possessing great power; he said its true form is [[abrahadabra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

The word is now commonly used as an [[incantation]] by stage magicians. It is also applied [[contempt]]uously to a conception or hypothesis which purports to be a simple solution of apparently insoluble phenomena.

== In popular culture ==

In the [[Nintendo]]/[[GameFreak]] video game franchise &quot;[[Pokémon]]&quot;, there are three creatures named [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam]] (the third of which is also an alleged magic word used by stage magicians).

The expression &quot;avada kedavra&quot; is used as lethal spell known as the [[Killing Curse]] in the &quot;[[Harry Potter]]&quot; novel series. During an audience interview at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 April 2004, series author [[J. K. Rowling]] had this to say about the fictional Killing Curse's etymology: &quot;Does anyone know where avada kedavra came from? It is an ancient spell in Aramaic, and it is the original of abracadabra, which means 'let the thing be destroyed.' Originally, it was used to cure illness and the 'thing' was the illness, but I decided to make it the 'thing' as in the person standing in front of me. I take a lot of liberties with things like that. I twist them round and make them mine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80 |title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival |work=J.K.Rowling Official Site |author=[[J.

{{UKFormation}}
The '''Acts of Union''' were two [[Act of Parliament|Parliamentary Acts]] passed in 1706 by the [[Parliament of England]], and in 1707 by the [[Parliament of Scotland]], which put into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. The Acts joined the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (previously separate [[sovereign state|state]]s, with separate legislatures but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]) into a single, united kingdom named &quot;[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Article I of the Treaty of Union&lt;/ref&gt;

The two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]) . There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments behind them, albeit for rather different reasons.

The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707.  On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]], the home of the English Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]],  Article 3&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, historian [[Simon Schama]] said &quot;What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 2001-05-22 |number=10 |minutes=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
=== Previous attempts at union ===
England and Scotland were separate states for several centuries before eventual union, and English attempts to take over Scotland by military force in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were ultimately unsuccessful (see the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]]). The first attempts at Union surrounded the foreseen unification{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} of the Royal lines of Scotland and England. In pursuing the English throne in the 1560s, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] pledged herself to a peaceful union between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/historic/actsofunion/panel2.php ABDN.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

England and Scotland were ruled by the same king for the first time in 1603 when James VI of Scotland also became the king of England. However they remained two separate states until 1 May 1707.

====Early Stuart union====
[[File:Union flag 1606 (Kings Colors).svg|thumb|The first [[Union flag]], created by James VI and I, symbolising the uniting of England and Scotland under one Crown]]
The first attempt to unite the parliaments of England and Scotland was by Mary's son, [[James I of England|King James VI and I]]. On his accession to the English throne in 1603 King James announced his intention to unite his two realms so that he would not be &quot;guilty of bigamy&quot;. James used his [[Royal Prerogative (United Kingdom)|Royal prerogative]] powers to take the style of 'King of Great Britain'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Larkin |editor-first= |editor2-last=Hughes |editor2-first= |title=Stuart Royal Proclamations: Volume I |location= |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1973 |page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to give an explicitly British character to his court and person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=R. |last=Lockyer |title=James VI and I |location=London |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman |year=1998 |pages=51–52 |isbn=0-582-27962-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst James assumed the creation of a full union was a foregone conclusion, the [[Parliament of England]] was concerned that the formation of a new state would deprive England of its ancient liberties, taking on the more [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] monarchical structure which James had previously enjoyed in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, ''op. cit.'', pp. 54–59&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, James declared that Great Britain be viewed 'as presently united, and as one realm and kingdom, and the subjects of both realms as one people'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_01_dream.html Parliament.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish and English parliaments established a commission to negotiate a union, formulating an instrument of union between the two countries. A latent unpopularity of the union remained, however, and when James dropped his policy of a speedy union the topic quietly disappeared from the legislative agenda. When the House of Commons attempted to revive the proposal in 1610, it was met with a more open hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, ''op. cit.'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

====Union during the interregnum====
[[File:Flag of The Commonwealth.svg|thumb|Flag of the Commonwealth (1651–58) showing the 'perfected' union between England and Scotland]]
The [[Solemn League and Covenant]] 1643 sought a forced union of the [[Church of England]] into the [[Church of Scotland]], and although the covenant referred repeatedly to union between the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a political union was not spelled out.

In the aftermath of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], in which the [[Covenanter]]s had fought for the King, [[Oliver Cromwell]] conquered Scotland and began a process of creating a 'Godly Britannic' Union between the former Kingdoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html Parliament.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1651, the Parliament of England issued the [[Tender of Union]] declaration supporting Scotland's incorporation into the Commonwealth and sent Commissioners to Scotland with the express purpose of securing support for Union, which was assented to by the Commissioners (Members of Parliament) in Scotland. On 12 April 1654, Cromwell – styling himself [[Lord Protector]] of England, Scotland and Ireland – enacted ''An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland'' which created 'one Commonwealth and under one Government' to be known as the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur098.htm Constitution.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance was ratified by the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]], as an [[Tender of Union|Act of Union]], on 26 June 1657.&lt;ref&gt;The 1657 Act's long title was ''An Act and Declaration touching several Acts and Ordinances made since the 20th April, 1653, and before the 3rd September, 1654, and other Acts''&lt;/ref&gt; One united Parliament sat in Westminster, with 30 representatives from Scotland and 30 from Ireland joining the existing members from England. Whilst free trade was brought about amongst the new Commonwealth, the economic benefits were generally not felt as a result of heavy taxation used to fund Cromwell's [[New Model Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;

This republican union was dissolved automatically with the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] to the thrones of England and Scotland.  Scottish members expelled from the Commonwealth [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] petitioned unsuccessfully for a continuance of the union. Cromwell's union had simultaneously raised interest in and suspicion of the concept of union and when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] attempted to recreate the union and fulfil the work of his grandfather in 1669, negotiations between Commissioners ground to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;C. Whatley, ''op. cit.'', p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later attempts====

An abortive scheme for union occurred in Scotland in 1670.&lt;ref&gt;C. Whatley, ''op. cit.'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1689, the records of the Parliament of Scotland show much discussion of possible union. [[William and Mary]], whilst supportive of the idea, had no interest in allowing it to delay their enthronement. Impetus for this incorporating union came almost entirely from the direction of Scotland. In the 1690s, however, the economic position of Scotland worsened and the relations between Scotland and England became strained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=C. |last=Whatley |title=The Scots and the Union |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2006 |page=91 |isbn=0-7486-1685-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, however, union became a significant matter on the political agenda.

===Passage of Acts of 1707===
Both countries appointed commissioners to handle negotiations. Scotland had 31 commissioners, mainly picked by the [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry]] and the [[Duke of Argyll]]. Most favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials. At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]], the [[Earl of Seafield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioners&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html The commissioners], UK Parliament website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commissioners were businessmen and bankers, including two directors of the [[Bank of Scotland]], and a director of the [[Company of Scotland]], and local leaders such as Sir [[James Smollet]] (Dumbarton), and Sir [[Patrick Johnston]], the [[provost of Edinburgh]]. The Scottish Parliament was also well-represented.&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioners&quot;/&gt;

There were an equivalent number of English commissioners, including government ministers and officers of state, such as [[Lord Godolphin]], and the two secretaries of state, Sir [[Charles Hedges]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], and a large number of [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] who supported union. [[Tories]] were not in favour of union and were not represented on the commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioners&quot;/&gt;

Negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners began in April 1706 at the Cockpit, a government building in London. The sessions opened with speeches from [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|William Cowper]], the [[English Lord Keeper]], and [[James Ogilvy, 1st Earl of Seafield|Lord Seafield]], the [[Scottish Lord Chancellor]], each describing the significance of the task. Each side had its own particular concerns. Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the Hanoverian royal dynasty would succeed [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to the Scottish crown, and the Scots received some much-desired access to English colonial markets, which would help to strengthen their economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;negotiations&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html The course of negotiations], UK Parliament website.&lt;/ref&gt;

After negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments. In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] were members of the [[Court Party]], meaning that they supported the Queen and union. For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], led by the [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[Duke of Roxburghe]]. Opponents of the court were generally known as the [[Country party]], and included various factions and individuals such as the [[Duke of Hamilton]], [[Lord Belhaven]] and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]], who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union. The Court party had greater party discipline and thus gained a steady majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html Ratification] UK parliament website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry]] was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action. In April 1707, he travelled to London in order to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From [[Barnet]], the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at [[Kensington Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html 1 May 1707 - the Union comes into effect], UK Parliament website, accessed 1/11/10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political motivations==
[[Image:QueenAnne1702.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Queen Anne in 1702, the year she became queen, from the school of [[John Closterman]]]]
=== English perspective ===
The English purpose of it was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne. The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England. The English succession was provided for by the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the [[House of Hanover]].  Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scots could choose their own successor to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]: the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704]] explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch.

=== Scottish perspective ===
In Scotland, it was claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the [[Darien scheme]] through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the [[Alien Act 1705|Alien Act]] to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=C. A. |last=Whatley |title=Bought and sold for English Gold? Explaining the Union of 1707 |location=East Linton |publisher=Tuckwell Press |year=2001 |page=48 |isbn=1-86232-140-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate securing of the treaty in the [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] is attributed by some {{Who|date=August 2010}} to the weakness and lack of cohesion between the various opposition groups in the House, rather than to the strength of pro-incorporationists{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The combined votes of the Court party with a majority of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]] were sufficient to ensure the final passage of the treaty through the House.

Personal financial interests were also allegedly involved.  Many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien Scheme and they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses; Article 15, the Equivalent granted [[Pound sterling|£]]398,085 10[[Shilling|s]] sterling to Scotland to offset future liability towards the English national debt. In essence, it was also used as a means of compensation for investors in the [[Darien Scheme]].

Even more direct bribery was also said to be a factor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/09_bribery.html Parliament.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; £20,000 (£240,000 [[Pound Scots|Scots]]) was dispatched to Scotland for distribution by the [[Earl of Glasgow]]. [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry]], the [[Queen's Commissioner in Parliament]], received £12,325, the majority of the funding. (Some contend that all of this money was properly accounted for as compensation for loss of office, pensions and so forth not outwith the usual run of government.  It is perhaps a debate that will never be set to rest. However, modern research has shown that payments were made to supporters of union that appear not to have been overdue salaries. At least four payments were made to people who were not even members of the Scottish Parliament.) [[Robert Burns]] referred to this:

:We were bought and sold for English Gold,
:Sic a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.

Some of the money was used to hire [[espionage|spies]], such as [[Daniel Defoe]]; his first reports were of vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. &quot;A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind,&quot; he reported, &quot;for every Scot in favour there is 99 against&quot;. Years later [[John Clerk of Penicuik]], originally a leading [[Unionism (Scotland)|Unionist]], wrote in his memoirs that,

:(Defoe) was a spy among us, but not known as such, otherwise the Mob of Edinburgh would pull him to pieces.

Defoe recalls that he was hired by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]].

The Treaty could be considered unpopular in Scotland: [[George Lockhart|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], the only member of the Scottish negotiating team against union, noted that &quot;The whole nation appears against the Union&quot; and even [[John Clerk of Penicuik|Sir John Clerk of Penicuik]], an ardent pro-unionist and Union negotiator, observed that the treaty was &quot;contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom&quot;. Public opinion against the Treaty as it passed through the Scottish Parliament was voiced through [[petition]]s from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes. The [[Convention of Royal Burghs]] also petitioned against the Union and not one petition in favour of an incorporating union was received by Parliament. On the day the treaty was signed, the [[carillon]]er in [[St Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune ''Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?''&lt;ref&gt;Notes by [[John Purser]] to CD ''Scotland's Music'', [http://www.electricscotland.com/familytree/magazine/augsep2003/edinburgh.htm Facts about Edinburgh].&lt;/ref&gt; There were also massive protests in [[Edinburgh]] and several other Scottish [[burgh]]s on the day it was passed by Parliament,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} as threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing [[martial law]].

=== Irish perspective ===
[[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], the third of the &quot;sister kingdoms&quot;, was not included in the union. It remained a separate kingdom and indeed was legally subordinate to Great Britain until 1784.

Ireland's benefits from the Union of 1707 were few. Its preferential status in trade with England now extended to Scotland. However, Ireland was left unequal and unrepresented in the Parliament of Great Britain.

In July 1707 each House of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed a congratulatory address to Queen Anne, praying that &quot;May God put it in your royal heart to add greater strength and lustre to your crown, by a still more comprehensive Union&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Journals of the Irish Commons, vol. iii. p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;  The British government did not respond to the invitation and an equal union between Great Britain and Ireland was out of consideration until the 1790s.  The [[Acts of Union 1800|union with Ireland]] finally came about on 1 January 1801.

== Provisions of the Acts ==

{{Main|Treaty of Union}}
The [[Treaty of Union]], agreed between representatives of the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706. In order to minimise the opposition of the [[Church of Scotland]], an Act was also passed to secure the [[Presbyterian]] establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy.  The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riley&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first=P. J. W. |last=Riley |title=The Union of 1707 as an Episode in English Politics |journal=The English Historical Review |volume=84 |issue=332 |year=1969 |pages=498–527 [pp. 523–524] |doi= |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/562482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send [[Scottish representative peers|representative peers]] from the [[Peerage of Scotland]] to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. It guaranteed that the [[Church of Scotland]] would remain the [[established church]] in Scotland, that the [[Court of Session]] would &quot;remain in all time coming within Scotland&quot;, and that [[Scots law]] would &quot;remain in the same force as before&quot;.  Other provisions included the restatement of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the ban on [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] from taking the throne. It also created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]].

The Act provided that any &quot;laws and statutes&quot; that were &quot;contrary to or inconsistent with the terms&quot; of the Act would &quot;cease and become void.&quot;

Soon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40 (later [[wiktionary:infelicitously|infelicitously]] named the &quot;Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707&quot;) united the English and Scottish [[Privy Council]]s and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration.  In effect it took the day to day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the [[College of Justice]].

== Criticisms ==
The English and Scottish parliaments had evolved along different lines, and for example the former Parliament of Scotland was [[unicameral]], not [[bicameral]]. Most of the pre-Union traditions of Westminster continued unchanged by becoming the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Defoe drew upon his Scottish experience to write his ''[[Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Britain]]'', published in 1726, where he actually admitted that the increase of trade and [[population in Scotland]], which he had predicted as a consequence of the Union, was &quot;not the case, but rather the contrary.&quot;

[[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]], a vehement critic of the Union, said in ''An Account of a Conversation'', that Scotland suffered &quot;... the miserable and languishing condition of all places that depend upon a ''remote seat of government''.&quot;

However by the time [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] made their tour in 1773, recorded in ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]'' Johnson noted that Scotland was: “a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing”, and [[Glasgow]] in particular had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.

== A new Scottish Parliament ==
In 1999, after almost three centuries, a [[devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish Parliament]] was opened after a [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|referendum]] in [[Scotland]]. The opening of the new parliament was presided over by [[Winnie Ewing|Winifred Ewing]] MSP, [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] regional list member for the [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Highlands and Islands]], in her role as the oldest member and ''de facto'' [[Mother of the House]], being first to take the parliamentary oath to Her Majesty the Queen. During the opening address which she delivered, she concluded with the words ''&quot;the Scottish Parliament, adjourned on the 25th of March in the year 1707 is hereby reconvened.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/may/13/uk.politicalnews5 Guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotsman.com/scotland/The-Scottish-parliament-adjourned-on.2570106.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

As a devolved institution, the new Scottish Parliament does not affect the powers and authority of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to make laws for Scotland, which remains a [[countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland Act 1998, s.28(7)&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst it has power to make laws in Scotland – in addition to the UK Parliament – over many [[home affairs]] issues, there are other [[reserved powers]] such as defence and foreign affairs over which it has no power.

== 300th anniversary ==

[[Image:2007£2union.jpg|thumb|The £2 coin issued in the United Kingdom in 2007 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Acts of Union]]

A commemorative [[two-pound coin]] was issued to mark the [[tercentennial]]—300th anniversary—of the Union, which occurred two days before the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|Scottish Parliament general election]] on 3 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-11-06a.79.0 House of Lords - Written answers], 6 November 2006, TheyWorkForYou.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]], an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the [[National Museums of Scotland]] and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the [[National Galleries of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Announced by the Scottish Culture Minister, Patricia Ferguson, 9 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
