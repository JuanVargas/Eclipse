{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon''' is a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].  It was first published in March 1830 by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] as ''The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=title page}}. In 1982, in an effort to clarify and emphasize its purpose, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) retitled its editions of the book to ''The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ'' {{harvtxt|LDS Church|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smith's account, and also according to the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as &quot;[[reformed Egyptian]]&quot; &lt;ref&gt;([http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.32?lang=eng#31 Mormon 9:32 -- LDS edition])&lt;/ref&gt; engraved on [[golden plates]]. Smith said that he received these plates in 1827 from an [[Angel Moroni|angel named Moroni]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|pp=11, 18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whom Smith identified as a [[resurrection#Mormonism|resurrected]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838|pp=42–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] who had written and abridged parts of the book over a millennium prior to the encounter. According to Smith, [[Moroni (Book of Mormon)|Moroni]] had buried the plates in a stone box, along with other ancient artifacts,&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Sword of Laban]], [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]]&lt;/ref&gt; in a hill near Smith's home in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]], [[New York]].

The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the defining publications of the Latter Day Saint movement.  The churches of the movement typically regard the Book of Mormon not only as scripture, but as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the [[Americas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng &quot;Introduction&quot;], Book of Mormon (1981 LDS Church ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; written by American [[prophet]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6730 &quot;Praise to the Man&quot;], 1979-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt; from perhaps as early as 2600 BC to about AD 421.&lt;ref&gt;[[Church Educational System]] (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp ''Book of Mormon Student Manual''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after the individuals named as primary authors and, in most versions, divided into chapters and verses.  It is written in English, very similar to the [[Early Modern English]] linguistic style of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible, and has since been fully or partially translated into 108 languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Brochures/King_James_Bible_and_the_Book_of_Mormon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]],&lt;ref&gt;See for [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/2 example]&lt;/ref&gt; the nature of the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]],&lt;ref&gt;See for [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/9 example]&lt;/ref&gt; [[eschatology]], redemption from physical and spiritual death,&lt;ref&gt;See for [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/12 example]&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|latter-day church]].

==Origin==
{{Main|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Golden plates|Criticism of the Book of Mormon}}

[[File:Basic BOM Manuscripts.jpg|thumb|A page from the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, covering {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|4|38}}{{lds|-|1_ne|5|14}}]]
Joseph Smith Jr. said that when he was seventeen &lt;!-- do not edit age, JS was 17 at time of Moroni visit, see refs for clarification --&gt;years of age an angel of God, named [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]], appeared to him,&lt;ref name=&quot;lds.org&quot;&gt;“The Life and Ministry of Joseph Smith,” Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith, (2007),xxii–25 [http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=da135f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=724720596a845110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1&amp;contentLocale=0]&lt;/ref&gt; and said that a collection of ancient writings, engraved on [[golden plates]] by ancient prophets, was buried in a [[Cumorah|nearby hill]] in [[Wayne County, New York]]. The writings described a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western Hemisphere 600 years before Jesus’ birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days.  Smith stated that he was instructed by Moroni to meet at the hill annually each September 22 to receive further instructions and that four years after the initial visit, in 1827, he was allowed to take the plates and was directed to translate them into English.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1/59#59 ''Pearl Of Great Price,'' Joseph SMith - History 1:59]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's first published description of the plates said the plates &quot;had the appearance of gold,&quot; and were described by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], one of Smith's early scribes, to be &quot;fastened together in the shape of a book by wires.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith called the engraved writing on the plates &quot;[[reformed Egyptian]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Only LDS linguists accept the existence of any language or character set known as &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; as described in LDS tradition.  The only example of reformed Egyptian extant is the &quot;Caractors Document&quot;, also known as the &quot;Anthon Transcript&quot;, a paper written by Smith with examples of what he claimed to be &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; characters.  See [[Reformed Egyptian]] for details and references.&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the text on the plates was also &quot;[[Golden_plates#.22Sealed.22_portion|sealed]]&quot; according to his account, so its content was not included in the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1842|p=707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others signed [[affidavits]] that they saw and handled the golden plates for themselves. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/thrwtnss Testimony of Three Witnesses]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/eghtwtns Testimony of Eight Witnesses]&lt;/ref&gt; These affidavits are published as part of the introductory pages to the Book of Mormon.

Smith enlisted the help of his neighbor, Martin Harris (one of the Three Witnesses), who later mortgaged his farm to underwrite the printing of the Book of Mormon, as a scribe during his initial work on the text. In 1828, Harris, prompted by his wife, [[Lucy Harris]], repeatedly requested that Smith lend him the current pages that had been translated. Smith reluctantly relented to Harris' requests. Lucy Harris is thought to have stolen the [[Lost 116 pages|first 116 pages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy Harris&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=163}}, {{Harvnb|Givens|2002|pp=33}}, {{Harvnb|Givens|2002|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the loss, Smith recorded that he had lost the ability to translate, and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'', [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 3|Section 3]] and&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin translating another part of the plates.  In 1829, with the assistance of [[Oliver Cowdery]], work on the Book of Mormon recommenced, and was completed in a remarkably short period (April–June 1829).&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]] (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 70.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith said that he then returned the plates to Moroni upon the publication of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/jstestimony Testimony of Joseph Smith] {{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Mormon went on sale at the bookstore of E.

For some followers of the Latter Day Saint movement, unresolved issues of the book's [[Historical Authenticity of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity]] and the lack of conclusive [[Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|archaeological]] evidence have led them to adopt a compromise position that the Book of Mormon may be the creation of Smith, but that it was nevertheless created through divine inspiration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Grant H.

''New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology''. Salt Lake City: Signature Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The official position of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), and that of most members of the Latter Day Saint movement, is that the book is a literal historical record.&lt;ref name = historicallyaccurate/&gt;

Smith stated that the title page, and presumably the actual title of the 1830 edition, came from the translation of &quot;the very last leaf&quot; of the golden plates, and was written by the prophet-historian [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith stated that the &quot;title page is not by any means a modern composition either of mine or of any other man's who has lived or does live in this generation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times and Seasons&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1842 |month=October |title=Truth Will Prevail |journal=Times and Seasons |volume=III |issue=24 |pages=943 |id= |url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n24.htm#943 |accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The title page states that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is &quot;to [show] unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers;...and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Mormon [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/ttlpg Title Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
The Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the [[First Book of Nephi]] (1 Nephi) and ending with the [[Book of Moroni]].

The book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the [[Words of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Ether]]. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]]. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. 1 Nephi through [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether).

Most modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses.  Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]] and the Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]], which are statements by men who said they saw the golden plates with Joseph Smith and could verify their existence.

===Chronology===
{{Main|Book of Mormon chronology}}
The books from 1 Nephi to Omni are described as being from &quot;the small plates of Nephi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/w_of_m/1/3#3 ''Book Of Mormon,'' Words Of Mormon 1:3]&lt;/ref&gt;  This account begins in ancient [[Jerusalem]] around 600 BC.  It tells the story of a man named [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], his family, and several others as they are led by [[God]] from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the [[Babylonians]] in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the [[Arabian peninsula]], and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/18/23#23 1 Nephi 18:23]&lt;/ref&gt; These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s, that frequently warred with each other.

Following this section is the Words of Mormon. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]], is a short introduction to the books of Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, 3 Nephi, and 4 Nephi.&lt;ref name=&quot;scriptures.lds.org&quot;&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/explanation ''Book Of Mormon,'' A BRIEF EXPLANATION ABOUT THE BOOK OF MORMON]&lt;/ref&gt; These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called &quot;the large plates of Nephi&quot; that detailed the people's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life.  The book of 3 Nephi is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the [[Americas]] sometime after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the [[Gospels]] of the [[Bible]] and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.

The book of Mormon is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough.  The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon is eventually killed in battle after having handed down the records to his son Moroni.

According to the text, Moroni then made an abridgment (called the Book of Ether) of a record from a previous people called the [[Jaredites]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scriptures.lds.org&quot;/&gt; The account describes a group of families led from the [[Tower of Babel]] &lt;ref&gt;http://scriptures.lds.org/en/ether/1 See verse 3&lt;/ref&gt; to the Americas, headed by a man named [[Jared (Book of Mormon)|Jared]] and [[The Brother of Jared|his brother]]. The [[Jaredite]] civilization is presented as existing on the American continent beginning about 2500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands. by Joseph L. Allen Published: October 2003 p.8&lt;/ref&gt; - long before Lehi's family arrived in 600 BC - and as being much larger and more developed. The dating in the text is only an approximation.

The [[Book of Moroni]] then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the [[idolatry|idolatrous]] state of the remaining society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moro/contents/summary ''Book Of Mormon,'' Book of Moroni Chapter Summaries]&lt;/ref&gt; It mentions a few spiritual insights and some important doctrinal teachings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moro/10 ''Book of Mormon,'' Moroni Ch. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; then closes with Moroni's [[testimony]] and an invitation to [[prayer|pray]] to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moro/10/4#4 Book Of Mormon, Moroni 10:4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrinal and philosophical teachings===
[[File:The Hill Cumorah by C.C.A. Christensen.jpeg|325px|left|thumb|A depiction of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]]'s description of receiving the golden plates from the [[angel Moroni]] at the Hill Cumorah.]]
The Book of Mormon contains doctrinal and philosophical teachings on a wide range of topics, from basic themes of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] to political and ideological teachings.

====Jesus====
Stated on the title page, The Book of Mormon's central purpose is for the &quot;convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=Title Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book describes Jesus, prior to his birth, as a spirit &quot;without flesh and blood&quot;, although with a spirit &quot;body&quot; that looked similar to how Jesus would appear during his physical life.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Ether|ether|3|16&quot;&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|3|16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is described as &quot;the Father and the Son&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|3|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to be:
:&quot;God himself [who] shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people...[b]eing the Father and the Son — the Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son — and they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|15|1|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other parts of the book portray the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as &quot;one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|19|22|23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beliefs among the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement encompass [[nontrinitarian]]ism (in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]) to [[Trinitarianism]] (particularly among the [[Community of Christ]]). See [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)]].

In furtherance of its theme of reconciling Jews and Gentiles to Jesus, the book describes a variety of visions or visitations to some of the early inhabitants in the Americas involving Jesus. Most notable among these is a described visit of Jesus to a group of early inhabitants shortly after his [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|11}} to {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the book's narrators described other visions of Jesus, including one by [[Brother of Jared|a narrator]]  who, according to the book, lived thousands of years before Jesus, but who saw the &quot;body&quot; of Jesus' spirit thousands of years prior to his birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Ether|ether|3|16&quot;/&gt; In another vision, according to the book, a [[Nephi|different narrator]] described a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a prophecy of Jesus' name,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|3|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus' birth.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|10|4}}, {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|19|8}}; See also {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative, at the time of [[King Benjamin]] (about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called &quot;the children of Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|5|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of [[Captain Moroni]] (73 BC) were called &quot;Christians&quot; by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|46|13|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|4 Nephi|1|22-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|4 Nephi|4_ne|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the prophet [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] worked to convince the faithless people of his time (A.D. 360) of Christ.  The prophet [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]] is said to have buried the [[Golden Plates|plates]] with faith in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|Book of Mormon Title page|bm/ttlpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other prophets in the book also wrote of the reality of the [[Messiah]].

Jesus spoke to the [[Jew]]s in [[Jerusalem]] of “other sheep” who would hear his voice,&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|John|john|10|16}} in the [[King James Version]] of the Bible&lt;/ref&gt; which the Book of Mormon claims meant that the Nephites and other remnants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|lost tribes]] of [[Israel]] throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|15|13|24}}, {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|16|1|4}}, {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|29|7|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other distinctive religious teachings====
On most religious issues, Book of Mormon doctrines are similar to those found in the Bible and among other Christian denominations.  Among its distinctive theological interpretations are the following:
* The Old Testament prophet Isaiah spoke of prophets who would &quot;whisper out of the dust.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 29:4&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Mormon interprets this as a reference to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|26|15|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Book of Mormon describes the [[Fall of Man]] as a prerequisite for procreation, and a necessary requirement for the return to God.  &quot;Adam fell that men might be, and men are, that they might have joy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|2|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teachings about political theology====
The book delves into [[political theology]] within a Christian or Jewish context. Among these themes are [[American exceptionalism]].  According to the book, the Americas are portrayed as a &quot;land of promise&quot;, the world's most exceptional land&lt;!--

On the issue of war and violence, the book teaches that war is justified for people to &quot;defend themselves against their enemies&quot;. However they were never to &quot;give an offense,&quot; or to &quot;raise their sword...except it were to preserve their lives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|48|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book praises the faith of [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|a group]] of former warriors who took an oath of complete [[pacifism]], refusing to take arms even to defend themselves and their people.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Alma|alma|24&quot;&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 2,000 of their descendants, who had not taken the oath of their parents not to take up arms against their enemies, chose to go to battle against the Lamanites, and it states that in the battle the 2,000 men were protected by God and, though many were injured, none of them died.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|56|47-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book points out monarchy as an ideal form of government, but only when the monarch is righteous.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Alma|alma|24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|29|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book warns of the evil that occurs when the king is wicked and therefore suggests that it is not generally good to have a king.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosial|29|18-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book further records the decision of the people to  be ruled no longer by kings,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosial|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; choosing instead a form of democracy led by elected judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Helaman|hel|6|17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When citizens referred to as &quot;king-men&quot; attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|62|9|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of what appears to be a peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19&quot;&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book supports notions of economic justice, achieved through voluntary donation of &quot;substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|1|26|27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, all the citizens held their property in common&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19&quot;/&gt; Concern for the poor is portrayed as leading to collective wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Helaman|hel|6|17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when individuals within a society began to disdain and ignore the poor, to &quot;wear costly apparel,&quot; and otherwise engage in wickedness for personal gain, such societies are repeatedly portrayed in the book as being ripe for destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|13|13|14}}; {{lds|Alma|alma|4:6}}; {{lds|Alma|alma|5:53}}; {{lds|4 Nephi|4_ne|1|24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Book of Mormon is one of four sacred texts or standard works of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The other texts are the [[Bible]] (the [[King James Version]]), the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Russell M. Nelson]], [http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=663fa1615ac0c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “Living by Scriptural Guidance,”] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', November 2000, 16–18 (discusses how the four standard works of the church can provide guidance in life)&lt;/ref&gt; Church members officially regard the Book of Mormon as the &quot;most correct&quot; book of scripture, in that &quot;a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than any other book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith, [[B. H. Roberts]] ed. ''[[History of the Church]]'', 4:461; see also [http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=b10cd75ccbae7110VgnVCM100000176f620a____ Additional Information].&lt;/ref&gt; This is, in part, because church members believe the Bible was the result of a multiple-step translation process and the Book of Mormon was not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezra Taft Benson]], [http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=50db94bf3938b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “The Keystone of Our Religion,”] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', Jan 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Smith told of receiving a revelation condemning the &quot;whole church&quot; for treating the Book of Mormon and the former commandments lightly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/84/54-57#54 Doctrine and Covenants 84:54–57].&lt;/ref&gt; Every church president has stressed the importance of studying the Book of Mormon along with the church's other standard works.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The Book of Mormon’s significance to the LDS Church was reiterated in the 1980s by [[Ezra Taft Benson]], the thirteenth [[President of the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=56a6ef960417b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “The Book of Mormon—Keystone of Our Religion,”] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', Nov 1986, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2005 ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' message, Church President [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] challenged each member of the church to re-read the Book of Mormon before the year's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=e82b2ee01e31c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 |title=A Testimony Vibrant and True |accessdate=2008-03-07 |author=Gordon B.

The LDS Church encourages discovery of the book’s truth by following the suggestion in its final chapter to study, ponder, and pray to God concerning its veracity. This passage is referred to as ''Moroni's Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|3|5}}; see [[Gene R. Cook]], [http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=5941425e0848b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “Moroni’s Promise,”] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', April 1994, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community of Christ===
The [[Community of Christ]], formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, [[Herald House]]. The Authorized Edition is based on the original printer's manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or Kirtland Edition) of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 &quot;Revised Authorized Edition&quot; which attempts to modernize some of the language.

In 2001, Community of Christ President [[W. Grant McMurray]] reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: &quot;The proper use of The Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McMurray, W. Grant, [http://www.cofchrist.org/docs/NativeAmericanConference/keynote.asp &quot;They &quot;Shall Blossom as the Rose&quot;: Native Americans and the Dream of Zion,&quot;] an address delivered February 17, 2001, accessed on Community of Christ website, September 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference, President [[Stephen M. Veazey]] ruled out of order a resolution to &quot;reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record.&quot; He stated that &quot;while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. Shields, &quot;Official Minutes of Business Session, Wednesday March 28, 2007,&quot; in 2007 World Conference Thursday Bulletin, March 29, 2007. Community of Christ, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greater Latter Day Saint movement ===

There are a number of other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|churches]] that are part of the Latter Day Saint movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these churches were created as a result of issues ranging from differing doctrinal interpretations and acceptance of the movement's scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, to disagreements as to who was the divinely chosen successor to Joseph Smith. These groups all have in common the acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. It is this acceptance which distinguishes the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement from other Christian denominations. A number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement have published their own editions of the Book of Mormon, along with private individuals and foundations not endorsed by any specific denomination.

==Historical authenticity==
{{Main|Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon}}
{{See also|Criticism of the Book of Mormon|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Genetics and the Book of Mormon|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon anachronisms}}

The archaeological, historical and scientific communities have in general been skeptical about the claims of the Book of Mormon. Critics of such tend to focus on four main areas:

* The lack of correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and American archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, writes (in a 1973 volume of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought): &quot;As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing [the historicity of The Book of Mormon], and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

* References to animals, plants, metals and technologies in the Book of Mormon that archaeological or scientific studies have found no evidence of in post-Pleistocene, pre-Columbian America, frequently referred to as [[anachronisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecil H.

* The [[Genetics and the Book of Mormon|lack of DNA evidence]] linking any [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American group]] to the ancient [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;The traditional view of the Book of Mormon suggests that Native Americans are principally the descendents of an Israelite migration around 600 BC.  However, DNA evidence shows no Near Eastern component in the Native American genetic make-up.  For example:&lt;br /&gt;Simon G. Southerton.  2004.  ''Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church''.  Signature Books. The entire book is devoted to the specific topic of DNA evidence and the Book of Mormon.&quot; ...[T]he DNA lineages of Central America resemble those of other Native American tribes throughout the two continents.  Over 99 percent of the lineages found among native groups from this region are clearly of Asian descent.  Modern and ancient DNA samples tested from among the Maya generally fall into the major founding lineage classes...  The Mayan Empire has been regarded by Mormons to be the closest to the people of the Book of Mormon because its people were literate and culturally sophisticated.  However, leading New World anthropologists, including those specializing in the region, have found the Maya to be similarly related to Asians.  Stephen L. Whittington...was not aware of any scientists 'in mainstream anthropology that are trying to prove a Hebrew origin of Native Americans... Archaeologists and physical anthropologists have not found any evidence of Hebrew origins for the people of North, South and Central America.'&quot; (pg 191)&lt;br /&gt;D. Andrew Merriwether.  2006.  &quot;Mitochondrial DNA,&quot; ''Handbook of North American Indians''.  Smithsonian Institution Press.  Pg 817-830. &quot;Kolman, Sambuughin, and Bermingham (1995) and Merriwether et al. (1996) used the presence of A, B, C, and D to argue for Mongolia as the location for the source population of the New World founders.  More specifically perhaps, they argued that the present-day Mongolians and present-day Native Americans are both derived from the same ancestral population in Asia, presumably in the Mongolia-Southern Siberia-Lake Baikal region.  T.G. Schurr and S.G. Sherry (2004) strongly favor a southern Siberian origin for the majority of lineages found in the New World.&quot; (pg 829)&lt;br /&gt;Tatiana M. Karafet, Stephen L. Zegura, and Michael F. Hammer.  2006.  &quot;Y Chromosomes,&quot; ''Handbook of North American Indians''.  Smithsonian Institution.  Pp. 831-839.  &quot;Zegura et al. (2004) have presented the following scenario for the early peopling of the Americas based on Y chromosome data:  a migration of a single, polymorphic Asian population across Beringia with a potential common source for both North American founding lineages (Q and C) in the Altai Mountains of southwest Siberia.  Since all their STR-based SNP lineage divergence dates between the Altai and North Asians versus Native Americans...ranged from 10,100 to 17,200 year ago, they favored a relatively late entry model.&quot; (pg. 839)&lt;br /&gt;Defenders of the book's historical authenticity suggest that the Book of Mormon does not disallow for other groups of people to have contributed to the genetic make-up of Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Nevertheless, this is a departure from the traditional view that Israelites are the primary ancestors of Native Americans, and therefore would be expected to present some genetic evidence of Near Eastern origins. A recently announced change in the Book of Mormon's introduction, however, allows for a greater diversity of ancestry of Native Americans. See, for example, the following Deseret News article published on November 9, 2007: [http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695226049,00.html Intro Change in Book of Mormon Spurs Discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account.&lt;ref name = historicallyaccurate&gt;&quot;The limited success so far in swaying popular LDS opinion is a constant source of frustration for Mormon apologists...It appears that Mormons are generally content to picture the Book of Mormon story in a setting that is factually wrong.  For most Mormons, the limited geography models create more problems than they solve.  They run counter to the dominant literal interpretation of the text and contradict popular folklore as well as the clear pronouncements of all church presidents since the time of Joseph Smith&quot;, Simon G. Southerton (2004, Signature Books), ''Losing a Lost Tribe'', pp. 164-165.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Some of the [Community of Christ]'s senior leadership consider the Book of Mormon to be inspired historical fiction.  For leaders of the Utah church, this is still out of the question.  [The leadership], and most Mormons, believe that the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon is what shores up Joseph Smith's prophetic calling and the divine authenticity of the Utah church&quot;, Southerton (2004), pg. 201.&lt;br&gt;Quotations from temple dedicatory sermons and prayers in Central and South America by President Gordon B. Hinckley in 1999-2000 continually refer to Native LDS members in attendance as &quot;children of Lehi&quot; (Southerton [2004], pp. 38-39).&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are many [[Mormon apologetics|apologetic]] groups that seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by [[FARMS|Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), and [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] (FAIR), attempting to prove that the Book of Mormon is literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text.  One of the more common recent arguments is the [[limited geography model]], which conjectures that the people of the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either [[Mesoamerica]], [[South America]], or the [[Great Lakes]] area.

==Manuscripts==
The Book of Mormon was dictated by Joseph Smith to several [[scribe]]s over a period of nearly two years, resulting in an original [[manuscript]] that was eventually printed into the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, minus the first 116 pages of the [[Book of Lehi]], which were lost after Smith lent the uncopied manuscript to Martin Harris who gave them to his wife Lucy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy Harris&quot;/&gt;  These pages were never returned and are assumed to be lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy Harris&quot;/&gt; The original manuscript was then hand copied by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes into a manuscript for the printer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is at this point that initial [[copyediting]] of the Book of Mormon was completed. Observations of the original manuscript show little evidence of corrections to the text.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Lightplanet&quot;&gt;http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/book_of_mormon/manuscripts.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LindsayFAQ&quot;&gt;http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_changes.shtml#printed&lt;/ref&gt;
Critical comparisons between surviving portions of the manuscripts show an average of two to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LindsayFAQ&quot;/&gt;  The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

The printer's manuscript was not used fully in the [[typesetting]] of the 1830 version of Book of Mormon; portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt; The original manuscript was used by Joseph Smith to further correct errors printed in the 1830 and 1837 versions of the Book of Mormon for the 1840 printing of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt; In October 1841, the entire original manuscript was placed into the [[cornerstone]] of the [[Nauvoo House]], and sealed up until nearly forty years later when the cornerstone was reopened.  It was then discovered that much of the original manuscript had been destroyed by water seepage and mold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lightplanet&quot;/&gt; Surviving manuscript pages were handed out to various families and individuals in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lightplanet&quot;/&gt; A total of only 28% of the original manuscript now survives, including a remarkable find of fragments from 58 pages in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt; The majority of what remains of the original manuscript is now kept in the [[LDS Church Archives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;  The printer's manuscript is now the earliest complete surviving copy of the Book of Mormon, being nearly 100% extant;&lt;ref&gt;There are three lines missing from the printer's manuscript in its current condition, covering 1 Nephi 1:7—8, 20. http://mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=15&amp;num=1&amp;id=401&lt;/ref&gt; it is owned by the [[Community of Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

==Editions==
=== Chapter and verse notation systems ===
The original 1830 publication did not have chapter and verse markers. Just as the Bible's chapter and verse notation system is a later addition of Bible publishers to books that were originally solid blocks of undivided text, the chapters and verse markers within the books of the Book of Mormon are mere conventions, not part of the original text.

Different publishers from different factions of the Latter Day Saint movement have published different competing chapter and verse notation systems. The two most significant are the LDS system, introduced in 1879, and the RLDS system, which is based on the original 1830 chapter divisions.&lt;ref&gt;The Zarahemla Research Foundation publishes a 48 page booklet titled, &quot;Book of Mormon Chapter &amp; Verse: RLDS-LDS Conversion Table&quot; to enable readers of an LDS edition to find references from an RLDS edition and visa versa.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RLDS 1908 Edition, RLDS 1966 Edition, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) Edition and Restored Covenant Editions use the RLDS system while most other current editions use the LDS system.

===Textual criticism===

In 1989, scholars at [[Brigham Young University]] began work on a critical text edition of the Book of Mormon. Volumes 1 and 2, published in 2001, contain transcriptions of all the text variants of the English editions of the Book of Mormon, from the original manuscript to the newest editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skousen|May 2001}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|January 2001}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 4, which is being published in parts, is a critical analysis of all the text variants. Volume 3, which is not yet published, will describe the history of all the English-language texts from Joseph Smith to today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skousen|2004}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|2005}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

In 2001, the LDS church reported that all or part of the Book of Mormon was available in the native language of 99% of [[Latter-day Saints]] and 87% of the world's total population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=2db2759235d0c010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 &quot;Taking the Scriptures to the World&quot;], ''Ensign'', July 2001, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations into languages without a tradition of writing (e.g., [[Kakchiqel language|Kakchiqel]], [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]]) are available on audio cassette.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldscatalog.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10151&amp;catalogId=10151&amp;langId=-1 Welcome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Translations into [[American Sign Language]] are available on videocassette and DVD.

Typically, translators are members of the LDS Church who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed many times before it is approved and published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=bd145ef93e84b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 &quot;Translation Work Taking Book of Mormon to More People in More Tongues,&quot;] Ensign, February 2005,  75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the LDS Church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon, and instead announced that each new translation it approves will be a full edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.cb5725b59dcb4a2b2c5e2ba6942826a0/?vgnextoid=7cecc8fe9c88d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=93c29150dfcad010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____ &quot;Translation Work Taking Book of Mormon to More People in More Tongues&quot;], 6 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], which distributes free copies of the Book of Mormon, reported in 2011 that 150 million copies of the book have been distributed since its initial publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/60797/150-Million-and-Counting-The-Book-of-Mormon-reaches-another-milestone.html &quot;150 Million and Counting: The Book of Mormon reaches another milestone&quot;], ''[[Church News]]'', 2011-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial printing of the Book of Mormon in 1830 produced 5000 copies.&lt;ref name = 150million&gt;[http://lds.org/church/news/book-of-mormon-reaches-150-million-copies?lang=eng &quot;Book of Mormon Reaches 150 Million Copies&quot;], lds.org, 2011-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The 50 millionth copy was printed in 1990, with the 100 millionth following in 2000.&lt;ref name =150million/&gt;

'''Baptists''' are individuals who comprise [[Christian denomination]]s and churches subscribing to a [[theology]] of [[believer's baptism]] (as opposed to [[infant baptism]]), salvation through [[Sola fide|faith alone]], [[Sola scriptura|Scripture alone]] as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local church. They practice baptism by [[Immersion baptism|immersion]] (as opposed to [[affusion]] or sprinkling). Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, [[pastor]]s and [[deacon]]s. Baptist churches are widely considered to be [[Protestantism|Protestants]], though some Baptists disavow this identity.

Diverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward other Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shurden turning&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=Shurden, Walter |title=Turning Points in Baptist History |publisher=The Center for Baptist Studies, Mercer University|location= Macon, GA |year=2001 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |url=http://www.centerforbaptiststudies.org/pamphlets/style/turningpoints.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians trace the earliest Baptist church back to 1609 in [[Amsterdam]], with [[English Dissenters|English Separatist]] [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] as its pastor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley&quot; /&gt; In accordance with his reading of the [[New Testament]], he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot; /&gt; Baptist practice spread to England. Here, the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect.  In 1639, Roger Williams established the [[first Baptist church in America|first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies]].  In the mid-18th century, the [[First Great Awakening]] increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBOself&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52364/Baptist Baptist].&quot;  2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Great Awakening]] in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for [[abolition]] and [[manumission]] of [[slavery]], which had been part of the 18th-century teachings. Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot; /&gt;

The term ''Baptist'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|βαπτιστής}} (''baptistés,'' &quot;baptist,&quot; also used to describe [[John the Baptist]]), which is related to the verb {{lang|grc|βαπτίζω}} (''baptízo,'' &quot;to baptize, wash, dip, immerse&quot;), and the [[Latin]] ''baptista''.

The term ''Baptist'' as applied to Baptist churches is a modification of the term [[Anabaptist]] (which means rebaptizer),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Newman |first=Albert Henry |title = A History of the Baptist Churches in the United States |url=http://books.google.com/?id=wCrmT5eki7YC |year=1894 |publisher=Christian Literature |quote= This rejection of infant baptism and this insistence on believers’ baptism were so distinctive of these Christians that they were stigmatized as ‘Anabaptists’, ‘Catabaptists’, and sometimes as simply ‘Baptists’; that is to say, they were declared to be ‘rebaptizers’, ‘perverters of baptism’, or, as unduly magnifying baptism and making it the occasion of [[Schism (religion)|schism]], simply ‘baptizers’. |isbn= 079054234X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used into the 19th century as a general epithet for churches which denied the validity of infant baptism, including the [[Campbellite]]s, [[Mennonite]]s and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] or [[German Baptist]]s, who are not identified with modern day Baptists.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Illustrated Book of All Religions From the Earliest Ages to the Present Time&quot;, Star Publishing Company, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; The English Anabaptists were called Baptists as early as 1569.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Christian |first=John T | title= A History of the Baptists|url= http://www.reformedreader.org/history/christian/ahob1/ahobp.htm | publisher = Broadman Press | year = 1922 | chapter = 15 | pages = 205–6 | quote = The word Baptists was used by a high official of the English government in the earlier days of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.

== Origins ==
{{cleanup|section|date=January 2011}}
Baptist Historian Bruce Gourley outlines four main views of Baptist origins: (1)&amp;nbsp;The modern scholarly consensus that the denomination traces its origin to the 17th century via the [[English Dissenters|English Separatists]], (2)&amp;nbsp;the view that it was an outgrowth of Anabaptist traditions, (3)&amp;nbsp;the perpetuity view which assumes that the Baptist faith and practice has existed since the time of Christ, and (4)&amp;nbsp;the successionist view which argues that Baptist churches actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley&quot;&gt;Gourley, Bruce. &quot;A Very Brief Introduction to Baptist History, Then and Now.&quot; ''The Baptist Observer.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English separatist view ===

The predominant view of Baptist origins is that Baptists came along in historical development in the century after the rise of the original Protestant denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brackney&quot; /&gt; This view of Baptist origins has the most historical support and is the most widely accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley&quot; /&gt; Representative writers include William H. Whitsitt, Robert G. Torbet, Winthrop S. Hudson, William G. McLoughlin and Robert A. Baker. This position considers the influence of Anabaptists upon early Baptists to be minimal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley&quot; /&gt;  It was a time of considerable political and religious turmoil. Both individuals and churches were willing to give up their theological roots if they became convinced that a more biblical &quot;truth&quot; had been discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonard&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Leonard, Bill J. |title=Baptist Ways: A History |publisher=Judson Press |year= 2003 |isbn=978-0817012311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baptist faith originated from within the [[English Dissenters|English Separatist]] movement. Prior to the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Church of England]] (Anglicans) had broken away from the [[Catholic Church]]. Then came the mainstream Reformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley&quot; /&gt; There were some Christians who were not content with the achievements of the mainstream Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shurden turning&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=Briggs, John |title=Baptist Origins |publisher= Baptist History and Heritage Society |accessdate = 10 January 2010 |url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/briggs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also were Christians who were disappointed that the Church of England had not made corrections of what some considered to be errors and abuses. Of those most critical of the Church's direction, some chose to stay and try to make constructive changes from within the Anglican Church. They became known as &quot;[[Puritans]]&quot; and are described by Gourley as cousins of the [[English Dissenters|English Separatists]].  Others decided they must leave the Church because of their dissatisfaction and became known as the Separatists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley&quot; /&gt;

Historians trace the earliest Baptist church back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] as its pastor.&lt;ref name= &quot;Gourley&quot; /&gt; Even prior to that, in 1606, [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]], a Fellow of Christ’s College, Cambridge, had broken his ties with the Church of England. Reared in the Church of England, he became &quot;Puritan, [[English Dissenters|English Separatist]], and then a Baptist Separatist,&quot; and ended his days working with the Mennonites.&lt;ref name = &quot;Leonard&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}} He began meeting in England with 60–70 [[English Dissenters|English Separatists]], in the face of &quot;great danger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Beale, David |title=The Mayflower Pilgrims: roots of Puritan, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Baptist heritage | publisher=Emerald House Group |year=2000 |isbn=978-1889893518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution of religious nonconformists in England led Smyth to go into exile in [[Amsterdam]] with fellow Separatists from the congregation he had gathered in Lincolnshire, separate from the established church (Anglican). Smyth and his lay supporter, [[Thomas Helwys]], together with those they led, broke with the other English exiles because Smyth and Helways were convinced they should be baptized as believers.  In 1609 Smyth first baptized himself and then baptized the others.&lt;ref name = &quot;Briggs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reformedreader.org/history/pbh.htm|title=A Primer on Baptist History|last=Traffanstedt|first=Chris|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, while still there, Smyth wrote a tract titled &quot;The Character of the Beast,&quot; or &quot;The False Constitution of the Church.&quot; In it he expressed two propositions: first, infants are not to be baptized; and second, &quot;Antichristians converted are to be admitted into the true Church by baptism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonard&quot; /&gt;{{rp|24}} Hence, his conviction was that a scriptural church should consist only of regenerate believers who have been baptized on a personal confession of faith. He rejected the [[English Dissenters|Separatist]] movement's doctrine of infant baptism ([[paedobaptism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nettles|first=Tom J. |date=Spring 2009|title=Once Upon a Time, Four Hundred Years Ago… |journal=Founders Journal|publisher=Founders Ministries|volume=76|pages=2–8|url= http://www.founders.org/journal/fj76/article1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reformedreader.org/history/vedder/ch14.htm|title=A Short History of the Baptists|last=Vedder|first = HC | publisher = The Reformed Reader | accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Smyth left the group, and layman Thomas Helwys took over the leadership, leading the church back to England in 1611.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley&quot; /&gt; Ultimately, Smyth became committed to believers' baptism as the only biblical baptism. He was convinced on the basis of his interpretation of Scripture that infants would not be damned should they die in infancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonard&quot; /&gt;{{rp|25}}

[[File:TheDippersDipt.jpg|thumb|Print from Anglican theologian [[Daniel Featley|Daniel Featley's]] book, &quot;The Dippers Dipt, or, The Anabaptists Duck'd and Plung'd Over Head and Ears, at a Disputation in Southwark&quot;, published in 1645.]]

Smyth, convinced that his self-baptism was invalid, applied with the [[Mennonites]] for membership. He died while waiting for membership, and some of his followers became Mennonites. Thomas Helwys and others kept their baptism and their Baptist commitments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonard&quot; /&gt;{{rp|25}} The modern Baptist denomination is an outgrowth of Smyth's movement.&lt;ref name= &quot;Briggs&quot; /&gt; Baptists rejected the name Anabaptist when they were called that by opponents in derision. McBeth writes that as late as the 18th century, many Baptists referred to themselves as &quot;the Christians commonly—though ''falsely''—called Anabaptists.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McBeth Bapt Beg&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/baptistbeginnings.htm|title=Baptist Beginnings|last=McBeth|first=H Leon |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society |accessdate=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anabaptist influence view ===

Another view is that early seventeenth-century Baptists were influenced by continental Anabaptists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Priest&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Priest | first = Gerald L PhD | title = Are Baptists Protestants? | publisher = Detroit Baptist Theological Seminary | date = 14 Oct 2010 | format = PDF | url = http://www.dbts.edu/pdf/macp/2007/Priest,%20Are%20Baptists%20Protestants.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view holds that although Baptist originated from [[English Dissenters|English Separatists]], some early Baptists were influenced by some Anabaptists. According to this view, the Dutch Mennonites (Anabaptists) shared some similarities with General Baptists (believer's baptism, religious liberty, separation of church and state, and Arminian views of salvation, predestination and original sin). However, there were significant differences between Anabaptists and Baptists.  Anabaptists tended towards extreme pacifism.  They promoted communal sharing of earthly goods,{{Citation needed | date =January 2010}} did not practice baptism by immersion, and had an unorthodox optimistic view of human nature{{Citation needed | date = January 2010}}.  Therefore, few Baptists hold to this theory of Baptist origins. Representative writers include AC Underwood and William R Estep. Gorley writes that among some contemporary Baptist scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty, the Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley&quot; /&gt;

The relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were early strained.  In 1624, the then five existing Baptist churches of London issued a condemnation of the Anabaptists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Melton | first = JG | contribution = Baptists | title = Encyclopedia of American Religions | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perpetuity view ===

Prior to the 20th century, Baptist historians generally wrote from the perspective that Baptists had existed since the times of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Robert G | last = Torbet | title = A History of the Baptists | pages = 18–9 | place = Valley Forge | publisher = Judson Press | year = 1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of the Baptist perpetuity view considers the Baptist movement to have always been historically separate from [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and in existence prior to the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H. Leon McBeth pages 59-60&quot;&gt;{{citation | first = H Leon | last = McBeth | title = The Baptist Heritage | pages = 59–60 | place = Nashville | publisher = Broadman Press | year = 1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The perpetuity view is often identified with ''The Trail of Blood'', a pamphlet by J.M. Carrol published in 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;H. Leon McBeth pages 59-60&quot; /&gt;  Other Baptist writers holding the perpetuity view are Thomas Crosby, G.H. Orchard, JM Cramp, William Cathcart, Adam Taylor and DB Ray&lt;ref name = &quot;H. Leon McBeth pages 59-60&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Robert | last = Torbet | title = A History of the Baptists | page = 18 | place = Valley Forge | publisher = Judson Press | year = 1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was also held by English Baptist preacher, [[Charles Spurgeon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The New park Street Pulpit | volume = VII | page = 225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Jesse Mercer]], the namesake of Mercer University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jesse Mercer|title= A History of the Georgia Baptist Association | pages = 196–201|year=1838|url= http://baptisthistoryhomepage.com/1811cl_mercer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1612, Thomas Helwys established a Baptist congregation in London, consisting of congregants from Smyth's church. A number of other Baptist churches sprang up, and they became known as the General Baptists. The Particular Baptists were established when a group of Calvinist Separatists adopted believers’ Baptism.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Stephen; Early English Baptists 1603-49 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Baptists in the United States|Baptists in Canada}}

Both [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and [[John Clarke (1609-1676)|John Clarke]], his compatriot in working for religious freedom, are variously credited as founding the earliest Baptist church in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newport&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.redwoodlibrary.org/notables/clarke.htm | title = Newport Notables | publisher = Redwood Library}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1639, Williams established a Baptist church in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and Clarke began a Baptist church in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter extensively, &quot;There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first' Baptist congregation in America. Exact records for both congregations are lacking.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Brackney&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | authorlink =William H.

The Great Awakening energized the Baptist movement, and the Baptist community experienced spectacular growth.  Baptists became the largest Christian community in many southern states, including among the black population.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot; /&gt;

In 1845, the Baptists congregations in the United States split over three main issues:  slavery, missions, and doctrinal integrity.  The northern congregations were opposed to members in the southern congregations owning slaves, and tried to prevent slaveholders from being missionaries.  However, not appointing a proportionate number of missionaries to the southern region of the US sparked animosity from the southern churches. The southern congregations were also concerned over perceived liberalism in the north, accusing some missionaries of denying virgin birth and divinity of Jesus.  The split created the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], while the northern congregations, then known as Northern Baptists, formed their own umbrella organization now called the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist Churches of the USA]] (ABC-USA).

After the American Civil War, another split occurred: most black Baptists in the South separated from white churches and set up their own congregations. In the late 1860s, they rapidly set up several separate state conventions. In 1895 their three national conventions merged into the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]]. With 8 million members, it is the largest African-American religious organization and is second in size to the Southern Baptist Convention.

== Baptist associations ==
{{Denominations of Christianity}}

Many Baptist churches choose to associate with associational groups that provide fellowship without control.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot; /&gt; The largest Baptist association is the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], but there are many other [[List of Baptist sub-denominations|Baptist associations]]. There are also autonomous churches that remain independent of any denomination, organization, or association.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last =Moore | first = G Holmes | title = 300&amp;nbsp;Years of Baptist History | quote = Bible Baptist Church of St. Louis, MO, is an example of an independent Baptist church that has never been a denominational church in the sense of belonging to some convention or association | date = 17 January 2010 | url = http://www.reformedreader.org/history/350years.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Baptists worldwide formed the [[Baptist World Alliance]] (BWA). The BWA now counts over 200 Baptist conventions and unions worldwide with over 37&amp;nbsp;million members.{{Citation needed | date=May 2010}} The BWA's goals include caring for the needy, leading in world evangelism and defending human rights and religious freedom. Though it played a role in the founding of the BWA, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] severed its affiliation with BWA in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44658-2004Jun15.html | title = Southern Baptists Vote To Leave World Alliance|last=Cooperman|first=Alan|date=16 June 2004|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-11-04|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, 46&amp;nbsp;million Baptists belong to churches cooperating with the [[Baptist World Alliance]]. Many Baptist groups, including the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and the [[Baptist Bible Fellowship]] do not cooperate with the Alliance. Their number can add up to a total of close to 100&amp;nbsp;million adherents in the world through 211 denominations, making Baptists the largest Protestant denomination in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbwc.ca&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.cbwc.ca/content/view/7/10/ | title = History | publisher = CBWC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Barna Group researchers, Baptists are the largest denominational grouping of ''born again Christians'' in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | chapter = Catholics Have Become Mainstream America | date = July 9, 2007 | accessdate = 16 January 2010 | url = http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/12-faithspirituality/100-catholics-have-become-mainstream-america | title = Born again Christians in US | quote = Barna defines ''Born again Christians'' as &quot;people who said they have made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ that is still important in their life today and who also indicated they believe that when they die they will go to Heaven because they had confessed their sins and had accepted Jesus Christ as their savior}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 ABCNEWS/Beliefnet phone poll of 1 022 adults suggests that fifteen percent of Americans identify themselves as Baptists.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews.go.com&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Langer | first = Gary | title = Poll: Most Americans Say They're Christian.

Besides North America and Europe, large populations of Baptists also exist in Asia, Africa and Latin America, notably in [[India]] (2.4&amp;nbsp;million), [[Nigeria]] (2.5&amp;nbsp;million), [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) (1.9&amp;nbsp;million), and [[Brazil]] (1.7&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name=&quot;cbwc.ca&quot; /&gt;

A large percentage of Baptists in North America are found in five bodies—the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (SBC); [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]] (NBC); [[National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.]]; (NBCA); [[American Baptist Churches in the USA]] (ABC); and [[Baptist Bible Fellowship International]] (BBFI).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Albert W | last = Wardin | title = Baptists Around the World | place = Nashville | publisher = Broadman and Holman Publishers | year = 1995 | place = 367}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qualification for membership===

Baptists define their church membership as a congregation of baptized believers in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The primary ''external'' qualification for membership in a Baptist church is a public profession of faith in Jesus, followed by water baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Church Manual For Baptist Churches |author=Pendleton, J. M. |authorlink=James Madison Pendleton |year=1867 |publisher=The Judson Press |url=http://www.reformedreader.org/rbb/pendleton/churchmanual/bcm01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baptist churches do not have an age restriction on membership, but will not accept as a member a child who is considered too young to fully understand and make a profession of faith of their own volition and comprehension.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In such cases, the pastor and parents usually meet together with the child to verify the child's comprehension of the decision to follow Jesus.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are instances where persons make a profession of faith but fail to follow through with believers' baptism. In such cases they are considered saved and usually eligible for membership.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Baptists do not believe that baptism has anything to do with salvation. It is considered a public expression of one's inner repentance and faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brackney&quot; /&gt;

Baptists believe that the act of baptism is a symbolic display of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brackney&quot; /&gt; When a person who believes that he has already been saved and confessed Christ submits to scriptural baptism, he or she is publicly identifying with Christ in His death to old self, burial of past sinful thought and action, and resurrection in newness of life, to walk with Christ the remainder of their days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brackney&quot; /&gt;

{{quotation|Even the briefest glance at early Baptist writings confirms that they sought to draw their teachings directly from Scripture. Other movements may have provided a framework for their understanding, but Baptists never consciously sought to pattern their teaching from these sources. Instead, they consciously and conscientiously sought to draw every teaching and practice from Scripture. Perhaps [John] Shakespeare is too partisan, but he made his point when he wrote that one could wipe out all the religious groups of the seventeenth century, leave an open Bible, and “there would be Baptists tomorrow.”| H.

Baptists, like other Christians, are defined by doctrine—some of it common to all orthodox and evangelical groups and a portion of it importantly distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= Nettles, Thomas J |title=A Foundation for the Future: The Southern Baptist Message and Mission |accessdate=17 January 2010 url=http://www.reformedreader.org/baptists.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years, different Baptist groups have issued confessions of faith—without considering them to be ''creeds''—to express their particular doctrinal distinctions in comparison to other Christians as well as in comparison to other Baptists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shurden fragile&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shurden, Walter B |title=The Baptist Identity: Four Fragile Freedoms |location=Macon, Georgia |publisher=Smyth &amp; Helwys Publishing |year=1993 |isbn=978-1880837207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Baptists are evangelical in doctrine, but Baptist beliefs can vary due to the congregational governance system that gives autonomy to individual local Baptist churches. Historically, Baptists have played a key role in encouraging religious freedom and separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Religion Facts | url = http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/denominations/baptists.htm | contribution = Baptists | accessdate = 17 January 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth; miracles; atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Jesus; the [[Trinity]]; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God, his death and resurrection, and confession of Christ as Lord); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth, the dead will be raised, and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions.  Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the [[1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith]], 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the [[1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith]], the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]'s ''[[Baptist Faith and Message]],'' and written [[church covenant]]s which some individual Baptist churches adopt as a statement of their faith and beliefs.

Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pinson, William M, Jr | title = Trends in Baptist Polity | publisher=Baptist History and Heritage Society |url=http://www.baptisthistory.org/contissues/pinson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of [[Elder (Christianity)#Baptists|elders]], as well as the [[Episcopal Baptist]]s that have an [[Episcopal polity|Episcopal system]].

Baptists generally believe in the literal [[Second Coming]] of Christ. Beliefs among Baptists regarding the &quot;[[Christian eschatology|end times]]&quot; include [[amillennialism]], [[dispensationalism]], and historic [[premillennialism]], with views such as [[postmillennialism]] and [[preterism]] receiving some support.

Some additional distinctive Baptist principles held by many Baptists:&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}}

* The supremacy of the canonical Scriptures as a norm of faith and practice. For something to become a matter of faith and practice, it is not sufficient for it to be merely ''consistent with'' and not contrary to scriptural principles. It must be something ''explicitly'' ordained through command or example in the Bible. For instance, this is why Baptists do not practice infant baptism—they say the Bible neither commands nor exemplifies infant baptism as a Christian practice, even though nowhere does the Bible forbid it. More than any other Baptist principle, this one when applied to infant baptism is said to separate Baptists from other evangelical Christians.
* Baptists believe that faith is a matter between God and the individual ([[religious freedom]]). To them it means the advocacy of absolute liberty of conscience.
* Insistence on immersion as the only mode of baptism.  Baptists do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation.  Therefore, they do not consider it to be a sacrament, since it imparts no saving grace.&lt;ref name = &quot;Newman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Newman | first =Albert Henry |authorlink= |title=A History of the Baptist Churches in the United States |edition=3rd |url= http://books.google.com/?id=F38uAAAAYAAJ |year=1915 |publisher=Christian Literature |isbn=079054234X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See|List of Baptist confessions}}

Most Baptist traditions believe in the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; articulated by Baptist historian Walter B. Shurden:&lt;ref name=&quot;Shurden fragile&quot; /&gt;

* '''Soul freedom''': the soul is competent before God, and capable of making decisions in matters of faith without coercion or compulsion by any larger religious or civil body
* '''Church freedom''': freedom of the local church from outside interference, whether government or civilian (subject only to the law where it does not interfere with the religious teachings and practices of the church)
* '''Bible freedom''': the individual is free to interpret the Bible for himself or herself, using the best tools of scholarship and biblical study available to the individual
* '''Religious freedom''': the individual is free to choose whether to practice their religion, another religion, or no religion; [[Separation of church and state]] is often called the &quot;civil corollary&quot; of religious freedom

{{Protestant}}Since there is no hierarchical authority and each Baptist church is autonomous, there is no official set of Baptist theological beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Hammett | first1 = John | first2 = John S | last2 = Hammett | quote = One thing that all Baptists have in common is that everything is built upon the Bible. | title = Biblical Foundations for Baptist Churches: A Contemporary Ecclesiology | publisher = Kregel Publications | year = 2005 | ISBN = 978-0825427695}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Baptists have different divisions, sects, and groups. Although they agree on many things, their differences are enough to keep them apart. Despite some common doctrines and practices which characterize the greater part of Baptists, there are many beliefs and practices which vary from church to church and among associations. Some doctrinal issues on which there is widespread difference among Baptists are [[eschatology]], [[Calvinism]] and [[Arminianism]], the [[doctrine of separation]] from &quot;the world&quot; and whether to associate with those who are &quot;of the world&quot;, [[glossolalia]] (speaking in tongues),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Position Paper Concerning the IMB Policy on Glossolalia | title = Florida Baptist Witness | accessdate = 18 March 2010 | url = http://www.gofbw.com/news.asp?ID=5592}}.&lt;/ref&gt; how the Bible should be interpreted ([[hermeneutics]]), the extent to which [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] boards should be used to support missionaries, the extent to which non-members may participate in the [[Lord's Supper]] services, which translation of Scripture to use from the pulpit and in Bible classes (see [[King-James-Only movement]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = An Introduction to Bible Translations | publisher = Trinity Baptist Church Discipleship Training | date = April 2005 | accessdate = 18 March 2010 | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.trinitybaptistreformed.org/files/Download/Bible%20Translations%20+.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the very nature of [[Gospel]], the role of [[Christian views of marriage|women in marriage]], and the [[Women in Christianity|ordination of women]] as deacons or pastors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Beck | first = Rosalie | contribution = Response to 'The Ordination of Women Among Texas Baptists' by Ann Miller | title = Perspectives in Religious Studies | journal = Journal of the NABPR | publisher = Baylor University, Baptist General Convention of Texas | accessdate = 18 March 2010 | url = http://www.bgct.org/texasbaptists/Document.Doc?&amp;id=3338}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies that have shaped Baptists ==
Baptists have faced many controversies in their 400-year history, controversies of the level of crises. Baptist historian Walter Shurden says the word &quot;crisis&quot; comes from the Greek word meaning &quot;to decide.&quot; Shurden writes that contrary to the presumed negative view of crises, some controversies that reach a crisis level may actually be &quot;positive and highly productive.&quot; He claims that even schism, though never ideal, has often produced positive results. In his opinion crises among Baptists each have become decision-moments that shaped their future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shurden crises&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Shurden, Walter B |title=Crises in Baptist Life |accessdate= 16 January 2010 |url=http://www.baptistdistinctives.org/crises.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some controversies that have shaped Baptists are:

* Missions crisis
* Slavery crisis
* Landmark crisis
* Modernist crisis

=== Missions crisis ===
Early in the 19th century, the rise of the modern [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] movement, and the backlash against it, led to widespread and bitter controversy among the American Baptists.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Christian, History of the Baptists, vol. 2, (Nashville: Broadman Press, 1926) pp. 404-420.&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, the American Baptists were split between missionary and anti-missionary. A substantial secession of Baptists went into the movement led by [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], to return to a more fundamental church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = John T | last = Christian | title = History of the Baptists | volume = 2 | pages = 421–36 | place = Nashville | publisher = Broadman Press | year = 1926}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slavery crisis ===
Leading up to the [[American Civil War]], Baptists became embroiled in the controversy over [[slavery in the United States]].  Whereas in the First [[Great Awakening]], [[Methodist]] and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the [[Home Mission Society]] refused to appoint a slaveholder as a [[missionary]] who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the Board did not want to appear to condone slavery.

The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was formed by nine state conventions in 1845, founded in part on the premise that the [[Bible]] sanctions slavery and that it is acceptable for [[Christianity|Christians]] to own slaves. They believed slavery was a human institution which Baptist teaching could make less harsh.  Not only were many planters among its membership, but some of the denomination's prominent preachers, such as Rev. [[Basil Manly, Sr.]], president of the [[University of Alabama]], were [[Plantations in the American South|planters]] and owned slaves (he owned 40.)

As early as the late 18th century, black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies, especially in the northern states. Not only did blacks set up some independent congregations in the South before the [[American Civil War]], [[freedmen]] quickly separated from white congregations and associations after the war. They wanted to be free of white supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Leroy | last = Fitts | title = A History of Black Baptists | pages = 43–106 | place = Nashville, TN | publisher = Broadman Press | year = 1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions, which they did in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Kentucky]]. In 1880 black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention, to support black Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest black religious organization and the second largest Baptist organization in the world. Currently American Baptist numerical strength is greatest in the former slaveholding states. The Baptist faith is the predominant faith of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title =Department of Geography and Meteorology, [[Valparaiso University]] | format = [[GIFF]] | url = http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/religion/baptist.gif | title = Baptists as a Percentage of all Residents, 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to black Baptists becoming independent of whites in the South after the war, new black denominations, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME) and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (AME Zion) established in the North, sent missionaries to the South. They attracted many new members from freedmen in the region. The AME Church had 50,000 new members the first year; eventually, they and AME Zion attracted hundreds of thousands of new members, who shaped both churches with their own culture.

On June 20, 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery. More than 20,000 Southern Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta. The resolution declared that messengers, as SBC delegates are called, &quot;unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as deplorable sin&quot; and &quot;lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest.&quot; It offered an apology to all African-Americans for &quot;condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime&quot; and repentance for &quot;racism of which we have been guilty, whether consciously or unconsciously.&quot; Although Southern Baptists have condemned racism in the past, this was the first time the predominantly white convention had dealt specifically with the issue of slavery.

The statement sought forgiveness &quot;from our African-American brothers and sisters&quot; and pledged to &quot;eradicate racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry.&quot; Currently about 500,000 members of the 15.6-million-member denomination are African Americans and another 300,000 are [[ethnic]] minorities. The resolution marked the denomination's first formal acknowledgment that [[racism]] played a role in its founding.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;SBC renounces racist past - Southern Baptist Convention&quot;, ''The Christian Century.'' July 5, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landmark crisis ===
Southern Baptist [[Landmarkism]] sought to reset the ecclesiastical separation which had characterized the old Baptist churches, in an era when inter-denominational union meetings were the order of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Robert | last = Ashcraft | title = Landmarkism Revisited | pages=84–5 | publisher = Ashcraft Publications | place = Mabelvale, Arkansas | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Robinson Graves]] was the primary leader of this movement and one of the most influential Baptists of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Ben M | last = Bogard | title = Pillars of Orthodoxy | page = 199 | place = Louisville | publisher = Baptist Book Concern | year = 1900}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While some Landmarkers eventually separated from the Southern Baptist Convention, the movement's influence on the Convention continued well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Smith | last2 = Handy | last3 = Loetscher | title = American Christianity: An Historical Interpretation With Representative Documents | Volume=II: 1820–1960 | page = 110 | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | year = 1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its influence continues to affect Convention policies. In 2005 the Southern Baptist International Mission Board forbade its missionaries to receive alien immersions for baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=International Mission Board |title=Guideline on Baptism |url= http://www.imb.org/main/news/details.asp?LanguageID=1709&amp;StoryID=3837 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modernist crisis ===
The rise of [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy|theological modernism]] in the latter 19th and 20th century also greatly affected Baptists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Torbet, Robert G |title=A History of the Baptists |pages= 424–45 |location=Valley Forge |publisher=Judson Press |year=1975 |isbn=978-0817000745}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Landmark movement, already mentioned, has been described as a reaction against incipient modernism among Southern Baptists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = History of the American Baptist Association | editor1-first = Robert | editor1-last = Ashcraft | pages = 63–6 | series = Texarkana | publisher = History and Archives Committee of the American Baptist Association | year = 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[Charles Haddon Spurgeon]] fought against modernistic views of the Scripture in the [[Downgrade Controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Robert G | last = Torbet | title = A History of the Baptists | page = 114 | place = Valley Forge, PA | publisher = Judson Press | year = 1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Northern Baptist Convention]] had internal conflict over modernism in the early 20th century, ultimately embracing it. Two new conservative associations were founded as a result: the [[General Association of Regular Baptist Churches]] in 1933 and the [[Conservative Baptist Association of America]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Robert G | last = Torbet | title = A History of the Baptists | pages = 395, 436 | place = Valley Forge, PA | publisher = Judson Press | year = 1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following similar conflicts over modernism, [[Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence|the Southern Baptist Convention adhered to conservative theology as its official position]]. Two new Baptist denominations were formed by former Southern Baptists who rejected the Southern Baptist interpretation of the Bible: the [[Alliance of Baptists]] in 1987{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} and the [[Cooperative Baptist Fellowship]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=16 January 2010 | url= http://www.thefellowship.info/About-Us/FAQ | title=CBF History | publisher = The Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BlackJackGame.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A game of blackjack with a blackjack hand of 21.]]
'''Blackjack''', also known as '''Twenty-one''' or '''''Vingt-et-un''''' ([[French language|French]] : &quot;twenty-one&quot;), is the most widely played [[casino game|casino]] banking game in the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Scarne's New Complete Guide to Gambling'', p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;  Blackjack is a comparing card game played with one or more [[Playing cards#French|French decks]] of 52 cards. The player draws cards to an initial two card hand with the object of bringing the total hand value as close as possible to 21 without exceeding it, so that the house, which plays after the player, will stop short of the player's total, or will lose by exceeding 21. Many rule variations of blackjack exist. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of [[advantage play]]ers, particularly [[card counting|card counters]], who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly.

Other casino games inspired by blackjack include Spanish 21 and pontoon. The recreational [[United Kingdom|British]] card game of [[Black Jack (card game)|black jack]] is a [[shedding-type game]] and unrelated to the subject of this article.

==History==
Blackjack's precursor was &quot;twenty-one&quot;, a game of unknown origin. The first written reference is found in a book by the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[author]] [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who is most famous for writing ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Cervantes was a [[gambler]], and the main characters of his tale ''Rinconete y Cortadillo'', from ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]'', are a couple of cheaters working in [[Seville]]. They are proficient at cheating at ''ventiuna'' (Spanish for twenty-one), and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without busting and that the ace values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish [[Baraja (playing cards)|''baraja'']] deck, which lacks eights, nines and tens. This short story was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that ''ventiuna'' was played in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilia]] since the beginning of the 17th Century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in [[France]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fontbona | first = Marc | title = Historia del Juego en España. De la Hispania romana a nuestros días | isbn = 978-84-96495-30-2 | url = http://www.loteriasyapuestas.es/index.php/mod.pags/mem.libros/libro.18/idpag.600008/relcategoria.271032 | year = 2008 | publisher = Flor del Viento Ediciones | location = Barcelona | p = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When twenty-one was introduced in the [[United States]], [[gambling]] houses offered bonus payouts to stimulate players' interest. One such bonus was a ten to one payout if the player's hand consisted of the ace of spades and a black jack (either the jack of clubs or the jack of spades). This hand was called a &quot;blackjack&quot; and the name stuck to the game, even though the ten to one bonus was soon withdrawn. In the modern game, a &quot;blackjack&quot; refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card, regardless of suits or colours.

==Rules of play at casinos==
At a casino blackjack table, the dealer faces between five and nine (commonly seven) playing positions from behind a semicircular table. At the beginning of each round, up to three players place their bets in the &quot;betting box&quot; at each position in play. The player whose bet is at the front of the betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to &quot;play behind&quot;. Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets in a single box. 

Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in &quot;hole card&quot; games receives its second card face down immediately (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor which are used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, &quot;no hole card&quot; games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.

Cards are dealt either from one or two hand-held decks, from a [[shoe (cards)|dealer's shoe]], or from a [[shuffling machine]]. Single cards are dealt to each of wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's leftmost position, followed by a single card to the dealer, followed by an additional card to each of the positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face-up, or face-down (more common in single-deck games).

The players' object is to win money by creating card totals which will turn out to be higher than the dealer's hand, but without exceeding 21 (&quot;busting&quot;/&quot;breaking&quot;). On their turn, players must choose whether to &quot;hit&quot; (take a card), &quot;stand&quot; (end their turn), &quot;double&quot; (double wager, take a single card and finish), &quot;split&quot; (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or &quot;surrender&quot; (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number-cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as &quot;face cards&quot; or &quot;pictures&quot;) count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's best interest. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace, or &quot;soft 17&quot;, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits nor surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. In the case of a tied score, known as &quot;push&quot; or &quot;standoff&quot;,  bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand which is not a blackjack, even with value 21. Blackjack ''vs.'' blackjack is a push. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for winning blackjacks, which are traditionally paid at 3:2, or one and a half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables.&lt;ref name=LVSun20031113/&gt; 

[[File:Blackjack game example.JPG|thumb|Example of a Blackjack game. The top half of the picture shows the beginning of the round, with bets placed and an initial two cards for each player. The bottom half shows the end of the round, with the associated losses or payoffs.]]

Blackjack games almost always provide a [[side bet]] called insurance, which may played when dealer's upcard is an ace. At least one further side bet is usually provided.

===Player decisions===
After receiving an initial two cards, the player has four standard options: &quot;hit,&quot; &quot;stand,&quot; &quot;double down,&quot; or &quot;split&quot;. Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, &quot;surrender&quot;.
* '''Hit''': Take another card from the dealer.
: ''signal'': (handheld) Scrape cards against table. (face up) Tap the table or wave hand toward body
* '''Stand''': Take no more cards; also known as &quot;stand pat&quot;, &quot;stick&quot;, or &quot;stay&quot;.
: ''signal'': (handheld) Slide cards under chips. (face up) Wave hand horizontally.
* '''Double down''' (only available as first decision of a hand): The player is allowed to increase the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Some games do not permit the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.
: ''signal'': Place additional chips beside the original bet, and point with one finger.
* '''Split''' (only available as first decision of a hand): If the first two cards have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box of the original bet. The dealer separates the two cards and draws a further card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn, with some restrictions. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of T-T may be split, but not of T-K. However, usually all ten-value cards are treated the same. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and blackjacks after a split are counted as non-blackjack 21 when comparing against the dealer's hand. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet, or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn.
: ''signal'': Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box. Point with two fingers spread into a V formation.
* '''Surrender''' (only available as first decision of a hand): Some games offer the option to &quot;surrender&quot;, usually in hole card games and directly after the dealer has checked for blackjack (but see below for variations).  When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and return the other half to the player; this terminates the player's interest in the hand. The request to surrender is made verbally, there being no standard hand signal.

Hand signals are used to assist the &quot;[[eye in the sky]]&quot;, a person or [[video camera]] located above the table and sometimes concealed behind [[one-way glass]]. The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify [[advantage players]] whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Each hand may normally &quot;hit&quot; as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard-20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is normally required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the players' wagers are immediately forefeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved, usually in [[counter-clockwise]] order; bets on losing hands are forfeited, and winners are paid out.

===Insurance===
If the dealer's upcard is an ace, the player is offered the option of taking &quot;insurance&quot; before the dealer checks the hole card.

Insurance is a side bet that the dealer has blackjack and is treated independently of the main wager. It pays 2:1 and is available when the dealer's exposed card is an ace. The idea is that the dealer's second card has a fairly high probability (nearly one-third) to be ten-valued, giving the dealer blackjack and disappointment for the player. It is attractive (although not necessarily wise) for the player to insure against the possibility of a dealer blackjack by making a maximum &quot;insurance&quot; bet, in which case the &quot;insurance proceeds&quot; will make up for the concomitant loss on the original bet. The player may add up to half the value of their original bet to the insurance and these extra chips are placed on a portion of the table usually marked &quot;Insurance Pays 2 to 1&quot;.

Players with a blackjack may also take insurance, and in taking maximum insurance they commit themselves to winning an amount exactly equal to their main wager, regardless of the dealer's outcome. Fully insuring a blackjack against blackjack is thus referred to as &quot;taking even money&quot;, and paid out immediately, before the dealer's hand is resolved; the players need not produce to place more chips for the insurance wager.

Insurance bets are expected to lose money in the long run, because the dealer is likely to have blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly [[correlation|anti-correlated]] with that of the main wager, and if the player's priority is to reduce [[variance|variation]], it is reasonable to pay for this.

Furthermore, the insurance bet is susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card has more than a chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is a good bet simply by observing the other cards on the table after the deal; even if there are just 2 player hands exposed, and neither of their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is a good bet. This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.

Bets to insure blackjack against blackjack are slightly less likely to be advantageous than insurance bets in general, since the ten in the player's blackjack makes it less likely that the dealer has blackjack too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatingbonuses.com/insurance.htm Blackjack Insurance Exceptions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--is this true? blackjack also means that the player can't have *two* tens, which would make insurance worse.--&gt;

==Rule variations and their consequences for the house edge==
The rules of casino blackjack are generally determined by law or regulation, which establishes certain rule variations allowed at the discretion of the casino. The rules of any particular game are generally posted on or near the table, failing which there is an expectation that casino staff will provide them on request. Over 100 variations of blackjack have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qfit.com/blackjack-rules.htm QFIT.com 100+ Blackjack variations]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all casino games, blackjack incorporates a &quot;house edge&quot;, a statistical advantage for the casino which is built into the game. The advantage of the dealer's position in blackjack relative to the player comes from the fact that if the player busts, the player loses, regardless of whether the dealer subsequently busts. Nonetheless, blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1% of their total wagered amount with strictly average luck; this is very favorable to the player compared to other casino games. The loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through ignorance is in general expected to be greater.

*'''Dealer hits soft 17'''
:Each game has a rule about whether the dealer must hit or stand on soft 17, which is generally printed on the table surface. The variation where the dealer must hit soft 17 is abbreviated &quot;H17&quot; in blackjack literature, with &quot;S17&quot; used for the stand-on-soft-17 variation. Substituting an &quot;H17&quot; rule with an &quot;S17&quot; rule in a game benefits the player, decreasing the house edge by about 0.2%.

*'''Number of decks'''
:All things being equal, using fewer decks decreases the house edge. This mainly reflects an increased likelihood of player blackjack, since if the players draws a ten on their first card, the subsequent probability of drawing an ace is higher with fewer decks. It also reflects a decreased likelihood of blackjack-blackjack push in a game with fewer decks.

:Casinos generally compensate by tightening other rules in games with fewer decks, in order to preserve the house edge. When offering single deck blackjack games, casinos are more likely to disallow doubling on soft hands or after splitting, to restrict resplitting, and to pay the player less than 3:2 for a winning blackjack.

:The following table illustrates the mathematical effect on the house edge of the number of decks, by considering games with various deck counts under the following ruleset: double after split allowed, resplit to four hands allowed, no hitting split aces, no surrender, double on any two cards, original bets only lost on dealer blackjack, dealer hits soft 17, and cut-card used. The increase in house edge per unit increase in the number of decks is most dramatic when comparing the single deck game to the two-deck game, and becomes progressively smaller as more decks are added.

|-
|Eight decks||0.66%
|}

*'''Late/early surrender'''
:Surrender, for those games that allow it, is usually not permitted against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked to make sure there is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as &quot;late&quot; surrender. The alternative, &quot;early&quot; surrender, gives player the option to surrender ''before'' the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early surrender was originally the norm in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] casinos but is much more favourable to the player than late surrender, and has largely disappeared from the United States. Nonetheless early surrender games can still be found in several countries. Most medium-strength hands should be surrendered against a dealer Ace if the hole card has not been checked.

:For late surrender, however, while it is tempting opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.

*'''Resplitting'''
:If the cards of a post-split hand have the same value, most games allow the player to split again, or &quot;resplit&quot;. The player places a further wager and the dealer separates the new pair dealing a further card to each as before. Some games allow unlimited resplitting, while others may limit it to a certain number of hands, such as four hands (for example, &quot;resplit to 4&quot;).

*'''Hit/resplit split aces'''
:After splitting aces, the common rule is that only one card will be dealt to each ace; the player cannot split, double, or take another hit on either hand. Rule variants include allowing resplitting aces or allowing the player to hit split aces. Games allowing aces to be resplit are not uncommon, but those allowing the player to hit split aces are extremely rare. Allowing the player to hit hands resulting from split aces reduces the house edge by about 0.13%; allowing resplitting of aces reduces house edge by about 0.03%. Note that a ten-value card dealt on a split ace (or vice versa) is a &quot;soft 21&quot; and not a &quot;natural&quot;.

*'''No double after split'''
:After a split, most games allow doubling down on the new two-card hands. Disallowing doubling after a split increases the house edge by about 0.12%.

*'''Double on 9/10/11 or 10/11 only'''
:Under the &quot;[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] rule&quot;, double down is only permitted on hard totals of 9, 10, or 11 (under a similar European rule, only 10 or 11). Basic strategy would otherwise call for some doubling down with hard 9 and soft 13-18, and advanced players can identify situations where doubling on soft 19-20 and hard 8,7 and even 6 is advantageous. The Reno rule prevents the player from taking advantage of double down in these situations and thereby increases the player's expected loss. The Reno rule increases the house edge by around one in 1000, and its European version by around two in 1000.

*'''No hole card and OBO'''
:In most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, meaning that the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have finished making decisions. With no hole card, it is almost never correct basic strategy to double or split against a dealer ten or ace, since a dealer blackjack will result in the loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of A's against a dealer 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no hole card game.  The no hole card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.

:The &quot;original bets only&quot; rule variation appearing in certain no hole card games states that if the player's hand loses to a dealer blackjack, only the mandatory initial bet (&quot;original&quot;) is forfeited, and all optional bets, meaning doubles and splits, are pushed. &quot;Original bets only&quot; is also known by the acronym OBO; it has the same effect on basic strategy and house edge as reverting to a hole card game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qfit.com/book/ModernBlackjackPage39.htm Modern Blackjack page 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Altered payout for a winning blackjack'''
:In many casinos, usually at tables with the lowest [[Table limit|table minimums]] and single-deck games, a blackjack pays only 6:5 or even 1:1 instead of the usual 3:2. Among common rule variations in the U.S., these altered payouts for blackjack are the most damaging to the player, causing the greatest increase in house edge. Since blackjack occurs in approximately 4.8% of hands, the 1:1 game increases the house edge by 2.3%, while the 6:5 game adds 1.4% to the house edge. Video blackjack machines generally pay 1:1 payout for a blackjack. The 6:5 rule is most commonly employed on table blackjack at single deck games, where they help the house to compensate for low house edge intrinsic in using one deck only.&lt;ref name=LVSun20031113&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2003/nov/13/taking-a-hit-new-blackjack-odds-further-tilt-advan/ ''Taking a hit: New blackjack odds further tilt advantage toward the house''] by Jeff Haney, [[Las Vegas Sun]], November 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Dealer wins ties'''
:The rule that bets on tied hands are lost rather than pushed is catastrophic to the player.  Though rarely used in standard blackjack, it is sometimes seen in &quot;blackjack-like&quot; games such as in some charity casinos.

==Blackjack strategy==
===Basic strategy===
Each blackjack game has a &quot;basic strategy&quot;, which is the way of playing a hand with any total value against any dealer upcard which will lose least money to the house in the long term with strictly average luck.

An example basic strategy is shown in the table below for a common ruleset:
* 4 to 8 decks
* Dealer stands on soft 17
* Double on any 2 cards
* Double after split allowed
* Only original bets lost on dealer blackjack
* Late surrender

The bulk of basic strategy is common to all blackjack games, with most rule variations calling for changes in only a few situations. For example, if the above game used the hit soft 17 rule, common in [[Las Vegas Strip]] casinos, only 5 cells of the table would need to be changed: double on 11 ''vs.'' A, double on A/7 ''vs.'' 2, double on A/8 ''vs.'' 6 and surrender 15 or 17 ''vs.'' A.

Estimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size. Most blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, making blackjack the cheapest casino table game. Casino promotions such as complimentary matchplay vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.

===Composition-dependent strategy===
Basic strategy is based upon a player's point total and the dealer's visible card. Players may be able to improve on this decision by considering the precise composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. However, in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the players' hand has two consequences:&lt;ref name= wizard&gt;{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix3c.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Fine points of basic strategy in single-deck blackjack |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It makes the players' 12 a worse hand to stand on (since the only way to avoid losing is for the dealer to go bust, which is less likely if there are fewer 10's left in the shoe).
* It makes hitting safer, since the only way of going bust is to draw a 10, and this is less likely with a 10 already in the hand.

However, even when basic and composition-dependent strategy lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small. Additionally, as the number of decks used in a blackjack game rises, both the number of situations in which composition determines the correct strategy and the house edge improvement from using a composition-dependent strategy falls. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.&lt;ref name= wizard2&gt;{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix15.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Total Dependent and Composition Dependent Basic Strategy in Blackjack |accessdate=December 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantage play===
Blackjack has been a high profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play is the attempt to win more using &quot;honest&quot; skills such as memory, computation and observation. These techniques, while generally legal, can be powerful enough to give the player a long-term edge in the game, making them an undesirable customer for the casino and leading to ejection or [[blacklist]]ing if they are detected. The main techniques of advantage play in blackjack are as follows:

====Card counting====
{{Main|Card counting#Blackjack}}

During the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer progressively exposes cards which are dealt to his or her own and the players' hands. Careful accounting of the exposed cards allows a player to make inferences about the cards which remain to be dealt, and use these inferences in one of two ways:
* The players can make larger bets when they have the advantage. For example, the players can increase the starting bet if there are many aces and tens left in the deck, in the hope of hitting a blackjack
* The players can deviate from basic strategy according to the composition of their undealt cards. For example, with many tens left in the deck, the players may double down in more situations since there is a better chance of getting a good hand.

A typical card counting system assigns a point score to each rank of card (''e.g.'' 1 point for 2-6 , 0 points for 7-9 and -1 point for 10-A). Whenever a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'; the count is used to make betting and playing decisions according to a table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for &quot;balanced&quot; counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends on the number of decks used in the game.

In comparison to the house edge of 0.5-1% which can be achieved by playing basic strategy in most blackjack games,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatingbonuses.com/blackjack.htm#table Rules &amp; House Edge Table]&lt;/ref&gt; card counting can give the player an advantage of up to 2% over the house.&lt;ref&gt;''Theory of Blackjack'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Card counting is most rewarding near the end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single deck games are therefore particularly susceptible to card counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and initiating a reshuffle when one or more decks remain undealt, or by using a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.

Card counting mentally is legal and is not considered cheating.&lt;ref&gt;''Theory of Blackjack'', pp 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; However, most casinos have the right to ban players, with or without cause, and card counting is frequently a reason for banning a player. Usually, the casino will inform the players that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack at that casino and they may be banned from the property. Players must be careful not to reveal the fact that they are counting. The use of electronic or other counting devices is illegal in Nevada, where the size of the gambling industry gives it a unique ability to influence state legislation.

====Shuffle tracking====
Techniques other than card-counting can swing the advantage of casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques are based on the value of the cards to the player and the casino, as originally conceived by [[Edward O. Thorp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjmath.com/bjmath/thorp/tog.htm The Mathematics of Gambling]&lt;/ref&gt; One technique, mainly applicable in multi-deck games, involves tracking groups of cards (aka slugs, clumps, packs) during the play of the shoe, following them through the shuffle and then playing and betting accordingly when those cards come into play from the new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation, but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackjackincolor.com/Shuffletracking2.htm Shuffle Tracking Counts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold Snyder's articles in ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' magazine brought shuffle tracking to the general public. His book, ''The Shuffle Tracker's Cookbook,'' mathematically analyzed the player edge available from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug. [[Jerry L. Patterson]] also developed and published a shuffle-tracking method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play.

Patterson and Eddie Olsen; Perigee Books; A Division of Penguin Putnam; © 1986; ISBN 0-399-51233-0 Shuffle-Tracking; Chapter 6, Page 83]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blackjack: A Winner's Handbook''; by Jerry L. Patterson; Perigee Books; A Division of Penguin Putnam; © 1990; ISBN 0-399-51598-4  Shuffle-Tracking; Chapter 4, Page 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Identifying concealed cards====
The player can also gain an advantage by identifying cards from distinctive wear markings on their backs, or by &quot;hole carding&quot; (observing during the dealing process the front of a card dealt face down). These methods are generally legal although their status in particular jurisdictions may vary.

==Side bets==
Many blackjack tables offer a side bet on various outcomes including&lt;ref&gt;[http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix8.html Blackjack side bets -- analyzed by The Wizard of Odds]&lt;/ref&gt;:
*Player hand and dealer's up card sum to 19, 20, or 21 (&quot;Lucky Lucky&quot;)
*Player initial hand is a pair (&quot;Perfect pairs&quot;)
*Player initial hand is suited, suited and connected, or a suited K-Q (&quot;Royal match&quot;)
*Player initial hand plus dealer's card makes a flush, straight, or three-of-a-kind [[three card poker|poker]] hand (&quot;21+3&quot;)
*Player initial hand totals 20 (&quot;Lucky Ladies&quot;)
*Dealer upcard is in between the value of the players two cards (&quot;In Bet&quot;)
*First card drawn to the dealer will result in a dealer bust  (&quot;Bust It!&quot;)
*One or both of the players cards is the same as the dealers card (&quot;Match the Dealer&quot;)
*Player allowed to make optional second hand, and effectively receive the hand of 10,8, or 18 without drawings cards (&quot;Instant 18&quot;)&lt;!-- is this a true side game? --&gt;

The side wager is typically placed in a designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side bet is usually required to place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet regardless of whether the controlling player does so.

The house edge for side games is generally higher than for the blackjack game itself. Nonetheless side games can be susceptible to card counting, often requiring bespoke counting systems. Most side games do not offer sufficient win rate to justify the effort of advantage play; exceptions are &quot;Lucky ladies&quot; and &quot;Over/Under&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In team play it is common for team members to be dedicated toward counting only a sidebet using a specialized count.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Blackjack tournaments==
Blackjack can be played in tournament form, where players start with equal numbers of chips and the aim is to finish among the top chip-holders. Depending on the number of competitors, tournaments may be held over several rounds, with one or two players qualifying from each table after a set number of deals to meet the qualifiers from the other tables in the next round. Alternatively the [[Elimination Blackjack]] format drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament, for instance after every four deals. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can be very different from non-tournament strategy, and has the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an initial entry fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.

==Video blackjack==
Some casinos, as well as general betting outlets, provide blackjack among a selection of casino-style games at electronic consoles. Video blackjack game rules are generally more favorable to the house, ''e. g.'' paying out only even money for winning blackjacks. Video and online blackjack games deal each coup from a fresh shoe, rendering card counting much less effective.

==Variants of the game==
Blackjack is a member of a large family of traditional card games played recreationally all around the world. Most of these games have not been adapted for casino play. Furthermore, the casino game development industry is very active in producing blackjack variants, most of which are ultimately not adopted for widespread use in casinos. The following are the prominent twenty-one themed comparing card games which have been adapted or invented for use in casinos and have become established in the gambling industry.

*'''[[Spanish 21]]''' provides players with many liberal blackjack rules, such as doubling down any number of cards (with the option to 'rescue', or surrender only one wager to the house), payout bonuses for five or more card 21s, 6-7-8 21s, 7-7-7 21s, late surrender, and player blackjacks always winning and player 21s always winning, at the cost of having no 10 cards in the deck (though there are jacks, queens, and kings). An unlicensed version of Spanish 21 played without a hole card is found in Australian casinos under the name &quot;Pontoon&quot; (presumably borrowed from the British recreational blackjack-like game &quot;Pontoon&quot; which has substantially different rules).

*'''21st-Century Blackjack''' (also known as &quot;Vegas Style&quot; Blackjack) is found in California card rooms. In this form of the game, a player bust does not always result in an automatic loss; there are a handful of situations{{which?|date=December 2010}} where the player can still push if the dealer busts as well, provided that the dealer busts with a higher total.

*'''[[Double Exposure Blackjack]]''' deals the first two cards of the dealer hand face up. Blackjacks pay [[even money]], and players lose on ties.

*'''[[Double Attack Blackjack]]''' has very liberal blackjack rules and the option of increasing one's wager after seeing the dealer's up card. This game is dealt from a Spanish shoe, and blackjacks only pay even money.

*'''[[Blackjack Switch]]''' is played over two hands whose second cards the player is allowed to interchange. For example, if the player is dealt 10-6 and 5-10, then the player can switch two cards to make hands of 10-10 and 6-5.  Natural blackjacks are paid 1:1 instead of the standard 3:2, and a dealer 22 is a push.

*'''Multiple Action Blackjack''' involves a player places between 2 or 3 bets on a single hand. The dealer then gets a hand for each bet the player places on a hand. This essentially doubles the number of hands a single dealer can play per hour. Splitting and doubling are still allowed, but often limited due to limited space on th felt for additional chips.  Strategy for this game is the same as strategy for conventional blackjack regardless of how many places are bet.

Examples of the many local traditional and recreational blackjack-like games include '''[[French/German Blackjack]]''', called &quot;Vingt-et-un&quot; ([[French language|French]]: Twenty-one) or &quot;Siebzehn und Vier&quot; ([[German language|German]]: Seventeen and Four). The French/German game does not allow splitting. An ace can only count as eleven, but two aces count as a blackjack. It is mostly played in private circles and barracks. A British variation is called &quot;Pontoon&quot;, the name being probably a corruption of &quot;Vingt-et-un&quot;.

==Blackjack Hall of Fame==
{{Main|Blackjack Hall of Fame}}

In 2002, professional gamblers around the world were invited to nominate great blackjack players for admission into the [[Blackjack Hall of Fame]]. Seven members were inducted in 2002, with new people inducted every year after. The Hall of Fame is at the [[Barona Casino]] in [[San Diego]]. Members include [[Edward O. Thorp]], author of the 1960s book ''Beat the Dealer'' which proved that the game could be beaten with a combination of basic strategy and [[card counting]]; [[Ken Uston]], who popularized the concept of team play; [[Arnold Snyder]], author and editor of the ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' trade journal; [[Stanford Wong]], author and popularizer of the &quot;Wonging&quot; technique of only playing at a positive count, and several others.

[[File:Bicarbonate-ion-3D-balls.png|thumb|180px|Ball and stick model of the bicarbonate ion, {{chem|HCO|3|−}}]]
[[File:Bicarbonate-resonance.png|thumb|180px|Structure of bicarbonate]]
In [[inorganic chemistry]], '''bicarbonate''' ([[IUPAC]]-recommended nomenclature: '''hydrogen carbonate''') is an intermediate form in the [[deprotonation]] of [[carbonic acid]]. Its chemical formula is HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;.

Bicarbonate serves a crucial biochemical role in the physiological [[pH]] [[buffering solution|buffering]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;veq&quot;&gt;[http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/medph/intro.html http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/medph/intro.html]&lt;br&gt;Biology.arizona.edu - October 2006. ''Clinical correlates of pH levels: bicarbonate as a buffer.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical properties==

The '''bicarbonate ion (hydrogen carbonate ion)''' is an [[anion]] with the [[empirical formula]] [[hydrogen|H]][[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; and a molecular mass of 61.01&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|daltons]]; it consists of one central carbon [[atom]] surrounded by three oxygen atoms in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with a hydrogen atom attached to one of the oxygens. It is [[isoelectronic]] with [[nitric acid]]&amp;nbsp;{{chem|HNO|3}}. The bicarbonate ion carries a negative one [[formal charge]] and is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of [[carbonic acid]]&amp;nbsp;{{chem|H|2|CO|3}}; it is the [[conjugate acid]] of {{chem|CO|3|2−}}, the [[carbonate]] ion as shown by these [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} 

CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; +2  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} '''HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +2  OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +2  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} '''HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''' + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; +2  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

A bicarbonate salt forms when a [[cation|positively charged ion]] attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion, forming an [[ionic compound]]. Many bicarbonates are [[solubility|soluble]] in [[aqueous solution|water]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]], in particular [[sodium bicarbonate]] contributes to [[total dissolved solids]], a common parameter for assessing [[water quality]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Biochemical role==

Bicarbonate is [[alkaline]], and a vital component of the [[pH]] buffering system&lt;ref name=&quot;veq&quot; /&gt; of the human body (maintaining [[acid-base homeostasis]]). 70 to 75 percent of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the body is converted into [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which can quickly turn into bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).  

With carbonic acid as the [[Reaction intermediate|central intermediate]] [[Chemical species|species]], bicarbonate – in conjunction with water, [[hydronium|hydrogen ions]], and [[carbon dioxide]] – forms this buffering system, which is maintained at the volatile equilibrium&lt;ref name=&quot;veq&quot; /&gt; required to provide prompt resistance to drastic pH changes in both the acidic and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] directions. This is especially important for protecting [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[central nervous system]], where pH changes too far outside of the normal range in either direction could prove disastrous.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} (See [[acidosis]], or [[alkalosis]].)

Bicarbonate also acts to regulate pH in the small intestine. It is released from the [[pancreas]] in response to the hormone [[secretin]] to neutralize the acidic [[chyme]] entering the duodenum from the stomach &lt;ref&gt;Berne &amp; Levy, Principles of Physiology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bicarbonate in the environment==
In freshwater ecology, strong [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity by freshwater plants in daylight releases gaseous [[oxygen]] into the water and at the same time produces bicarbonate ions. These shift the pH upward until in certain circumstances the degree of alkalinity can become toxic to some organisms or can make other chemical constituents such as [[ammonia]] toxic. In darkness, when no photosynthesis occurs, respiration processes release carbon dioxide, and no new bicarbonate ions are produced, resulting in a rapid fall in pH.

==Other uses==
The most common salt of the bicarbonate ion is [[sodium bicarbonate]], NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is used as [[baking powder]]. When exposed to an [[acid]] such as [[acetic acid]] ([[vinegar]]), sodium bicarbonate releases [[carbon dioxide]]. This is used as a [[leavening agent]] in [[baking]].

The flow of bicarbonate ions from rocks weathered by the carbonic acid in rainwater is an important part of the [[carbon cycle]].

Bicarbonate also serves in the digestive system.  It raises the internal pH of the stomach, after highly acidic digestive juices have finished in their digestion of food. [[Ammonium bicarbonate]] is used in [[digestive biscuit]] manufacture.

==Diagnostics==
In [[diagnostic medicine]], the [[blood value]] of bicarbonate is one of several indicators of the state of [[acid-base physiology]] in the body.

The parameter ''standard bicarbonate concentration'' (SBC&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) is the bicarbonate concentration in the blood at a [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] of {{convert|40|mmHg|kPa|2|abbr=on}}, full oxygen saturation and 37 degrees [[Celsius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u13/u1312_03.htm Acid Base Balance (page 3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Allan Federko''' (born May 12, 1956) is a retired professional [[ice hockey]] [[centre (ice hockey)|centre]] who played fourteen seasons in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] from [[1976–77 NHL season|1976]] through [[1989–90 NHL season|1990]].

==Playing career==
Federko began playing hockey at a young age in his home town of [[Foam Lake, Saskatchewan]]. He was captain of the 1971 Bantam provincial champions. He also played Senior hockey with the local [[Foam Lake Flyers]] of the Fishing Lake Hockey League, winning the league scoring title as a bantam-aged player. Federko continued his career with the [[Saskatoon Blades]] of the [[Western Hockey League|WHL]] where he set and still holds the team record for assists. He played three seasons with the Blades, and in his final year with the club he led the league in assists and points in both the regular season ''and'' playoffs. As a reward, Federko was drafted 7th overall by the [[St. Louis Blues]] in the [[1976 NHL Amateur Draft]]. He started the next season with the [[Kansas City Blues (ice hockey)|Kansas City Blues]] of the [[Central Hockey League (1963–84)|Central Hockey League]] and was leading the league in points when he was called up mid-season to play 31 games with St. Louis. He scored three [[hat trick]]s in those 31 games. In the [[1978–79 NHL season]], Federko developed into a bonafide star, as he scored 95 points.

Federko would score 100 points in a season four times, and was a consistent and underrated superstar for the Blues. Federko scored at least 90 points in seven of the eight seasons between 1978 and 1986, and became the first player in NHL history to record at least 50 assists in 10 consecutive seasons. However, in an era when [[Wayne Gretzky]] was scoring 200 points a season, Federko never really got the attention many felt he deserved. In 1986, in a poll conducted by GOAL magazine, he was named the most overlooked talent in hockey. His [[General Manager]] [[Ron Caron]] said he was &quot;A great playmaker. He makes the average or above average player look like a star at times. He's such an unselfish player.&quot;

On March 19, 1988, Federko became the 22nd NHL player to record 1000 career points. After a poor season for Federko in [[1988–89 NHL season|1988–89]], he was traded to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] with [[Tony McKegney]] for future Blues star [[Adam Oates]], and [[Paul MacLean (ice hockey)|Paul MacLean]]. In Detroit, Federko re-united with former Blues head coach [[Jacques Demers]], but he had to play behind [[Steve Yzerman]] and did not get his desired ice time. After his lowest point output since his rookie season, Federko decided to retire after the [[1989–90 NHL season|1989–90 season]], having played exactly 1,000 NHL games.

==Post-NHL career==
Federko was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 2002, and is currently a television color commentator for the Blues. He also had his number '24' retired by the Blues on March 16, 1991.

Federko was the head coach/general manager of the St. Louis Vipers InLine team of the [[Roller Hockey International]] for the 1993 and 1994 seasons.

==Name origin==
Most popular accounts hold that the name &quot;Buffalo&quot; is a corruption of the French phrase ''beau fleuve,'' &quot;beautiful river,&quot; a phrase said to have been exclaimed by French explorers upon seeing the [[Niagara River]]. This speculation, however, is contradicted by primary sources. French explorers actually referred to Buffalo Creek in print as ''Rivière aux Chevaux,'' &quot;Horse River.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Houghton, Frederick. The Name Buffalo.

Prior to the [[Iroquois]] occupation of the region, the region was settled by the [[Neutral Nation]]. Later, the Senecas of the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy conquered the Neutrals. In 1804, [[Joseph Ellicott]], a principal agent of the [[Holland Land Company]], designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Priebe Jr.|first = J. Henry |title = Beginnings&amp;nbsp;—The Village of Buffalo - 1801 to 1832 |url = http://history.buffalonet.org/1801.html |accessdate = 2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the few radial street plans in the US.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} During the [[War of 1812]], on December 30, 1813,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/TheBurningofBuffalo.html The Buffalonian]&lt;/ref&gt;{{'}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffaloah.com/h/war1812/burning.html History of Buffalo]&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalo was burned by British forces. On November 4, 1825 the [[Erie Canal]] was completed with Buffalo strategically positioned at the western end of the system. At the time, the population was about 2,400. The Erie Canal brought a surge in population and commerce which led Buffalo to incorporate as a city in 1832, with a population of about 10,000 people.

The City of Buffalo has long been home to African-Americans. An example is the 1828 village directory which listed 59 &quot;Names of Coloured&quot; heads of families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Fordham |first = Monroe |title = Michigan Street Church |work = African American history of Western New York |month = April | year = 1996 |url = http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/hwny-michigan.st.church.html |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, construction was begun on the [[Macedonia Baptist Church (Buffalo, New York)|Macedonia Baptist Church]] (commonly called the ''Michigan Street Baptist Church''). This African-American church was an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement. On February 12, 1974 the church was added to the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Erie County, New York|National Register of Historic Places]]. Abolitionist leaders such as [[William Wells Brown]] made their home in Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= African American history of Western New York |url= http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/wwb0.html |accessdate = 2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalo was also a terminus point of the [[Underground Railroad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Underground Railroad Sites in Buffalo, NY |url=http://www.buffaloresearch.com/ugrr.html |accessdate = 2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many fugitives crossing the [[Niagara River]] from Buffalo to [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] and freedom.

During the 1840s, Buffalo's port continued to develop. Both passenger and commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from the port of Buffalo.&lt;ref name=&quot;The City of Buffalo 1840-1850&quot; &gt;{{cite web |last = Priebe Jr. |first = J.

In 1843, the world's first steam-powered [[grain elevator]] was constructed by local merchant Joseph Dart, Jr. and engineer Robert Dunbar. The &quot;Dart Elevator&quot; enabled faster unloading of [[lake freighter]]s along with the transshipment of grain in bulk from lakers to canal boats and, later on, rail cars.&lt;ref name = &quot;The City of Buffalo 1840-1850&quot;/&gt;

Abraham Lincoln visited Buffalo on February 16, 1861 on his trip to accept the presidency of the United States. During his visit, he stayed at the American Hotel on Main Street between Eagle Street and Court Street.&lt;ref name = &quot;The History of Buffalo: A Chronology Buffalo, New York 1841-1865&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last =LaChiusa |first = Chuck |title = The History of Buffalo: A Chronology Buffalo, New York 1841–1865 |url = http://freenet.buffalo.edu/bah/h/1865.html#1859 |accessdate = 2007-09-08}} {{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil War years saw an increase in the population of Buffalo which grew from 81,029 to 94,210 by 1865. In addition to sending many soldiers to the Union effort, Buffalo manufacturers supplied important war material. For example, the Niagara Steam Forge Works manufactured turret parts for the [[ironclad]] ship [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']].&lt;ref name = &quot;The History of Buffalo: A Chronology Buffalo, New York 1841-1865&quot; /&gt;

[[Grover Cleveland]] served as Sheriff of Erie County (1871–1873), and was Mayor of Buffalo in 1882. He was later [[Governor of New York]] (1883–1885), 22nd President of the United States (1885–1889) and 24th President (1893–1897).

In May, 1896, the [[Ellicott Square Building]] opened. For the next 16 years, it was the largest office building in the world. It was named after the surveyor Joseph Ellicott.

At the dawn of the 20th Century, local mills were among the first to benefit from [[hydroelectric power]] generated via the Niagara River. The city got the nickname ''City of Light'' at this time due to the widespread electric lighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityjournal&quot;&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_4_buffalo_ny.html Can Buffalo Ever Come Back?] from ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, Buffalo deployed the first electric street lights in the United States. It was also part of the [[automobile]] revolution, hosting the [[brass era]] car builders [[Pierce Arrow]] and the [[Seven Little Buffaloes (automobile company)|Seven Little Buffaloes]] early in the century.&lt;ref&gt;Believe it, or not. Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; ''City of Light'' (1999) was the title of Buffalo native [[Lauren Belfer|Lauren Belfer's]] historical novel set in 1901, which in turn engendered a listing of real versus fictional persons and places&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffaloah.com/h/bel/places.html The History of Buffalo]&lt;/ref&gt; featured in her pages.

President [[William McKinley]] was [[William McKinley assassination|shot and mortally wounded]] at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. He died in the city eight days later and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was sworn in at the [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site|Wilcox Mansion]] as the 26th President of the United States.

An international bridge, known as the [[Peace Bridge]], linking Buffalo to [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] was opened in 1927. The [[Buffalo Central Terminal]], a 17-story [[Art Deco]] style station designed by architects [[Fellheimer &amp; Wagner]] for the [[New York Central Railroad]], was finished just weeks before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].

During [[World War II]], Buffalo saw a period of prosperity and low unemployment due to its position as a manufacturing center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = 1941–1945| work = History| publisher =Parkside Community Association| date =| url = http://www.parksidebuffalo.org/history.html| doi =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1957, which cut the city off from valuable trade routes; [[deindustrialization]]; and the nation-wide trend of [[suburbanization]]; the city's economy began to deteriorate. Like much of the [[Rust Belt]], Buffalo, which peaked at more than half a million people in the 1950s, has seen its population decline by almost 50 percent as industries shut down and people left for the suburbs or other cities.

Like other [[rust belt]] cities such as [[Flint, Michigan]], Buffalo has attempted to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. $4 billion was spent in 2007 compared to a $50 million average for the previous ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= current city development projects 2007|url= http://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/files/1_2_1/splanning/listofprojects/ListBuffDev101007.pdf |accessdate = 2007-11-04|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; New proposals and renovations are numerous, especially in the downtown core. As of 2008, the population has continued to decrease, despite the efforts of city officials. (See demographics section.)

The economy today is stable and the city's prosperity has increased significantly in the 21st century with the opening of several new hotels catering to tourists visiting nearby [[Niagara Falls]] and a new entertainment district along Elmwood Avenue, along with the opening of factories manufacturing environmentally conscious products.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:BuffaloAvgTemps.png|right|thumb|Buffalo average temperatures]]

===Geography===
Buffalo is located on the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]], opposite [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] in Canada, and at the beginning of the [[Niagara River]], which flows northward over [[Niagara Falls]] and into [[Lake Ontario]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|52.5|mi2|km2|abbr=off|lk=off}}. {{convert|40.6|mi2|km2|abbr=off|lk=off}} of it is land and {{convert|11.9|mi2|km2|abbr=off|lk=off}} of it is water. The total area is 22.66% water.

===Climate===
[[File:BuffInBloom.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo in bloom]]
[[File:Blizzard of 1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977|Blizzard of 1977]]]]
Buffalo has a reputation for snowy winters, but it is rarely the snowiest city in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldensnowball.com/2009/01/syracuse-already-over-annul-snowfall.html New York State Golden Snowball Awards.]&lt;/ref&gt; The region experiences a fairly humid, [[humid continental climate|continental-type]] climate, but with a definite [[maritime climate|maritime]] flavor due to strong modification from the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] &quot;Dfb&quot;&amp;nbsp;— uniform precipitation distribution). The transitional seasons are very brief in Buffalo and Western New York.

Winters in Western New York are generally cold and [[snowstorm|snowy]], but are changeable and include frequent thaws and rain as well. Winters can also be quite long in Western New York, usually spanning from mid-November to mid-March. Snow covers the ground more often than not from late December into early March, but periods of bare ground are not uncommon. Over half of the annual snowfall comes from the [[lake effect snow|lake effect]] process and is very localized. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air crosses the relatively warm lake waters and becomes saturated, creating clouds and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] downwind. Due to the prevailing winds, areas south of Buffalo receive much more lake effect snow than locations to the north. The lake snow machine starts as early as mid-November, peaks in December, then virtually shuts down after [[Lake Erie]] freezes in mid-to-late January. The most well-known snowstorm in Buffalo's history, the [[Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977|Blizzard of '77]], was not a lake effect snowstorm in Buffalo in the normal sense of that term (Lake Erie was frozen over at the time), but instead resulted from a combination of high winds and snow previously accumulated both on land and on frozen Lake Erie. Snow does not typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage as with the [[Lake Storm &quot;Aphid&quot;|October 2006 storm]].

Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], but still has enough rain to keep [[vegetation]] green and lush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/buf/bufclifo.htm Buffalo's Climate]. ''National Weather Service''. Retrieved July 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate [[humidity]] and temperature. It receives, on average, over 65% of possible sunshine in June, July and August. Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact that Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off [[Lake Erie]] in summer that gently temper the warmest days. As a result, the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of {{convert|100|F|1|abbr=on}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USNY0181?from=tenDay_bottomnav_undeclared Weather.com. Record high of {{convert|99|°F|0|abbr=on}} was recorded in August 1948]&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfall is moderate but typically occurs at night. The stabilizing effect of [[Lake Erie]] continues to inhibit [[thunderstorms]] and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July. August usually has more showers and is hotter and more humid as the warmer lake loses its temperature-stabilizing influence.

===City proper===
Like most formerly industrial cities of the Great Lakes region, Buffalo has suffered through several decades of population decline brought about by the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States and its population has declined in every year since. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, is significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's current population is equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change.

Although the trend is inconclusive at this time, current census estimates indicate the rate of population loss may be decelerating to a stable state. The 2008–2009 loss estimate is 50% less than the years prior, and is at less than 1% year-over-year loss. Whether this trend will continue will not be evident until next year's estimate.

At the 2005–2007 American Community Survey Estimates, the city's population was 53.8% White (48.7% non-Hispanic White alone), 41.1% Black or African American, 1.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.0% Asian, 4.5% from some other race and 2.5% from two or more races. 8.3% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=adp&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_DP3YR5&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_&amp;-tree_id=3307&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=16000US3611000&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en Census Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time of the 2000 census there were 292,648 people, 122,720 [[households]], and 67,005 [[family|families]] residing in the city. The [[population density]] is 7,205.8 people per square mile (2,782.4/km²). There are 145,574 [[house|housing]] units at an average density of 3,584.4 per square mile (1,384.1/km²). The [[Race (U.S. Census)|racial]] makeup of the city is 54.43% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 37.23% [[African American]], 0.77% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.40% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.68% from other races, and 2.45% from two or more races. 7.54% of the population are [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino]] of any race. The top 5 largest ancestries include [[German American|German]] (13.6%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (12.2%), [[Italian American|Italian]] (11.7%), [[Polish American|Polish]] (11.7%), and [[English American|English]] (4.0%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/city/Buffalo-New-York.html Buffalo, New York (NY) Detailed Profile - relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 122,720 households out of which 28.6% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.6% are married couples living together, 22.3% have a female householder with no husband present, and 45.4% are non-families. 37.7% of all households are made up of individuals and 12.1% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.29 and the average family size is 3.07.

In the city the population included 26.3% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 34 years. For every 100 females there are 88.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 83.5 males.

The [[median household income|median income]] for a household in the city is $24,536, and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23.0% of families are below the [[poverty line]]. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

[[File:Buffalo NY historical population.png|left|thumb|Population of Buffalo, 1830–2006]]

Buffalo has very sizable populations of [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Polish American|Polish]], [[German American|German]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]], [[Greek American|Greek]], [[Arab American|Arab]], [[African American]], [[Indian American|Indian]], and [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] descent. Major ethnic neighborhoods still exist but they changed significantly in the second half of the 20th century. Traditionally, [[Polish-Americans]] were the predominant occupants of the [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]], while [[Italian-Americans]] composed a close-knit neighborhood in the west side. The [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]] is now a predominantly African American neighborhood, while the West Side has become a [[melting pot]] of many ethnicities, with [[Latino]] culture being the strongest influence. Throughout the history of Buffalo, the neighborhoods collectively called the First Ward, as well as much of [[South Buffalo]], have comprised almost entirely people of [[Irish descent]]. Recently, there has been an influx of inhabitants that are of Arab descent, mainly from [[Yemen]], as the city's [[Muslim]] population has increased to approximately 3000 according to an estimate.&lt;ref&gt;http://wings.buffalo.edu/sa/muslim/LocalMosques.htm {{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s and 1960s, the greater portion of the Jewish population has moved to the [[suburban]] areas outside of the city, or to the city's upper West Side.

===Metropolitan area===
{{Main|Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area}}

As of 2006, [[Erie County, New York|Erie]] and [[Niagara County|Niagara]] Counties had a combined estimated population of 1,154,378.&lt;ref name=&quot;suny_rkn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rkn.buffalo.edu/data/topicdata.cfm?Topic=100&amp;Region=777|title=SUNY Buffalo Regional Knowledge Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racial makeup of the area is 82.2% [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|White]], 13% [[African American]], 0.6% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], 1.32% [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Asian]], 3.3% [[Hispanic]], and 1.4% of all [[other races]].

==Economy==
[[File:20080310 Soldiers and Sailors edit.JPG|thumb|right|Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, [[Lafayette Square, Buffalo|Lafayette Square]]]]

===History===
Buffalo and the surrounding area were long involved in railroad commerce, [[steel]] manufacture, [[automobile]] production, aircraft/aerospace design and production, Great Lakes shipping, and grain storage. Most of these industries have left the city through the years. Major steel production no longer exists in the area, although several smaller steel mills remain in operation. For example, Gibraltar Industries, a leading manufacturer, processor, and distributor of steel products for the building, industrial, and vehicular markets is headquartered in Buffalo. As of the [[1950 United States Census]], Buffalo was the 15th largest city in the country, the nation's largest inland port (twelfth overall), second biggest rail center, sixth largest steel producer, and eighth largest manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Greater Look At Greater Buffalo|page=58|publisher=Windsor Publications|isbn=978-0-89781-198-9|year=1986|author=Bisco, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regional economy can now best be described as a mix of industrial, light manufacturing, high technology and service-oriented private sector companies. Instead of relying on a single industry or sector for its economic future, the region has taken a diversified approach that have the potential to create opportunities for growth and expansion in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rkn.buffalo.edu/reports/region_quick_results.cfm?type=4 |title= Binational Buffalo Niagara Region Report |author= University at Buffalo Regional Institute|publisher= UB Regional Institute|year=2011 |work=Regional Knowledge Network |accessdate=2 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===

On October 25, 2008 the United Nations released a report entitled &quot;State of the World's Cities&quot; in which the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area was specifically cited as having one of the worst rates of economic inequality in the world and that it was racially based. The report specifically stated &quot;the report cited figures from western New York state, where 40 per cent of black, Hispanic and ethnically-mixed households earned less than $15,000 in 1999, as compared to 15 per cent of white households.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2008/10/2008102321493551343.html UN: Major inequality in US cities - Americas - Al Jazeera English]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the United States Census department also released information placing the Buffalo-Niagara metro area, as the 8th most segregated area in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/rank_dissimilarity_white_black.html CensusScope - Segregation: Dissimilarity Indices]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
Overall, employment in Buffalo has shifted as its population has declined and manufacturing has left. Buffalo's 2005 unemployment rate was 6.6%, contrasted with New York State's 5.0% rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/wny/WesternSlideShows.asp See Erie County]&lt;/ref&gt; And from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006, Erie County had no net job growth, ranking it 271st among the 326 largest counties in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cewqtr.t01.htm BLS, Table 1. Covered establishments, employment, and wages in the 326 largest counties, fourth quarter 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the area has recently seen an upswing in job growth as unemployment has dropped to only 4.9% in July 2007 from 5.2% in 2006 and 6.6% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/PressReleases/prtbur.txt New York]&lt;/ref&gt; The area's manufacturing jobs have continued to show the largest losses in jobs with over 17,000 fewer than at the start of 2006. Yet other sectors of the economy have outdistanced manufacturing and are seeing large increases. Educational and health services added over 30,400 jobs in 2006 and over 20,500 jobs have been added in the professional and business (mostly finance) arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/ ''bizjournals.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life sciences===
Buffalo has increasingly become a center for [[bioinformatics]] and [[human genome]] research, including work by researchers at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] and the [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute]]. This consortium is known as the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]]. It also includes: Buffalo Hearing &amp; Speech Center, Buffalo Medical Group Foundation, [[Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute]], Kaleida Health, Olmsted Center for the Visually Impaired, Cleveland BioLabs and Upstate New York Transplant Services. The DNA samples used in The Human Genome Project were also collected from anonymous donors from Buffalo.

Entrepreneurial resources and life science business consultants accelerate the growth and development of emerging companies found within the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]] and Upstate New York Region. For example, Buffalo BioSciences is a technology commercialization partner to the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics &amp; Life Sciences and contributed to the launch and early success of Empire Genomics&amp;nbsp;–- a firm based on research conducted at Roswell Park Cancer Institute by Dr. Norma Nowak enabling {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the delivery of personalized medicine.

===Banking===
Buffalo is the headquarters of [[M&amp;T Bank]], a large regional bank with assets over $69B.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mtb.com/aboutus/Pages/WhoIsMT.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; [[HSBC Bank USA]] also has major operations in Buffalo (The sports arena, which hosts the [[Buffalo Sabres]] [[National Hockey League|NHL]] franchise, is named [[HSBC Arena (Buffalo)|HSBC Arena]]). Other banks, such as [[Bank of America]] and [[KeyBank]] have corporate operations in Buffalo. [[Citigroup]] also has regional offices in [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], Buffalo's largest suburb. Buffalo has also become a hub of the debt collection industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Thompson | first = Carolyn | authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Buffalo's debt collectors accused of bullying =| agency = Associated Press| date = 2010-01-05| url = http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Buffalos-debt-collectors-apf-2226423347.html?x=0| doi =| accessdate = 2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[First Niagara Bank]] recently moved its headquarters to downtown Buffalo from nearby [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]]. First Niagara has branches from Buffalo to [[Albany, New York]], and since September 2009 has had branches as far south as [[Pittsburgh]]. On September 10, 2009, First Niagara announced the relocation of its corporate headquarters from Lockport to downtown Buffalo. The company says facilities in Lockport will remain open and fully staffed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fnfg.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=847 First Niagara © 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; First Niagara, which had been considering expanding into [[Western Pennsylvania]] for some time,&lt;ref name=PNC&gt;[http://kdka.com/business/PNC.First.Niagara.2.978660.html KDKA-TV] {{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; benefited from [[PNC Financial Services]] being required by the [[United States Department of Justice]] to sell off 50 [[National City Corp.|National City]] branches in the [[Pittsburgh]] area and 11 more branches in and around [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] to competitors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/branches-divested.pdf United States Department of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; since the two banks had significant overlap in [[Western Pennsylvania]] and had potential [[antitrust]] issues in that area. First Niagara took advantage by buying 57 of the 61 National City branches from PNC that had to be divested after PNC acquired National City with funds from the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|$700 billion bailout plan]] after National City became a victim of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. The move affected the area by creating 200 more jobs, some in the Buffalo area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnfg.com/pdf/pressRelease_04072009.pdf First Niagara © 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Buffalo is home to [[Rich Products]], one of the world's largest family-owned food manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rich.com/business.cfm Rich Products Corporation :: Our Business]/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labatt]] moved its US headquarters to Buffalo in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonawanda-news.com/business/x681731064/LABATT-USA-Company-opens-new-headquarters-in-Buffalo?keyword=secondarystory LABATT USA: Company opens new headquarters in Buffalo » Business » Tonawanda News]/&lt;/ref&gt; This is in large part due to Buffalo's location directly in the middle of the Northeastern Trade Corridor. The city is the heart of the Canadian-American corridor. Over 80% of all U.S.-Canada trade occurs via border crossings in the eastern United States and with five bridges to Canada, the Buffalo area is one of the key eastern border crossing locations. Cheese company [[Sorrento Lactalis]] is also based in Buffalo.

[[New Era Cap Company]], the largest sports-licensed headwear company in the United States, is based in Buffalo. It opened new headquarters in 2007 in the former [[Federal Reserve]] Building in downtown Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.neweracap.com/category/14/About_New_Era/page/119/HISTORY.aspx History Timeline of the New Era Cap Company]/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trico]] company operated three major manufacturing facilities but has since closed all of them and moved operations to [[Mexico]]. For many years, Buffalo was the nation's second largest [[rail transport|rail]] center, after [[Chicago]]. Milk Bone dog biscuits are still manufactured in a small factory on the city's East Side.

Regionally based insurance companies also have maintained their headquarters in Buffalo, New York. There’s [[Merchants Insurance Group]] and [[Lawley Insurance]]. Merchants Insurance Group is a property and casualty insurance company that provides commercial, personal property and [[casualty insurance]] throughout the Northeast and North Central [[United States]]. Lawley Insurance provides commercial insurance, employee benefits, risk management and personal insurance.

{{See also|List of mayors of Buffalo, New York}}

At the [[City (New York)|municipal]] level, the City of Buffalo has a council made up of the [[mayor]] and nine [[city council|councilmen]]. Buffalo also serves as the seat of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] with 6 of the 15 county legislators representing at least a portion of Buffalo. At the state level, there are three state [[New York State Assembly|assemblymen]] and two state [[New York State Senate|senators]] representing parts of the city proper. At the federal level, Buffalo is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

In a trend common to Northern &quot;[[Rust Belt]]&quot; regions, political life in Buffalo has been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for the last half-century, and has been roiled by racial division and social issues. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/20/beck.cities CNN]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Democratic Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] was first elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the [[Conservative Party (New York)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Right to Life Party]], after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker [[Arthur Eve]]. Griffin switched political allegiance several times during his 14 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat [[Anthony M. Masiello]] (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on social conservatism, often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, however, Democrat [[Byron Brown]] was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%-27%) over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform.

This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. At the urging of [[New York State Comptroller]] [[Alan Hevesi]], the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the [[Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority]]. Conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government were initiated the following year by Mayor Tony Masiello, but came to naught.

There are currently 9 [http://www.city-buffalo.com/Home/Leadership/CommonCouncil common council districts] in The City of Buffalo. They are: Delaware, Ellicott, Fillmore, Lovejoy, Masten, Niagara, North, South, and University.

===Parks===
{{Main|Buffalo, New York parks system}}
[[File:Buffalo Botanical Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens]]]]

One of Buffalo's many monikers is the ''City of Trees'', which describes the abundance of green in the city. In fact, Buffalo has more than 20 parks with multiple ones being accessible from any part of the city.

The Olmsted Park and Parkway System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Begun in 1868 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his partner [[Calvert Vaux]], the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and are maintained by the [http://www.buffaloolmstedparks.org/ Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy].

===Waterfront===
[[File:Buffalo New York aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of the waterfront at Buffalo, New York. The city is to the north. The highway to the right is [[New York State Route 5]]]]
Situated at the confluence of [[Lake Erie]] and the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo]] and [[Niagara River]]s, Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of [[transshipment]], [[manufacturing]], and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade, and industry.

As of 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront is being transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. Recently excavated and rewatered is the Erie Canal Commercial Slip, which is the original western terminus of the Erie Canal System. This is intended to revitalize the original Erie Canal Harbor, with shops, eateries,and high-rise condominiums planned. Buffalo's intent is to stress its relatively architectural and historical heritage, creating a tourism destination.

===Standard of living===
The loss of traditional jobs in manufacturing, rapid suburbanization and high costs of labor have led to economic decline, making Buffalo one of the poorest amongst U.S. cities with populations of more than 250,000 people. An estimated 28.7% of Buffalo residents live below the [[poverty line]]; only [[Detroit]] and [[Cleveland]] have higher rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wgrz.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=60244&amp;catid=37 Buffalo 3rd Poorest Large City].

This, in part, has led to the [[Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area]] having the most affordable housing market in the U.S. today. The quarterly NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) noted that nearly 90% of the new and existing homes sold in the metropolitan area during the second quarter were affordable to families making the area's median income of $57,000. The area median price of homes was $75,000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Buffalo faces issues with vacant and abandoned houses, as the city ranks second only to [[St. Louis]] on the list of American cities with the most vacant properties per capita. Since 2000, the city has torn down 2,000 vacant homes but as many as 10,000 still remain. Mayor Byron W. Brown recently unveiled a $100 million, five-year plan to demolish 5,000 more houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/nyregion/13vacant.html?_r=1&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/B/Belson,%20Ken&amp;oref=slogin Vacant Houses, Scourge of a Beaten-down Buffalo].

==Culture==
===Nicknames===
&quot;The Queen City&quot;, Buffalo's most common moniker, first appeared in print in the 1840s, referring to the city's status as the second largest city in New York State after New York City. &quot;The Queen City&quot; was also used during the 19th century to describe Buffalo as the second largest American city on the [[Great Lakes]] after [[Chicago]]. Buffalo has also been called ''The Nickel City'' due to the appearance of a bison on the back of [[Nickel (U.S. coin)|Indian Head nickel]] in the early part of the 20th century. ''The City of Good Neighbors'' refers to the helpful, friendly spirit of its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title = Buffalo Widely Knows as 'City of Good Neighbors'| newspaper = Washington Afro-American| location =| page = 20| publisher =| date = August 14, 1951| url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&amp;dat=19510814&amp;id=CjsmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rv4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4955,329648| accessdate =April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the city began calling itself the ''City of Light'' both because of the plentiful hydroelectric power made possible by nearby [[Niagara Falls]] and because it was the first city in America to have electric street lights.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityjournal&quot;/&gt;

===People===
Buffalo was first settled primarily by [[New England]]ers. The first wave of European immigrants was a large influx of [[German American|Germans]]. The city was further populated by [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants first, Erie Canal builders and then escaping [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|famine]], and infused by [[Polish American|Polish]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]], and more recently [[Latino]] populations, all of which have made it a [[melting pot]] of ethnic cultures. The newest immigrants are from [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Asia]].

The Old First Ward retains a strong Irish identity, and Kaisertown reflects a German heritage. Buffalo's [[Polonia]] is centered at the Broadway Market on the East Side. The market serves as a microcosm of Polish/Slavic traditions and delicacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The History of the Broadway Market| work =| publisher = The Broadway Market| year = 2009| url = http://broadwaymarket.org/?page_id=2| format =| doi =| accessdate =April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East Side is now home to African Americans, many of whom came north during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. The annual [[Juneteenth]] Festival is a large cultural celebration organized by African Americans&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juneteenthofbuffalo.com/ Juneteenth Festival of Buffalo, NY]. Retrieved 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Park.

The West Side is home to the city's [[Hispanic]] community, predominantly of Puerto Rican descent. The West Side was once Buffalo's &quot;Little Italy,&quot; but in the 1980s much of Buffalo's Italian American community moved to North Buffalo. There is also a small Italian-American enclave in the East Side neighborhood of Lovejoy. Many Buffalo households, churches, and restaurants continue to observe the Sicilian custom of preparing [[St. Joseph's Day]] (March 19) tables, at which various meatless [[Lent]]en courses are laid out for the poor.

Buffalo is also home to a large [[American Jews|Jewish]] community. [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] immigrants originally settled on Buffalo's Westside in the mid-19th century. Lower income [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] and [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] immigrating to the [[Niagara Frontier]] in the early 20th century initially settled on the Lower East Side, near William Street and Jefferson Avenue. The community migrated to the Masten Park neighborhood on the East Side, and then to [[North Buffalo, Buffalo, New York|North Buffalo]] between the 1940s and the 1960s. Although many still live in the city, particularly in North Buffalo and the Delaware District on the city's Westside, the majority of the Buffalo area's Jews now live in the northeastern suburbs. Buffalo's [[Jewish Community Center|Jewish Community centers]] are located in the Delaware District, North Buffalo and Amherst.

Distancing itself from its industrial past, Buffalo is redefining itself as a cultural, banking, [[education]]al, [[medicine|medical]] center and architectural tourism destination.

The New York Times has declared that Buffalo is one of the top cities in America for architecture. Approximately 80 sites are included on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Buffalo, New York|National Register of Historic Places]]. All of the major American architects of the 19th and early 20th century built masterpieces in Buffalo, most of which are still standing. They include:

The country's largest intact parks system designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], including [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Delaware Park]]. Buffalo was the first city for which Olmsted designed (in 1869) an interconnected park and parkway system rather than stand-alone parks.

The [[Prudential (Guaranty) Building (Buffalo, New York)|Guaranty Building]], by [[Louis Sullivan]], was one of the first steel-supported, curtain-walled buildings in the world, and its 13 stories made it, at the time it was built (1895), the tallest building in Buffalo and one of the world's first true skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/tc.html Louis Sullivan - Guaranty / Prudential Building], accessed 7 July 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/tc.html | date=20070702045925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[National Historic Landmark]].

The Hotel Buffalo (originally the Statler Hotel) by August Esenwein and [[James A. Johnson (architect)|James A. Johnson]] was the first hotel in the world to feature a private bath in each room.

The [[H. H. Richardson Complex]], originally the New York State Asylum for the Insane, is [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] in style and was the largest commission designed by prominent architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. The grounds of this hospital were designed by Olmsted. Though currently in a state of disrepair, New York State has allocated funds to restore this treasure.

There are several buildings by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]], [[George Barton House]], [[William R. Heath House]], [[Walter V. Davidson House]], [[Graycliff|The Graycliff Estate]], as well as the now demolished [[Larkin Administration Building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ah.bfn.org/a/soldiers/76/ William Heath House], accessed 7 July 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://ah.bfn.org/a/soldiers/76/  | date=20071228212810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://graycliff.bfn.org/ The Graycliff Estate].

===Nightlife===
{{Original research|date=June 2008}}{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}

[[Last call (bar term)|Last call]] is at 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. in Buffalo, rather than 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. as in most other areas of the U.S. This is often attributed to the historically high density of industrial facilities and the demand of second and third [[shift work|shift]] patrons. It is also because [[New York]] law allows bars to be open until 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. (However, local municipalities can override it to an earlier time.)

Several distinct and thriving [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]] districts have grown around clusters of bars and nightclubs in the city. The most visible nightlife district is West Chippewa Street,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westchippewa.com/ Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabres, Buffalo NightLife, chippewa street, west chippewa street, Chippewa Street, West Chippewa Street]&lt;/ref&gt; located between Main Street and South Elmwood Avenue. The area is home to high-energy dance clubs, crowded bars, trendy coffeehouses, and restaurants. [[Allentown, Buffalo, New York|Allentown]], where bars are as numerous but the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed, is a several minute walk north to Allen Street. Allen Street near Main Street houses several bars, while Allen near Elmwood has many bars that feature live music. Continuing up Elmwood Avenue from Allentown is the Elmwood Strip, which runs about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) to [[Buffalo State College]]. This strip has numerous small boutiques and restaurants, with few large corporate establishments. Crowds on this strip include everyone from college students to families to the elderly.

===Public festivals===
Like many large cities, numerous festivals have become part of the city's culture and tradition. Though most of the festivals occur during the summer months, the city has recently pushed efforts to have winter festivals as well in an effort to capitalize on the region's snowy reputation.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
Buffalo is served by the [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]], located in [[Cheektowaga]]. The airport, recently re-constructed, serves over 5 million passengers a year and is still growing. [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] ranks among the five cheapest airports from which to fly in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The average round trip flight cost is $295.58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Area flies high on low fares|author=Sharon Linstedt|work=[http://www.buffalonews.com/103/story/63037.html Buffalo News]|date=2007-04-24}} {{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years there has been a surge in Canadians flying out of Buffalo, mainly due to much cheaper tax and airline surcharges, as compared with Canadian airports and the ability to fly on some US based discount carriers not available in Canada (for example, [[JetBlue Airways]] and [[Southwest Airlines]]). As of 2006, plans are in the works by U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]] to make the under-used [[Niagara Falls International Airport]] into an international cargo hub for [[New York]] and [[Toronto]], as well as Canada as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Niagara airport pushed as trade hub; Schumer joins effort to bring global cargo|author=Bill Michelmore|work=Buffalo News|page=B1|date=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Main Court Building, Buffalo.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] in downtown]]

===Public transit===
The [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] (NFTA) operates [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] and [[Niagara Falls International Airport]], and the [[public transport|public transit]] system throughout the Buffalo area. The [[NFTA]] operates bus lines throughout the city and suburbs, as well as the [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] transit system in the city.

The [[Buffalo Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] is a {{convert|6.4|mi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} long, single line [[light rail]] system that extends from [[Erie Canal Harbor]] in downtown Buffalo to the [[University Heights, Buffalo, New York|University Heights]] district (specifically, the South Campus of [[University of Buffalo]]) in the northern part of the city. The downtown section of the line runs above ground and is free of charge to passengers. North of Theater Station, at the northern end of downtown, the line moves underground, remaining underground until it reaches the northern terminus of the line at University Heights. Passengers pay a fare to ride this section of the rail.

A new NFTA project is underway, often called &quot;Cars on Main Street&quot;, that will substantially revise the downtown portion of the Metro Rail. It will allow vehicular traffic and Metro Rail cars to share Main St. in a manner similar to that of the trolleys of San Francisco. The design includes new stations and pedestrian-friendly improvements. The first phase of the project, restoring two way traffic on Main Street between Edward and West Tupper, was completed in 2009. When the entire project is complete in the next few years, the downtown portion of Main St. will be re-opened to vehicular traffic for the first time in almost 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Intercity rail===
Two train stations, [[Buffalo-Depew (Amtrak station)|Buffalo-Depew]] and [[Buffalo-Exchange Street Station|Buffalo-Exchange Street]] serve the city and are operated by [[Amtrak]].

Freight service for Buffalo is served by [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Norfolk Southern]] (NS), as well as [[Canadian National]] (CN) and [[Canadian Pacific]] (CP) railroads from across the Border. The area has 4 large rail yards: Frontier (CSX), Bison (NS), SK (NS / CP) and Buffalo Creek (NS / CSX). A large amount of hazardous cargo also crosses through the Buffalo area, such as liquid [[propane]] and [[anhydrous ammonia]].

===Waterways===
Buffalo is at the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]], one of the [[Great Lakes]], which boasts the greatest variety of freshwater sportfish in the country. The Lake serves as a playground for numerous personal yachts, sailboats, power boats and watercraft, and provides a short water route to excellent sand beaches on the nearby [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]] (Canada) shore. The city has an extensive [[breakwall]] system protecting its inner and outer Lake Erie [[harbor]]s, which are maintained at commercial navigation depths for [[Great Lakes]] freighters.

A Lake Erie tributary that flows through south Buffalo is the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]], for which the city is named. Buffalo is historically linked to the fabled [[Erie Canal]], which ends where the [[Black Rock Channel]] enters [[Lake Erie]]. When the Canal was dedicated in 1825, its conceiver, New York State governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] took waters from Lake Erie at Buffalo's Western Terminus of the Canal (now the [[Commercial Slip]]). He sailed to New York City on the Canal packet ''[[Seneca Chief]]'', which later returned to Buffalo with Atlantic Ocean water. The seawater was poured into the Lake by Judge and future Buffalo Mayor [[Samuel Wilkeson]]. Once a major route for passengers and cargo, the Canal is now used primarily for pleasure craft and some light local freight, and in Buffalo it bypasses the swift upper reach of the [[Niagara River]]. A tributary of the Niagara River is [[Scajaquada Creek]], which flows though Buffalo, via the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed Delaware Lake and Park.

===National and state highway access===

==Federal offices==
===US Army Corps of Engineers===
The offices of the Buffalo District, [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] are located adjacent to the Black Rock Lock in the Black Rock channel of the [[Erie Canal]]. In addition to maintaining and operating the lock, the District is responsible for planning, design, construction and maintenance of water resources projects in an area extending from [[Toledo, Ohio]] to [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]]. These include the [[Mount Morris Dam|flood-control dam]] at [[Mount Morris (town), New York|Mount Morris, New York]], oversight of the lower [[Great Lakes]] ([[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]]), review and permitting of wetlands construction, and remedial action for hazardous waste sites.

Buffalo is also the home of a major office of the [[National Weather Service]] (NOAA), which serves all of western and much of central New York State.

===Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)===
Buffalo is home to one of the 56 national FBI field offices. The field office covers all of Western New York and parts of the Southern Tier and Central New York. The field office operates several task forces in conjunction with local agencies to help combat issues such as gang violence, terrorism threats and health care fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buffalo.fbi.gov/ FBI Buffalo Division]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Franklin''' ({{OldStyleDateDY|January 17,|1706|January 6, 1705&lt;!-- 1705 is correct. In Old Style, new year began March 25--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Engber&quot;&gt;Engber, Daniel (2006). [http://www.slate.com/id/2134455/ What's Benjamin Franklin's Birthday?]. Retrieved June 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{ndash}} April 17, 1790) was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States of America]]. A noted [[polymath]], Franklin was a leading author and printer, [[list of political philosophers|political theorist]], [[Politics of the United States|politician]], [[United States Postal Service|postmaster]], scientist, inventor, [[Satire|satirist]], civic activist, statesman, and [[Timeline of United States diplomatic history|diplomat]]. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the [[American Enlightenment]] and the [[history of physics]] for his discoveries and theories regarding [[electricity]]. He invented the [[lightning rod]], [[bifocals]], the [[Franklin stove]], a carriage [[odometer]], and the [[glass harmonica#Benjamin Franklin's armonica|glass 'armonica']]. He formed both the first public [[lending library]] in America and the first [[fire department]] in Pennsylvania.

Franklin earned the title of &quot;The First American&quot; for his early and indefatigable campaigning for [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial unity]]; as an author and spokesman in [[London]] for several colonies, then as the first [[United States Ambassador to France]], he exemplified the emerging American nation.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Brands, ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical and democratic values of thrift, hard work, [[education in the United States|education]], [[community spirit]], self-governing institutions, and opposition to [[authoritarianism]] both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In the words of historian [[Henry Steele Commager]], &quot;In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of [[Puritanism]] without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Walter Isaacson]], this makes Franklin &quot;the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin, always proud of his [[working class]] roots, became a successful newspaper editor and printer in [[Philadelphia]], the leading city in the colonies. He was also partners with [[William Goddard (US patriot/publisher)|William Goddard]] and [[Joseph Galloway]] the three of whom published the [[Pennsylvania Chronicle]], a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the [[British monarchy]] in the American colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian+Constitutional Post&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a1f_wgoddard.html |title=William Goddard and the Constitutional Post |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became wealthy publishing ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' and ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette (newspaper)|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. Franklin gained international renown as a scientist for his famous experiments in electricity and for his many inventions, especially the lightning rod. He played a major role in establishing the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and was elected the first president of the [[American Philosophical Society]]. Franklin became a national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] repeal the unpopular [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive [[France–United States relations|Franco-American relations]]. For many years he was the British postmaster for the colonies, which enabled him to set up the first national communications network. He was active in community affairs, colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|governor of Pennsylvania]]. Toward the end of his life, he freed his slaves and became one of the most prominent [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]].

His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of America's most influential [[Founding Fathers]], have seen Franklin honored on coinage and [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|money]]; [[USS Benjamin Franklin (SSBN-640)|warships]]; [[List of places named for Benjamin Franklin|the names of many towns]], counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references.

==Ancestry==
Franklin's father, [[Josiah Franklin]] was a [[tallow]] chandler, a soap-maker and a candle-maker. Josiah was born at [[Ecton]], [[Northamptonshire]], England on December 23, 1657, the son of Thomas Franklin, a blacksmith-farmer, and Jane White. His mother, Abiah Folger, was born in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], on August 15, 1667, to Peter Folger, a miller and schoolteacher and his wife [[Mary Morrill]], a former [[indentured servant]].

Josiah Franklin had 17 children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and emigrated with her to Boston in 1683; they had three children before emigrating, and four after. After her death, Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689 in the [[Old South Meeting House]] by [[Samuel Willard]]. Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin's 15th child and tenth and last son.

Ben Franklin's mother, Abiah Folger, was born into a [[Puritan]] family among those that fled to Massachusetts to establish a purified [[Congregationalist]] Christianity in New England, when [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] began persecuting Puritans. They sailed for Boston in 1635. Her father was &quot;the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson 2003, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; as [[court clerk|clerk of the court]], he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy Penn family that owned the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Colony]].

==Early life==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace 2.JPG|thumb|upright|Franklin's birthplace on [[Milk Street]], [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]]]
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin's birthplace site directly across from [[Old South Meeting House]] on [[Milk Street]] is commemorated by a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] above the second floor facade of this building]]

Benjamin Franklin was born on [[Milk Street]], in [[Boston]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], on January 17, 1706&lt;ref name=&quot;Engber&quot; /&gt; and [[Infant baptism|baptized]] at Old South Meeting House. Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy, but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended [[Boston Latin School]] but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although &quot;his parents talked of the church as a career&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Franklin |first= Benjamin |authormask= 2 |title= Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=qW4VAAAAYAAJ |accessdate= February 1, 2011 |series= Macmillan's pocket English and American classics |origyear= 1771 |year= 1901 |publisher= Macmillan |location= New York |page= vi |chapter= Introduction}}&lt;!-- Note: the introduction of this edition is the source for this quote; please do not change the edition without verifying the quote remains sourced. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He then worked for his father for a time and at 12 he became an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James founded ''[[The New-England Courant]]'', which was [[History of American newspapers|the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies]]. When denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of &quot;[[Mrs. Silence Dogood]]&quot;, a middle-aged widow. &quot;Mrs. Dogood&quot;'s letters were published, and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the ''Courant'''s readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin left his apprenticeship without permission, and in so doing became a fugitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;&gt;Van Doren, Carl. ''Benjamin Franklin''. (1938). Penguin reprint 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived he worked in several printer shops around town. However, he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor [[William Keith (colonial governor)|Sir William Keith]] to go to [[London]], ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper to be empty, Franklin worked as a [[typesetter]] in a printer's shop in what is now the [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, a merchant who employed Franklin as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

In 1727, Benjamin Franklin, then 21, created the [[Junto (club)|Junto]], a group of &quot;like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community.&quot; The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia.

Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library, initially assembled from their own books. This did not suffice, however. Franklin then conceived the idea of a [[subscription library]], which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]]: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, [[Louis Timothee]].
Originally, the books were kept in the homes of the first librarians, but in 1739 the collection was moved to the second floor of the State House of Pennsylvania, now known as [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]. In 1791, a new building was built specifically for the library. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and [[research library]] with 500,000 rare books, pamphlets, and broadsides, more than 160,000 manuscripts, and 75,000 graphic items.

Upon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. In 1728, Franklin had set up a printing house in partnership with Hugh Meredith and the following year became the publisher of a newspaper called ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette (newspaper)|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. The ''Gazette'' gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect. But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

In 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lodge. He became Grand Master in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[[History (TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Mysteries of the Freemasons: America'', video documentary, August 1, 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/franklin_b/franklin_b.html |title=Freemasonry Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon website |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson's]] ''[[Masonic manuscripts|Constitutions of the Free-Masons]]''. Franklin remained a Freemason for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Van Horne, John C. &quot;The History and Collections of the Library Company of Philadelphia,&quot; ''The Magazine Antiques'', v. 170. no. 2: 58–65 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lemay, J.

===Common-law marriage to Deborah Read===
{{double image|right|Deborah ReadFranklin.jpg|160|Sarah Franklin Bache1793.jpg|160|[[Deborah Read|Deborah Read Franklin]]&lt;br /&gt;(circa 1759). Common-law wife of Benjamin Franklin|[[Sarah Franklin Bache]] (1743–1808). Daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read}}
At the age of 17, Franklin proposed to 15-year-old [[Deborah Read]] while a boarder in the Read home. At that time, Read's mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin, who was on his way to London at Governor [[William Keith (colonial governor)|Sir William Keith's]] request, and also because of his financial instability. Her own husband had recently died, and Mrs. Read declined Franklin's request to marry her daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

While Franklin was in London, his trip was extended, and there were problems with Sir William's promises of support. Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This proved to be a regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to [[Barbados]] with her [[dowry]], leaving Deborah behind. Rodgers's fate was unknown, and because of bigamy laws, Deborah was not free to remarry.

Franklin established a [[common-law marriage]] with Deborah Read on September 1, 1730, and besides taking in Franklin's young, recently acknowledged illegitimate son, William, together they had two children. The first, Francis Folger Franklin, born October 1732, died of [[smallpox]] in 1736. Their second child, [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah Franklin]], familiarly called Sally, was born in 1743. She eventually married [[Richard Bache]], had seven children, and cared for her father in his old age.

Deborah's fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe, despite his repeated requests. However, Franklin did not leave London to visit Deborah even after she wrote to him in November 1769 saying her illness was due to “dissatisfied distress” from his prolonged absence.&lt;ref&gt;November 1769 [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=16&amp;page=230a Letter] from Deborah Read to Ben Franklin, ''franklinpapers.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Read Franklin died of a [[stroke]] in 1774, while Franklin was on an extended trip to England.

===Illegitimate son William===
[[Image:WilliamFranklin.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[William Franklin]]]]
In 1730, at the age of 24, Franklin publicly acknowledged an illegitimate son named [[William Franklin|William]],&lt;ref&gt;Skemp SL. William Franklin: son of a patriot, servant of a king. Oxford University Press US, 1990, ISBN 0195057457, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; who would eventually become the last Loyalist governor of [[New Jersey]]. While the identity of William's mother remains unknown, perhaps the responsibility of an infant child gave Franklin a reason to take up residence with Deborah Read. William was raised in the Franklin household but eventually broke with his father over opinions regarding the treatment of the colonies by the British government. The elder Franklin could never accept William's decision to declare his loyalty to the crown.

Any hope of reconciliation was shattered when William Franklin became leader of The Board of Associated Loyalists—a quasi-military organization, headquartered in British-occupied [[New York City]], which, among other things, launched guerilla forays into New Jersey, southern Connecticut, and New York counties north of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Thomas, &quot;The Perils of Peace: America's Struggle for Survival&quot;, (Collins, NY, 2007) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain &quot;...Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea (that they be given a general pardon). He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; William left New York along with the British troops. He settled in England, never to return.

===Success as an author===
In 1733, Franklin began to publish the famous ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. &quot;Poor Richard's Proverbs,&quot; adages from this almanac, such as &quot;A penny saved is twopence dear&quot; (often misquoted as &quot;A penny saved is a penny earned&quot;) and &quot;Fish and visitors stink in three days&quot; remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year (a circulation equivalent to nearly three million today).&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

In 1758, the year he ceased writing for the Almanack, he printed ''Father Abraham's Sermon'', also known as [[The Way to Wealth]]. Franklin's [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]], begun in 1771 but published after his death, has become one of the classics of the genre. [[Daylight saving time]] (DST) is often erroneously attributed to a 1784 satire that Franklin published [[anonymity|anonymously]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Inventions and scientific inquiries==
[[File:Glassharmonica.png|thumb|[[Glass Armonica]]]]

Franklin was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the [[lightning rod]], [[glass armonica]] (a glass instrument, not to be confused with the metal harmonica), [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals|bifocal glasses]] and the flexible [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheter]]. Franklin never patented his inventions; in his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] he wrote, &quot;... as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin
|chapter=Part three

|url=http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page55.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His inventions also included [[social innovation]]s, such as [[pay it forward|paying forward]]. Franklin's fascination with innovation could be viewed as altruistic; he wrote that his scientific works were to be used for increasing efficiency and human improvement. One such improvement was his effort to expedite news services through his printing presses.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin. &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;. [http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedNames.jsp FranklinPapers.org], October 23, 1729&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic Ocean currents===

As deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] Ocean circulation patterns. While in England in 1768 he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packet ships carrying mail several weeks longer to reach [[New York]] than it took an average merchant ship to reach [[Newport, Rhode Island]]&amp;nbsp;– despite the merchantmen having a longer and more complex voyage because they left from [[London]], while the packets left from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in [[Cornwall]]?

Franklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger, a Nantucket whaler captain, who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current while the mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of {{convert|3|mph|km/h|0}}. Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the [[Gulf Stream]], by which it is still known today.

Franklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England, where it was completely ignored. Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786. The British edition of the chart, which was the original, was so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole Oceanographer]] and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip L. Richardson (February 8, 1980) &quot;Benjamin Franklin and Timothy Folger's first printed chart of the Gulf Stream,&quot; ''Science'', vol. 207, no. 4431, pages 643-645.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/special_packages/inquirer/How_Franklin_s_chart_resurfaced.html &quot;How Franklin's chart resurfaced&quot;], The Philadelphia Inquirer, posted December 18, 2005, accessed November 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This find received front page coverage in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John N. Wilford, &quot;Prints of Franklin's chart of Gulf Stream found,&quot; ''New York Times'' (N.Y., N.Y.), pages A1, B7 (February 6, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

It took many years for British sea captains finally to adopt Franklin's advice on navigating the current; once they did, they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time.&lt;ref&gt;1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations', The Academy of Natural Sciences, April 1939&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html ''1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations' ''.] NOAA Ocean Explorer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, oceanographer and cartographer [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] reminded that Franklin only charted and codified the Gulf Stream, he did not actually ''discover'' it:

{{quote|Though it was Dr. Franklin and Captain Tim Folger, who first turned the Gulf Stream to nautical account, the discovery that there was a Gulf Stream cannot be said to belong to either of them, for its existence was known to [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], and to [[Sir Humphrey Gilbert]], in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Explanations and Sailing Directions to Accompany the Wind and Current Charts, 1853, p.53, by [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===No longer a printer===
In 1743, Franklin founded the [[American Philosophical Society]] to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

[[File:BenFranklin Waterspout 1806.jpg|thumb|An illustration from Franklin's paper on &quot;[[waterspout|Water-spouts]] and Whirlwinds.&quot;]]

In 1747, he retired from printing and went into other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Green, &quot;English Books and Printing in the Age of Franklin,&quot; in ''The Colonial Book in the Atlantic World'' (2002), 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He created a partnership with his foreman, David Hall, which provided Franklin with half of the shop's profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with educated persons throughout Europe and especially in France.

===Electricity===

His discoveries resulted from his investigations of electricity. Franklin proposed that &quot;vitreous&quot; and &quot;resinous&quot; electricity were not different types of &quot;[[Aether theories|electrical fluid]]&quot; (as electricity was called then), but the same electrical fluid under different pressures. He was the first to label them as [[electric charge|positive and negative]] respectively,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/FranklinBenjamin.html ''Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790).''] Science World, from Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the first to discover the principle of [[charge conservation|conservation of charge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physchem.co.za/Static%20Electricity/Charge.htm ''Conservation of Charge''.]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750 he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that lightning is electricity by [[Kite experiment|flying a kite in a storm]] that appeared capable of becoming a [[lightning]] storm. On May 10, 1752 [[Thomas-François Dalibard]] of France conducted Franklin's experiment using a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}}-tall iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15 Franklin may possibly have conducted his famous kite experiment [[St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, Philadelphia#Franklin|in Philadelphia]], successfully extracting sparks from a cloud. Franklin's experiment was not written up with credit&lt;ref&gt;Steven Johnson (2008) in ''The Invention of Air'', p.39 notes that Franklin published a description of the kite experiment in ''[[The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' without claiming he had performed the experiment himself, a fact he shared with Priestley 15 years later.&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Joseph Priestley|Joseph Priestley's]] 1767 ''History and Present Status of Electricity''; the evidence shows that Franklin was insulated (not in a conducting path, where he would have been in danger of [[electric shock|electrocution]]). Others, such as Prof. [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] were indeed electrocuted during the months following Franklin's experiment.

In his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of [[ground (electricity)|electrical ground]]. If Franklin did perform this experiment, he may not have done it in the way that is often described, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it could have been dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mos.org/sln/toe/kite.html ''Franklin's Kite''.] Museum of Science, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular television program [[MythBusters]] simulated the alleged &quot;key at the end of a string&quot; Franklin experiment and established with a degree of certainty that, if Franklin had indeed proceeded thus, he would undoubtedly have been killed. Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, which implied that lightning was electrical.

On October 19 in a letter to England explaining directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote:

{{quote|When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or [[Leiden jar]], maybe charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, A., ''History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century''. New York, 1939. p.232&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Franklin's electrical experiments led to his invention of the lightning rod. He noted that conductors with a sharp rather than a smooth point were capable of discharging silently, and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this knowledge could be of use in protecting buildings from lightning by attaching &quot;upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground;...Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!&quot; Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Krider, E. Philip. [http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-59/iss-1/p42.html ''Benjamin Franklin and Lightning Rods''.] Physics Today. January 2006. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his work with electricity, Franklin received the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]] [[Copley Medal]] in 1753 and in 1756 he became one of the few 18th century Americans to be elected as a Fellow of the Society. The [[centimetre gram second system of units|cgs]] unit of electric charge has been named after him: one ''franklin'' (Fr) is equal to one [[statcoulomb]].

===Wave theory of light===

Franklin was, along with his contemporary [[Leonard Euler]], the only major scientist who supported [[Christiaan Huygens|Christiaan Huygens']] [[wave theory of light]], which was basically ignored by the rest of the [[scientific community]]. In the 18th century [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[corpuscular theory of light|corpuscular theory]] was held to be true; only after [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young's]] famous [[slit experiment]] were most scientists persuaded to believe Huygens' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Jogn Gribbin, &quot;&quot;In search of Schrödinger's cat&quot;&quot;, Black Swan, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meteorology===

On October 21, 1743, according to popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Franklin was said to have noted that the [[prevailing winds]] were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced [[meteorology]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidorn, Keith C. Heidorn, PhD. [http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2003/alm03oct.htm ''Eclipsed By Storm''.] The Weather Doctor. October 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept of cooling===

Franklin noted a principle of [[refrigeration]] by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments. In 1758 on a warm day in [[Cambridge]], England, Franklin and fellow scientist [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]] experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury [[thermometer]] with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and using [[bellows]] to evaporate the ether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |title=The Writings of Benjamin Franklin: London, 1757 - 1775 |publisher=Historycarper.com |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With each subsequent [[evaporation]], the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching 7&amp;nbsp;°F (−14&amp;nbsp;°C). Another thermometer showed the room [[temperature]] to be constant at 65&amp;nbsp;°F (18&amp;nbsp;°C). In his letter ''[[Cooling by Evaporation]],'' Franklin noted that &quot;one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer’s day.&quot;

===Temperature's effect on electrical conductivity===

According to [[Michael Faraday]], Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice are worth mentioning although the law of the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes is not attributed to Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |title=Experimental researches in electricity |url=http://books.google.com/?id=XuITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=non-conduction+of+ice#v=onepage&amp;q=non-conduction%20of%20ice |page=v |volume=2 |year=1839 |publisher=R. &amp; J.E. Taylor |quote= ...Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice...}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as reported in 1836 by Prof. A. D. Bache of the University of Pennsylvania, the law of the effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non-conductors, for example, glass, could be attributed to Franklin. Franklin writes, &quot;...A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct...&quot; and again, &quot;...And water, though naturally a good conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into ice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Thomas P. |title=Journal of the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania |url=http://books.google.com/?id=zV9DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=Thomas+P.+Jones+1836+Journal+of+the+Franklin+Institute+vol.xvii&amp;q= |pages=182–183 |year=1836 |quote=In the fourth series of his electrical researches, Mr. Faraday... |publisher=Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanography findings===

An aging Franklin accumulated all his oceanographic findings in ''Maritime Observations'', published by the Philosophical Society's ''transactions'' in 1786.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Musical endeavors==
Franklin is known to have played the [[violin]], the [[harp]], and the [[guitar]]. He also composed music, notably a [[string quartet]] in [[classical period (music)|early classical style]], and invented a much-improved version of the [[glass armonica]], in which the glasses rotate on a shaft, with the player's fingers held steady, instead of the other way around; this version soon found its way to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Thomas. [http://www.finkenbeiner.com/gh.html ''The Glassharmonica''.] GFI Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess==
Franklin was an avid [[chess]] player. He was playing chess by around 1733, making him the first chess player known by name in the American colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCraryChessandFranklin&quot;&gt;John McCrary, [http://www.benfranklin300.org/_etc_pdf/Chess_John_McCrary.pdf ''Chess and Benjamin Franklin-His Pioneering Contributions''] ([[PDF]]).

==Public life==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1759.jpg|thumb|left|Benjamin Franklin by [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)|Benjamin Wilson]], 1759.]]

In 1736, Franklin created the [[Union Fire Company]], one of the first volunteer [[firefighting]] companies in [[United States|America]]. In the same year, he printed a new currency for [[New Jersey]] based on innovative anti-[[counterfeit]]ing techniques he had devised. Throughout his career, Franklin was an advocate for [[Banknote|paper money]], publishing ''A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency'' in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped deflation without causing excessive inflation. In 1766 he made a case for paper money to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. (1975). ''Money: Where It Came, Whence It Went'' pp. 54–54. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he set forth a scheme for [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia]]. He was appointed president of the academy on November 13, 1749, and it opened on August 13, 1751. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and one as [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]]. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania.

Franklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman, in June 1749 he became a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Philadelphia, and in 1751 he was elected to the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]]. On August 10, 1753, Franklin was appointed joint deputy postmaster-general of North America. His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, with mail sent out every week.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

In 1751, Franklin and [[Thomas Bond (physician)|Dr. Thomas Bond]] obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] was the first hospital in what was to become the United States of America.
[[File:PennsylvaniaHospitalWilliamStrickland.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Hospital]] by [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]], 1755]]

In 1753, both [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] awarded him [[honorary degree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gophila.com/Go/PressRoom/pressreleases/ben300/Resume_Ben_Franklin_Fact_Sheet.aspx ''Benjamin Franklin resume''.] Official Visitor Site for Greater Philadelphia. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the [[Albany Congress]]. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the [[Board of Trade]] in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad [[Albany Plan|Plan of Union]] for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the Constitution.

In 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia (see &quot;Associated Regiment of Philadelphia&quot; under heading of Pennsylvania's 103rd Artillery and [[111th Infantry Regiment (United States)|111th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Continental Army]]). He used [[Tun Tavern]] as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the Native American uprisings that beset the American colonies. Reportedly Franklin was elected &quot;Colonel&quot; of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor.
[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|right|thumb|[[Join, or Die]]: This political cartoon by Franklin urged the colonies to join together during the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]).]]

Also in 1756, Franklin became a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (now [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|Royal Society of Arts]] or RSA, which had been founded in 1754), whose early meetings took place in [[Coffeehouse|coffee shops]] in London's [[Covent Garden]] district, close to Franklin's main residence in Craven Street. 

The Craven street residence is the only of his residences to survive. It opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]] museum on January 17, 2006. 

After his return to America, Franklin became the Society's Corresponding Member and remained closely connected with the Society. The RSA instituted a [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Franklin's birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.

[[File:Sketch of Tun Tavern in the Revolutionary War.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of the original [[Tun Tavern]]]]
In 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the Penn family, the proprietors of the colony. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in [[Whitehall]] led to the failure of this mission.

Whilst in [[London]], Franklin became involved in radical politics. He was a member of the Club of Honest Whigs, alongside thinkers such as [[Richard Price]], the minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] who ignited the [[Revolution Controversy]]. During his stays at Craven Street between 1757 and 1775, Franklin developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly.

In 1759, he visited [[Edinburgh]] with his son, and recalled his conversations there as &quot;the ''densest'' happiness of my life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. ''Crowded with Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind''. HarperCollins Publishers. 2003. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree and in October of the same year he was granted [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the Borough]] of [[St. Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katekennedyclub.org.uk/news.aspx#19 |title=The Kate Kennedy Club |publisher=The Kate Kennedy Club |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] awarded Franklin an honorary doctorate for his scientific accomplishments and from then on he went by &quot;Doctor Franklin.&quot; He also managed to secure a post for his illegitimate son, William Franklin, as [[Governor of New Jersey|Colonial Governor of New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;

He also joined the influential [[Birmingham]] based [[Lunar Society]] with whom he regularly corresponded and on occasion, visited in Birmingham in the West Midlands.

At this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania#Proprietors|William Penn's heirs]], who controlled the colony as [[proprietary colony|proprietors]]. Franklin led the &quot;anti-proprietary party&quot; in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Speaker of the Pennsylvania House]] in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship, but during this visit, events would drastically change the nature of his mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot;&gt;J. A. Leo Lemay, &quot;Franklin, Benjamin&quot;. ''[[American National Biography]] Online'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe years===
In London, Franklin opposed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]], but when he was unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and his testimony before the House of Commons led to its repeal. With this, Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies, and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Massachusetts]] also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot; /&gt;

Painting by [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]], displayed in the [[White House]].]]

In September 1767, Franklin visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, [[John Pringle|Sir John Pringle]]. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isaacson&quot;&gt;Isaacson, Walter. ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life''. Simon &amp; Schuster. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in London in 1768, he developed a [[Benjamin Franklin's phonetic alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] in ''A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling''. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. His new alphabet, however, never caught on and he eventually lost interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/franklin.htm ''Benjamin Franklin's Phonetic Alphabet''.] Omniglot.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1771, Franklin made short journeys through different parts of [[England]], staying with [[Joseph Priestley]] at [[Leeds]], [[Thomas Percival]] at [[Manchester]] and Dr. Darwin at [[Litchfield, Hampshire|Litchfield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sparks&quot;&gt;Sparks, Jared. [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/biography/chap05.htm ''Life of Benjamin Franklin''.] US History.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin belonged to a gentleman's club (designated &quot;honest Whigs&quot; by Franklin), which held stated meetings, and included members such as [[Richard Price]] and [[Andrew Kippis]]. He was also a corresponding member of the [[Lunar Society]] of [[Birmingham]], which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as [[Matthew Boulton]], [[James Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgewood]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]]. He had never been to Ireland before, and met and stayed with [[Lord Hillsborough]], whom he believed was especially attentive, but of whom he noted that &quot;all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BL1VXdTbDucC&amp;pg=PR21 |title=Google Books&amp;nbsp;— Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin By Benjamin Franklin, Nathan Haskell Dole, 2003 |publisher=Books.google.ie |date= March 31, 2003|accessdate=September 21, 2009|isbn=9780766143753}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dublin]], Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to be given this honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;sparks&quot; /&gt; While touring Ireland, he was moved by the level of poverty he saw. Ireland's economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of Britain that governed America. Franklin feared that America could suffer the same effects should Britain’s &quot;colonial exploitation&quot; continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/exp_worldly_ireland.html ''Benjamin Franklin''.] PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, he spent five days with [[Lord Kames]] near [[Stirling]] and stayed for three weeks with [[David Hume]] in [[Edinburgh]].

In 1773, Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: [[s:Rules By Which A Great Empire May Be Reduced To A Small One|''Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One'']], and ''An Edict by the King of Prussia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/pa-1773.htm|title=reprinted on The History Carper.|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published an ''Abridgment of the Book of Common Prayer'', anonymously with [[Francis Dashwood, 15th Baron le Despencer|Francis Dashwood]]. Among the unusual features of this work is a [[funeral|funeral service]] reduced to six minutes in length, &quot;to preserve the health and lives of the living.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isaacson&quot;/&gt;

===Hutchinson letters===
{{main|Hutchinson Letters Affair}}
Franklin obtained private letters of Massachusetts governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] and lieutenant governor [[Andrew Oliver]] that proved they were encouraging London to crack down on the rights of Bostonians. Franklin sent them to America where they escalated the tensions. Franklin now appeared to the British as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] [[Alexander Wedderburn]], before the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] on January 29, 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/franklin-break.html |title=Break with Britain: Benjamin Franklin: In His Own Words...

===Coming of Revolution===
In 1763, soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The [[Paxton Boys]], a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] raids, murdered a group of peaceful [[Susquehannock]] Indians and then marched on Philadelphia. Franklin helped to organize a local militia to defend the capital against the mob, and then met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the [[racism|racial prejudice]] of the Paxton Boys. &quot;If an ''Indian'' injures me,&quot; he asked, &quot;does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all ''Indians''?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin.

By the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, the [[American Revolution]] had begun with fighting at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]. The New England [[militia]] had trapped the main British army in Boston. The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isaacson&quot;/&gt;

At the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by [[John Hancock|Hancock]] that they must all hang together: &quot;Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

On July 26, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] established the [[United States Post Office]] and named Benjamin Franklin as the first [[United States Postmaster General]]. Franklin had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson. ''Benjamin Franklin: an American life'' pp. 206-9, 301&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin had just returned from England and was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system. The report of the Committee, providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies, was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26. On July 26, 1775, Franklin was appointed Postmaster General, the first appointed under the Continental Congress. It established a postal system that became the United States Post Office, a system that is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blmailus1.htm#CONGRESS The New York Times Company/About.com]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Ambassador to France: 1776–1785===
[[File:Franklin1877.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin, in his [[fur]] hat, charmed the French with what they saw as rustic new world [[genius]].&lt;ref&gt;Such was the number of portraits, busts and medallions of him in circulation before he left Paris that he would have been recognized from them by any adult citizen in any part of the civilized world. Many of these portraits bore inscriptions, the most famous of which was [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot's]] line, &quot;{{lang|la|Eripuit fulmen coelo sceptrumque tyrannis.}}&quot; (He snatched the lightning from the skies and the scepter from the tyrants.)&amp;nbsp;— {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Franklin, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]In December 1776, Franklin was dispatched to France as [[commissioner]] for the United States. He lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of [[Passy]], donated by [[Jacques-Donatien Le Ray|Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont]] who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785. He conducted the affairs of his country towards the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and negotiating the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]. During his stay in France, Benjamin Franklin was active as a [[freemasonry|freemason]], serving as Grand Master of the Lodge [[Les Neuf Sœurs]] from 1779 until 1781. His number was 24 in the Lodge. He was also a Past Grand Master of Pennsylvania. In 1784, when [[Franz Mesmer]] began to publicize his theory of &quot;animal magnetism&quot;, which was considered offensive by many, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the physician [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], and Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Stephan A. &quot;[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/5/2004_5_65.shtml Franklin's Forgotten Triumph: Scientific Testing]&quot; ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin also served as American minister to Sweden, although he never visited that country. He negotiated a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–Sweden)|treaty]] that was signed in April 1783. On August 27, 1783 in Paris Franklin witnessed the world's first hydrogen [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;EcceF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5_7IRHZGyzMC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22jacques+charles%22+%22Eccentric+France%22&amp;q=%22jacques%20charles%22%20%22Eccentric%20France%22 |title=Eccentric France: Bradt Guide to mad, magical and marvellous France By Piers Letcher&amp;nbsp;— Jacques Charles |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= May 25, 2003|accessdate=March 17, 2010|isbn=9781841620688}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Robert brothers#First hydrogen balloon|Le Globe]]'', created by professor [[Jacques Charles]] and [[Robert brothers|Les Frères Robert]], was watched by a vast crowd as it launched from the [[Champ de Mars]] (now the site of the [[Eiffel Tower]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sci&amp;Soc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10447673 |title=Science and Society, Medal commemorating Charles and Robert’s balloon ascent, Paris, 1783 |publisher=Scienceandsociety.co.uk |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This so enthused Franklin that he subscribed financially to the next project to build a manned hydrogen balloon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fid Green&quot;&gt;[https://www.fiddlersgreen.net/models/Aircraft/Balloon-Charles.html Fiddlers Green, History of Ballooning, Jacques Charles]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1783 Franklin was seated in the special enclosure for honoured guests when ''[[Robert brothers#First manned hydrogen balloon flight|La Charlière]]'' took off from the [[Jardin des Tuileries]], piloted by Jacques Charles and [[Robert brothers|Nicolas-Louis Robert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EcceF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/ballooning/newsletter/pr00-02.htm |title=Federation Aeronautique Internationale, Ballooning Commission, Hall of Fame, Robert Brothers |publisher=Fai.org |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}{{dead link|url=http://www.fai.org/ballooning/newsletter/pr00-02.htm|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional Convention====
[[File:Franklin's return to Philadelphia 1785 cph.3g09906.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Franklin's return to Philadelphia, 1785'', by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]].]]
When he finally returned home in 1785, Franklin occupied a position only second to that of [[George Washington]] as the champion of American independence. Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by [[Joseph Duplessis]] that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] After his return, Franklin became an abolitionist, freeing both of his slaves. He eventually became president of the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/l3_citizen_abolitionist.html ''Citizen Ben, Abolitionist''.] PBS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, Franklin served as a delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention]]. He held an honorary position and seldom engaged in debate. He is the only Founding Father who is a signatory of all four of the major documents of the founding of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Paris, the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with France, and [[United States Constitution|the United States Constitution]].

In 1787, a group of prominent ministers in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], proposed the foundation of a new college to be named in Franklin's honor. Franklin donated £200 towards the development of Franklin College, which is now called [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]].

Between 1771 and 1788, he finished his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]]. While it was at first addressed to his son, it was later completed for the benefit of mankind at the request of a friend.

In his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], Franklin wrote several essays that attempted to convince his readers of the importance of the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] and of the integration of blacks into American society. These writings included:
* ''[[s:An Address to the Public|An Address to the Public]]'', (1789)
* ''[[s:A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks|A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks]]'' (1789), and
* ''Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade'' (1790).

In 1790, Quakers from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition. Their argument against slavery was backed by the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society and its president, Benjamin Franklin.

===President of Pennsylvania===
Special balloting conducted October 18, 1785 unanimously elected Franklin the sixth [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|President]] of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania]], replacing [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]. The office of President of Pennsylvania was analogous to the modern position of [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor]]. It is not clear why Dickinson needed to be replaced with less than two weeks remaining before the regular election. Franklin held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the Constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election he was reelected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. Officially, his term concluded on November 5, 1788, but there is some question regarding the ''[[de facto]]'' end of his term, suggesting that the aging Franklin may not have been actively involved in the day-to-day operation of the Council toward the end of his time in office.

==Virtue, religion, and personal beliefs==
[[File:Houdon - Benjamin Franklin (1778).jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Franklin by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]]]

Like the other advocates of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous. All his life he explored the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in ''Poor Richard's'' [[aphorism]]s. Franklin felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men, but rarely attended religious services himself.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Autobiography,'' ed. Lemay, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; When Franklin met [[Voltaire]] in Paris and asked this great apostle of the Enlightenment to bless his grandson, Voltaire said in English, &quot;God and Liberty,&quot; and added, &quot;this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin’s parents were both pious Puritans.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 5-18&lt;/ref&gt; The family attended the old South Church, the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Old South Church |url=http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html |title=Isaacson, 2003, p. 15 |publisher=Oldsouth.org |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080531090015/http://www.oldsouth.org/history.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin’s father, a poor chandler, owned a copy of a book, ''Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good'', by the Puritan preacher and family friend [[Cotton Mather]], which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;If I have been,” Franklin wrote to Cotton Mather’s son seventy years later, “a useful citizen, the public owes the advantage of it to that book.” in Isaacson, 2003, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin’s first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a famous sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather, but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Franklin | first = Benjamin | title = Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion| work = Benjamin Franklin Papers| publisher = franklinpapers.org| date = November 20, 1728| url = http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/yale;jsessionid=9379F5D050E36AA9D1F95700EE223865?d=-363718316&amp;d=1379669530&amp;vol=1&amp;page=101a| doi = | accessdate = December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas as regards belief in salvation, hell, the [[divinity of Jesus]], and indeed most religious dogma.

It was Ben Franklin who, at a critical impasse during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in June 1787, attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;... In the beginning of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. -- Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor.&amp;nbsp;... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth -- that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that &quot;except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it.&quot; I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel: ...I therefore beg leave to move -- that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E. Eidenmuller |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benfranklin.htm |title=Online Speech Bank: Benjamin Franklin's Prayer Speech at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 |publisher=Americanrhetoric.com |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the motion met with resistance and was never brought to a vote.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clinton Rossiter|Rossiter, Clinton]]. ''1787. The Grand Convention'' (1966), pp. 184-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical minister [[George Whitefield]] during the [[First Great Awakening]]. Franklin did not subscribe to Whitefield’s theology, but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works. Franklin published all of Whitefield’s sermons and journals, thereby boosting the Great Awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson. 2003, pp.107-13&lt;/ref&gt;

When he stopped attending church, Franklin wrote in his autobiography: &lt;blockquote&gt;
...Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Franklin Benjamin [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/singlehtml.htm &quot;Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography&quot;.] Section 2 reprinted on UShistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111frank2.html |title=Benjamin Franklin |publisher=History.hanover.edu |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin retained a lifelong commitment to the Puritan virtues and political values he had grown up with, and through his civic work and publishing, he succeeded in passing these values into the American culture permanently. He had a “passion for virtue.”&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson p 485&lt;/ref&gt; These Puritan values included his devotion to egalitarianism, education, industry, thrift, honesty, temperance, charity and community spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson,2003, p.149, 92,486,490&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract [[Republicanism in the United States|ideal of republican government]] based on hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that English liberties relied on their balance of power, but also hierarchal deference to the privileged class.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1992) p. 273-4, 299-300&lt;/ref&gt; “Puritanism&amp;nbsp;... and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification”{{cite quote|date=November 2010}} by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all men can be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, 1992 p.303&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin, steeped in Puritanism and an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical movement, rejected the salvation dogma, but embraced the radical notion of egalitarian democracy.

Franklin’s commitment to teach these values was itself something he gained from his Puritan upbringing, with its stress on “inculcating virtue and character in themselves and their communities.”&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p 10,102,489&lt;/ref&gt; These Puritan values and the desire to pass them on, were one of Franklin’s quintessentially American characteristics, and helped shape the character of the nation. Franklin's writings on [[virtue]] were derided by some European authors, such as Jackob Fugger in his critical work ''Portrait of American Culture''. [[Max Weber]] considered Franklin's ethical writings a culmination of the [[Protestant work ethic|Protestant ethic]], which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Protestant Ethic and the &quot;Spirit of Capitalism&quot;'', (Penguin Books, 2002), translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells, pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Franklin's famous characteristics was his respect, tolerance and promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, he wrote in [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|his autobiography]], &quot;new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; “He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism.”&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson,2003 p. 93ff&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of Puritans had been intolerant of dissent, but by the early 18th century, when Franklin grew up in the Puritan church, tolerance of different churches was the norm, and Massachusetts was known, in John Adams' words, as “’the most mild and equitable establishment of religion that was known in the world.’”&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn,1992,p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Franklin’s friend and preacher, George Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, “claiming liberty of conscience to be an ‘inalienable right of every rational creature.’”&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, 1992, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Whitefield’s supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected “a large, new hall, that...could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief.”&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin’s rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and [[civic virtue]], made him the “prophet of tolerance.”&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 93ff&lt;/ref&gt; While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|British Unitarianism]], attending the inaugural session of the [[Essex Street Chapel]], at which [[Theophilus Lindsey]] drew together the first avowedly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky, and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the Trinity was illegal until [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813|the 1813 Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitarian.org.uk/support/doc-EssexHall1.shtml Chapter 2, ''The History of Essex Hall'' by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D. Lindsey Press, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Franklin's parents had intended for him to have a career in the Church,&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot; /&gt; Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in deism, that God’s truths can be found entirely through nature and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, 2003, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I soon became a thorough Deist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin.

At one point, he wrote to [[Thomas Paine]], criticizing his manuscript, ''[[The Age of Reason]]'':

{{Quote|For without the Belief of a Providence that takes Cognizance of, guards and guides and may favour particular Persons, there is no Motive to Worship a Deity, to fear its Displeasure, or to pray for its Protection....think how great a Proportion of Mankind consists of weak and ignorant Men and Women, and of inexperienc'd and inconsiderate Youth of both Sexes, who have need of the Motives of Religion to restrain them from Vice, to support their Virtue, and retain them in the Practice of it till it becomes habitual, which is the great Point for its Security; And perhaps you are indebted to her originally that is to your Religious Education, for the Habits of Virtue upon which you now justly value yourself. If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be if without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallbuilders.com/LIBissuesArticles.asp?id=58 |title=Historical Writings&amp;nbsp;— Benjamin Franklin's letter to Thomas Paine |publisher=WallBuilders |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to David Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, David T. ''Benjamin Franklin: Champion of Generic Religion.'' The Historian. 62#4 2000. pp 722+&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was a proponent of religion in general. He prayed to ''&quot;Powerful Goodness&quot;'' and referred to God as &quot;the infinite&quot;. [[John Adams]] noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: &quot;The [[Catholicism|Catholics]] thought him almost a Catholic. The [[Church of England]] claimed him as one of them. The Presbyterians thought him half a Presbyterian, and the Friends believed him a wet Quaker.&quot; Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, &quot;he was a true champion of generic religion.&quot; In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin stated that he believed that religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming; &quot;When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig'd to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin to Richard Price, Oct. 9, 1780 ''Writings'' 8:153--54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to [[Ezra Stiles]], president of [[Yale University]], who had asked him his views on religion:

{{quote|As to [[Jesus of Nazareth]], my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present [[English Dissenters|Dissenters in England]], some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble....&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;}}

On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed three-member committee composed of Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams to design the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Franklin's proposal (which was not adopted) featured the motto: &quot;Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God&quot; and a scene from the [[Book of Exodus]], with [[Moses]], the [[Israelites]], the [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and George III depicted as [[pharaoh]]. The design that was produced was never acted upon by Congress and the Great Seal's design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf The Great Seal of the United States]&quot; (July 2003).

[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] ([[Oxford University Press]], 2006), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thirteen Virtues===
Franklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of 13 virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] lists his 13 virtues as:

# &quot;Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.&quot;
# &quot;Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.&quot;
# &quot;Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.&quot;
# &quot;Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.&quot;
# &quot;Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.&quot;
# &quot;Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.&quot;
# &quot;Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.&quot;

Franklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week &quot;leaving all others to their ordinary chance&quot;. While Franklin did not live completely by his virtues and by his own admission, he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography Franklin wrote, &quot;I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm ''Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin page 38 forward''] by Benjamin Franklin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Franklin on U.S. Postage==
Benjamin Franklin is a prominent figure in American history comparable to Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln and as such he has been honored on US Postage stamps many times. The image of Franklin, the first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] of the United States, occurs on the face of U.S. Postage more than any other notable American, save that of [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotts&quot;&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin appeared on the first U.S. postage stamp [[Benjamin Franklin#Postmaster|(displayed above)]] issued in 1847. From 1908 through 1923 the U.S. Post Office issued a series of postage stamps commonly referred to as the [[Washington-Franklin Issues]] where, along with George Washington, Franklin was depicted many times over a 14-year period, the longest run of any one series in US postal history. Along with the regular issue stamps Franklin however only appears on a few [[:File:Ben Franklin 250th 1956 issue-3c.jpg|commemorative stamps]]. Some of the finest portrayals of Franklin on record can be found on the engravings inscribed on the face of US postage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotts&quot;/&gt;

Franklin died on April 17, 1790, at age 84. Approximately 20,000 people attended his funeral. He was interred in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]] in Philadelphia. In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Body of B. Franklin Printer; Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost: For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new &amp; more perfect Edition, Corrected and Amended By the Author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/franklin-epitaph.html ''Benjamin Franklin: In His Own Words''.] Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads &quot;Benjamin and Deborah Franklin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sln.fi.edu/franklin/family/lastwill.html ''The Last Will and Testament of Benjamin Franklin''.] The Franklin Institute Science Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1773, when Franklin's work had moved from printing to science and politics, he corresponded with a French scientist, [[Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg]], on the subject of preserving the dead for later revival by more advanced scientific methods, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I should prefer to an ordinary death, being immersed with a few friends in a cask of Madeira, until that time, then to be recalled to life by the solar warmth of my dear country! But in all probability, we live in a century too little advanced, and too near the infancy of science, to see such an art brought in our time to its perfection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/biotime.html?pg=1&amp;topic=biotime&amp;topic_set= The Doctor Will Freeze You Now] from [[Wired News|Wired.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Extended excerpt also online.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_9.html Engines of Creation] E-drexler.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His death is described in the book ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin'', quoting from the account of Dr. John Jones:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, pp 529–530.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin [[bequest|bequeathed]] £1,000 (about $4,400 at the time, or about $55,000 in 2010 dollars{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}) each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, in trust to gather interest for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician [[Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour]], who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly [[parody]] of Franklin's &quot;Poor Richard's Almanack&quot; called &quot;Fortunate Richard.&quot; The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 ''[[French livre|livres]]'', to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price. ''Observations on the Importance of the American Revolution, and the Means of Making it a Benefit to the World. To which is added, a Letter from M. Turgot, late Comptroller-General of the Finances of France: with an Appendix, containing a Translation of the Will of M. Fortuné Ricard, lately published in France.'' London: T. Cadell, 1785.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000&amp;nbsp;pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia. As of 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a [[Vocational school|trade school]] that became the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology|Franklin Institute of Boston]] and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |title=Excerpt from Philadelphia Inquirer article by Clark De Leon |publisher=Mathsci.appstate.edu |date=February 7, 1993 |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php |title=History of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology |publisher=Bfit.edu |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080731130624/http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php| archivedate = July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, Franklin is considered one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] of the U.S. His pervasive influence in the early history of the United States has led to his being jocularly called &quot;the only President of the United States who was never President of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Everything You Know Is Wrong|Firesign Theater quote, meant humorously but poignantly.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's likeness is ubiquitous. Since 1928, it has adorned American [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bills]], which are sometimes referred to in slang as &quot;Benjamins&quot; or &quot;Franklins.&quot; From 1948 to 1963, Franklin's portrait was on the [[Franklin half dollar|half dollar]]. He has appeared on a [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]] and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918. Franklin appears on the $1,000 Series EE [[Treasury security#Savings bond|Savings bond]]. The city of Philadelphia contains around 5,000 likenesses of Benjamin Franklin, about half of which are located on the University of Pennsylvania campus. Philadelphia's [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] (a major thoroughfare) and [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] (the first major bridge to connect Philadelphia with New Jersey) are named in his honor.

In 1976, as part of a [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]] celebration, [[United States Congress|Congress]] dedicated a 20-foot (6&amp;nbsp;m) marble statue in Philadelphia's Franklin Institute as the [[Benjamin Franklin National Memorial]]. Many of Franklin's personal possessions are also on display at the Institute, one of the few national memorials located on [[property|private property]].

In London, his house at 36 Craven Street was first marked with a [[blue plaque]] and has since been opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/default.htm |title=Benjamin Franklin House |publisher=Benjamin Franklin House. |date= |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. ''[[The Times]]'' reported on February 11, 1998:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. Paul Knapman, the Westminster Coroner, said yesterday: &quot;I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by [[William Hewson (surgeon)|William Hewson]], who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/news/pdf/Issue2.pdf ''The Craven Street Gazette''] ([[PDF]]), Newsletter of the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House, Issue 2, Autumn 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===
&quot;The Princess and the Patriot: [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova|Ekaterina Dashkova]], Benjamin Franklin and the Age of Enlightenment&quot; exhibition opened in Philadelphia in February 2006 and ran through December 2006. Benjamin Franklin and Dashkova met only once, in Paris in 1781. Franklin was 75 and Dashkova was 37. Franklin invited Dashkova to become the first woman to join the American Philosophical Society and the only woman to be so honored for another 80 years. Later, Dashkova reciprocated by making him the first American member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

In [[mathematics]], '''Banach spaces''' (pronounced {{IPA-pl|ˈbanax|}}) are one of the central objects of study in [[functional analysis]]. Many of the [[infinite-dimensional space|infinite-dimensional]] [[function space]]s studied in analysis are Banach spaces, including spaces of [[continuous function]]s ([[continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space]]), spaces of [[Lebesgue integrable]] functions known as [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]], and spaces of [[holomorphic function]]s known as [[Hardy space]]s.  They are the most commonly used [[topological vector space]]s, and their topology comes from a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]].

They are named after the Polish mathematician [[Stefan Banach]], who introduced them in 1920–1922 along with [[Hans Hahn]] and [[Eduard Helly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1987|loc=V.86}}&lt;!--From French edition.  Please check the &quot;Historical Note&quot; in the English edition.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Banach spaces are defined as [[complete metric space|complete]] [[normed vector space]]s. This means that a Banach space is a [[vector space]] ''V'' with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] ||·|| such that every [[Cauchy sequence]] (with respect to the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ||''x'' − ''y''||) in ''V'' has a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] in ''V'' (with respect to the [[topology]] induced by that metric). As for general vector spaces, a Banach space over the [[real number]]s is called a real Banach space, and a Banach space over the complex numbers is called a complex Banach space.

== Examples ==
{{main|List of Banach spaces}}
Throughout, let '''K''' stand for one of the [[field (mathematics)|fields]] '''R''' or '''C'''.

The familiar [[Euclidean space]]s '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where the Euclidean norm of ''x''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by ||''x''||&amp;nbsp;= (∑&lt;sub&gt;i=1…n&lt;/sub&gt; |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, are Banach spaces. Hence every finite-dimensional '''K''' vector space becomes a  Banach space being endowed with an arbitrary norm, since all norms are [[norm equivalence|equivalent]] on a finite-dimensional '''K''' vector space.  

Consider the space of all [[continuous function]]s ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']&amp;nbsp;→ '''K''' defined on a [[closed interval]] [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. This space becomes a Banach space if an appropriate norm ||''ƒ''||, is defined in it. Such a norm may be defined as ||''ƒ''|| = sup { |''ƒ''(''x'')| : ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈ [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] }, known as the [[supremum norm]]. This is indeed a well-defined norm, since continuous functions defined on a closed interval are bounded.

Since ''ƒ'' is a continuous function on a closed interval, then it is bounded and the supremum in the above definition is attained by the Weierstrass [[extreme value theorem]], so we can replace the supremum by the maximum. In this case, the norm is also called the '''maximum norm'''.

The space is complete under this norm, and the resulting Banach space is denoted by C[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. This example can be generalized to the space C(''X'') of all continuous functions ''X''&amp;nbsp;→ '''K''', where ''X'' is a [[compact space]], or to the space of all ''bounded'' continuous functions ''X''&amp;nbsp;→ '''K''', where ''X'' is any [[topological space]], or indeed to the space B(''X'') of all bounded functions ''X''&amp;nbsp;→ '''K''', where ''X'' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. In all these examples, we can even multiply functions and stay in the same space: all these examples are in fact [[unital algebra|unital]] [[Banach algebra]]s.

For any [[open set]] Ω&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''C''', the set ''A''(Ω) of all bounded, [[analytic function]]s ''u''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''C''' is a complex Banach space with respect to the supremum norm.  The fact that uniform limits of analytic functions are analytic is an easy consequence of [[Morera's theorem]].

If ''p''&amp;nbsp;≥ 1 is a real number, we can consider the space of all infinite [[sequence]]s (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …) of elements in '''K''' such that the [[infinite series]] ∑&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is finite. The ''p''-th root of this series' value is then defined to be the ''p''-norm of the sequence. The space, together with this norm, is a Banach space; it is denoted by ℓ&lt;sup&gt; ''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Banach space ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; consists of all bounded sequences of elements in '''K'''; the norm of such a sequence is defined to be the supremum of the absolute values of the sequence's members.

Again, if ''p''&amp;nbsp;≥ 1 is a real number, we can consider all functions ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']&amp;nbsp;→ '''K''' such that |''ƒ''|&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrable]]. The ''p''-th root of this integral is then defined to be the norm of ''ƒ''. By itself, this space is not a Banach space because there are non-zero functions whose norm is zero. We define an [[equivalence relation]] as follows: ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are equivalent [[if and only if]] the norm of ''ƒ''&amp;minus;''g'' is zero. The set of [[equivalence class]]es then forms a Banach space; it is denoted by ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;([''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']).  It is crucial to use the Lebesgue integral and not the Riemann integral here, because the Riemann integral would not yield a complete space. These examples can be generalized; see [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] for details.

If ''X'' and ''Y'' are two Banach spaces, then we can form their [[Direct sum of modules#Direct sum of Banach spaces|direct sum]] ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊕ ''Y'', which has a natural topological vector space structure but no canonical norm. However, it is again a Banach space for several equivalent norms, for example

:&lt;math&gt; \|x \oplus y\| = \bigl( \|x\|^p + \|y\|^p \bigr)^{1/ p}, \quad 1 \le p \le \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

This construction can be generalized to define ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;-direct sums of arbitrarily many Banach spaces. When there is an infinite number of non-zero summands, the space obtained in this way depends upon ''p''.

If ''M'' is a closed [[linear subspace]] of the Banach space ''X'', then the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''X''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''M'' is again a Banach space.

Every [[inner product]] gives rise to an associated norm.  The inner product space is called a [[Hilbert space]] if its associated norm is complete.  Thus every Hilbert space is a Banach space by definition.  The converse statement also holds under certain conditions; see below.

== Linear operators ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Operator]] --&gt;
{{main|Bounded operator}}
If ''V'' and ''W'' are Banach spaces over the same ground field '''K''', the set of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]]
[[linear transformation|'''K'''-linear maps]] ''A'' : ''V'' → ''W''
is denoted by L(''V'', ''W''). In infinite-dimensional spaces, not all linear maps are automatically continuous.  In general, a linear mapping on a normed space is continuous if and only if it is [[bounded operator|bounded]] on the closed unit ball.  Thus the vector space L(''V'', ''W'') can be given the [[operator norm]]
:&lt;math&gt;\|A\| = \sup\{\|Ax\|_W \mid x\in V,\ \|x\|_V\le 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;
With respect to this norm, L(''V'',''W'') is a Banach space.  This is also true under the less restrictive condition that ''V'' be a normed space.

When ''V'' = ''W'', the space L(''V'') = L(''V'', ''V'') forms a unital [[Banach algebra]]; the multiplication operation is given by the composition of linear maps.

== Dual space ==
If ''V'' is a Banach space and '''K''' is the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]] (either the [[real number|real]] or the [[complex number|complex]] numbers), then '''K''' is itself a Banach space (using the [[absolute value]] as norm) and we can define the ''[[dual space]]'' ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;′&lt;/nowiki&gt; as ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;′&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;= L(''V'', '''K'''), the space of continuous linear maps into&amp;nbsp;'''K'''. This is again a Banach space (with the [[operator norm]]). It can be used to define a new [[topology]] on ''V'': the [[weak topology]].

Note that the requirement that the maps be continuous is essential; if ''V'' is infinite-dimensional, there exist linear maps which are not continuous, and therefore not [[bounded function|bounded]], so the space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; of linear maps into '''K''' is not a Banach space.  The space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; (which may be called the ''algebraic dual space'' to distinguish it from ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;) also induces a weak topology which is [[finer topology|finer]] than that induced by the continuous dual since {{nowrap|''V''&amp;thinsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;′&lt;/nowiki&gt; ⊆ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

There is a natural map ''F''&amp;thinsp; from ''V'' to ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;′′&lt;/nowiki&gt; (the dual of the dual)  defined by
:''F''(''x'')(''&amp;fnof;'') = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')
for all ''x'' in ''V'' and ''ƒ'' in ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;′&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Because ''F''(''x'') is a map from ''V''′ to '''K''', it is an element of ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;′′&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The map ''F'': ''x''&amp;nbsp;→ ''F''(''x'') is thus a map ''V''&amp;nbsp;→ ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;′′&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  As a consequence of the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]], this map is [[injective]], and isometric; if it is also [[surjective]], then the Banach space ''V'' is called [[reflexive space|reflexive]].  Reflexive spaces have many important geometric properties.  A space is reflexive if and only if its dual is reflexive, which is the case if and only if its unit ball is [[compact space|compact]] in the [[weak topology]].

For example, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is reflexive for 1&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞ but ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; are not reflexive.  When ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞, the dual of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''p'' and ''q'' are related by the formula 1/''p''&amp;nbsp;+ 1/''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  See [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] for details.

== Relationship to Hilbert spaces ==
As mentioned above, every [[Hilbert space]] is a Banach space because, by definition, a Hilbert space is complete with respect to the norm associated with its inner product, where a norm and an inner product are said to be associated if ||'''v'''||² = ('''v''','''v''') for all '''v'''.

The converse is not always true; not every Banach space is a Hilbert space.  A necessary and sufficient condition for a Banach space ''V'' to be associated to an inner product (which will then necessarily make ''V'' into a Hilbert space) is the [[parallelogram identity]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\|u+v\|^2 + \|u-v\|^2 = 2(\|u\|^2 + \|v\|^2)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''u'' and ''v'' in ''V'', and where ||*|| is the norm on ''V''. So, for example, while '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a Banach space with respect to ''any'' norm defined on it, it is only a Hilbert space with respect to the Euclidean norm. Similarly, as an infinite-dimensional example, the Lebesgue space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is always a Banach space but is only a Hilbert space when ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

If the norm of a Banach space satisfies this identity, the associated inner product which makes it into a Hilbert space is given by the [[polarization identity]]. If ''V'' is a real Banach space, then the polarization identity is

:&lt;math&gt;\langle u,v\rangle = \frac{1}{4} (\|u+v\|^2 - \|u-v\|^2)&lt;/math&gt;

whereas if ''V'' is a complex Banach space, then the polarization identity is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\langle u,v\rangle = \frac{1}{4} \left(\|u+v\|^2 - \|u-v\|^2 + i(\|u+iv\|^2 - \|u-iv\|^2)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The necessity of this condition follows easily from the properties of an inner product. To see that it is sufficient&amp;mdash;that the parallelogram law implies that the form defined by the polarization identity is indeed a complete inner product&amp;mdash;one verifies algebraically that this form is additive, whence it follows [[mathematical induction|by induction]] that the form is linear over the integers and rationals.  Then since every real is the limit of some Cauchy sequence of rationals, the completeness of the norm extends the linearity to the whole real line.  In the complex case, one can check also that the bilinear form is linear over ''i'' in one argument, and conjugate linear in the other.

== Hamel dimension ==
It follows from the completeness of Banach spaces and the [[Baire category theorem]] that a [[Hamel basis]] of an infinite-dimensional Banach space is [[uncountable]].

== Derivatives ==
Several concepts of a derivative may be defined on a Banach space. See the articles on the [[Fréchet derivative]] and the [[Gâteaux derivative]].

== Generalizations ==
Several important spaces in functional analysis, for instance the space of all infinitely often differentiable functions '''R''' → '''R''' or the space of all [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] on '''R''', are complete but are not normed vector spaces and hence not Banach spaces. In [[Frechet space|Fréchet spaces]] one still has a complete [[metric space|metric]], while [[LF-space]]s are complete [[uniform space|uniform]] vector spaces arising as limits of Fréchet spaces.

'''Abraham &quot;Bram&quot; Stoker''' (November 8, 1847 – April 20, 1912) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[novelist]] and [[short story]] [[writer]], best known today for his 1897 [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] novel ''[[Dracula]]''. During his lifetime, he was better known as [[personal assistant]] of actor [[Henry Irving]] and [[business manager]] of the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in [[London]], which Irving owned.

==Early life==
Stoker was born on 8 November 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent, Clontarf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note, as location has led to multiple edits: The location was, and is, in the Civil Parish of Clontarf.  Clontarf extends to the east side of the Malahide Road and borders Marino.  Fairview is further west commencing just after Marino Mart.&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents were Abraham Stoker (1799&amp;ndash;1876), from Dublin, and the [[Feminism|feminist]] Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley (1818&amp;ndash;1901), who came from [[Ballyshannon]], [[County Donegal]]. Stoker was the third of seven children.&lt;ref&gt;His siblings were: Sir (William) Thornley Stoker, born in 1845; Mathilda, born 1846; Thomas, born 1850; Richard, born 1852; Margaret, born 1854; and George, born 1855&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham and Charlotte were members of the [[Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf]] and attended the parish church with their children, who were baptised there.

Stoker was bed-ridden until he started school at the age of seven, when he made a complete recovery. Of this time, Stoker wrote, &quot;I was naturally thoughtful, and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years.&quot; He was educated in a private school run by the Rev. William Woods.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Obituary, Irish Times, 23 April 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

After his recovery, he grew up without further major health issues, even excelling as an athlete (he was named University Athlete) at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], which he attended from 1864 to 1870. He graduated with honours in mathematics. He was auditor of the [[College Historical Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|College Historical Society]] and president of the [[University Philosophical Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|University Philosophical Society]], where his first paper was on &quot;Sensationalism in Fiction and Society&quot;.

==Early career==
Stoker became interested in the theatre while a student through a friend, Dr. Maunsell. He became the theatre critic for the ''[[Dublin Evening Mail]]'', co-owned by the author of Gothic tales [[Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]]. Theatre critics were held in low esteem but he attracted notice by the quality of his reviews. In December 1876 he gave a favourable review of Henry Irving's ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|Theatre Royal]] in Dublin. Irving invited Stoker for dinner at the [[Shelbourne Hotel]], where he was staying. They became friends. Stoker also wrote stories, and in 1872 &quot;The Crystal Cup&quot; was published by the London Society, followed by &quot;The Chain of Destiny&quot; in four parts in ''The Shamrock''. In 1876, while a [[civil servant]] in Dublin, Stoker wrote a non-fiction book (''The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland'', published 1879), which remained a standard work .&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Obituary, Irish Times, 23 April 1912&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he possessed an interest in art, and was a founder of the Dublin Sketching Club in 1874.&lt;ref name=www&gt;Website, Dublin Painting and Sketching Club, http://www.dublinpaintingandsketchingclub.ie/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyceum Theatre and later career==
[[Image:Bram Stoker's Home.jpg|thumb|left|Bram Stoker's former home, Kildare Street, Dublin, Ireland.]]
In 1878 Stoker married [[Florence Balcombe]], daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent, a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Irish Times, 8 March 1882, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Stoker had known Wilde from his student days, having proposed him for membership of the university’s Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florence's decision, but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship, and after Wilde's fall visited him on the Continent.&lt;ref name = &quot;irtimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0328/1224243595688.html|author= |title=Why Dracula never loses his bite|date=last modified 2009|publisher=Irish Times|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stokers moved to London, where Stoker became acting-manager and then business manager of Irving's [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], a post he held for 27 years. On 31 December 1879, Bram and Florence's only child was born, a son whom they christened Irving Noel Thornley Stoker. The collaboration with Irving was important for Stoker and through him he became involved in London's [[Upper class|high society]], where he met [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] (to whom he was distantly related). Working for Irving, the most famous actor of his time, and managing one of the most successful theatres in London made Stoker a notable if busy man. He was dedicated to Irving and his memoirs show he idolised him. In London Stoker also met [[Hall Caine]] who became one of his closest friends - he dedicated ''Dracula'' to him.

In the course of Irving's tours, Stoker travelled the world, although he never visited [[Eastern Europe]], a setting for his most famous novel. Stoker enjoyed the [[United States]], where Irving was popular. With Irving he was invited twice to the [[White House]], and knew [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Stoker set two of his novels there, using Americans as characters, the most notable being [[Quincey Morris]]. He also met one of his literary idols, [[Walt Whitman]].

==Writings==
While manager for Irving, and secretary and director of London's Lyceum Theatre, he began writing novels beginning with ''[[The Snake's Pass]]'' in 1890 and ''[[Dracula]]'' in 1897. During this period, Stoker was part of the literary staff of the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|London Daily Telegraph]]'' and wrote other fiction, including the horror novels ''[[The Lady of the Shroud]]'' (1909) and ''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]'' (1911).&lt;ref name=WorldBio/&gt; In 1906, after Irving's death, he published his life of Irving, which proved successful,&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; and managed productions at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]].

Before writing ''Dracula'', Stoker spent several years researching European folklore and mythological stories of [[vampire]]s. ''Dracula'' is an [[epistolary novel]], written as a collection of realistic, but completely fictional, diary entries, telegrams, letters, ship's logs, and newspaper clippings, all of which added a level of detailed realism to his story, a skill he developed as a newspaper writer. At the time of its publication, it was considered a &quot;straightforward horror novel&quot; based on imaginary creations of [[supernatural]] life.&lt;ref name=WorldBio/&gt; &quot;It gave form to a universal fantasy . . . and became a part of popular culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=WorldBio/&gt;

According to the ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', Stoker's stories are today included within the categories of &quot;horror fiction,&quot; &quot;romanticized Gothic&quot; stories, and &quot;melodrama.&quot;&lt;ref name=WorldBio&gt;''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', Gale Research (1998) vol 8. pgs. 461-464&lt;/ref&gt; They are classified alongside other &quot;works of popular fiction&quot; such as [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''&lt;ref name=Latham/&gt;{{rp|394}} which, according to historian Jules Zanger, also used the &quot;myth-making&quot; and story-telling method of having &quot;multiple narrators&quot; telling the same tale from different perspectives. &quot;'They can't all be lying,' thinks the reader.&quot;&lt;ref name=Zanger&gt;Zanger, Jules. ''Blood Read: The Vampire as Metaphor in Contemporary Culture'' ed. Joan Gordon. Univ. of Pennsylvania Press (1997), pgs. 17-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The original 541-page manuscript of ''Dracula'', believed to have been lost, was found in a barn in northwestern Pennsylvania during the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122514491757273633.html What a Tax Lawyer Dug Up on 'Dracula']&lt;/ref&gt; It included the typed manuscript with many corrections, and handwritten on the title page was &quot;THE UN-DEAD.&quot; The author's name was shown at the bottom as Bram Stoker. Author Robert Latham notes, &quot;the most famous horror novel ever published, its title changed at the last minute.&quot;&lt;ref name=Latham&gt;Latham, Robert. ''Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Book Review Annual'', Greenwood Publishing (1988) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoker's inspirations for the story, in addition to Whitby, may have included a visit to [[Slains Castle]] in [[Aberdeenshire]], a visit to the crypts of [[St. Michan's Church]] in Dublin and the novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' by [[Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]].&lt;ref name=boy&gt;{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|page= 412|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|ISBN = 0-7171-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After suffering a number of strokes, Stoker died at No. 26 [[St George's Square]] in 1912.&lt;ref name = &quot;mc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/stoker/bio.html|author= |title=Bram Stoker|date=last modified 1998|publisher=Victorian Web|accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biographers attribute the cause of death to [[tertiary syphilis]].&lt;ref name='Gibson'&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Capital Companion | publisher = Webb &amp; Bower | year = 1985 | location = | pages = 365–366 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0863500420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Cremation|cremated]], and his ashes placed in a display urn at [[Golders Green Crematorium]]. After Irving Noel Stoker's death in 1961, his ashes were added to that urn. The original plan had been to keep his parents' ashes together, but after Florence Stoker's death her ashes were scattered at the Gardens of Rest. To visit his remains at Golders Green, visitors must be escorted to the room the urn is housed in, for fear of vandalism.

==Beliefs and philosophy==
Stoker was brought up as a Protestant, in the [[Church of Ireland]]. He was a strong supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] party. He took a keen interest in Irish affairs&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; and was what he called a &quot;philosophical home ruler&quot;, believing in [[Irish Home Rule bills|Home Rule]] for Ireland brought about by peaceful means - but as an ardent monarchist he believed that Ireland should remain within the British Empire which he believed was a force for good. He was a great admirer of Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] whom he knew personally, and admired his plans for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Paul. ''From the Shadow of Dracula: A Life of Bram Stoker''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoker had a strong interest in science and medicine and a belief in progress. Some of his novels like ''[[The Lady of the Shroud]]'' (1909) can be seen as early [[science fiction]].

Stoker had an interest in the occult especially [[mesmerism]], but was also wary of occult fraud and believed strongly that superstition should be replaced by more scientific ideas. In the mid 1890s, Stoker is rumoured to have become a member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], though there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shadowplayzine.com/Articles/hermetic_horrors.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The occult power behind the spear which pierced the side of Christ |first=Trevor |last=Ravenscroft |year=1982 |publisher=Red Wheel |pages=p165 |isbn=0877285470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ |first=Lynn |last=Picknett |year=2004 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |pages=p201 |isbn=0743273257}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Stoker's closest friends was J.W. Brodie-Innis, a major figure in the Order, and Stoker himself hired [[Pamela Coleman Smith]], as an artist at the Lyceum Theater.

==Posthumous==
The short story collection ''[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories]]'' was published in 1914 by Stoker's widow Florence Stoker. The first film adaptation of ''Dracula'' was released in 1922 and was named ''[[Nosferatu]]''. It was directed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]] and starred [[Max Schreck]] as Count Orlock. ''Nosferatu'' was produced while Florence Stoker, Bram Stoker's widow and literary executrix, was still alive. Represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors, she eventually sued the filmmakers. Her chief legal complaint was that she had been neither asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty. The case dragged on for some years, with Mrs. Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the film. The suit was finally resolved in the widow's favour in July 1925. Some copies of the film survived, however and the film has become well known. The first authorized film version of ''Dracula'' did not come about until almost a decade later when [[Universal Studios]] released [[Tod Browning]]'s ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' starring [[Bela Lugosi]].

Because of the Stokers' frustrating history with ''Dracula's'' copyright, a great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker, [[Canadian]] writer Dacre Stoker, with encouragement from screenwriter Ian Holt, decided to write &quot;a sequel that bore the Stoker name&quot; to &quot;reestablish creative control over&quot; the original novel. In 2009, ''[[Dracula the Un-dead|Dracula: The Un-Dead]]'' was released, written by Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt. Both writers &quot;based [their work] on Bram Stoker's own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition&quot; along with their own research for the sequel. This also marked Dacre Stoker's writing debut.&lt;ref&gt;''Dracula: The Un-Dead'' by Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draculatheundead.com/stoker-book-overview.htm ''Dracula: The Undead'''s overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Dealing the cards and scoring the results are procedural activities while the auction and playing the hand are the two actively competitive phases of the game.

:'''Dealing:''' Cards are dealt clockwise, one at a time and face down starting on the dealer's&lt;ref&gt;The dealer is determined by the cut of the cards or in [[duplicate bridge]] is predetermined by the [[Board (bridge)|board]]; the board also contains the four hands which have been dealt and placed in the board prior to commencement of the game.&lt;/ref&gt; left so that each player receives thirteen cards.
:'''Bidding:''' The bidding starts with the dealer and rotates around the table clockwise with each player making a [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#call|call]],&lt;ref&gt;When calls are made orally (as opposed to using bidding boxes) they use a limited number of permissible words (to reduce the possibility of passing unauthorised information). When the English language is used, these are: (1) a bid, being a number from &quot;one&quot; to &quot;seven&quot; inclusive together with a strain (also known as denomination) in the singular or plural (&quot;club&quot;/&quot;clubs&quot;, &quot;diamond&quot;/&quot;diamonds&quot;, &quot;heart&quot;/&quot;hearts&quot;, &quot;spade&quot;/&quot;spades&quot; and &quot;notrump&quot;), for example &quot;one heart&quot;, &quot;two notrump&quot; or &quot;three spades&quot;, (2) &quot;pass&quot; or, in some countries, &quot;no bid&quot;, (3) &quot;double&quot;, and (4) &quot;redouble&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; the purpose being to determine which partnership will [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#contract|contract]] to take more tricks given a particular [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#trumpsuit|trump suit]] or with [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#notrump|notrump]], referred to as the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#strain|strain]].&lt;ref&gt;The four suits (''spades'', ''hearts'', ''diamonds'' and ''clubs'') and ''notrump'' are generally referred to in bridge literature as the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#strain|''strain'']] while in the official 'Laws' of the game, they are defined as the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#denomination|''denomination'']].&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership which makes the highest final bid is known as the [[Contract bridge glossary#declaring side|declaring side]] and is said to have won the contract.  The available scoring points for the declaring side are dependent upon both the level and strain of the contract; failure to take at least the contracted for number of tricks results in the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#defenders|defending side]] receiving points instead and they are said to have 'defeated' the contract. The player on the declaring side who, during the auction, first stated the strain ultimately becoming trumps or notrumps is referred to as the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#declarer|declarer]]. 
:'''Playing:''' The rules of play are similar to other trick-taking games with the additional feature that the hand of declarer's partner is displayed face up on the table after the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#openinglead|opening lead]] has been made by the member of the defending side to the left of declarer; the displayed hand is referred to as the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#dummy|dummy]] and is played by declarer.
:'''Scoring:''' After all thirteen tricks have been played, the hand's score is determined by comparing the actual number of tricks taken by the declaring partnership with that proposed in the contract and awarding points accordingly. Individual scores of several hands are accumulated to determine the overall game score.

While the game involves [[game of skill|skill]] and [[game of chance|chance]], it has many variants and event types designed to emphasize skill, vary the method of scoring, set limits on the nature of the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#biddingsystem|bidding systems]] which may be used, limit the duration of play, have larger team composition, provide country representation in international play, and to group players of similar interests, skill levels, age, or gender, or combinations thereof. The most common game variants are [[rubber bridge]] and [[duplicate bridge]]. In rubber bridge, two partnerships participate in the game at one table and the objective is to score the most points in the play of several hands. In duplicate bridge, there are more tables and partnerships and the hands are dealt and played in such a manner that each partnership plays the same set of hands and with the scoring based upon relative performance. Competitions in duplicate bridge range from small clubs with a handful of tables, to large [[tournaments]] such as the [[World Bridge Championships]]&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Bermuda Bowl]], the [[World Team Olympiad]] and the [[North American Bridge Championships]].&lt;/ref&gt; where hundreds of tables play the same hands. The game variant and associated method of scoring have significant influence on bidding and card play strategies.

== Game play ==

Two partnerships of two players each are needed to play bridge. The four players sit around a table with partners opposite one another. The [[compass]] directions are often used to refer to the four players, aligned with their seating pattern. Thus, [[South]] and [[North]] form one partnership and [[East]] and [[West]] form the other. Often there are long-established partnerships, in which the players have played together for many years. It is also possible, but somewhat more difficult, to play with a totally new partner.

A session of bridge consists of a number of '''deals''' (also called ''hands'' or ''boards''). A hand is dealt (or may have been pre-dealt), the bidding (or auction) proceeds to a conclusion and then the hand is played. Finally, the hand's result is scored.

The goal of a single deal is to achieve a high score with the cards dealt. The score for the hand is affected by two principal factors: the contract (number of tricks bid in the auction, the denomination, and which side has bid it) and the number of tricks taken during play. It may also be affected by the ''vulnerability''. The '''contract''', a feature which distinguishes contract bridge from its predecessors, is an undertaking made during the auction by one partnership that they will take at least the stated number of tricks, either with a specified suit as [[trumps]], or without trumps (notrumps). The contract has two components: '''level''' and '''strain''' (also called ''denomination'').

There are seven levels, numbered 1-7, and the number of tricks required is six plus the level number, so may be anywhere between 7 and 13. The five strains are ranked, from lowest to highest, as ''clubs'' ({{Clubs}}), ''diamonds'' ({{Diams}}), ''hearts'' ({{Hearts}}), ''spades'' ({{Spades}}), and ''notrump'' (NT). The two lower-ranked suits ({{Clubs}} and {{Diams}}) are called the minor suits (or minors), and the higher-ranked suits ({{Hearts}} and {{Spades}}) are called majors. Minor suit contracts score less, so are less frequently chosen.

For instance, the contract &quot;3 hearts&quot; is a promise that the partnership will take nine tricks (six plus three) with hearts as the trump suit. Thus, there are 7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;35 possible basic contracts; 1{{Clubs}} being the lowest, followed by 1{{Diams}} etc., up to 7NT.

In the bidding stage or ''auction'', the pairs compete to determine who proposes the highest-ranked contract, and the side that wins the bidding must then strive in the play of the hand to fulfil that bargain by winning at least the contracted number of tricks if it is to obtain a score. Broadly speaking, there is an incentive to bid accurately to the [[optimum contract]] and then to play to make the contracted number of tricks (or more if good play or luck allows). If the side that wins the auction (''declaring side'') then takes the contracted number of tricks (or more), it is said to have ''made the contract'' and is awarded a score; otherwise, the contract is said to be ''defeated'' or ''set'' and points are awarded to the opponents (''defenders'').

It can sometimes be advantageous to bid a contract that one does not expect to make and to be defeated, thus losing some points, rather than allow the opposing side to bid and make a contract which would score them an even greater number of points. This is known as a ''[[sacrifice (bridge)|sacrifice]]'', and is quite common if both sides are contesting the final contract. This aspect is more common in [[duplicate bridge]] than in [[rubber bridge]] owing to the different scoring systems in effect.

=== Dealing ===
The [[game]] is played with a standard [[Playing card#Anglo-American|deck of 52 cards]]. In [[rubber bridge]] (or other non-[[duplicate bridge|duplicate]] games), the cards are [[shuffle]]d before each deal, and the dealer deals the cards clockwise one at a time, starting with the left-hand opponent, so that each player receives a ''hand'' of 13 cards. The deal rotates clockwise each hand.

In [[duplicate bridge]], the hands are shuffled and dealt only once, at the beginning of the session. Players do not throw their cards to the center of the table during the play but instead play them immediately in front of themselves and turn them face down at the end of each trick. The direction that each face down card is pointed indicates which side won each trick, so that at the end of the hand, the number of tricks taken by each side can be determined. At the end of the hand each player returns his hand, intact, to the correct slot in the ''[[board (bridge)|bridge board]]'' in which it is transported to other tables so that everyone can play the same deals. The results for different players playing the same deal are then compared. This removes much of the element of chance from scores. It also means that in the case of an irregularity or dispute over a hand before the cards are returned to the board, they can be reviewed and it can be determined who played which cards in what order.

In some competitions, boards are pre-dealt prior to the competition, especially if the same hands are to be played at many locations (for example in a large national or international tournament). Sometimes computerised dealing machines are used for pre-dealing hands at large tournaments and in many clubs. As the boards arrive for play at each subsequent table, the four players take their cards from the board and should count them to ensure that there are 13 cards in their hand before looking at the cards, so that any irregularity can be corrected before the auction and play commence.

In some countries, the rules require that after the hand is played for the first time, the players write the hands down on the travelling scoresheet, which can be consulted later if the cards are accidentally mixed up. Alternatively, if the boards are pre-dealt, &quot;curtain cards&quot; may be supplied which have each hand printed on them, so that each player can check at the beginning of the deal that he has the right cards. Pre-dealt hands also have the advantage that, at the end of the session, diagrams of each deal can be made available to the players for later analysis.

=== Auction or bidding ===
The ''auction'' determines the declaring side and the final contract. Only one of the partners of the declaring side, referred to as ''declarer'', plays the hand, while the other is ''dummy'', and does not participate actively in the play of the hand. In addition to establishing suit and level,&lt;ref name=&quot;SeagramLee2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barbara Seagram|author2=Linda Lee|title=Beginning Bridge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=choHxGThcKsC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=20 August 2010|date=June 2008|publisher=Master Point Press|isbn=9781897106334|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final contract may be doubled (by the opponents) or redoubled (by the declaring side after the opponents had already doubled), in which case the score for the hand is increased, whether the contract is made or defeated.

During the auction, each player makes a ''call'' in turn, which must be one of the following:
* a ''Bid'' (stating a level and a denomination)
* ''Double'' (when the last call other than pass was a bid by an opponent)
* ''Redouble'' (when the last call other than pass was a double by an opponent)
* ''Pass'' (when unwilling to make one of the three preceding calls)
(''Note'': although technically incorrect, the word &quot;bid&quot; is also often used informally in place of &quot;call&quot;)

The auction starts with the dealer and proceeds clockwise with each player, having first [[hand evaluation|evaluated]] their hand, making a call in order. The auction ends when three successive passes occur at some point after the dealer's first call. If all four players pass in the first round, the deal is not played (in rubber bridge the deal is not scored and the hand is redealt by the original dealer, while in duplicate the score is recorded as zero for each pair since re-dealing a hand that has been 'passed out' is prohibited by the rules).

A ''bid'' specifies a level and denomination, and ostensibly denotes a willingness to play the corresponding contract. A player wishing to bid must make a bid that is sufficient; a bid is sufficient if it specifies any denomination at a higher level than the last bid, or a higher-ranked denomination at the same level. Thus, after a bid of 3{{Hearts}}, bids of 2{{Spades}} or 3{{Clubs}} are not allowable, but 3{{Spades}} or 4{{Diams}} are. A bid that skips one level of bidding is called a (single) ''jump'', for instance 2{{Spades}} over 1{{Hearts}} is a jump, but 2{{Hearts}} over 1{{Spades}} is not a jump. Similarly, a ''double jump'' is a bid that skips two levels of bidding, for instance 3{{Spades}} over 1{{Hearts}} or 4{{Hearts}} over 1{{Spades}}.

A ''double'' can be made only after the opponents have made a bid. The natural meaning of a double is that the player is confident that the opponents cannot fulfil their contract, and the player is willing to risk increasing the opponents' score if they succeed, in exchange for receiving a larger penalty if the opponents fail. However, in modern bridge, the double more often has a [[convention (bridge)|conventional]] (artificial) meaning (especially after a low level bid, for example 1♠), to ask partner to bid or to pass information to partner. A &quot;redouble&quot; can be made only after an opponent's double; it further increases the points scored and the penalty for failure yet further. However a redouble is almost always conventional, and very few redoubled contracts end up being played. In practice, the double and redouble are often used systemically for other purposes, though if they are in effect for the final contract they increase the score regardless of their intended meaning. Double and redouble remain in effect only until the next bid&amp;nbsp;— any subsequent bid invalidates them.

Once the auction ends, the last bid (together with any double and/or redouble that followed it) becomes the contract, the level of this bid determines the number of tricks required to fulfil the contract and its strain determines what suit, if any, will be trumps.

It should be noted that the primary purpose of early bids is to exchange information rather than to determine the final contract. For most players, many calls (bids, doubles and redoubles, and sometimes even passes) are not made with the intention that they become the final contract, but to describe the strength and distribution of the player's hand, so that the partnership can make an informed guess which is the best contract, and/or to obstruct the opponents' bidding. The set of agreements used by a partnership about the meaning of each call is referred to as a [[bidding system]], full details of which must be made available to the opponents; 'secret' systems are not allowed. An opponent can ask the bidder's partner to explain the meaning of the call.

The pair that did not win the contract is called the ''defense''. The pair that made the last bid is divided further: the player who first made a bid in the denomination of the final contract becomes the ''declarer'' and his partner becomes the ''dummy.''  For example, suppose West is the dealer and the bidding was:

{| class=wikitable
!width=&quot;25%&quot;|'''West '''
!width=&quot;25%&quot;|'''North '''
!width=&quot;25%&quot;|'''East '''
!width=&quot;25%&quot;|'''South'''
|-
|Pass || 1{{Hearts}} || Pass || 1{{Spades}}
|-
|Pass || 2{{Diams}} || Double || 3{{Spades}}
|-
|Pass || 4{{Spades}} || Pass || Pass
|-
|Pass || || ||
|}

Then East and West would be the defenders, South would be the declarer (being the first to bid spades), North would be the dummy, and spades the trump suit; 10 tricks would be required by declarer (and dummy). Since East's double of 2{{Diams}} was invalidated by the subsequent South's 3{{Spades}} bid, it does not affect the contract. For the purpose of determining the declarer, bids in the denomination of the final contract by the defense are ignored.

[[Bidding box]]es contain a special card for each possible call. When these are in use, players make a call by taking the appropriate card from the bidding box and placing it on the table. This avoids the need for players to bid out loud. This prevents players at nearby tables overhearing the bidding and also avoids voice inflexions passing information to a partner. Pre-printed bidding pads, on which the calls can be written, are sometimes used instead in Australia and New Zealand.

=== Play of the hand ===
The play consists of 13 [[trick (cards)|tricks]], each trick consisting of one card played from each of the four hands. Aces are high in bridge, followed by kings, queens, jacks, 10s, 9s ... down to 2s, the lowest card in each suit. The first card played in a trick is called the ''lead''; after the lead, play proceeds clockwise around the table. Any card may be selected from a hand as the lead, but the remaining hands must ''follow suit'', meaning they must play a card of the same suit as the lead, unless the hand in question has no more cards of that suit, in which case any card may be played. The hand that plays the highest card in the suit of the lead wins the trick, unless any of the played cards are of the ''trump suit'', in which case the hand that plays the highest trump card wins the trick. The hand that wins the trick plays the lead card of the next trick, until all the cards have been played.

The first lead, called the ''opening lead'', is made by the defender to the left of the declarer. After the opening lead is played, the dummy lays his/her hand face up on the table in four columns, one for each suit, with the column of the trump suit (if there is one) on the right as dummy looks at the table. The declarer is responsible for selecting cards to play from the dummy's hand and from his own hand in turn. The defenders each choose the cards to play from their own hands. Dummy is allowed to try to prevent declarer from infringing the rules, but otherwise must not interfere with the play; for example, dummy may attempt to prevent declarer from leading from the wrong hand (by stating, e.g., &quot;you won the last trick in dummy&quot;) but must not comment on opponents' actions or make suggestions as to play. In casual bridge games the dummy often does nothing, but in duplicate bridge dummy must play cards from the dummy hand at declarer's instruction (e.g., by saying &quot;jack of hearts please, partner&quot;, or less frequently by touching or pointing at the card that declarer wishes to play).

The contract level sets a specific target: in the example above, the declarer must attempt to win ten tricks (the assumed &quot;book&quot; of six, plus four as bid, with spades as trumps), to ''make'' the contract and get a positive score. Success in this goal is rewarded by points in the scoring phase for the declarer's side. If the declarer fails to make the contract, the defenders are said to have ''set'' or ''defeated'' the contract (declarer has ''gone down''), and are awarded points for doing so.

If a declarer does not have enough tricks immediately available to make his contract, he can try to develop additional tricks through a variety of methods. These include:
*losing tricks to the defenders' high cards in order to &quot;promote&quot; the remaining cards of that suit in his hand.
*running out long suits after the defenders' cards in that suit are exhausted, to force defenders to discard useful cards.
*the finesse, in which a low card is led toward a high card in the hope of trapping a high card held by the defender who must play in between.
*in trump contracts, the declarer may attempt to cover losers in his hand by trumping them in dummy, while also taking care to draw out the defenders' trumps if necessary.
*cutting communications between the two defenders, for instance by allowing them to win early tricks in a suit until they are unable to use the suit as an entry.
*more advanced techniques include the &quot;squeeze&quot; in which a defender is forced to choose which card to discard ''before'' declarer has to make his own discard choice.

=== Scoring ===
{{Main|Bridge scoring}}

The goal for each pair is to make as high a score as possible. However, if the contract is made, the level of the contract is the primary factor affecting the scoring, rather than the number of tricks taken in play: for example, if the declarer takes all 13 tricks without trumps, there is a huge score difference between the cases of contract being 1NT and 7NT. This premium for contracting to take more tricks ensures competitiveness in the auction: even if a partnership holds most of the high cards and their opponents have no interest in bidding, they are still encouraged to bid high in order to achieve the best possible score, which in turn often results in contracts that are difficult to make.

When the declarer makes the contract, the declarer's side receives points for:

* Every trick bid and made (20 for minor suit contracts, 30 for major suit and no-trump ones, with an additional 10 points for the first trick at no-trump)
* Overtricks (tricks taken over the contract level), again with 20 for minor suits, 30 for majors and no-trump
* Bonuses for contract level
* Other specific bonuses

When the declarer fails to make the contract, the defending pair receives points for ''undertricks''&amp;nbsp;— the number of tricks by which declarer fell short of the goal.

Because of the structure of bonuses, certain bid levels have special significance. The most important level is ''game'', which is any contract whose bid trick value is 100 or more points. Game level varies by suit, since different suits are worth different amounts in scoring. The game level for no-trump is 3 (9 tricks, 3 x 30 + 10 = 100), the game level for hearts or spades (''major suits'') is 4 (10 tricks, 4 x 30 = 120), and the game level for clubs or diamonds (''minor suits'') is 5 (11 tricks, 5 x 20 = 100). Because of the value of the game bonus, much of the bidding revolves around investigating the possibility of making game. Even higher bonuses are also awarded for bidding and making ''small slam'' (level 6, ie 12 tricks) and the rather rare ''grand slam'' (level 7, i.e. all 13 tricks). The contracts below game level are called ''partial contracts'' or ''part scores''.

The concept of ''vulnerability'' affects scoring and introduces a wider range of tactics in bidding and play. Every partnership is beforehand assigned one of two states: ''vulnerable'' or ''non-vulnerable''. When a pair is vulnerable, game and slam bonuses are higher, as are penalties for failure to make the contract. Methods for assigning vulnerability differ between duplicate and rubber bridge.

There are two important variations in bridge scoring: [[rubber bridge|rubber scoring]] and duplicate/Chicago scoring. They share most features, but differ in how the total score is accumulated. In rubber bridge, the declaring partnership counts points for successfully taken contracted tricks &quot;below the line&quot; on a scoresheet (which can be accumulated to make a game), while penalties and bonuses are tallied &quot;above the line&quot;. The first partnership to accumulate two games gets a &quot;rubber&quot; bonus. In duplicate bridge, all the points are accumulated for each hand by itself and present a single score, expressed as a positive number (sum of trick points and bonus points) for the winning pair, and by implication, as a negative number for their opponents. (A third form, &quot;Chicago&quot; bridge, is a form of &quot;friendly&quot; game that uses duplicate scoring, with every deal scored as a single number, but usually with only one table (i.e., not duplicated elsewhere) and with vulnerability assigned in a very simple fashion.) Part-scores are not carried forward from one hand to the next.

In [[duplicate bridge]], the same cards are played unchanged at two or more tables, and the results are then compared. Scores at each table are recorded on traveling slips that move with the boards or on pickup slips taken to the director. More recently, wireless electronic scoring is becoming more common. For this, each table has a purpose-built keypad on which players enter the score which is then transmitted directly to the scoring computer, doing away with paper slips.

Depending on the type of tournament, after the different scores on a board are compared, the relative scores are converted either to ''match points (MP)'' or to ''international match points (IMP)''. Regardless of the actual contract, the competitor (pair or team) with the best performance on each board gets the highest number of MP or IMP for that board, and vice versa. The competitor with the highest total number of MP or IMP becomes the winner of the tournament. Thus, even with bad cards, competitors can win the tournament if they have bid better and/or played better than the other players who played the same set of cards.

Match points (or (for teams) &quot;Board-a-match&quot;) scoring simply awards a team or pair two match points for every other pair that had a lower score playing the same hands on that board and one match point for every other pair that had exactly the same score. (In the USA, the points awarded not 2 and 1, but 1 and ½.)

IMPs convert differences in scores using a sliding scale. 0 IMPS are awarded for a 0-10 point difference. This requires slightly different tactics at the table.

=== Laws of duplicate contract bridge ===
{{Main|Laws of Duplicate Contract Bridge}}

The Laws constitute the rules of the game. In addition to the basic rules there are a great many additional rules covering playing conditions and how to deal with various kinds of irregularity. The players do not need to be familiar with many of these additional rules, which are rarely referred to and are included mainly for the benefit of tournament directors. In addition, some details are left to the discretion of the national bridge organisation (for tournaments under their aegis) and some (for example the choice of ''movement'') to the sponsoring organisation (eg the club).

The worldwide rules are promulgated by the World Bridge Federation (WBF) as the &quot;International Code of Laws of Duplicate Bridge 2007 (LAW)&quot;, available under www.worldbridge.org/departments/laws. There are 93 laws.

National organisations publish books containing their version of the Laws: for example the [[American Contract Bridge League]] publishes a book, &quot;Laws of Duplicate Bridge&quot;. The ACBL also publishes additional documentation to support bridge directors, including Director Decisions, Tech Files and Casebook (Appeals) from national bridge championships. A cross-referenced listing including documentation is available at www.bridgehands.com/Laws/index.htm. Contract bridge laws, requirements for convention charts, alerts, and other laws is also available online.

The laws were compiled by Harold S. Vanderbilt in 1925, but there have been many detailed changes since then in an effort to make the game fairer. Vanderbilt introduced ''inter alia'' the current concept of scoring, the use of boards to hold the cards, and the Tournament Director. The main responsibilities of the tournament director are to adjudicate on disputes and irregularities that occur during the tournament and to control the [[duplicate bridge movements|movement]].

Despite or perhaps because of the complexity of the laws, there are sometimes difficulties in interpreting them to apply to specific situations, and various organisations have committees to make judgements on the rules and to conduct appeals against decisions by tournament directors.

Clearly detailed precise rules are important for high level tournaments, but may in part be less relevant to, and unhelpful for, bridge played in local clubs.

=== Laws of rubber bridge ===
&quot;Rubber bridge&quot; is a version of the game played by four players on their own. Each hand is only played once so there is no comparison of scores. Thus it contrasts with duplicate bridge. A succession of hands are played and the scores made by each side are accumulated until one side has won two &quot;games&quot;, at which point the overall scores are totalled and the winner is determined. (As in duplicate, a minimum trick score of 100 is required for game.) The main differences in scoring compared with duplicate bridge are that
* &quot;part-scores&quot; (trick scores of less than 100) are accumulated to count towards game, but are not carried forward to the following game.
* there is no bonus for making a part-score.
* a bonus may be awarded for &quot;honours&quot;, ie for holding all or most of the high cards in the trump suit.
* &quot;vulnerability&quot; (which affects the size of penalties and bonuses) is determined by previous games within the rubber, whereas in duplicate it is predetermined by the number of the board.
In the rubber bridge game variant known as [[Chicago (bridge card game)|Chicago]], vulnerability is predetermined (in rounds of four deals) but scoring is otherwise similar to duplicate bridge.

== History ==
{{Main|History of contract bridge}}

Bridge is member of the family of [[trick-taking game]]s and is a development of [[Whist]], which had become the dominant such game enjoying a loyal following for centuries. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Bridge'' is the [[English language|English]] pronunciation of a game called ''[[Biritch]]'', which was also known as Russian Whist.

The oldest known [[s:Biritch, or Russian Whist|Biritch rule book]] dates from 1886 and documents many significant bridge-like developments from whist: dealer chose the [[trump (cards)|trump]] suit, or nominated his partner to do so; there was a call of notrumps (''biritch''); dealer's partner's hand became dummy; points were scored above and below the line; game was 3NT, 4H and 5D (although 8 club odd tricks and 15 spade odd tricks were needed); the score could be doubled and redoubled; and there were slam bonuses. This game, and variants of it known as ''bridge''&lt;ref&gt;(Elwell 1905 and Benedict 1900)&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''bridge-whist'',&lt;ref&gt;(Melrose 1901)&lt;/ref&gt; became popular in the United States and the UK in the 1890s despite the long-established dominance of whist.&lt;ref&gt;(Foster 1889)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 [[auction bridge]], (also known as ''royal auction bridge''&lt;ref&gt;(Bergholt 1915)&lt;/ref&gt;), was developed, in which the players bid in a competitive auction to decide the contract and declarer. The object became to make at least as many tricks as were contracted for and penalties were introduced for failing to do so.

The modern game of contract bridge was the result of innovations to the scoring of auction bridge made by [[Harold Stirling Vanderbilt]] and others. The most significant change was that only the tricks contracted for were scored below the line toward game or a slam bonus, a change that resulted in bidding becoming much more challenging and interesting. Also new was the concept of ''vulnerability'', making sacrifices to protect the lead in a rubber more expensive, and the various [[bridge scoring|scores]] were adjusted to produce a more balanced game. Vanderbilt set out his rules in 1925, and within a few years contract bridge had so supplanted other forms of the game that &quot;bridge&quot; became synonymous with &quot;contract bridge.&quot;

In the USA, most of the bridge played today is [[duplicate bridge]], which is played at clubs, in tournaments and online.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In the UK, [[rubber bridge]] is still popular in both homes and clubs, as is duplicate bridge.  It has been noted that the popularity of contract bridge has waned in recent years for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''Turning Tricks&amp;nbsp;— The rise and fall of contract bridge, The New Yorker'', September 17, 2007  [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/09/17/070917crbo_books_owen Newyorker.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tournaments ==
Bridge is a game of skill played with [[random]]ly dealt cards, which makes it also a [[game of chance]], or more exactly, a tactical game with inbuilt randomness, imperfect knowledge and restricted communication. The chance element is in the deal of the cards; in competitions and clubs the chance element is largely eliminated by comparing results of multiple pairs in identical situations. This is achievable when there are eight or more players, sitting at two or more tables, and the deals from each table are preserved and passed to the next table, thereby ''duplicating'' them for the next table of participants to play. At the end of a session, the scores for each deal are compared, and the most points are awarded to the players doing the best with each particular deal. This measures skill because each player is being judged only on the ability to bid with, and play, the same cards as other players. However very often even the most skillful play will only succeed some of the time, and the skilled player may be unlucky because an alternative, less expert play achieves a better result. But in the long run the expert player will score better.

This form of the game is referred to as ''duplicate bridge'' and is played in clubs and tournaments, which can gather as many as several hundred players. Duplicate bridge is a [[mind sport]], and its popularity gradually became comparable to that of [[chess]], with which it is often compared for its complexity and the mental skills required for high-level competition. Bridge and chess are the only &quot;mind sports&quot; recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]], although they were not found eligible for the main [[Olympic games|Olympic]] program.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of the Olympic programme and the recommendations on the programme of the games of the XXIX Olympiad, Beijing 2008; page 8|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_527.pdf|date=2002-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise of duplicate bridge had previously been used for whist matches as early as 1857. Initially, bridge was not thought to be suitable for duplicate competition; it wasn't until the 1920s that (auction) bridge tournaments became popular.

In 1925 when contract bridge first evolved, bridge tournaments were becoming popular, but the rules were somewhat in flux, and several different organizing bodies were involved in tournament sponsorship: the [[American Bridge League]] (formerly the American Auction Bridge League, which changed its name in 1929), the [[American Whist League]], and the [[United States Bridge Association]]. In 1935, the first officially recognized world championship was held. By 1937, however, the [[American Contract Bridge League]] had come to power (a union of the ABL and the USBA), and it remains the principal organizing body for [[North American Bridge Championships|bridge tournaments]] in North America. In 1958, the [[World Bridge Federation]] was founded to promote bridge world-wide, coordinate periodic revision to the Laws and conduct world championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Bidding boxes and bidding screens ===
[[Image:Encheres bridge.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Bidding box]]

In tournaments, &quot;[[bidding box]]es&quot; are frequently used, as noted above. In top national and international events, &quot;[[screen (bridge)|bidding screens]]&quot; are used. These are placed diagonally across the table, preventing partners from seeing each other during the game; often the screen is removed after the auction is complete.

== Game strategy ==
=== Bidding ===
{{Main|Bidding system|Convention (bridge)}}

Much of the complexity in bridge arises from the difficulty of arriving at a good final contract in the auction. This is a difficult problem: the two players in a partnership must try to communicate sufficient information about their hands to arrive at a makeable contract, but the information they can exchange is restricted—information may be passed only by the calls made and later by the cards played, not by other means; in addition, the agreed-upon meaning of each call and play must be available to the opponents.

Since a partnership that has freedom to bid gradually at leisure can exchange more information, and since a partnership that can interfere with the opponents' bidding (as by raising the bidding level rapidly) can cause difficulties for their opponents, bidding systems are both informational and strategic. It is this mixture of information exchange and evaluation, deduction, and tactics that is at the heart of bidding in bridge.

A number of basic [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]] in bridge bidding and play are summarized as [[bridge maxims]].

==== Bidding systems and conventions ====
A ''bidding system'' is a set of partnership agreements on the meanings of bids. A partnership's bidding system is usually made up of a core system, modified and complemented by specific [[convention (bridge)|conventions]] (optional customizations incorporated into the main system for handling specific bidding situations) which are pre-chosen between the partners prior to play. The line between a well-known convention and a part of a system is not always clear-cut: some bidding systems include specified conventions by default. Bidding systems can be divided into mainly natural systems such as [[Acol]] and [[Standard American]], and mainly artificial systems such as the [[Precision Club]].

Calls are usually considered to be either ''natural'' or ''conventional'' (artificial). A natural bid is one in which the suit and level bid is essentially passing the information &quot;I have some cards in this suit and (usually) some high cards in my hand&quot;; a natural double says in effect &quot;I don't think the opponents can make their contract, so I want to raise the stakes&quot;. By contrast, a conventional (artificial) call offers and/or asks for information by means of pre-agreed coded interpretations, in which some calls convey very specific information or requests that are not part of the natural meaning of the call. Thus in response to 4NT, a 'natural' bid of 5{{Diams}} would state a preference towards a diamond suit or a desire to play the contract in 5 diamonds, whereas if the partners have agreed to use the common [[Blackwood convention]], a bid of 5{{Diams}} in the same situation would say nothing about the diamond suit, but tell the partner that the hand in question contains exactly one ace.

Conventions are valuable in bridge because of the need to pass information beyond a simple like or dislike of a particular suit, and because the limited bidding space can be used more efficiently by taking situations in which a given call will have less utility, because the information it would convey is not valuable or because the desire to convey that information would arise only rarely, and giving that call an artificial meaning that conveys more useful (or more frequently useful) information. There are a very large number of conventions from which players can choose; many books have been written detailing bidding conventions. Well-known conventions include [[Stayman]] (to ask for the showing of any 4 card major suit in a 1NT opener's hand), [[Jacoby transfer]]s (a request by the weak hand for the stronger partner to bid a particular suit first, and therefore to become the declarer), and the [[Blackwood convention]] (to ask for information on the number of aces and kings held, used in slam bidding situations).

The term ''[[preempt]]'' refers to a high level tactical bid by a weak hand, relying upon a long suit rather than high-value cards for tricks. Preemptive bids serve a double purpose&amp;nbsp;— they allow players to indicate they are bidding on the basis of a long suit in an otherwise weak hand, which is important information to share, and they also consume substantial bidding room before a possibly strong opposing pair can identify whether they have a good possibility to play the hand, or in what suit or at what level they should do so. Several systems include the use of opening bids or other early bids with weak hands including long (usually six to eight card) suits at the 2, 3 or even 4 or 5 levels as preempts.

==== Basic natural systems ====
As a rule, a natural suit bid indicates a holding of at least four (or more, depending on the situation and the system) cards in that suit as an opening bid, or a lesser number when supporting partner; a natural NT bid indicates a balanced hand.

Most systems use a count of [[high card point]]s as the basic evaluation of the strength of a hand, refining this by reference to shape and distribution if appropriate. In the most commonly used point count system, aces are counted as 4 points, kings as 3, queens as 2, and jacks as 1 point; therefore, the deck contains 40 points. In addition, the ''distribution'' of the cards in a hand into suits may also contribute to the strength of a hand and be counted as [[point count|distribution points]]. A better than average hand, containing 12 or 13 points, is usually considered sufficient to ''open'' the bidding, i.e., to make the first bid in the auction. A combination of two such hands (i.e., 25 or 26 points shared between partners) is often sufficient for a partnership to bid, and generally to make, game in a [[major suit]] or notrump (more are usually needed for a [[minor suit]] game, as the level is higher).

In natural systems, a 1NT opening bid usually reflects a hand that has a relatively balanced shape (usually between two and four (or less often five) cards in each suit) and a sharply limited number of high card points, usually somewhere between 12 and 18&amp;nbsp;— the most common ranges use a span of exactly three points, (e.g., 12-14, 15-17 or 16-18), but some systems use a 4 point range, usually 15-18.

Opening bids of 3 or higher are preemptive bids, i.e., bids made with weak hands that especially favor a particular suit, opened at a high level in order to define the hand's value quickly and to frustrate the opposition. For example, a hand of {{BridgeHandInline|KQJ9872|7|42|763}} would be a candidate for an opening bid of 3{{Spades}}, designed to make it difficult for the opposing team to bid and find their [[optimum contract]] even if they have the bulk of the points, as it is nearly valueless unless spades are trumps, it contains good enough spades that the penalty for being set should not be higher than the value of an opponent game, and the high card weakness makes it more likely that the opponents have enough strength to make game themselves.

Openings at the 2 level are either unusually strong (2NT, natural, and 2{{Clubs}}, artificial) or preemptive, depending on the system. Unusually strong bids communicate an especially high number of points (normally 20 or more) or a high trick-taking potential (normally 8 or more).

Opening bids at the one level are made with hands containing 12–13 points or more and which are not suitable for one of the preceding bids. Using [[Standard American]] with [[Five-card majors|5-card majors]], opening hearts or spades usually promises a 5-card suit. Partnerships who agree to play 5-card majors open a [[minor suit]] with 4-card majors and then bid their [[major suit]] at the next opportunity. This means that an opening bid of 1{{Clubs}} or 1{{Diamonds}} will sometimes be made with only 3 cards in that suit.

Doubles are sometimes given conventional meanings in otherwise mostly natural systems. A natural, or ''penalty'' double, is one used to try to gain extra points when the defenders are confident of setting (defeating) the contract. The most common example of a conventional double is the [[takeout double]] of a low-level suit bid, implying support for the unbid suits or the unbid major suits and asking partner to choose one of them.

==== Variations on the basic themes ====
Bidding systems depart from these basic ideas in varying degrees. [[Standard American]], for instance, is a collection of conventions designed to bolster the accuracy and power of these basic ideas, while Precision Club is a system that uses the 1{{Clubs}} opening bid for all or almost all strong hands (but sets the threshold for &quot;strong&quot; rather lower than most other systems&amp;nbsp;— usually 16 high card points) and may include other artificial calls to handle other situations (but it may contain natural calls as well). Many experts today use a system called [[2/1 game forcing]] (pronounced two over one game forcing), which is similar to but more complicated than Standard American. In the UK, [[Acol]] is the most common system.

There are also a variety of advanced techniques used for hand evaluation. The most basic is [[point count|the Milton Work point count]], (the 4-3-2-1 system detailed above) but this is sometimes modified in various ways, or either augmented or replaced by other approaches such as [[losing trick count]], [[honor point count]], [[law of total tricks]], or [[Zar Points]].

Common conventions and variations within natural systems include:
:* Point count required for 1 NT opening bid ('mini' 10-12, 'weak' 12-14, 'strong' 15-17 or 16-18)
:* Whether an opening bid of 1{{Hearts}} and 1{{Spades}} requires a minimum of 4 or 5 cards in the suit (''4 or 5 card majors'')
:* Whether 1{{Clubs}} (and sometimes 1{{Diams}}) is 'natural' or 'suspect' ''(also called 'phoney' or 'short')'', signifying an opening hand lacking a notable heart or spade suit
:* Whether opening bids at the two level are 'strong' (20+ points) or '[[Weak two bid|weak]]' (i.e., pre-emptive with a 6 card suit). (Note: an [[Strong two clubs|opening bid]] of 2{{Clubs}} is usually played in otherwise natural systems as conventional, signifying any exceptionally strong hand)
:* ''[[Blackwood convention|Blackwood]]'' (either the original version or ''[[Blackwood convention#Roman Key Card Blackwood .28RKCB.29|Roman Key Card]]'')
:* ''[[Stayman convention|Stayman]]'' (together with Blackwood, described as &quot;the two most famous conventions in Bridge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge Lessons series, ''Stayman &amp; Transfer'' (Deal 1), by Andrew Robson&lt;/ref&gt;)
:* Whether the partnership will play ''[[Jacoby transfer]]s'' (bids of 2{{Diamonds}} and 2{{Hearts}} over 1NT or 3{{Diamonds}} and 3{{Hearts}} over 2NT respectively require the 1NT or 2NT bidder to rebid 2{{Hearts}} and 2{{Spades}} or 3{{Hearts}} and 3{{Spades}}), ''minor suit transfers'' (bids of 2{{Spades}} and either 2NT or 3{{Clubs}} over 1NT respectfully require the 1NT bidder to bid 3{{Clubs}} and 3{{Diamonds}}) and ''Texas transfers'' (bids of 4{{Diamonds}} and 4{{Hearts}} respectively require the 1NT, or 2NT bidder to rebid 4{{Hearts}} and 4{{Spades}})
:* What types of ''[[cue bid]]s (e.g. rebidding the opponent's suit)'' the partnership will play, if any.
:* Whether doubling a contract at the 1, 2 and sometimes higher levels signifies a belief that the opponents' contract will fail and a desire to raise the stakes (a ''penalty double''), or an indication of strength but no biddable suit coupled with a request that partner bid something (a ''[[takeout double]]'').
:* How the partnership's bidding practices will be varied if their opponents intervene or compete.
:* Which (if any) bids are ''[[forcing bid|forcing]]'' and require a response.

Within play, it is also commonly agreed what systems of opening leads, signals and discards will be played:
:* Conventions for the [[opening lead]] govern how the first card to be played will be chosen and what it will mean,
:* [[Signal (bridge)|Signals]] indicate how cards played within a suit are chosen&amp;nbsp;— for example, playing a noticeably high  card when this would not be expected can signal encouragement to continue playing the suit, and a low card can signal discouragement and a desire for partner to choose some other suit. (Some partnerships use &quot;reverse&quot; signals, meaning that a noticeably high card ''discourages'' that suit and a noticeably low card ''encourages'' that suit, thus not &quot;wasting&quot; a potentially useful intermediate card in the suit of interest.)
:* [[Discard (bridge)|Discards]] cover the situation when a defender cannot follow suit and therefore has free choice what card to play or throw away. In such circumstances the thrown-away card can be used to indicate some aspect of the hand, or a desire for a specific suit to be played.
:* [[Count Signals (bridge)|Count signals]] cover the situation when a defender is following suit (usually to a suit that the declarer has led). In such circumstances the order in which a defender plays his spot cards will indicate whether an even or odd number of cards was originally held in that suit. This can help the other defender count out the entire original distribution of the cards in that suit. It is sometimes critical to know this when defending.

==== Advanced bidding techniques ====
Every call (including &quot;pass&quot;, also sometimes called &quot;no bid&quot;) serves two purposes. It confirms or passes some information to a partner, and also denies by implication any other kind of hand which would have tended to support an alternative call. For example, a bid of 2NT immediately after partner's 1NT not only shows a balanced hand of a certain point range, but also would almost always deny possession of a five-card major suit (otherwise the player would have bid it) or even a four card major suit (in that case, the player would probably have used the Stayman convention).

Likewise, in some partnerships the bid of 2{{Hearts}} in the sequence 1NT - 2{{Clubs}} - 2{{Diams}} - 2{{Hearts}} between partners (opponents passing throughout) explicitly shows five hearts but also confirms four cards in spades: the bidder must hold at least five hearts to make it worth looking for a heart fit after 2{{Diams}} denied a four card major, and with at least five hearts, a Stayman bid must have been justified by having exactly four spades, the other major (since Stayman (as used by this partnership) is not useful with anything except a four card major suit).&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Andrew Robson ''Bridge Lessons'' series, &quot;Stayman &amp; Transfer&quot;, deal 14&lt;/ref&gt; Thus an astute partner can read much more than the surface meaning into the bidding. Alternatively, many partnerships play this same bidding sequence as &quot;Crawling Stayman&quot; by which the responder shows a weak hand (less than eight high card points) with shortness in diamonds but at least four hearts and four spades; the opening bidder may correct to spades if that appears to be the better contract.

The situations detailed here are extremely simple examples; many instances of advanced bidding involve specific agreements related to very specific situations and subtle inferences regarding entire sequences of calls.

=== Play techniques ===
{{Main|Play techniques (bridge)}}

[[Terence Reese]], a prolific author of bridge books, points out that there are only four ways of taking a trick by force, two of which are very easy:

*playing a high card that no one else can beat
*trumping an opponent's high card
*establishing long suits (the last cards in a suit will take tricks if the opponents don't have the suit and are unable to trump)
*playing for the opponents' high cards to be in a particular position (if their ace is to the right of your king, your king may be able to take a trick, especially if, when that suit is led, the player to your right has to play their card before you do)

Nearly all trick-taking techniques in bridge can be reduced to one of these four methods.

The optimum play of the cards can require much thought and experience, and is too complicated to describe in a short article. However, below are some of the common techniques.

==== Techniques by declarer ====
&lt;!-- One of the most fundamental skills is counting the number of tricks you are expecting to obtain. There are two typical ways: counting the winners or counting the losers.
There are many ways to obtain extra tricks. Below are some o

*when not to draw trumps

**discarding a quick loser
**complete crossruff

*the [[duck (bridge)|duck]]
*the [[dummy reversal]]
*the [[endplay]]
*various [[coup (bridge)|coups]]
*the [[squeeze play (bridge)|squeeze]]
*the [[principle of restricted choice (bridge)|principle of restricted choice]]
*the theory of vacant spaces (probability)
*techniques for playing various [[suit combinations]]
*percentages
*the [[safety play]]

==== Techniques by defenders ====
Defense is commonly seen as much harder than playing as a declarer mainly because the defenders have less information than the declarer. The defense starts with the [[opening lead]], which often determines the course of play and hence the result of the hand. It is so important that the common opening lead conventions are usually included in the [[convention card (bridge)|convention card]]. Below are the most commonly used conventions:
*Which card to lead in a suit
**the higher card from a doubleton to show count, create ruff opportunity, and avoid blocking (with or without honors)
**the top card from a ''three-card'' sequence with honor(s) to cash and possibly establish the suit (strong enough to do so)
**the smallest one or the fourth-highest card in a suit with honor to encourage return and help establish the suit (both suit and no-trump contracts)
**A or K from a suit led by AK for suit and no-trump contracts (depending on conventions)
**an agreed card from a three-card suit without honor in suit and no-trump contracts (depending on conventions). The middle card from a three card suit without honor is a commonly used agreement
*Which suit to lead
**singleton/doubleton for ruff in the second/third round
**longest and strongest in notrump contracts
**partner's bid suit
**trump suit
*Aggressive or passive leads

After the opening lead, the most important technique is [[Signal (bridge)|signaling]].  Signaling passes information on the defender's hand to his partner (and also to the declarer). There are three types of signals: attitude signals (encouraging or discouraging the suit led), count signals (showing the number of cards held in the suit), and suit preference signals. Among them, the attitude signals are most frequently used.

Since the defenders usually have access to less information, communication is important for the defenders. Other techniques used by the defence (as well as by declarer) include [[unblocking (bridge)|unblocking]], [[overtaking (bridge)|overtaking]] and [[ducking (bridge)|ducking]].

It may be preferable for a beginner to learn play as a declarer before play as a defender; techniques for defence play include those used by the declarer.

The cards are dealt as in the [[contract bridge diagram|diagram]], and North is the dealer. As neither North nor East have sufficient strength to ''open'' the bidding, they each pass, denying such strength. South, next in turn, opens with the bid of 1{{Hearts}}, which denotes a reasonable heart suit (at least 4 or 5 cards long, depending on the system) and at least 12 [[high card point]]s. On this hand, south has 14 high card points. West ''[[overcall]]s'' with 1{{Spades}}, since he has a longish spade suit of reasonable quality and 10 high card points (an overcall can be made on a hand that is not quite strong enough for an opening bid). North ''supports'' partner's suit with 2{{Hearts}}, showing heart support and about 6-8 points. East supports spades with 2{{Spades}}. South inserts a ''[[game try]]'' of 3{{Clubs}}, ''inviting'' the partner to bid the ''game'' of 4{{Hearts}} with good club support and overall values. North complies, as North is at the higher end of the range for his 2{{Hearts}} bid, and has a fourth trump (the 2{{Hearts}} bid promised only three), and the ''doubleton'' queen of clubs to fit with partner's strength there. (North could instead have bid 3{{Hearts}}, indicating not enough strength for game, asking south to pass and so play 3{{Hearts}}.) The bidding was:

{| class='wikitable'
!West||North||East||South
|-
| ||Pass||Pass||1{{Hearts}}
|-
|1{{Spades}}||2{{Hearts}}||2{{Spades}}||3{{Clubs}}

In the auction, North-South are trying to investigate whether their cards are sufficient to make a '''game''' (ten tricks in hearts or spades, 11 tricks in clubs or diamonds), which yields bonus points if bid and made. East-West are ''competing'' in spades, hoping to play a contract in spades at a low level. 4{{Hearts}} is the final contract, 10 tricks being required for N-S to make with hearts as trump.

South is the ''declarer'', having been first to bid hearts, and the player to South's left, West, has to choose the first card in the play, known as the ''opening lead''. West chooses the spade king because spades is the suit the partnership has shown strength in, and because they have agreed that when they hold two ''touching honors'' (or ''adjacent honors'') they will play the higher one first. West plays the card face down, to give their partner and the declarer (but not dummy) a chance to ask any last questions about the bidding or to object if they believe West is not the correct hand to lead. After that, North's cards are laid on the table and North becomes ''dummy'', as both the North and South hands will be controlled by the declarer. West turns the lead card face up, and the declarer studies the two hands to make a plan for the play. On this hand, the trump ace, a spade, and a diamond trick must be lost, so declarer must not lose a trick in clubs.

If the {{Clubs}}K is held by West, South will find it very hard to prevent it making a trick (unless West leads a club). However, there is an almost-equal chance that it is held by East, in which case it can be 'trapped' against the ace, and will be beaten, using a tactic known as a ''[[finesse]]''.

After considering the cards, the declarer directs dummy (North) to play a small spade. East plays ''low'' (small card) and South takes the {{Spades}}A, gaining the ''lead''. (South may also elect to ''[[duck (bridge)|duck]]'', but for the purpose of this example, let us assume South wins the {{Spades}}A at trick 1). South proceeds by ''drawing trump'', leading the {{Hearts}}K. West decides there is no benefit to holding back, and so wins the trick with the ace, and then cashes the {{Spades}}Q. For fear of conceding a ''[[ruff and discard]]'', West plays the {{Diams}}2 instead of another spade. Declarer plays low from the table, and East scores the {{Diams}}Q. Not having anything better to do, East returns the remaining trump, taken in South's hand. The trumps now accounted for, South can now execute the finesse, perhaps trapping the king as planned. South ''enters'' the dummy (i.e. wins a trick in the dummy's hand) by leading a low diamond, using dummy's {{Diams}}A to win the trick, and leads the {{Clubs}}Q from dummy to the next trick. East ''covers'' the queen with the king, and South takes the trick with the Ace, and proceeds by ''cashing'' the remaining ''master'' {{Clubs}}J. (If East doesn't play the king, then South will play a low club from South's hand and the queen will win anyway, this being the essence of the finesse). The game is now safe: South ''[[ruff (cards)|ruffs]]'' a small club with a dummy's trump, then ruffs a diamond in hand for an ''entry'' back, and ruffs the last club in dummy (sometimes described as a ''[[crossruff]]''). Finally, South ''claims'' the remaining tricks by showing his or her hand, as it now contains only high trumps and there's no need to play the hand out to prove they are all winners.

(The trick-by-trick notation used above can be also expressed in tabular form, but a textual explanation is usually preferred in practice, for reader's convenience. Plays of small cards or ''discards'' are often omitted from such a description, unless they were important for the outcome).

North-South score the required 10 tricks, and their opponents take the remaining 3. The contract is fulfilled, and North enters the pair numbers, the contract, and the score of +620 for the winning side (North is in charge of bookkeeping in duplicate tournaments) on the [[traveling sheet]]. North asks East to check the score entered on the traveller. All players return their own cards to the board, and the next deal is played.

On the prior hand, it is quite possible that the {{Clubs}}K is held by West. For example, by swapping the {{Clubs}}K and {{Hearts}}A between the defending hands. Then the 4{{Hearts}} contract would fail by one trick (unless West had led a club early in the play). However the failure of the contract would not mean that 4{{Hearts}} is a bad contract on this hand. The contract depends on the club finesse working, or a mis-defense. The bonus points awarded for making a game contract far outweigh the penalty for going one off, so it is best strategy in the long run to bid game contracts such as this one.

Similarly, there is a minuscule chance that the {{Clubs}}K is in the west hand, but the west hand has no other clubs. In that case, declarer can succeed by simply cashing the {{Clubs}}A, felling the {{Clubs}}K and setting up the {{Clubs}}Q as a winner. However the chance of this is far lower than the simple chance of approximately 50% that East started with the {{Clubs}}K. Therefore the superior ''percentage'' play is to take the club finesse, as described above.

== Playing on the Internet ==
There are several free and some subscription-based servers available for playing bridge on the [[Internet]]. [[OKbridge]] is the oldest of the still-running Internet Bridge services;{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} players of all standards, from beginners to world champions may be found playing there. OKbridge is a subscription-based club, with services such as customer support and ethics reviews. Another subscription-based online Bridge club, founded in 1994, is [[Bridge Club Live]] (BCL). Calling itself &quot;the friendliest Bridge club of the world&quot;, BCL organizes annual 4–6 day meetings, in a different country each year, to get its members together. [[SWAN Games]] is a more recent competitor in subscription-based online Bridge clubs. [[Bridge Base Online]] is the most populated online bridge club in the world,{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} in part because it is free to play regular games. These clubs offer various features, such as opportunities to earn ACBL masterpoints, to play in online tournaments, to compile lists of friends, and to earn money playing Bridge. Bridge Base Online also has a [[Vugraph]] feature showing important international events for anyone interested to watch.

Some national contract bridge organizations now offer online bridge play to their members, including the English Bridge Union, the Dutch Bridge Union and the Australian Bridge Federation. MSN and Yahoo! Games have several online rubber bridge rooms. In 2001, World Bridge Federation issued a special edition of the lawbook adapted for internet and other electronic forms of the game.

Differences relevant to online play include:
* Flexibility when to play, and choice of opponent skill level.
* Player rating systems may attempt to measure ability without regard to the number of games played or the number of years spent accumulating [[masterpoints]].
* Fewer restrictions on the conventions that are permitted.
* Unauthorised information cannot be passed by [[Nonverbal communication|tone of voice]] or [[body language]] (but can much more easily be passed by external communication).
* Detailed records can be kept, to help resolve complaints.
* The software prevents improper plays and calls, such as insufficient bids, [[revoke]]s (failure to follow suit when able), and actions out of turn.

There are also a number of disadvantages:
* Inability to decide on bidding convention ahead of time, because partners are (usually) strangers.
* A reduced social element.
* Players may leave before a hand finishes, or in the middle of a planned session, either intentionally or because of connection difficulties.

== Computer bridge ==
After many years of little progress, [[computer bridge]] made great progress at the end of the 20th century. In 1996, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) initiated official World Championships Computer Bridge, to be held annually along with a major bridge event. The first Computer Bridge Championship took place in 1997 at the North American Bridge Championships in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].

Strong bridge playing programs such as Jack (World Champion in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2009), Wbridge5 (World Champion in 2005, 2007 and 2008), RoboBridge &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.RoboBridge.com RoboBridge]&lt;/ref&gt; and many-time finalist Bridge Baron, would probably rank among the top few thousand human pairs worldwide. A series of articles published in 2005 and 2006 in the Dutch bridge magazine [[List of significant bridge books and magazines|IMP]] describes matches between Jack and seven top Dutch pairs. A total of 196 boards were played. Overall, the program Jack lost, but by a small margin (359 versus 385 imps).

A '''boat''' is a [[watercraft]] of any size designed to float or [[Planing (sailing)|plane]], to provide passage across water. Usually this water will be inland ([[lake]]s) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the [[whaleboat]] were designed to be operated from a [[ship]] in an offshore environment. In [[Navy|naval]] terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Strictly speaking and uniquely a [[submarine]] is a boat as defined by the [[Royal Navy]]. Some boats too large for the naval definition include the [[lake freighter|Great Lakes freighter]], [[riverboat]], [[narrowboat]] and [[ferry]]boat.

The [[Uru (boat)|Uru]] wooden big boat made in [[Beypore]] a village in south [[Calicut]], [[Kerala]], in southwestern [[India]]. These have been used by the Arabs and Greeks since ancient times as trading vessels. This mammoth wooden ship was constructed using teak, without any iron or blueprints which has transportation capacity of 400 tonnes.

The accounts of historians [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Strabo]] suggest that boats were being used for commerce and traveling.&lt;ref name=McGrail &gt;McGrail 2004, pages 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{main|List of boat types}}
[[Image:Tug Boat NY 1.jpg|right|thumb|A [[tug boat]], used for towing or pushing other, larger [[Ship|vessels]].]]

Boats can be categorized into three types:
* Unpowered or human-powered boats. (Unpowered boats include [[raft]]s and floats meant for one-way downstream travel. Human-powered boats include [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[gondola]]s and boats propelled by poles like a [[Punt (boat)|punt]].)
* [[Sailing ship|Sailing boats]], which are boats propelled solely by means of [[sail]]s.
* [[Motorboat]]s, which are boats propelled by mechanical means, such as engines.

== Parts and terminology==
{{details|Glossary of nautical terms}}
[[Image:Oldboats.JPG|thumb|Aluminum flat-bottomed boats ashore for storage]]
Several key components make up the main structure of most boats. The [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] is the main structural component of the boat which actually provides buoyancy for the boat. The roughly horizontal, but chambered structures spanning the hull of the boat are referred to as the deck. In a ship there are often several decks, but a boat is unlikely to have more than one, if any at all. Above the deck are the [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructures]]. The underside of a deck is the deck head.

An enclosed space on a boat is referred to as a cabin. Several structures make up a cabin: the similar but usually lighter structure which spans a raised cabin is a coach-roof. The &quot;floor&quot; of a cabin is properly known as the sole, but is more likely to be called the floor (a floor is properly, a structural member which ties a frame to the keelson and keel). The vertical surfaces dividing the internal space are bulkheads. 

The [[keel]] is a lengthwise structural member to which the frames are fixed (sometimes referred to as a backbone).

The front (or forward end) of a boat is called the bow. Boats of earlier times often featured a [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] protruding from the front of the bows. The rear (or aft end) of the boat is called the stern. The right side (facing forward) is starboard and the left side is port.

== Building materials ==
{{see also|Boat building}}

[[Image:DerelictBoatFollyIs.jpg|thumb|upright|Derelict|A ship's [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]], built of steel, rusting away in the wetlands of [[Folly Island]], [[South Carolina]], [[United States]].]]
Until the mid 19th century most boats were of all natural materials; primarily wood although [[Reed (plant)|reed]], bark and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in Ancient Egypt, the [[birch bark]] [[canoe]], the animal hide-covered [[kayak]] and [[coracle]] and the [[dugout canoe]] made from a single log. By the mid 19th century, many boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. In 1855 ferro-cement boat construction was patented by the French. They called it Ferciment. This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat's hull and covered ([[trowell]]ed) over with cement. Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structure, it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode. These materials and methods were copied all over the world, and have faded in and out of popularity to the present. As the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats, and the [[Bessemer process]] ([[patent]]ed in 1855) cheapened the cost of steel, steel ships and boats began to be more common. By the 1930s boats built of all steel from frames to plating were seen replacing wooden boats in many industrial uses, even the fishing fleets. Private recreational boats in steel are uncommon. In the mid 20th century [[aluminium]] gained popularity. Though much more expensive than steel, there are now aluminium alloys available that will not corrode in salt water, and an aluminium boat built to similar load carrying standards could be built lighter than steel. 
[[Image:Boating in fair weather.jpg|thumb|left|A wooden boat operating near shore]]
Around the mid 1960s, boats made out of [[glass-reinforced plastic]], more commonly known as [[fibreglass]], became popular, especially for recreational boats. The [[United States Coast Guard]] refers to such boats as 'FRP' (for Fibre Reinforced Plastic) boats.

Fibreglass boats are extremely strong, and do not rust (iron oxide), corrode, or rot. They are, however susceptible to structural degradation from sunlight and extremes in temperature over their lifespan. Fibreglass provides structural strength, especially when long woven strands are laid, sometimes from bow to stern, and then soaked in epoxy or polyester resin to form the hull of the boat. Whether hand laid or built in a mold, FRP boats usually have an outer coating of gelcoat which is a thin solid colored layer of polyester resin that adds no structural strength, but does create a smooth surface which can be buffed to a high shine and also acts as a protective layer against sunlight. FRP structures can be made stiffer with sandwich panels, where the FRP encloses a lightweight core such as balsa or foam. Cored FRP is most often found in decking which helps keep down weight that will be carried above the waterline. The addition of wood makes the cored structure of the boat susceptible to rotting which puts a greater emphasis on not allowing damaged sandwich structures to go unrepaired. Plastic based foam cores are less vulnerable. The phrase 'advanced composites' in FRP construction may indicate the addition of carbon fibre, kevlar(tm) or other similar materials, but it may also indicate other methods designed to introduce less expensive and, by at least one yacht surveyor's eyewitness accounts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yachtsurvey.com/Fiberglass_Boats.htm Are They Fiberglass Boats Anymore? by David Pascoe, Marine Surveyor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; less structurally sound materials. 

Cold molding is similar to FRP in as much as it involves the use of epoxy or polyester resins, but the structural component is wood instead of fibreglass. In cold molding very thin strips of wood are laid over a form or mold in layers. This layer is then coated with resin and another directionally alternating layer is laid on top. In some processes the subsequent layers are stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous layers, but in other processes the layers are weighted or even vacuum bagged to hold layers together while the resin sets. Layers are built up thus to create the required thickness of hull.

People have even made their own boats or watercraft out of materials such as [[Extruded polystyrene|foam]] or plastic, but most homebuilts today are built of plywood and either painted or covered in a layer of fibreglass and resin.

=== Track-driven propulsion ===
[[File:Popular Science Dec 1918 p68 - History of boat propulsion, Water caterpillar.jpg|thumb|right|The water caterpillar boat propulsion system ([[Popular Science]] Monthly, December 1918, p 68)]]

An early uncommon means of boat propulsion was referred to as the ''water caterpillar'' which is similar in construction to paddles on a conveyor belt and preceded the development of tracked vehicles such as military tanks and earth moving equipment. A series of paddles on chains moved along the bottom of the boat to propel it over the water.&lt;ref&gt;''The Caterpillar Is Now Being Applied to Ships'', [[Popular Science]] monthly, December 1918, page 68, Scanned by Google Books: http://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&lt;/ref&gt;

The first water caterpillar was developed by Desblancs in 1782 and propelled by a steam engine. In the United States the first water caterpillar was patented in 1839 by William Leavenworth of New York.

==Buoyancy==
{{see also|Buoyancy}}

A floating boat [[displacement (fluid)|displaces]] its weight in water. The material of the boat hull may be denser than water, but if this is the case then it forms only the outer layer. If the boat floats, the mass of the boat (plus contents) ''as a whole'' divided by the volume ''below the waterline'' is equal to the [[density]] of water (1&amp;nbsp;kg/l). If weight is added to the boat, the volume below the waterline will increase to keep the weight balance equal, and so the boat sinks a little to compensate.

'''Blood''' is a specialized [[body fluid|bodily fluid]] that delivers necessary substances to the body's [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s (in [[animal]]s) – such as nutrients and [[oxygen]] – and transports [[waste]] products away from those same cells.

In [[vertebrate]]s, it is composed of [[blood cells]] suspended in a [[liquid]] called [[blood plasma]]. Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and contains dissipated proteins, [[glucose]], mineral ions, [[hormone]]s, [[carbon dioxide]] (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), [[platelets]] and blood cells themselves. The blood cells are mainly [[red blood cell]]s (also called RBCs or erythrocytes) and [[white blood cell]]s, including leukocytes and [[platelet]]s. The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain [[hemoglobin]], an [[iron]]-containing protein, which facilitates transportation of [[oxygen]] by reversibly binding to this [[Breath|respiratory]] gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly dissolved in plasma as [[bicarbonate]] ion.

Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated. Some animals, such as [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusk]]s, use [[hemocyanin]] to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. [[Insect]]s and some molluscs use a fluid called [[hemolymph]] instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed [[circulatory system]]. In most insects, this &quot;blood&quot; does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]] to suffice for supplying oxygen.

[[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrate]]s have an [[adaptive immune system]], based largely on [[white blood cell]]s. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. [[Platelet]]s are important in the [[Coagulation|clotting]] of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthropod]]s, using hemolymph, have [[hemocyte]]s as part of their [[immune system]].

Blood is circulated around the body through [[blood vessel]]s by the pumping action of the [[heart]]. In animals with [[lung]]s, [[artery|arterial]] blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and [[vein|venous]] blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of [[metabolism]] produced by [[Cell (biology)|cells]], from the tissues to the [[lung]]s to be exhaled.

Medical terms related to blood often begin with '''''hemo-''''' or '''''hemato-''''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|also spelled]] '''''haemo-''''' and '''''haemato-''''') from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{polytonic|αἷμα}} (''haima'') for &quot;blood&quot;. In terms of [[anatomy]] and [[histology]], blood is considered a specialized form of [[connective tissue]], given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of [[fibrinogen]].

[[File:Heme.svg|right|thumb|Heme]]
Blood performs many important functions within the body including:
* Supply of [[oxygen]] to tissues (bound to [[hemoglobin]], which is carried in red cells)
* Supply of nutrients such as [[glucose]], [[amino acids]], and [[fatty acids]] (dissolved in the blood or bound to [[Blood proteins|plasma proteins]] (e.g., [[blood lipid]]s))
* Removal of waste such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[urea]], and [[lactic acid]]
* Immunological functions, including circulation of [[white blood cells]], and detection of foreign material by [[antibodies]]
* [[Coagulation]], which is one part of the body's self-repair mechanism (blood clotting after an open wound in order to stop bleeding)
* Messenger functions, including the transport of [[hormones]] and the signaling of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage
* Regulation of body [[pH]]
* Regulation of core [[body temperature]]
* [[Hydraulics|Hydraulic]] functions

==Constituents of human blood==

Blood accounts for 8% of the human body weight,&lt;ref name=&quot;alberts_table&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;rid=mboc4.table.4143|title=Leukocyte functions and percentage breakdown|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=NCBI Bookshelf|year=2005|author=Alberts, Bruce|work=Molecular Biology of the Cell}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average density of approximately 1060&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, very close to pure water's density of 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/MichaelShmukler.shtml | title = Density of Blood | accessdate = 2006-10-04 | year = 2004 | work=The Physics Factbook|last=Shmukler|first=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average adult has a [[blood volume]] of roughly 5 [[liter]]s (1.3 gal), composed of plasma and several kinds of cells (occasionally called ''corpuscles''); these formed elements of the blood are erythrocytes ([[red blood cell]]s, RBCs), leukocytes ([[white blood cell]]s), and thrombocytes ([[platelet]]s). By volume, the red blood cells constitute about 45% of whole blood, the plasma about 54.3%, and white cells about 0.7%.

Whole blood (plasma and cells) exhibits [[non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian]], [[Blood viscosity|viscoelastic]] fluid dynamics; its flow properties are adapted to flow effectively through tiny capillary blood vessels with less resistance than plasma by itself. In addition, if all human hemoglobin were free in the plasma rather than being contained in RBCs, the circulatory fluid would be too viscous for the cardiovascular system to function effectively.

===Cells===
{{See|Complete blood count}}
One microliter of blood contains:
*'''4.7 to 6.1 million (male), 4.2 to 5.4 million (female) [[erythrocyte]]s:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most mammals&lt;!-- the exception is camels --&gt;, mature red blood cells lack a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[organelle]]s. They contain the blood's [[hemoglobin]] and distribute oxygen. The red blood cells (together with [[endothelial]] vessel cells and other cells) are also marked by [[glycoprotein]]s that define the different [[Human blood group systems|blood types]]. The proportion of blood occupied by red blood cells is referred to as the [[hematocrit]], and is normally about 45%. The combined surface area of all red blood cells of the human body would be roughly 2,000 times as great as the body's exterior surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert B. Tallitsch; Martini, Frederic; Timmons, Michael J. |title=Human anatomy |publisher=Pearson/Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |year=2006 |page=529 |isbn=0-8053-7211-3 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They change [[fibrinogen]] into [[fibrin]]. This fibrin creates a mesh onto which red blood cells collect and clot, which then stops more blood from leaving the body and also helps to prevent bacteria from entering the body.

===Plasma===
About 55% of whole blood is [[blood plasma]], a fluid that is the blood's liquid medium, which by itself is straw-yellow in color. The blood plasma volume totals of 2.7–3.0 liters (2.8–3.2 quarts) in an average human. It is essentially an [[water|aqueous]] solution containing 92% water, 8% blood plasma [[protein]]s, and trace amounts of other materials. Plasma circulates dissolved nutrients, such as [[glucose]], [[amino acids]], and [[fatty acids]] (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins), and removes waste products, such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[urea]], and [[lactic acid]].

Other important [[List of human blood components|components]] include:
* [[Serum albumin]]
* Blood-clotting factors (to facilitate [[coagulation]])
* [[Immunoglobulins]] (antibodies)
* [[lipoprotein]] particles
* Various other [[protein]]s
* Various [[electrolyte]]s (mainly [[sodium]] and [[chloride]])

The term '''serum''' refers to plasma from which the clotting proteins have been removed. Most of the proteins remaining are albumin and [[antibody|immunoglobulins]].

===Narrow range of pH values===
{{see also|Acid-base homeostasis}}

Blood [[pH]] is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly alkaline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waugh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waugh|first1=Anne|last2=Grant|first2=Allison|title=Anatomy ans Physiology in Health and Illness|publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier|year=2007|edition=Tenth |pages=22|chapter=2|isbn=978 0 443 10102 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{MerckManual|12|157|a||Acid-Base Regulation and Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood that has a pH below 7.35 is too [[acidic]], whereas blood pH above 7.45 is too [[alkaline]]. Blood pH, [[partial pressure]] of oxygen (pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[Bicarbonate|HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;]] are carefully regulated by a number of [[homeostasis|homeostatic mechanisms]], which exert their influence principally through the [[respiratory system]] and the [[urinary system]] in order to control the [[Acid-base homeostasis|acid-base balance]] and respiration. An [[arterial blood gas]] will measure these. Plasma also circulates [[hormone]]s transmitting their messages to various tissues. The list of normal [[Reference ranges for blood tests|reference ranges]] for various blood electrolytes is extensive.

Bones are especially     affected by blood pH as they tend to be used as a mineral source for pH buffering. Consuming a high ratio of animal protein to vegetable protein is implicated in bone loss in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sellmeyer DE, Stone KL, Sebastian A, Cummings SR |title=A high ratio of dietary animal to vegetable protein increases the rate of bone loss and the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women. Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=118–22 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11124760 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/73/1/118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood in non-human vertebrates===
Human blood is typical of that of mammals, although the precise details concerning cell numbers, size, [[protein structure]], and so on, vary somewhat between species. In non-mammalian vertebrates, however, there are some key differences:&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 404–406|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Red blood cells of non-mammalian vertebrates are flattened and ovoid in form, and retain their cell nuclei
* There is considerable variation in the types and proportions of white blood cells; for example, acidophils are generally more common than in humans
* Platelets are unique to mammals; in other vertebrates, small, nucleated, spindle cells are responsible for blood clotting instead

==Physiology==
===Cardiovascular system===
[[File:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg|thumb|The circulation of blood through the human heart]]

{{main|Circulatory system}}
Blood is circulated around the body through [[blood vessel]]s by the pumping action of the [[heart]]. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong [[left ventricle]] of the heart through [[artery|arteries]] to peripheral [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and returns to the right [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]] of the heart through [[vein]]s. It then enters the right [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and is pumped through the [[pulmonary artery]] to the [[lung]]s and returns to the left atrium through the [[pulmonary vein]]s. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and [[venous blood]] carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of [[metabolism]] by [[Cell (biology)|cells]], to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.

Additional return flow may be generated by the movement of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the [[right atrium]].

The blood circulation was famously described by [[William Harvey]] in 1628.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = [[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus]] |url = http://www.rarebookroom.org/Control/hvyexc/index.html |first = William|last = Harvey|authorlink = William Harvey|language = Latin |year = 1628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production and degradation of blood cells===
In vertebrates, the various cells of blood are made in the [[bone marrow]] in a process called [[hematopoiesis]], which includes [[erythropoiesis]], the production of red blood cells; and myelopoiesis, the production of white blood cells and platelets. During childhood, almost every human bone produces red blood cells; as adults, red blood cell production is limited to the larger bones: the bodies of the vertebrae, the breastbone (sternum), the ribcage, the pelvic bones, and the bones of the upper arms and legs. In addition, during childhood, the [[thymus]] gland, found in the [[mediastinum]], is an important source of [[lymphocytes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, Peter W.; Gray, Henry David |title=Gray's anatomy |publisher=C. Livingstone |location=New York |year=1989 |isbn=0-443-02588-6 |edition=37th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The proteinaceous component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced predominantly by the [[liver]], while hormones are produced by the [[endocrine gland]]s and the watery fraction is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] and maintained by the [[kidney]].

Healthy [[erythrocytes]] have a plasma life of about 120 days before they are degraded by the [[spleen]], and the [[Kupffer cell]]s in the liver. The liver also clears some proteins, lipids, and [[amino acid]]s. The kidney actively secretes waste products into the [[urine]].

===Oxygen transport===
[[File:Oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve.png|thumb|Basic hemoglobin saturation curve. It is moved to the right in higher acidity (more dissolved carbon dioxide) and to the left in lower acidity (less dissolved carbon dioxide)]]
About 98.5% of the [[oxygen]] in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at sea-level pressure is chemically combined with the Hgb. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to Hgb. The [[hemoglobin]] molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in [[mammals]] and many other species (for exceptions, see below). Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity of between 1.36 and 1.37 ml O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per gram Hemoglobin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dominguez de Villota ED, Ruiz Carmona MT, Rubio JJ, de Andrés S |title=Equality of the in vivo and in vitro oxygen-binding capacity of haemoglobin in patients with severe respiratory disease |journal=Br J Anaesth |volume=53 |issue=12 |pages=1325–8 |year=1981 |month=December |pmid=7317251 |doi= 10.1093/bja/53.12.1325|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which increases the total [[blood oxygen capacity]] seventyfold,&lt;ref name=brsphys&gt;{{cite book |author=Costanzo, Linda S. |title=Physiology |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7311-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to if oxygen solely was carried by its solubility of 0.03 mL O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per liter blood per mmHg [[partial pressure]] of oxygen (approximately 100 mmHg in arteries).&lt;ref name=brsphys/&gt;

With the exception of [[Pulmonary artery|pulmonary]] and [[Umbilical artery|umbilical arteries]] and their corresponding veins, [[artery|arteries]] carry oxygenated blood away from the [[heart]] and deliver it to the body via [[arteriole]]s and [[capillary|capillaries]], where the oxygen is consumed; afterwards, [[venule]]s, and [[vein]]s carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.

Under normal conditions in adult humans at rest; hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98–99% saturated with oxygen, achieving an ''oxygen delivery'' of between 950 - 1150 mL/min&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;[http://www.edwards.com/SiteCollectionImages/edwards/products/presep/ar04313hemodynpocketcard.pdf Edwards Lifesciences LLC &gt; Normal Hemodynamic Parameters – Adult] 2009&lt;/ref&gt; to the body. In a healthy adult at rest, ''oxygen consumption'' is approximately 200 - 250 mL/min,&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; and ''deoxygenated'' blood returning to the lungs is still approximately 75%&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.hia.no/~stephens/ventphys.htm Ventilation and Endurance Performance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.msn.com/TransplantSupportLungHeartLungHeart/oxygen2.msnw Transplant Support- Lung, Heart/Lung, Heart] MSN groups&lt;/ref&gt; (70 to 78%)&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; saturated. Increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mortensen SP, Dawson EA, Yoshiga CC, ''et al.'' |title=Limitations to systemic and locomotor limb muscle oxygen delivery and uptake during maximal exercise in humans |journal=J. Physiol. (Lond.) |volume=566 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=273–85 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15860533 |pmc=1464731 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2005.086025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia. Sustained hypoxia (oxygenation of less than 90%), is dangerous to health, and severe hypoxia (saturations of less than 30%) may be rapidly fatal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manbit.com/PAC/chapters/P30.cfm The 'St George' Guide To Pulmonary Artery Catheterisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[fetus]], receiving oxygen via the [[placenta]], is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found in an adult's lungs), and, so, fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen ([[Fetal hemoglobin|hemoglobin F]]) in order to function under these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/Bio50/LecNotes/lecnot20.html Oxygen Carriage in Blood - High Altitude]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon dioxide transport===
When blood flows through capillaries, carbon dioxide diffuses from the tissues into the blood. Some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood. A part of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with hemoglobin and other proteins to form [[carbamino]] compounds. The remaining carbon dioxide is converted to [[bicarbonate]] and [[hydrogen ion]]s through the action of RBC [[carbonic anhydrase]]. Most carbon dioxide is transported through the blood in the form of bicarbonate ions.

[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the main [[cellular waste product]] is carried in blood mainly dissolved in [[Blood plasma|plasma]], in equilibrium with [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). 86–90% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the body is converted into [[carbonic acid]], which can quickly turn into bicarbonate, the chemical equilibrium being important in the pH [[Buffering agent|buffering]] of plasma.&lt;ref name=&quot;veq&quot;&gt;[http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/medph/intro.html Biology.arizona.edu]. October 2006. ''Clinical correlates of pH levels: bicarbonate as a buffer.''&lt;/ref&gt; Blood [[pH]] is kept in a narrow range (pH between 7.35 and 7.45).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Transport of hydrogen ions===
Some oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin.

===Lymphatic system===
{{main|Lymphatic system}}
In mammals, blood is in equilibrium with [[lymph]], which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by capillary ultrafiltration. Lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the [[thoracic duct]], which drains into the left [[subclavian vein]] where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation.

===Thermoregulation===
Blood circulation transports [[heat]] throughout the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of [[thermoregulation]]. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g., during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss. In contrast, when the external temperature is low, blood flow to the extremities and surface of the skin is reduced and to prevent heat loss and is circulated to the important organs of the body, preferentially.

===Hydraulic functions===
The restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement, resulting in an [[erection]] of that tissue; examples are the [[erectile tissue]] in the [[penis]] and [[clitoris]].

Another example of a hydraulic function is the [[jumping spider]], in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump, without the need for bulky muscular legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-559817/spider
|encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Britannica online|title = Spiders: circulatory system|accessdate= 2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invertebrates===
In [[insect]]s, the blood (more properly called [[hemolymph]]) is not involved in the transport of oxygen. (Openings called [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]]e allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues). Insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system.

Other invertebrates use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature. [[Hemocyanin]] ([[blue]]) contains [[copper]] and is found in [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusk]]s. It is  thought that [[tunicate]]s (sea squirts) might use [[vanabins]] ([[protein]]s containing [[vanadium]]) for [[respiratory pigment]] (bright-green, blue, or orange).

In many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood; in vertebrates they are contained in specialized [[red blood cell]]s, allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing [[viscosity]] or damaging blood filtering organs like the [[kidneys]].

[[Giant tube worms]] have unusual hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments. These hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals.

==Color==
===Hemoglobin===
[[File:Bleeding finger.jpg|thumb|Capillary blood from a bleeding finger]]
[[File:Bloodbags.jpg|thumb|Venous blood collected during blood donation]]
Hemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood in vertebrates. Each molecule has four heme groups, and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact color. In [[vertebrate]]s and other hemoglobin-using creatures, arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red, as oxygen imparts a strong red color to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during [[blood donation]] and when venous blood samples are taken. Blood in [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] is bright red, because [[carbon monoxide]] causes the formation of [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. In [[cyanide]] poisoning, the body cannot utilize oxygen, so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. While hemoglobin-containing blood is never blue, there are several conditions and diseases wherein the color of the heme groups make the skin appear blue. If the heme is oxidized, [[methaemoglobin]], which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the rare condition [[sulfhemoglobinemia]], arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark red with a bluish hue ([[cyanosis]]).

Veins in the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons only weakly dependent on the color of the blood. Light scattering in the skin, and the visual processing of color play roles as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Hemocyanin===
The blood of most [[mollusks]] – including [[cephalopods]] and [[gastropods]] – as well as some [[arthropods]], such as [[horseshoe crab]]s, is blue, as it contains the copper-containing protein hemocyanin at concentrations of about 50&amp;nbsp;grams per liter.&lt;ref name = &quot;AHC 2004 p276-7&quot;/&gt; Hemocyanin is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it turns dark blue when exposed to the oxygen in the air, as seen when they bleed.&lt;ref name = &quot;AHC 2004 p276-7&quot;/&gt; This is due to change in color of [[hemocyanin]] when it is oxidized.&lt;ref name = &quot;AHC 2004 p276-7&quot;/&gt; Hemocyanin carries oxygen in [[extracellular fluid]], which is in contrast to the intracellular oxygen transport in mammals by hemoglobin in RBCs.&lt;ref name = &quot;AHC 2004 p276-7&quot;/&gt;

===Hemovanabin===
The blood of some species of [[Ascidiacea|ascidians]] and [[tunicate]]s, also known as sea squirts and sea cucumbers, contains proteins called [[Vanabins]]. These proteins are based on [[vanadium]], and give the creatures a concentration of vanadium in their bodies 100 times higher than the surrounding sea water. It is not clear whether these vanabins actually carry oxygen. When exposed to  oxygen, however, vanabins turn a mustard yellow.

==Pathology==
===General medical disorders===
* Disorders of volume
** [[Injury]] can cause blood loss through [[bleeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/blood/blood.html|title = Blood - The Human heart|publisher = The Franklin Institute|accessdate = 19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A healthy adult can lose almost 20% of blood volume (1 L) before the first symptom, restlessness, begins, and 40% of volume (2 L) before [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] sets in. [[Thrombocyte]]s are important for blood [[coagulation]] and the formation of blood clots, which can stop bleeding. Trauma to the internal organs or bones can cause [[internal bleeding]], which can sometimes be severe.
** [[Dehydration]] can reduce the blood volume by reducing the water content of the blood. This would rarely result in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] (apart from the very severe cases) but may result in [[orthostatic hypotension]] and [[fainting]].
* Disorders of circulation
** Shock is the ineffective [[perfusion]] of tissues, and can be caused by a variety of conditions including blood loss, [[infection]], poor [[cardiac output]].
** [[Atherosclerosis]] reduces the flow of blood through arteries, because atheroma lines arteries and narrows them. Atheroma tends to increase with age, and its progression can be compounded by many causes including smoking, [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], excess circulating lipids ([[hyperlipidemia]]), and [[diabetes mellitus]].
** Coagulation can form a [[thrombosis]], which can obstruct vessels.
** Problems with blood composition, the pumping action of the heart, or narrowing of blood vessels can have many consequences including hypoxia (lack of oxygen) of the tissues supplied. The term ''ischemia'' refers to tissue that is inadequately perfused with blood, and ''infarction'' refers to tissue death ([[necrosis]]), which can occur when the blood supply has been blocked (or is very inadequate).

===Hematological disorders===
{{see also|Hematology}}

* Anemia
** Insufficient red cell mass ([[anemia]]) can be the result of bleeding, blood disorders like [[thalassemia]], or [[Illnesses related to poor nutrition|nutritional deficiencies]]; and may require [[blood transfusion]]. Several countries have [[blood bank]]s to fill the demand for transfusable blood. A person receiving a blood transfusion must have a [[blood type]] compatible with that of the donor.
** [[Sickle-cell anemia]]

* Disorders of cell proliferation
** [[Leukemia]] is a group of [[cancer (medicine)|cancers]] of the blood-forming tissues.
** Non-cancerous overproduction of red cells ([[polycythemia vera]]) or platelets ([[essential thrombocytosis]]) may be [[Premalignant condition|premalignant]].
** [[Myelodysplastic syndrome]]s involve ineffective production of one or more cell lines.

* Disorders of coagulation
** [[Hemophilia]] is a [[Genetic disorder|genetic illness]] that causes dysfunction in one of the blood's [[coagulation|clotting mechanisms]]. This can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening, but more commonly results in [[hemarthrosis]], or bleeding into joint spaces, which can be crippling.
** Ineffective or insufficient platelets can also result in [[coagulopathy]] (bleeding disorders).
** Hypercoagulable state ([[thrombophilia]]) results from defects in regulation of platelet or clotting factor function, and can cause thrombosis.

* Infectious disorders of blood
** Blood is an important vector of infection. [[HIV]], the [[virus]] that causes [[AIDS]], is transmitted through contact with blood, semen or other body secretions of an infected person. [[Hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]] are transmitted primarily through blood contact. Owing to [[blood-borne infection]]s, bloodstained objects are treated as a [[Biological hazard|biohazard]].
** Bacterial infection of the blood is [[bacteremia]] or [[sepsis]]. Viral Infection is viremia. [[Malaria]] and [[trypanosomiasis]] are blood-borne parasitic infections.

===Carbon monoxide poisoning===
{{main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}
Substances other than oxygen can bind to hemoglobin; in some cases this can cause irreversible damage to the body. [[Carbon monoxide]], for example, is extremely dangerous when carried to the blood via the lungs by inhalation, because carbon monoxide irreversibly binds to hemoglobin to form [[carboxyhemoglobin]], so that less hemoglobin is free to bind oxygen, and fewer oxygen molecules can be transported throughout the blood. This can cause suffocation insidiously. A fire burning in an enclosed room with poor ventilation presents a very dangerous hazard, since it can create a build-up of carbon monoxide in the air. Some carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin when smoking [[tobacco]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Medical treatments==
===Blood products===
{{see|Blood transfusion}}
Blood for transfusion is obtained from human donors by [[blood donation]] and stored in a [[blood bank]]. There are many different [[blood type]]s in humans, the [[ABO blood group system]], and the [[Rhesus blood group system]] being the most important. Transfusion of blood of an incompatible blood group may cause severe, often fatal, complications, so [[crossmatching]] is done to ensure that a compatible blood product is transfused.

Other blood products administered [[intravenous]]ly are platelets, blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, and specific coagulation factor concentrates.

===Intravenous administration===
Many forms of medication (from [[antibiotic]]s to [[chemotherapy]]) are administered intravenously, as they are not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract.

After severe acute blood loss, liquid preparations, generically known as plasma expanders, can be given intravenously, either solutions of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; etc.) at physiological concentrations, or colloidal solutions, such as dextrans, [[human serum albumin]], or fresh frozen plasma. In these emergency situations, a plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.

===Bloodletting===
{{main|bloodletting}}
In modern [[evidence-based medicine]], bloodletting is used in management of a few rare diseases, including [[hemochromatosis]] and [[polycythemia]]. However, [[bloodletting]] and [[leeching]] were common unvalidated interventions used until the 19th century, as many diseases were incorrectly thought to be due to an excess of blood, according to [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] medicine.

==History==
According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the word &quot;blood&quot; originated before the 12th century. The word is derived from Middle English, which is derived from the Old English word ''blôd'', which is akin to the Old High German word ''bluot'', meaning blood. The modern German word is ''(das) Blut.''

===Classical Greek medicine===
In classical Greek medicine, blood was associated with air, with Springtime, and with a merry and gluttonous (''sanguine'') personality. It was also believed to be produced exclusively by the [[liver]].

===Hippocratic medicine===
In [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] medicine, blood was considered to be one of the [[four humors]], the others being [[phlegm]], [[yellow bile]], and [[black bile]].

==Cultural and religious beliefs==
Due to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships through birth/parentage; to be &quot;related by blood&quot; is to be related by ancestry or descendance, rather than marriage. This bears closely to [[bloodline]]s, and sayings such as &quot;[[blood is thicker than water]]&quot; and &quot;[[bad blood]]&quot;, as well as &quot;[[Blood brother]]&quot;. Blood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions because [[Leviticus]] 17:11 says &quot;the life of a creature is in the blood.&quot; This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off.

Mythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the life-giving nature of blood, seen in such events as [[childbirth]], as contrasted with the blood of injury or death.

===Indigenous Australians===
In many [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian Aboriginal peoples']] traditions, [[ochre]] (particularly red) and blood, both high in [[iron]] content and considered [[Maban]], are applied to the bodies of dancers for ritual. As Lawlor states:&lt;blockquote&gt;
In many Aboriginal rituals and ceremonies, red ochre is rubbed all over the naked bodies of the dancers. In secret, sacred male ceremonies, blood extracted from the veins of the participant's arms is exchanged and rubbed on their bodies. Red ochre is used in similar ways in less-secret ceremonies. Blood is also used to fasten the feathers of birds onto people's bodies. Bird feathers contain a protein that is highly magnetically sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lawlor, Robert |title=Voices of the first day: awakening in the Aboriginal dreamtime |publisher=Inner Traditions International |location=Rochester, Vt |year=1991 |pages=102–3 |isbn=0-89281-355-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Lawlor comments that blood employed in this fashion is held by these peoples to attune the dancers to the invisible energetic realm of the Dreamtime. Lawlor then connects these invisible energetic realms and [[magnetic fields]], because iron is [[magnetism|magnetic]].

===European paganism===
Among the [[Germanic tribe]]s (such as the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and the [[Norsemen]]), blood was used during their sacrifices; the ''[[Blót]]s''. The blood was considered to have the power of its originator, and, after the butchering, the blood was sprinkled on the walls, on the statues of the gods, and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling blood was called ''blóedsian'' in [[Old English language|Old English]], and the terminology was borrowed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] becoming ''to bless'' and ''blessing''. The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] word for blood, ''ishar'' was a cognate to words for &quot;oath&quot; and &quot;bond&quot;, see [[Ishara]].
The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] believed that the blood of the gods, ''[[ichor]]'', was a substance that was poisonous to mortals.

As a relic of Germanic Law the [[cruentation]], an ordeal where the corpse of the victim was supposed to start bleeding in the presence of the murderer was used until the early 17th. century.

===Judaism===
In [[Judaism]], blood cannot be consumed even in the smallest quantity ([[Leviticus]] 3:17 and elsewhere); this is reflected in Jewish [[diet (nutrition)|dietary]] laws ([[Kashrut]]). Blood is purged from [[meat]] by [[salting (food)|salting]] and soaking in water.

Another ritual involving blood involves the covering of the blood of [[fowl]] and [[game]] after slaughtering ([[Leviticus]] 17:13); the reason given by the [[Torah]] is: &quot;Because the life of the animal is [in] its blood&quot; (ibid 17:14).

Also if a person of the orthodox Jewish faith suffers a violent death, religious laws order the collection of their blood for burial with them.

===Christianity===
{{main|Eucharist}}

Some Christian churches, including [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] teach that, when consecrated, the Eucharistic wine [[transubstantiation|actually becomes]] the blood of [[Jesus]] for worshippers to drink. Thus in the consecrated wine, Jesus becomes spiritually and physically present. This teaching is rooted in [[the Last Supper]], as written in the four gospels of the [[Bible]], in which Jesus stated to his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]] that the bread that they ate was his body, and the wine was his blood. ''&quot;This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.&quot; ({{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke |chapter=22|verse=20}})''.

Various forms of Protestantism, especially those of a [[Wesley]]an or [[Presbyterian]] lineage, teach that the wine is no more than a symbol of the blood of Christ, who is spiritually but not physically present. [[Lutheran]] theology teaches that the body and blood is [[consubstantiation|present together &quot;in, with, and under&quot;]] the bread and wine of the Eucharistic feast.

Christ's blood is also seen as the means for [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sins for Christians.

At the [[Council of Jerusalem]], the [[apostles]] prohibited Christians from consuming blood (except Jesus's), probably because this was a command given to [[Noah]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:4, see [[Noahide Law]]). This command continued to be observed by the [[Eastern Orthodox]].

===Islam===
Consumption of food containing blood is forbidden by [[Islamic dietary laws]]. This is derived from the statement in the [[Qur'an]], sura [[Al-Ma'ida]] (5:3): &quot;Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah.&quot;

Blood is considered as unclean and in Islam cleanliness is part of the faith, hence there are specific methods to obtain physical and ritual status of cleanliness once bleeding has occurred. Specific rules and prohibitions apply to [[menstruation]], postnatal bleeding and irregular vaginal bleeding.

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
{{main|Jehovah's Witnesses and blood}}

Based on their interpretation of scriptures such as Acts 15:28, 29 (&quot;Keep abstaining...from blood.&quot;), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] neither consume blood nor accept transfusions of whole blood or its major components: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (thrombocytes), and plasma. Members may personally decide whether they will accept medical procedures that involve their own blood or substances that are further fractionated from the four major components.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 15 June 2004, page 22, &quot;Be Guided by the Living God&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese and Japanese culture===
In Chinese popular culture, it is often said that if a man's nose produces a small flow of blood, he is experiencing sexual desire. This often appears in [[China|Chinese-language]] and [[Hong Kong]] [[film]]s as well as in [[Japan]]ese culture parodied in [[anime]] and [[manga]]. Characters, mostly males, will often be shown with a [[epistaxis|nosebleed]] if they have just seen someone [[nude]] or in little clothing, or if they have had an erotic thought or fantasy; this is based on the idea that a male's blood pressure will spike dramatically when aroused.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Anime #40 aka ''Law of Nasal Sanguination'' at [http://www.abcb.com/laws/index.htm ABCB.com], The Anime Cafe.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood libel===
{{main|Blood libel}}
Various religious and other groups have been falsely accused of using human blood in rituals; such accusations are known as [[blood libel]]. The most common form of this is [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although there is no ritual involving human blood in Jewish law or custom, fabrications of this nature (often involving the murder of children) were widely used during [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] to justify [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] persecution.

===Vampire legends===
{{main|Vampire}}
[[Vampire]]s are mythical creatures that drink blood directly for sustenance, usually with a preference for human blood. Cultures all over the world have myths of this kind; for example the '[[Nosferatu]]' legend, a human who achieves damnation and immortality by drinking the blood of others, originates from Eastern European folklore. [[Ticks]], [[leeches]], female [[mosquito]]es, [[vampire bat]]s, and an assortment of other natural creatures do consume the blood of other animals, but only bats are associated with vampires. This has no relation to vampire bats, which are [[new world]] creatures discovered well after the origins of the European myths.

==Applications==
===In the applied sciences===
[[Blood residue]] can help [[forensic]] investigators identify weapons, reconstruct a criminal action, and link suspects to the crime. Through [[bloodstain pattern analysis]], forensic information can also be gained from the spatial distribution of bloodstains.

Blood residue analysis is also a technique used in [[archeology]].

===In art===
Blood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artscad.com/A.nsf/Opra/SRVV-6MDNX5 &quot;Nostalgia&quot;] Artwork in blood&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the performances of [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionist]] [[Hermann Nitsch]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]], [[Ron Athey]], [[Yang Zhichao]], and [[Kira O' Reilly]], along with the photography of [[Andres Serrano]], have incorporated blood as a prominent visual element. [[Marc Quinn]] has made sculptures using frozen blood, including a cast of his own head made using his own blood.

===In genealogy &amp; family history===
The term, ''blood'', is used in [[Genealogy|genealogical circles]] to refer to one's [[Ancestor|ancestry]], [[Human evolution|origins]], and [[Ethnic group|ethnic background]], as in the word, ''[[Heredity|bloodline]]''. Other terms where blood is used in a family history sense are ''[[Nobility#.22Blue.22_blood|blue-blood]]'', ''[[Royal descent|royal blood]]'', ''[[mixed-blood]]'' and ''[[Kinship terminology|blood relative]]''.

Born in [[Poland]], he moved to France with his family when he was a child. Mandelbrot spent much of his life living and working in the [[United States]], acquiring [[multiple citizenship|dual]] [[French nationality law|French]] and [[United_States_nationality_law#Dual_citizenship|American]] citizenship.

Mandelbrot worked on a wide range of mathematical problems, including [[mathematical physics]] and [[quantitative finance]], but is best known as the father of [[fractal|fractal geometry]]. He coined the term [[fractal]] and described the [[Mandelbrot set]]. Mandelbrot extensively popularized his work, writing books and giving lectures aimed at the general public.

Mandelbrot spent most of his career at [[International Business Machines|IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]], and was appointed as an [[IBM Fellow]]. He later became a [[Sterling Professor]] of Mathematical Sciences at [[Yale University]]. Mandelbrot also held positions at the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], [[Université Lille Nord de France]], [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]].

==Early years==
Mandelbrot was born in [[Warsaw]] into a [[Lithuanian Jews|Jewish]] family from [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wos1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/9596|title=Web of Stories • Benoît Mandelbrot • Family background and early education|last=Mandelbrot|first=Benoît|coauthors=Bernard Sapoval, Daniel Zajdenweber|date=May 1998|publisher=[[Web of Stories]]|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot was born into a family with a strong academic tradition - his mother was a [[physician]] and he was introduced to [[mathematics]] by two of his uncles, one of whom, [[Szolem Mandelbrojt]], was a mathematician who resided in [[Paris]]. However, his father made his living trading clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolf&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|last=Mandelbrot|first=Benoît|contribution=A maverick's apprenticeship|title=The Wolf Prizes for Physics|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2002|url=http://www.math.yale.edu/mandelbrot/web_pdfs/mavericksApprenticeship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the threat posed by [[Nazi Germany]], the family fled from Poland to [[France]] in 1936 when he was 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11560101|title=BBC News - 'Fractal' mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot dies aged 85|date=17 October 2010|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot attended the Lycée Rolin in Paris until the start of [[World War II]], when his family moved to [[Tulle]], France. He was helped by [[Rabbi]] [[David Feuerwerker]], the Rabbi of [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]], to continue his studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway P. Divine proportion: Phi in art, nature and science.  Psychology Press, 2005  ISBN 0415344956&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 he returned to Paris. He studied at the [[Lycée du Parc]] in [[Lyon]] and in 1945 - 47 attended the [[École Polytechnique]], where he studied under [[Gaston Julia]] and [[Paul Pierre Lévy|Paul Lévy]]. From 1947 to 1949 he studied at [[California Institute of Technology]], where he earned a master's degree in [[aeronautics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/oct/17/benoit-mandelbrot-obituary|title=Benoît Mandelbrot obituary|last=Lesmoir-Gordon|first=Nigel|date=17 October 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to France, he obtained his [[Ph.D. degree]] in Mathematical Sciences at the [[University of Paris]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolf&quot;/&gt;

From 1949 to 1958 Mandelbrot was a staff member at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]]. During this time he spent a year at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he was sponsored by [[John von Neumann]]. In 1955 he married Aliette Kagan and moved to [[Geneva, Switzerland]], and later to the [[Université Lille Nord de France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|last=Barcellos|first=Anthony|contribution=Interview Of B.

==Research career==
[[File:Benoit Mandelbrot mg 1845.jpg|thumb|right|Mandelbrot speaking in 2007]]
From 1951 onward, Mandelbrot worked on problems and published papers not only in mathematics but in applied fields such as [[information theory]], [[economics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. He became convinced that two key themes, [[fat tail]]s and [[self-similar]] structure, ran through a multitude of problems encountered in those fields.

Mandelbrot found that price changes in [[financial market]]s did not follow a [[Gaussian distribution]], but rather [[Lévy distribution|Lévy]] [[stable distributions]] having theoretically infinite [[variance]]. He found, for example, that cotton prices followed a Lévy stable distribution with parameter α equal to 1.7 rather than 2 as in a Gaussian distribution. &quot;Stable&quot; distributions have the property that the sum of many instances of a random variable follows the same distribution but with a larger [[scale parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420784.700-flight-over-wall-st.html |title='&amp;#39;New Scientist'&amp;#39;, 19 April 1997 |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=1997-04-19 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandelbrot also put his ideas to work in [[cosmology]]. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of [[Olbers' paradox]] (the &quot;dark night sky&quot; riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a sufficient, but not necessary, resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the [[star]]s in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like [[Cantor dust]]), it would not be necessary to rely on the [[Big Bang]] theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.&lt;ref&gt;''Galaxy Map Hints at Fractal Universe'', by Amanda Gefter; New Scientist; June 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term ''[[fractal]]'' to describe these structures, and published his ideas in ''Les objets fractals, forme, hasard et dimension'' (1975; an English translation ''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension'' was published in 1977).&lt;ref&gt;''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension'', by Benoît Mandelbrot; W H Freeman and Co, 1977; ISBN 0716704730&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot developed here ideas from the article ''Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique''&lt;ref&gt;Jaromír Korčák (1938): Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique. Prague, Comité d’organisation, Bull. de l'Institute Int'l de Statistique, vol. 3, pp. 295–299.&lt;/ref&gt; (1938; an English translation ''Two Basic Types of Statistical Distribution'') of Czech [[geographer]], [[demographer]] and [[statistician]] [[Jaromír Korčák]].

[[Image:Mandelbrot Set - Periodicites.png|thumb|left|The [[Mandelbrot set]] and periodicities of orbits.]]

While on secondment as Visiting Professor at [[Harvard University]] in 1979, Mandelbrot began to study fractals called [[Julia set]]s that were invariant under certain transformations of the [[complex plane]]. Building on previous work by [[Gaston Julia]] and [[Pierre Fatou]], Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets of the formula ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − μ. While investigating how the topology of these Julia sets depended on the complex parameter μ he studied the [[Mandelbrot set]] fractal that is now named after him. (Note that the Mandelbrot set is now usually defined in terms of the formula ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c'', so Mandelbrot's early plots in terms of the earlier parameter μ are left–right mirror images of more recent plots in terms of the parameter ''c''.) {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xJ4qiEBNP4gC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature''], by Benoît Mandelbrot; W H Freeman &amp; Co, 1982; ISBN 0716711869&lt;/ref&gt; This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as &quot;[[Artifact (observational)|program artifact]]s&quot;.

[[File:Mandelbrot p1130876.jpg|thumb|right|Mandelbrot speaking about the [[Mandelbrot set]], during his acceptance speech for the [[Légion d'honneur]] in 2006]]

Mandelbrot left [[IBM]] in 1987, after 35 years and 12 days, when IBM decided to end pure research in his division.&lt;ref name=&quot;wos44&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/10483|title=Web of Stories • Benoît Mandelbrot • IBM: background and policies|last=Mandelbrot|first=Benoît|coauthors=Bernard Sapoval, Daniel Zajdenweber|date=May 1998|publisher=[[Web of Stories]]|accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Department of Mathematics at [[Yale University|Yale]], and obtained his first [[tenure]]d post in 1999, at the age of 75.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenner&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/10/benoit-mandelbrot-the-maverick-1924-2010/64684/|title=Benoît Mandelbrot the Maverick, 1924-2010|last=Tenner|first=Edward|date=16 October 2010|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences. His awards include the [[Wolf Prize]] for Physics in 1993, the [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] Prize of the [[European Geophysical Society]] in 2000, the [[Japan Prize]] in 2003, and the Einstein Lectureship of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 2006.

The small asteroid [[27500 Mandelbrot]] was named in his honor. In November 1990, he was made a Knight in the French [[Legion of Honour]]. In December 2005, Mandelbrot was appointed to the position of Battelle Fellow at the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnl.gov/news/release.asp?id=141 |title=PNNL press release: Mandelbrot joins Pacific Northwest National Laboratory |publisher=Pnl.gov |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=PREX0508911D |title='&amp;#39;Légion d'honneur'&amp;#39; announcement of promotion of Mandelbrot to '&amp;#39;officier'&amp;#39; |language={{fr icon}} |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An honorary degree from [[Johns Hopkins University]] was bestowed on Mandelbrot in the May 2010 commencement exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://gazette.jhu.edu/2010/06/07/six-granted-honorary-degrees-society-of-scholars-inductees-recognized-2/ |title=Six granted honorary degrees, Society of Scholars inductees recognized |publisher=Gazette.jhu.edu |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fractals and regular roughness==

Although Mandelbrot coined the term ''[[fractal]]'', some of the mathematical objects he presented in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'' had been described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, they had been regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to non-smooth objects in the real world. He highlighted their common properties, such as [[self-similarity]] (linear, non-linear, or statistical), [[scale invariance]], and a (usually) non-integer [[Hausdorff dimension]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

He also emphasized the use of fractals as realistic and useful models of many &quot;rough&quot; phenomena in the real world. Natural fractals include the shapes of [[mountain]]s, [[coastline]]s and [[river basin]]s; the structures of plants, [[blood vessel]]s and [[lung]]s; the clustering of [[galaxy|galaxies]]; and [[Brownian motion]]. Fractals are found in human pursuits, such as [[music]], [[painting]], [[architecture]], and [[stock market]] prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional [[Euclidean geometry]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;—Mandelbrot, in his introduction to ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mandelbrot has been called a visionary&lt;ref name=&quot;RLD&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Devaney, Robert L. | title=&quot;Mandelbrot’s Vision for Mathematics&quot; in ''Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics''. Volume 72.1 | publisher=American Mathematical Society | year=2004 | url=http://www.math.yale.edu/mandelbrot/web_pdfs/jubileeletters.pdf | accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a maverick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fractals/mandelbrot.html|title=A Radical Mind|last=Jersey|first=Bill|date=April 24, 2005|work=Hunting the Hidden Dimension|publisher=NOVA/ PBS|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His informal and passionate style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition (supported by the inclusion of numerous illustrations) made ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature'' accessible to non-specialists. The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to [[chaos theory]] and other fields of science and mathematics.

When visiting the Museu de la Ciència de Barcelona in 1988, he told its director that the painting [[The Face of War]] had given him &quot;the intuition about the transcendence of the fractal geometry when making intelligible the omnipresent similitude in the forms of nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=wasenberg /&gt; He also said that, fractally, [[Antonio Gaudí|Gaudí]] was superior to [[Van der Rohe]].&lt;ref name=wasenberg&gt;{{Cite document |title= Obituarios.

'''Saint Benedict of Nursia''' ({{lang-it|San Benedetto da Norcia}}) (480–547) is a Christian saint, honored by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as the [[patron saint]] of Europe and students.

Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} to the east of [[Rome]], before moving to [[Monte Cassino]] in the mountains of [[southern Italy]]. There is no evidence that he intended to find a [[Roman Catholic religious order|religious order]]. The [[Order of St Benedict]] is of later origin and, moreover, not an &quot;order&quot; as commonly understood but merely a confederation of autonomous congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Called into existence by Pope Leo XIII's Apostolic Brief &quot;Summum semper&quot;, 12 July 1893, see [http://www.osb-international.info/index/en.html OSB-International website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict's main achievement is his &quot;Rule&quot;, containing [[precepts]] for his monks. It is heavily influenced by the writings of [[John Cassian]], and shows strong affinity with the [[Rule of the Master]]. But it also has a unique spirit of balance, moderation and reasonableness (ἐπιείκεια, ''epieikeia''), and this persuaded most religious communities founded throughout the Middle Ages to adopt it. As a result, the [[Rule of Benedict]] became one of the most influential religious rules in Western Christendom. For this reason, Benedict is often called the founder of western Christian monasticism.

==Biography==
Apart from a short poem, attributed to Mark of Monte Cassino, the only ancient account of Benedict is found in the second volume of [[Pope Gregory I]]'s four-book ''[[Dialogues]]'', thought to have been written in 593. The authenticity of this work has been hotly disputed, especially by Dr Francis Clarke in his two volume work &quot;The Pseudo-Gregorian Dialogues&quot;. Book Two consists of a prologue and thirty-eight succinct chapters.&lt;ref&gt;''Life and Miracles of St. Benedict'' (''Book II, Dialogues''), translated by Odo John Zimmerman, O.S.B. and Benedict R. Avery, O.S.B. (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1980), p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory’s account of this saint’s life is not, however, a biography in the modern sense of the word. It provides instead a spiritual portrait of the gentle, disciplined abbot. In a letter to Bishop Maximilian of Syracuse, Gregory states his intention for his ''Dialogues'', saying they are a kind of ''floretum'' (an ''anthology'', literally, ‘flowers’) of the most striking miracles of Italian holy men.&lt;ref name=&quot;fn_4&quot;&gt;See Ildephonso Schuster, ''Saint Benedict and His Times'', Gregory J. Roettger, trans. (London: B. Herder, 1951), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory did not set out to write a chronological, historically anchored story of St. Benedict, but he did base his anecdotes on direct testimony. To establish his authority, Gregory explains that his information came from what he considered the best sources: a handful of Benedict’s disciples who lived with the saint and witnessed his various miracles. These followers, he says, are Constantinus, who succeeded Benedict as [[Abbot]] of [[Monte Cassino]]; Valentinianus; Simplicius; and Honoratus, who was abbot of [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]] when St Gregory wrote his ''Dialogues''.

In Gregory’s day, history was not recognized as an independent field of study; it was a branch of grammar or rhetoric, and ''historia'' (defined as ‘story’) summed up the approach of the learned when they wrote what was, at that time, considered ‘history.’&lt;ref name=&quot;fn_6&quot;&gt;See Deborah Mauskopf Deliyannis, editor, ''Historiography in the Middle Ages'' (Boston: Brill, 2003), pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory’s ''Dialogues'' Book Two, then, an authentic medieval hagiography cast as a conversation between the Pope and his deacon Peter, is designed to teach spiritual lessons.

==Early life==
Benedict was the son of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] noble of [[Nursia]], the modern Norcia, in [[Umbria]]. A tradition which [[Bede]] accepts makes him a twin with his sister [[Scholastica]]. St Gregory's narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than 19 or 20. He was old enough to be in the midst of his literary studies, to understand the real meaning and worth of the dissolute and licentious lives of his companions, and to have been deeply affected himself by the love of a woman (Ibid. II, 2). He was capable of weighing all these things in comparison with the life taught in the [[Gospels]], and chose the latter. He was at the beginning of life, and he had at his disposal the means to a career as a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] noble; clearly he was not a child. If we accept the date 480 for his birth, we may fix the date of his abandonment of his studies and leaving home at about 500 AD.

Benedict does not seem to have left Rome for the purpose of becoming a [[hermit]], but only to find some place away from the life of the great city. He took his old nurse with him as a servant and they settled down to live in [[Enfide]], near a church to [[Saint Peter|St Peter]], in some kind of association with &quot;a company of virtuous men&quot; who were in sympathy with his feelings and his views of life. Enfide, which the tradition of Subiaco identifies with the modern [[Affile]], is in the [[Monti Simbruini|Simbruini]] mountains, about forty miles from Rome and two from [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]].

[[Image:Benedetto, Mauro e Placido.jpg|thumb|200px|left|St Benedict orders [[Saint Maurus]] to the rescue of [[Saint Placidus]], by [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], 1445 A.D. .]]

A short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow, gloomy valley, penetrating the mountains and leading directly to Subiaco. Crossing the [[Aniene]] and turning to the right, the path rises along the left face off the ravine and soon reaches the site of [[Nero]]'s villa and of the huge mole which formed the lower end of the middle lake; across the valley were ruins of the [[Roman baths]], of which a few great arches and detached masses of wall still stand. Rising from the mole upon 25 low arches, the foundations of which can even yet be traced, was the bridge from the villa to the baths, under which the waters of the middle lake poured in a wide fall into the lake below. The ruins of these vast buildings and the wide sheet of falling water closed up the entrance of the valley to St Benedict as he came from Enfide; today the narrow valley lies open before us, closed only by the far-off mountains. The path continues to ascend, and the side of the ravine, on which it runs, becomes steeper, until we reach a cave above which the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly; while on the right, it strikes in a rapid descent down to where, in St Benedict's day, {{convert|500|ft|m}} below, lay the blue waters of the lake. The cave has a large triangular-shaped opening and is about ten feet deep.

On his way from Enfide, Benedict met a monk, [[Romanus of Subiaco]], whose monastery was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave. Romanus had discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to Subiaco, and had given him the monk's habit. By his advice Benedict became a hermit and for three years, unknown to men, lived in this cave above the lake.

==Later life==
St Gregory tells us little of these years. He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth (''puer''), but as a man (''vir'') of God. Romanus, he twice tells us, served the saint in every way he could. The monk apparently visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food.&lt;!-- Image with questionable fair-use claim removed: [[image:it238th.jpg|right]] --&gt;

During these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, Benedict matured both in mind and character, in knowledge of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the abbot of a monastery in the neighbourhood (identified by some with [[Vicovaro]]), the community came to him and begged him to become its abbot. Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the monastery, and knew that &quot;their manners were diverse from his and therefore that they would never agree together: yet, at length, overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent&quot; (ibid., 3). The experiment failed; the monks tried to [[poison]] him, and he returned to his cave. The legend goes that they first tried to poison his drink. He prayed a blessing over the cup and the cup shattered. Then they tried to poison him with poisoned bread. When he prayed a blessing over the bread, a [[raven]] swept in and took the loaf away. From this time his miracles seem to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his sanctity and character, came to Subiaco to be under his guidance. For them he built in the valley twelve monasteries, in each of which he placed a superior with twelve monks. In a thirteenth he lived with ''a few, such as he thought would more profit and be better instructed by his own presence'' (ibid., 3). He remained, however, the father, or abbot, of all. With the establishment of these monasteries began the schools for children; and among the first to be brought were [[Saint Maurus]] and [[Saint Placidus]].

==Veneration==
St. Benedict spent the rest of his life realizing the ideal of monasticism which he had drawn out in his [[Rule of St Benedict|rule]]. He died at [[Monte Cassino]], Italy, while standing in prayer to God. According to tradition, this occurred on March 21, 547. He was named patron protector of Europe by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=556 | title=St. Bendict of Nursia | publisher=Catholic Online | accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1980, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared him co-[[patron saint|patron]] of [[Europe]], together with [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Egregiae Virtutis&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Egregiae Virtutis | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_31121980_egregiae-virtutis_lt.html | accessdate = 2009-04-26}} [[Apostolic letter]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], 31 December 1980 {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[General Roman Calendar of 1962|pre-1970 Roman Calendar]], his feast is kept on the day of his death, 21 March. Because on that date his [[liturgy|liturgical]] [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]] would always be impeded by the observance of [[Lent]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Calendarium Romanum&quot; (Libreria Editrice Vaticana), pp. 97 and 119&lt;/ref&gt; the reform of the [[Roman Catholic calendar of saints|General Roman Calendar]] set an obligatory memorial for him on 11 July, the date on which some monasteries commemorated the translation of his relics to the [[Fleury Abbey|monastery of St. Benoit-sur-Loire]] in Northern France. His memorial on 21 March was removed from the General Roman Calendar but is retained in the [[Roman Martyrology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'' 199 (edito altera 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Orthodox Church]] commemorates St. Benedict on March 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100800 Orthodox Church in America: The Lives of the Saints, March 14th ]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Benedict is honored with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on July 11.

[[File:2002 Austria 50 Euro Christian Religious Orders front.jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|Austria 50 euro 'The Christian Religious Orders' commemorative coin]]]]

Seventy-three short chapters comprise the ''Rule''. Its wisdom is of two kinds: spiritual (how to live a Christocentric life on earth) and administrative (how to run a monastery efficiently). More than half the chapters describe how to be obedient and humble, and what to do when a member of the community is not. About one-fourth regulate the work of God (the Opus Dei). One-tenth outline how, and by whom, the monastery should be managed. And two chapters specifically describe the abbot’s pastoral duties.

==The Saint Benedict Medal==
{{Main|Saint Benedict Medal}}

This medal originally came from a cross in honor of St Benedict. On one side, the medal has an image of St Benedict, holding the Holy Rule in his left hand and a cross in his right. There is a raven on one side of him, with a cup on the other side of him. Around the medal's outer margin are the words ''&quot;Eius in obitu nostro praesentia muniamur&quot;'' (&quot;May we, at our death, be fortified by His presence&quot;). The other side of the medal has a cross with the initials '''CSSML''' on the vertical bar which signify ''&quot;Crux Sacra Sit Mihi Lux&quot;'' (&quot;May the Holy Cross be my light&quot;) and on the horizontal bar are the initials '''NDSMD''' which stand for ''&quot;Non Draco Sit Mihi Dux&quot;'' (&quot;Let not the dragon be my overlord&quot;). The initials '''CSPB''' stand for ''&quot;Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti&quot;'' (&quot;The Cross of the Holy Father Benedict&quot;) and are located on the interior angles of the cross. Either the inscription ''&quot;PAX&quot;'' (Peace) or the [[Christogram]] ''&quot;[[IHS]]&quot;'' may be found at the top of the cross in most cases. Around the medal's margin on this side are the ''[[Vade Retro Satana]]'' initials '''VRSNSMV''' which stand for ''&quot;Vade Retro Satana, Nonquam Suade Mihi Vana&quot;'' (&quot;Begone Satan, do not suggest to me thy vanities&quot;) then a space followed by the initials '''SMQLIVB''' which signify ''&quot;Sunt Mala Quae Libas, Ipse Venena Bibas&quot;'' (&quot;Evil are the things thou profferest, drink thou thy own poison&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedict pp 60&quot;&gt;&quot;The Life of St Benedict,&quot; by St. Gregory the Great, Rockford, IL: TAN Books and Publishers, pp 60&amp;ndash;62&lt;/ref&gt;

This medal was first struck in 1880 to commemorate the fourteenth centenary of St Benedict's birth and is also called the Jubilee Medal; its exact origin, however, is unknown. In 1647, during a witchcraft trial at [[Natternberg]] near [[Metten Abbey]] in [[Bavaria]], the accused women testified they had no power over Metten, which was under the protection of the cross. An investigation found a number of painted crosses on the walls of the abbey with the letters now found on St Benedict medals, but their meaning had been forgotten. A manuscript written in 1415 was eventually found that had a picture of Saint Benedict holding a scroll in one hand and a staff which ended in a cross in the other. On the scroll and staff were written the full words of the initials contained on the crosses. Medals then began to be struck in Germany, which then spread throughout Europe. This medal was first approved by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in his briefs of December 23, 1741, and March 12, 1742.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedict pp 60&quot;/&gt;

Saint Benedict has been also the motive of many collector's coins around the world. The [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|Austria 50 euro 'The Christian Religious Orders']], issued on March 13, 2002 is one of them.

==The influence of St. Benedict==
{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}

The early Middle Ages have been called &quot;the Benedictine centuries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Western Europe in the Middle Ages | accessdate = 2008-11-17 | url = http://www.northern.edu/marmorsa/medievallec1.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080602064810/http://www.northern.edu/marmorsa/medievallec1.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] discussed the influence St Benedict had on Western Europe. The pope said that “with his life and work St Benedict exercised a fundamental influence on the development of European civilization and culture” and helped Europe to emerge from the &quot;dark night of history&quot; that followed the fall of the [[Roman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, &quot;Saint Benedict of Norcia&quot; Homily given to a general audience at St Peter's Square on Wednesday, 9 April 2008 {{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20080409_en.html |title= ?|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, The Rule of St. Benedict is the most common and influential Rule used by monasteries and monks, more than 1400 years after its writing.

The leaders of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, when choosing a single figure from each century of Christian History, chose Benedict of Nursia as the most important figure of the 6th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05E3DF1239EF3ABC4D52DFB1668389639EDE |title=? |author= |date= July 15, 1922|work= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumplanet.com/tour.php/nyc/sjd/106 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of St Benedict produced &quot;a true spiritual ferment&quot; in Europe, and over the coming decades his followers spread across the continent to establish a new cultural unity based on Christian faith.

In 1964, [[Pope Paul VI]] named St Benedict as [[patron saint]] of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=57724 |title=Catholic World News: St. Benedict and the key to European unity |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2010}} &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Caesar's Civil War}}

The '''Battle of Pharsalus''' was a decisive battle of [[Caesar's civil war|Caesar's Civil War]]. On 9 August 48 BC at [[Pharsalus]] in central Greece, [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] and his allies formed up opposite the army of the [[Roman Republic|republic]] under the command of [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (&quot;Pompey the Great&quot;). Pompey had the backing of a majority of [[Roman Senate|senators]], of whom many were [[optimate]]s, and his army significantly outnumbered the veteran Caesarian legions.

==Prelude==
Pompey and much of the [[Roman Senate]] fled Italy in 49 BC to prepare an army. Caesar, lacking a fleet, solidified his control over the western Mediterranean – Spain specifically – before assembling ships to follow Pompey.
Pompey had appointed [[Bibulus]] to look after his fleet – ordering him to destroy any of Caesar's ships that he came across. However, before this plan could be implemented, Bibulus died of fever. This allowed Julius Caesar to land his troops at Pharsalus.
Caesar thereafter marched overland through southern Gaul, [[siege of Massilia|blockading Massilia]] (present-day [[Marseille]]), and managed to assemble a small fleet. After crushing Pompey's forces in Spain, Caesar focused once again on Pompey and his troops in Greece. Pompey had a large fleet, as well as much support from all Roman provinces and [[client state]]s east of Italy. Caesar, however, managed to cross the Adriatic in the winter, with [[Mark Antony]] following a little later because Caesar lacked sufficient ships. Although Pompey had a larger army, he recognized that Caesar's troops were more experienced, and could prove victorious in a pitched battle. Instead, Pompey waited Caesar's troops out, attempting to starve them by cutting off Caesar's supply lines. Caesar made a near disastrous attack on Pompey's camp at [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Dyrrhachium]] and was forced to pull away.

Pompey did not immediately follow up on his success. An indecisive winter ([[49 BC|49]]–48 BC) of blockade and siege followed. Pompey eventually pushed Caesar into [[Thessaly]] and urged on by his senatorial allies, he confronted Caesar near Pharsalus. Caesar began the battle with a smaller, but veteran, force. Moreover, Pompey's senatorial allies disagreed with Pompey over whether to fight at Pharsalus, and pushed Pompey, who wanted to starve Caesar's soldiers, into a quick decision.

Caesar had the following legions with him:

* Legions of veterans from the [[Gallic Wars]] – Caesar's favourite legion, [[Legio X Equestris|X ''Equestris'']], and those later known with the names of [[Legio VIII Augusta|VIII ''Augusta'']], [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Hispana'']], and [[Legio XII Fulminata|XII ''Fulminata'']]
* Legions levied for the civil war – legions later known as [[Legio I Germanica|I ''Germanica'']], [[Legio III Gallica|III ''Gallica'']], and [[Legio IV Macedonica|IV ''Macedonica'']]

However, all of these legions were 'short', and did not have the requisite numbers of troops. Some only had about a thousand men at the time of Pharsalus, due partly to losses at Dyrrhachium and partly to Caesar's wish to rapidly advance with a picked body as opposed to a ponderous movement with a large army.

==Battle==
[[Image:Battle of Pharsalus.png|thumb|right|400px|Battle formations as described by Plutarch in his Life of Caesar c. 44]]

===Deployment===
Pompey deployed his army in three lines, 10 men deep. He posted his most experienced legions on the flanks (the first and the third legion on his left with Pompey himself commanding, the Syrian legions in the center with Scipio, the Cilician legion and the Spanish cohorts on the right with Afranius), dispersing his new recruits along the center. In total, Caesar counted 110 complete cohorts in the Pompeiian army, about 45,000 men. Pompey also placed 600 horses on his right flank toward the [[Enipefs|River Enipeus]], a natural barrier that protected the wings of both armies. He had given command of the cavalry to [[Labienus]], the former commander of Caesar's favourite X legion. He deployed the rest of the army on his left together with his auxiliary troops. Pompey's plan was to allow Caesar's infantry to advance, have his cavalry attack and push back the numerically inferior Julian horses, and then attack Caesar's infantry from behind. Pompey had disclosed his battle plans to companions days before the battle, and Caesar became aware of them.

Caesar also deployed in three lines. He arrayed his men 6 men deep. He rested his left on the marshland of the river and he positioned all his cavalry on the right, against Pompey's squadrons. Behind them he hid light troops, carrying javelins and other weapons, in anticipation of Pompey's cavalry. Caesar himself commanded his cavalry. He also had 2,000 legionaries as reserves. He posted the notorious tenth legion on his right under Sulla, with the understrength eighth and possibly the ninth on his left under Antonius. In the center he designated [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus|Domitius]] as the commanding officer. According to his accounts, he had 80 cohorts on the battlefield, about 22,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili,III 89,2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict ===
There was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar. Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters. Pompey's advisor [[Caius Triarius]] believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance. But seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's men, without orders, stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge. Caesar, in his history of the war, would praise his own men's discipline and experience, and questioned Pompey's decision not to charge.

When the lines joined, [[Labienus]] ordered the cavalry to attack; at first they successfully repelled Caesar's horse and began to flank his legions. Then Caesar ordered his cavalry to withdraw, and partially-hidden light troops fiercely attacked Pompey's cavalry. The first line of the Pompeiian horse were panicked by the cohort's javelins and caused the entire cavalry to fall into disorder. When the cavalry retreated, Caesar's men slaughtered the light troops who supported them. They attacked Pompey's left flank and, rejoined by their cavalry, were able to get behind and attack Pompey's army from the rear. Caesar raised the pressure further by ordering his as yet uninvolved third line to relieve the front ranks. The remaining Pompeiian soldiers fled and soon the main battle was done.

Pompey retreated to his camp and ordered the garrison to defend it. Caesar urged his men to end the day by capturing the enemy camp, and they complied with his wishes, furiously attacking the walls. The Thracians and the other auxiliaries who were left in the camp, in total seven cohorts, defended bravely, but they were not able to fend off the enemy assault. Pompey fled with a very small retinue, claiming that he had been betrayed. Caesar had won his greatest victory, having lost only about 200 soldiers and 30 centurions.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, BC III 99,1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Pompey fled from Pharsalus to [[Egypt]], where he was assassinated on the order of [[Pharaoh]] [[Ptolemy XIII]]. Interestingly enough, Ptolemy XIII sent Pompey's head to Caesar in an effort to win his favor, but Caesar was not pleased about receiving the head of his son-in-law in a box. It was even said that Caesar cried. Nor did Ptolemy—advised by his regent, the eunuch [[Pothinus]], and his rhetoric tutor [[Theodotus of Chios]]—take into account that Caesar was granting amnesty to a great number of those of the [[Optimates|senatorial]] faction in their defeat, men who had once considered him an enemy. The Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the [[First Triumvirate]]. The Roman Civil War, however, was not ended. Pompey's two sons, Gnaeus and Sextus, and the Pompeian faction, led now by Metellus Scipio and Cato, survived and fought for their cause in the name of Pompey the Great. Caesar spent the next few years 'mopping up' remnants of the [[Optimates|senatorial faction]]. After he'd finally completed this task, he was assassinated by a conspiracy organized by [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]].

Davis, ''100 Decisive Battles from Ancient Times to the Present: The World’s Major Battles and How They Shaped History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Battle date==
The date of the battle is given as 9 August 48 BC. This is according to the republican calendar. The date according to the Julian calendar, however, was either 29 June 48 BC (according to Le Verrier's chronological reconstruction) or possibly 7 June 48 BC (according to Drumann/Groebe). Pompey was assassinated on 3 September 48 BC. The point is not entirely academic: had the battle taken place in the true month of August, when the harvest was becoming ripe, Pompey's strategy of starving Caesar would have been senseless.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Location==
Controversy long raged among scholars over the location of the battlefield. Caesar himself mentions few place-names;&lt;ref&gt;''Bellum Civile'' 3.81–98&lt;/ref&gt; and although the battle is called after Pharsalos, four ancient writers – the author of the ''Bellum Alexandrinum'' (48.1), [[Frontinus]] (''Strategemata'' 2.3.22), [[Eutropius]] (20), and [[Orosius]] (6.15.27) – place it specifically at ''Palae''pharsalos. Until the early 20th century, unsure of the site of Palaepharsalos, scholars followed [[Arrian]] (2.75) and located the battle south of the Enipeus or close to Pharsalos (today's [[Pharsala]]).&lt;ref&gt;Map with conjectured locations, ''Annual of the British School at Athens'', No. XXIV, 1921 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/30102514?seq=21] &lt;/ref&gt; The “north-bank” thesis of [[F. L. Lucas]],&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Lucas, 'The Battlefield of Pharsalos', ''Annual of the British School at Athens'', No. XXIV, 1919–21, pp.34–53&lt;/ref&gt; based on his 1921 solo field-trip to Thessaly, is now, however, broadly accepted by historians.&lt;ref&gt;T.Rice-Holmes, ''The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire'' (Oxford, 1923); Simon Sheppard, ''Pharsalus 48 B.C.: Caesar and Pompey – Clash of the Titans'' (Oxford, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; “A visit to the ground has only confirmed me,” Lucas wrote in 1921; “and it was interesting to find that Mr. Apostolides, son of the large local landowner, the hospitality of whose farm at Tekés I enjoyed, was convinced too that the [battle-]site was by Driskole [now Krini], for the very sound reason that neither the hills nor the river further east suit Caesar’s description.” John D. Morgan in his definitive “Palae-pharsalus – the Battle and the Town”,&lt;ref&gt;''The American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 87, No. 1, Jan. 1983&lt;/ref&gt; arguing for a site closer still to Krini, where he places Palaepharsalos, writes: “My reconstruction is similar to Lucas’s, and in fact I borrow one of his alternatives for the line of the Pompeian retreat. Lucas’s theory has been subjected to many criticisms, but has remained essentially unshaken.”

'''Bigfoot''', also known as '''Sasquatch''', is purportedly an [[Ape|ape-like]] [[cryptid]] that inhabits forests, mainly in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]]. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[humanoid]]. The term &quot;Sasquatch&quot; is an anglicized derivative of the word &quot;Sésquac&quot; which means &quot;wild man&quot; in a [[Salishan languages|Salish]] Native American language.&lt;ref name=&quot;SalishName&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Most scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of [[folklore]], misidentification, and [[hoax]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America's Enduring Legend |last=Daegling |first=David J. |year=2004 |publisher=Altamira Press |isbn=0-7591-0539-1 |ref=Dae04 |pages=62–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a living animal, in part because of the large numbers thought necessary to maintain a breeding population.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;breedingpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html |title= Bigfoot hunting |author= Stephanie Earls |accessdate= 2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some scientists such as [[Jane Goodall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NmCmfdFAhQ |title= &quot;Dr. Jane Goodall Speaks About Bigfoot, Ira Flatow, National Public Radio's &quot;Science Friday,&quot; September 27, 2002.&quot; |accessdate=2010-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Meldrum]], [[John Napier (primatologist)]] and [[Grover Krantz]]  have expressed interest and belief in the creature. Meldrum expressed the opinion that evidence collected of alleged Bigfoot encounters warrants further evaluation and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isu.edu/~meldd/fxnlmorph.html |title= Evaluation of Alleged Sasquatch Footprints and their Inferred Functional Morphology |accessdate=2010-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Napier, a one-time director of the Smithsonian's Primate Biology Program, conceded the likelihood of Bigfoot as a real creature, personally stating &quot;I am convinced that Sasquatch exists&quot; in his 1973 book, Bigfoot: The Sasquatch and Yeti in Myth and Reality (although he ultimately judged the evidence to be scientifically inconclusive).&lt;ref&gt;Napier, &quot;Bigfoot; The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality&quot; E P Dutton; 1st edition, 1973. P. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Bigfoot remains one of the more famous examples of a cryptid within [[cryptozoology]] and an enduring legend.

==Description==
Bigfoot is described in reports as a large hairy ape-like creature, ranging between {{convert|6|–|10|ft|0}} tall, weighing in excess of {{convert|500|lb|kg}}, and covered in dark brown or dark reddish hair.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/bigfoot.html |title=Bigfoot [a.k.a. Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, Mapinguari (the Amazon), Sasquatch, Yowie (Australia) and  Yeti (Asia)] |publisher=The Skeptic's Dictionary |accessdate=2008-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title=Sasquatch |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9065832 |accessdate=2008-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alleged witnesses have described large eyes, a pronounced [[Supraorbital ridge|brow ridge]], and a large, low-set forehead; the top of the head has been described as rounded and crested, similar to the [[sagittal crest]] of the male [[gorilla]]. Bigfoot is commonly reported to have a strong, unpleasant smell by those who claim to have encountered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/biology/smell.htm |title=Sasquatch Smell / Aroma / Odor / Scent |publisher=Bigfoot Encounters |accessdate=2008-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The enormous footprints for which it is named have been as large as {{convert|24|in|cm|-1}} long and {{convert|8|in|cm}} wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt; While most casts have five toes—like all known apes—some casts of alleged Bigfoot tracks have had numbers ranging from two to six.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Radford&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bigfoot_at_50_evaluating_a_half-century_of_bigfoot_evidence |title=Bigfoot at 50 Evaluating a Half-Century of Bigfoot Evidence |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|year=2002|month=March/April|accessdate=2008-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also contained claw marks, making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears, which have five toes and claws.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdnhm.org/fieldguide/mammals/bearsign.html Bear signs], San Diego Natural History Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents have also claimed that Bigfoot is [[omnivorous]] and mainly [[nocturnal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/gdb/show_FAQ.asp?id=586 |title=Physiology |publisher=Bigfoot Field Research Organization |accessdate=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Before 1958===
Wildmen stories are found among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous population]] of the Pacific Northwest. The legends existed prior to a single name for the creature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dae04_p28&quot;&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; They differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community. Similar stories of wildmen are found on every continent except Antarctica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dae04_p28&quot; /&gt; Ecologist [[Robert Michael Pyle]] argues that most cultures have human-like giants in their folk history: &quot;We have this need for some larger-than-life creature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodavage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodavage |first=Maria |title=Hunt for Bigfoot Attracts True Believers |publisher=''USA TODAY''/bz050 |date=1996-05-24 |url=http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/HomePage.usatbf.html |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Lummi]] tell tales about ''Ts'emekwes'', the local version of Bigfoot. The stories are similar to each other in terms of the general descriptions of ''Ts'emekwes'', but details about the creature's diet and activities differed between the stories of different families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rasmus |first=S. Michelle |title=Repatriating Words: Local Knowledge in a Global Context |journal=American Indian Quarterly |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=292 |year=200 |month=Spring |url=http://www.jstor.org.revproxy.brown.edu/stable/4128463 |accessdate = 2008-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some regional versions contained more nefarious creatures. The ''stiyaha'' or ''kwi-kwiyai'' were a nocturnal race that children were told not to say the names of lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a person—sometimes to be killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rigsby&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Rigsby |first=Bruce |title=Some Pacific Northwest Native Language Names for the Sasquatch Phenomenon |publisher=Bigfoot: Fact or Fantasy? |url=http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/papers/rigsby.html |accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the native people about ''skoocooms'': a race of cannibalistic wild men living on the peak of [[Mount St. Helens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt; The ''skoocooms'' appear to have been regarded as supernatural, rather than natural.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;

Less menacing versions such as the one recorded by Reverend Elkanah Walker exist. In 1840, Walker, a Protestant missionary, recorded stories of giants among the Native Americans living in [[Spokane, Washington]]. The Indians claimed that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole salmon from the fishermen's nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/walker.htm |title=The Diary of Elkanah Walker |publisher=Bigfoot Encounters |accessdate=2007-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local legends were combined together by J. W. Burns in a series of Canadian newspaper articles in the 1920s. Each language had its own name for the local version.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last=Mizokami |first=Kyle |coauthors=Franzoni, Henry and Glickman, Jeff |title=Native American Sasquatch Names |publisher=Sasquatch Research |url=http://www.sasquatchresearch.net/sassynames.html |accessdate=2008-08-18 }} for a list of names.&lt;/ref&gt; Many names meant something along the lines of &quot;wild man&quot; or &quot;hairy man&quot; although other names described common actions it was said to perform (e.g. eating clams).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mil07&quot; /&gt; Burns coined the term Sasquatch, which is from the [[Halkomelem language|Halkomelem]] ''sásq’ets'' ({{IPA-sal|ˈsæsqʼəts|IPA}}),&lt;ref&gt;Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 422&lt;/ref&gt; and used it in his articles to describe a hypothetical single type of creature reflected in these various stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mil07&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Meldrum |first=Jeff |title=Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007|page=50 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=ggeQHFa5E7AC&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=salish%20sasquatch&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q=salish%20sasquatch |accessdate=2010-02-19 |isbn=9780765312174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sasquatch |title=Sasquatch |accessdate=2007-08-07 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns's articles popularized both the legend and its new name, making it well known in western [[Canada]] before it gained popularity in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;missingLinks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19990420004631/www.parascope.com/en/cryptozoo/missingLinks.htm |title=Bigfoot |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=Missing Links Primate Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1958===
In 1951, Eric Shipton had photographed what he described as a [[Yeti]] footprint.&lt;ref name=&quot;missingLinks&quot; /&gt; This photograph generated considerable attention and the story of the Yeti entered into popular consciousness. The notoriety of ape-men grew over the decade, culminating in 1958 when large footprints were found in [[Del Norte County, California]], by bulldozer operator Gerald Crew. Sets of large tracks appeared multiple times around a road-construction site in Bluff Creek. After not being taken seriously about what he was seeing, Crew brought in his friend, Bob Titmus, to cast the prints in plaster.

1958 was a watershed year for not just the Bigfoot story itself but also the culture that surrounds it. The first Bigfoot hunters began following the discovery of footprints at Bluff Creek. Within a year, Tom Slick, who had funded searches for Yeti in the Himalayas earlier in the decade, organized searches for Bigfoot in the area around Bluff Creek.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bigfoot has become better known and a [[Bigfoot in popular culture|phenomenon in popular culture]], sightings have spread throughout North America. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] and the [[Southeastern United States]] have had many reports of Bigfoot sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ |title=Geographical Database of Bigfoot/Sasquatch Sightings &amp; Reports |publisher=[[BFRO]] |accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent reported sightings==
[[File:Bigfoot Sightings in USA.png|300px|thumb|Distribution of reported Bigfoot sightings in North America.]]
About a third of all reports of Bigfoot sightings are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, with most of the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ |title=Geographical Database of Bigfoot/Sasquatch Sightings and Reports |publisher=Bigfoot Field Research Organization |accessdate=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Car08_p118&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Car08&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cartmill |first=Matt |title=Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America's Enduring Legend/Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=135 |issue=1 |page=118 |month=January |year=2008 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.20691 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bigfoot advocates, such as cryptozoologist [[John Willison Green]], have postulated that Bigfoot is a worldwide phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sasquatch - The Apes Among Us |last=Green |first=John Willison |year=1978 |publisher=Hancock House Publishing |isbn=0-88839-123-4 |page=16 |ref=Gre78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable reports include:
*'''1924''': Fred Beck claimed that he and four other miners were attacked one night in July 1924, by several &quot;apemen&quot; throwing rocks at their cabin in an area later called [[Ape Canyon]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/beck.htm |title=I Fought the Apemen of Mount St. Helens, WA. |accessdate=2007-08-01 |last=Beck |first=Ronald A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck said the miners shot and possibly killed at least one of the creatures, precipitating an attack on their cabin, during which the creatures bombarded the cabin with rocks and tried to break in. The supposed incident was widely reported at the time.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gorilla Seeahtik Indians and prospectors,&quot; ''Engineering and Mining Journal-Press'', 16 Aug. 1924, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck wrote a book about the alleged event in 1967, in which he argued that the creatures were mystical beings from another dimension, claiming that he had experienced psychic premonitions and visions his entire life of which the apemen were only one component.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Fred; told to Ronald A. Beck. (1967) [http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/beck.htm ''I Fought The Apemen of Mount St. Helens, WA.'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speleologist]] William Halliday argued in 1983 that the story arose from an incident in which hikers from a nearby camp had thrown rocks into the canyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ape Cave and the Mount St. Helens Apes |first=William R. |last=Halliday |year=1983 |isbn=1886168008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also local rumors that pranksters harassed the men and planted faked footprints.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;

*'''1958''': Bulldozer operator Jerry Crew took to a newspaper office a cast of one of the enormous footprints he and other workers had seen at an isolated work site at Bluff Creek, California. The crew was overseen by Wilbur L. Wallace, brother of [[Raymond L. Wallace]].

*'''1967''': Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin reported that on October 20 they had captured a purported Sasquatch on film at Bluff Creek, California.

==Proposed explanations for sightings==
Various types of creatures have been suggested to explain both the sightings and what type of creature Bigfoot would be if it existed. The scientific community typically attributes sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification of known animals and their tracks. While cryptozoologists generally explain Bigfoot as an unknown ape, some believers in Bigfoot attribute the phenomenon to [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] or other paranormal causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/scenes_from_a_bigfoot_conference |last=Boston |first=Rob |title=Scenes from a Bigfoot Conference |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |year=2003 |month=December |accessdate=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of proponents of a natural explanation have attributed Bigfoot to animals that are not apes such as the [[Megatherium|giant ground sloth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae|Daegling 2004]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misidentification===
[[File:Croped BFRO image.jpg|thumb|Photo of an unidentified animal the Bigfoot Research Organization claims is a &quot;juvenile Sasquatch&quot;&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfro.net/avevid/jacobs/jacobs_photos.asp|title= Jacobs Photos |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The reported size of Bigfoot approximates that of a [[bear]] standing on its hind legs, and bears have a high prevalence in regions said to be inhabited by Bigfoot; as such, they are likely candidates to explain some sightings. 

In 2007, the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]] said that photos the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization claimed showed a juvenile Bigfoot were most likely of a bear with [[mange]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ap_bigfoot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490638/Is-Bigfoot---bear-bad-skin.html|title=Is this Bigfoot ... or is it a bear with bad skin?|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Updated 90 minutes ago 2/16/2011 5:01:04 AM +00:00 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21518056/ |title=Hunter's pics revive lively Bigfoot debate |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Meldrum]], on the other hand, said the limb proportions of the suspected juvenile in question were not bear-like, and stated that he felt they were &quot;more like a human.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthfiles333.com/earthfiles/Episode27mp3.html |title=Young Sasquatch?

A tale presented in [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s 1892 book ''The Wilderness Hunter'' (reprinted in his  1900 book ''Hunting the Grisly and Other Sketches'') describing an encounter between two hunters and a violent bear is sometimes presented by Bigfoot proponents as historical evidence of the creature's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Theodore Roosevelt]]|title=The Wilderness Hunter|publisher= Kessinger Publishing|year=2005|isbn=1417975121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hoaxes ===
Both scientists and Bigfoot believers agree that many of the sightings are hoaxes or misidentified animals. Cryptozoologists [[Loren Coleman]] and Diane Stocking have estimated that as many as 70 to 80 percent of sightings are not real.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Radford&quot; /&gt;

Bigfoot sightings or footprints are often demonstrably hoaxes. Author Jerome Clark argues that the &quot;Jacko affair&quot;, involving an 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured in British Columbia, was a hoax. Citing research by John Green, who found that several contemporary British Columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as very dubious, Clark notes that the ''Mainland Guardian'' of [[New Westminster, British Columbia]], wrote, &quot;Absurdity is written on the face of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=195 |last=Clark |first=Jerome |title=Unexplained! 347 Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences and Puzzling Physical Phenomena |publisher=Visible Ink |year=1993 |isbn=0-8103-9436-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2005, [[Tom Biscardi]], a long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and CEO of Searching for Bigfoot Inc., appeared on the [[Coast to Coast AM]] paranormal radio show and announced that he was &quot;98% sure that his group will be able to capture a Bigfoot which they have been tracking in the [[Happy Camp, California]] area.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biscardi_C2C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oregonbigfoot.com/georgia_bigfoot_dead_body_in_freezer_dyer_whitton_biscardi.php |title= Georgia Bigfoot body in freezer |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Biscardi announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured Bigfoot and was arranging a [[pay-per-view]] event for people to see it. Biscardi appeared on Coast to Coast AM again a few days later to announce that there was no captive Bigfoot. Biscardi blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him, and the show's audience for being gullible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biscardi_C2C&quot; /&gt;

On July 9, 2008, Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton posted a video to [[YouTube]] claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate.  Dyer and Whitton received $50,000 from Searching for Bigfoot, Inc., as a [[good faith]] gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/search/content/metro/clayton/stories/2008/08/20/bigfoot_hoax_lawsuit.html|title=Searching for Bigfoot group to sue Georgia hoaxers|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal Constitution]]|date=2008-08-20|first=Christian|last=Boone|coauthors=Kathy Jefcoats}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the men's claims was covered by many major news networks, including [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7564635.stm | work=BBC News | title=Americans 'find body of Bigfoot' | date=2008-08-15 | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/bigfoot.body/ |title= Body proves Bigfoot no myth, hunters say | work=CNN |date=2008-08-15 | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/story?id=5590180 |title= Legend of Bigfoot: Discovery or Hoax? |work=ABC News |date=2008-08-15 |author= Ki Mae Heusser |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fox News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Aug16/0,4670,BigfootClaim,00.html |title= Georgia men claim hairy, frozen corpse is Bigfoot |date=2008-09-16 |author= Malia Wollan |accessdate=2010-04-01 | work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body arrived in a block of ice in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team.

===''Gigantopithecus''===
[[File:Gigantopithecus blacki.JPG|250px|thumb|Fossil jaw of ''Gigantopithecus blacki'', an extinct primate]]
Bigfoot proponents [[Grover Krantz]] and [[Geoffrey Bourne (anatomist)|Geoffrey Bourne]] believe that Bigfoot could be a [[relict|relict population]] of ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''. Bourne contends that as most ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils are found in China, and as many species of animals migrated across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]], it is not unreasonable to assume that ''Gigantopithecus'' might have as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gentle Giants: The Gorilla Story |last=Bourne |first=Geoffrey H. |coauthors=Cohen, Maury |year=1975 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-11528-5 |page=296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Gigantopithecus'' hypothesis is generally considered entirely speculative. ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils are not found in the Americas.  As the only recovered fossils are of [[mandible]]s and teeth, there is some uncertainty about ''Gigantopithecus's'' locomotion. Krantz has argued, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible, that ''[[Gigantopithecus blacki]]'' could have been bipedal.  However, the relevant part of mandible is not present in any fossils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstream view is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was [[quadruped]]al, and it has been argued that ''Gigantopithecus's'' enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.

Matt Cartmill presents another problem with the ''Gigantopithecus'' hypothesis: &quot;The trouble with this account is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was not a hominin and maybe not even a crown-group hominoid; yet the physical evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that ''Gigantopithecus'' would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car08|Cartmill 2008]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard G. Campbellin wrote: &quot;That ''Gigantopithecus'' is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the Yeti of the Himalayas and the Sasquatch of the north-west American coast. But the evidence for these creatures is not convincing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Humankind Emerging |last=Campbell |first=Bernard G.|year=1979 |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |id=Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 78-78234 |page=100 |isbn=0673521702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinct hominidae ===
A species of ''[[Paranthropus]]'', such as ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'', with its crested skull and bipedal gait, was suggested by primatologist [[John Napier (primatologist)|John Napier]] and anthropologist Gordon Strasenburg as a possible candidate for Bigfoot's identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm |title=Scientific Names for Bigfoot |last=Coleman |first=Loren |publisher=BFRO |accessdate=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that fossils of ''Paranthropus'' are found only in Africa.

Michael Rugg, of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum, presented a comparison between human, Gigantopithecus and [[Meganthropus]] skulls (reconstructions made by [[Grover Krantz]]) in episodes 131 and 132 of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php |title=Bigfoot Discovery Project Media |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He favorably compares a modern tooth suspected of coming from a bigfoot to the Meganthropus fossil teeth, noting the worn enamel on the [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] surface.  The Meganthropus fossils originated from Asia, the tooth was found in the Pacific Northwest.

Some suggest [[Neanderthal]] or ''[[Homo erectus]]'' to be the creature but no remains of either species are found in the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific view==
{{quote box|quote=Bigfoot is more than just a silly slice of history. The beast's appearance on the national scene marked an important milestone: the first widely popularized example of pseudoscience in American culture. The debate over its legitimacy reached a zenith in the 1970s, with a slew of high-profile magazine stories and TV specials that gave prominent coverage to theories supporting the creature's existence, concocted by self-styled Bigfoot &quot;experts&quot; spouting factoids cherry-picked from bona fide scientific research. The controversy led anthropologists and other scientists to run for cover to avoid being tarred by association with such specious ideas. As a result, the &quot;evidence&quot; in Bigfoot's favor was presented essentially unchallenged, effectively legitimizing the pseudoscientific claims. Because the existence of the beast could not be disproved, many readers and viewers were left feeling that its existence was quite probable. By absenting themselves from the debate, the scientific community appeared out of touch and elitist. In the three intervening decades, the increasingly common use of pseudoscience—junk science, voodoo science, pathological science, or whatever you choose to call it—has transformed public debate.|source=—''Anatomy of a beast: obsession and myth on the trail of Bigfoot'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anatomy of a beast: obsession and myth on the trail of Bigfoot|last=McLeod|first=Michael|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25571-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_6FmjJYd13wC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|year=2009|location=Berkley&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right|width=40%|fontsize=70%||bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quoted=2}}

{{see also|Formal studies of Bigfoot}}
The scientific community discounts the existence of Bigfoot, as there is no evidence supporting the survival of such a large, prehistoric ape-like creature. The evidence that does exist points more towards a hoax or delusion than to sightings of a genuine creature.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot; /&gt; In a 1996 ''[[USA Today]]'' article titled &quot;Bigfoot Merely Amuses Most Scientists&quot;, Washington State zoologist John Crane says, &quot;There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material that's clearly been fabricated has ever been presented.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USA_Today&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/HomePage.usatbf.html |title=USA Today Bigfoot Articles |accessdate=2008-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the lack of evidence, scientists cite the fact that Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized nonhuman apes are found in the [[tropics]] of Africa and Asia.  Thus, as with other proposed megafauna cryptids, climate and food supply issues would make such a creature's survival in reported habitats unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjögren, Bengt 1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Sjögren, Bengt |title= ''Berömda vidunder'' |publisher= Settern |year= 1980 |isbn= 91-7586-023-6}}{{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, great apes are not found in the fossil record in the Americas, and no Bigfoot remains have ever been found. Indeed, scientific consensus is that the breeding population of such an animal would be so large that it would account for many more purported sightings than currently occur, making the existence of such an animal an almost certain impossibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;breedingpop&quot;/&gt;

A few scientists have been less skeptical about the claims of the existence of sasquatch.

==Bigfoot organizations==
There are several organizations dedicated to the research and investigation of Bigfoot sightings in the United States. The oldest and largest is the Bigfoot Field Research Organization or &quot;BFRO&quot;. The BFRO also provides a free database to individuals and other organizations. Their internet website includes reports from across North America that have been investigated by researchers to determine credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bigfoot!:The True Story of Apes in America |last=Coleman |first=Loren |year=2003 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |ref=Col03 |page=233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Lillis &quot;Bing&quot; Crosby''' (May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', October 19, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[singer]] and [[actor]]. Crosby's trademark [[bass-baritone]] voice made him one of the best-selling recording artists of the 20th century, with over half a billion records in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/bing-crosby/3574#/artist/bing-crosby/bio/3574 | title = Bing Crosby Billboard Biography | work = [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] |accessdate = October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multimedia star, from 1934 to 1954 Bing Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings and motion picture grosses.&lt;ref&gt;Giddins, 2001, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby's early career coincided with technical recording innovations; this allowed him to develop a laid-back, intimate singing style that influenced many of the popular male singers who followed him, including [[Perry Como]],&lt;ref name=pop40t1B&gt;{{cite book

}}, cassette 1, side B.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Dean Martin]]. ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank]]'' magazine recognized Crosby as the person who had done the most for American [[GI (military)|G.I.]] morale during World War II and, during his peak years, around 1948, polls declared him the &quot;most admired man alive,&quot; ahead of [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Pope Pius XII]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddins, 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;crooner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Dr. Frank|title=Crooner|url=http://www.jeffosretromusic.com/bing.html|accessdate=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1948, the ''Music Digest'' estimated that Crosby recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.&lt;ref name=&quot;crooner&quot;/&gt;

Crosby exerted an important influence on the development of the postwar recording industry. Crosby worked for NBC at the time and wanted to record his shows, however, most broadcast networks did not allow recording. This was mainly because of the quality of the recording at the time. While in Europe performing during the war, Crosby had witnessed tape recording, on which The Crosby Research Foundation would come to have many patents. The company also developed equipment and recording techniques such as the [[Laugh Track]] which are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, C. H., &amp; Kittross, J. M. (1990). Stay tuned: A concise history of american broadcasting (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he invested $50,000 in the [[Ampex]] company, which built North America's first commercial [[reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He left NBC to work for ABC, because NBC was not interested in recording at the time. This proved beneficial because ABC accepted him and his new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, C. H., &amp; Kittross, J. M. (1990). Stay tuned: A concise history of american broadcasting 	(2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby then became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 200 recorders to his friend, musician [[Les Paul]], which led directly to Paul's invention of [[multitrack recording]]. Along with [[Frank Sinatra]], Crosby was one of the principal backers behind the famous [[United Western Recorders]] studio complex in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Jim; Clark, William, [http://books.google.com/books?id=hO-KQ4o_B2MC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Temples of sound : inside the great recording studios''], San Francisco : Chronicle Books, 2003. ISBN 0811833941&lt;/ref&gt;

During the &quot;Golden Age of Radio,&quot; performers often had to recreate their live shows a second time for the west coast time zone.  Through the aegis of recording, Crosby constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) being used in motion picture production.  This became the industry standard.

Crosby won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture ''[[Going My Way]]'', and was nominated for his reprise of the role in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' the next year, becoming the first of four actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first [[Grammy Award|Grammy Global Achievement Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/ |title=Lifetime Achievement Award. '&amp;#39;Past Recipients'&amp;#39; |publisher=Grammy.com |date=February 8, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby is one of the 22 people to have three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Early life==
Crosby was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], on May 3, 1903,&lt;ref name=Grudens/&gt; in a house his father built at 1112 North J Street.&lt;ref&gt;Bing Crosby had no birth certificate and his birth date was unconfirmed until his childhood Roman Catholic church released his baptismal record.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Crosby's family moved to [[Spokane, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blecha |first=Peter |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=7445} |title=the Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |publisher=HistoryLink.org |date=2005-08-29 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, Crosby's father built a house at 508 E. Sharp Ave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gonzaga History 1980-1989 |url=http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Libraries/Foley-Library/Departments/Special-Collections/exhibitions/GonzagaHistory1980.asp |title=Gonzaga History 1980-1989 - Gonzaga University |publisher=Gonzaga.edu |date=1986-09-17 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house now sits on the campus of Bing's alma mater [[Gonzaga University]] and formerly housed the Alumni Association.

He was the fourth of seven children: brothers [[Larry Crosby|Larry]] (1895–1975), Everett (1896–1966), Ted (1900–1973), Harry 'Bing' (1903–1977), and [[Bob Crosby|Bob]] (1913–1993); and two girls, Catherine (1904–1974) and Mary Rose (1906–1990). His parents, Harry Lincoln Crosby (1870–1950), an [[English-American]] [[bookkeeper]], and Catherine Helen (known as Kate) Harrigan (1873–1964), who was a second generation [[Irish-American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gary|last=Giddins|title=Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bing's paternal ancestors had emigrated to what would become the U.S. in the 17th century, and included Patience Brewster, the daughter of the Pilgrim leader and ''[[Mayflower]]'' passenger [[William Brewster (pilgrim)|William Brewster]], (c. 1567 – April 10, 1644).&lt;ref&gt;Giddins, 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, six-year-old Harry Crosby was forever renamed. The Sunday edition of the ''[[Spokesman-Review]]'' published a feature called &quot;The Bingville Bugle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Spokesman Review|title=The Bingville Bugle|first=Newton|last=Newkirk|date=14 March 1909|accessdate = 25 September 2010|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/blogs/history/media/bingville.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Spokesman Review|title=The Bingville Bugle|first=Newton|last=Newkirk|date=19 July 1914|accessdate=25 September 2010|url=http://leonardodesa.interdinamica.net/comics/lds/bing/bingville.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Written by [[humorist]] [[Newton Newkirk]], ''The Bingville Bugle'' was a [[parody]] of a [[hillbilly]] newsletter filled with gossipy tidbits, [[minstrel]] [[quips]], creative spelling, and mock ads. A neighbor, 15-year-old Valentine Hobart, shared Crosby's enthusiasm for &quot;The Bugle&quot; and noting Crosby's laugh, took a liking to him and called him &quot;Bingo from Bingville&quot;. Eventually the last vowel was dropped and the nickname stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Oa2_zcwucAgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=bing+crosby+bingo+bingville+bugle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8DHK9U9Lfl&amp;sig=BLFVQNnhQflUL769bVqYXepaWY8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JVqeTI-XM4H68Aa-2cAl&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=bing%20crosby%20bingo%20bingville%20bugle&amp;f=false|author=Gary Giddins|title=Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams - The Early Years, 1903 - 1940, Volume I|publisher= Back Bay Books|date=8 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Crosby took a summer job as property boy at [[Spokane]]'s &quot;Auditorium,&quot; where he witnessed some of the finest acts of the day, including [[Al Jolson]], who held Crosby spellbound with his [[ad lib]]bing and [[Parody|spoofs]] of [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian songs]].  Crosby later described Jolson's delivery as &quot;electric&quot;.&lt;ref name=pop40t3B&gt;{{cite book

===Music===
{{ref improve section|date=January 2011}}
By 1925, Crosby had formed a vocal duo with partner Al Rinker, brother of [[Mildred Bailey]]. Mildred introduced Al and Bing to [[Paul Whiteman]],who was at that time America's most famous bandleader. Hired for $150 a week, they made their debut on December 6, 1926 at the [[Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)]]. Their first recording was &quot;I've Got The Girl,&quot; with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record did them no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78 rpm. Throughout his career, Bing Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.

Even as the Crosby and Rinker duo was increasing in popularity, Whiteman added a third member to the group.  The threesome, now including pianist and aspiring songwriter [[Harry Barris]], were dubbed &quot;[[The Rhythm Boys]]&quot;.  They joined the Whiteman touring act, performing and recording with musicians [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], and [[Eddie Lang]] and [[Hoagy Carmichael]].

Crosby soon became the star attraction of [[the Rhythm Boys]], and in 1928 had his first number one hit with the Whiteman orchestra, a jazz-influenced rendition of &quot;[[Ol' Man River]]&quot;. However, Crosby's reported taste for alcohol and his growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to [[the Rhythm Boys]] quitting to join the [[Gus Arnheim]] Orchestra. During his time with Arnheim, the other two Rhythm Boys were increasingly pushed to the background as the emphasis was on Crosby. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's subsequent hits including &quot;At Your Command,&quot; &quot;[[I Surrender Dear]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)|Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams]].  But the members of the band had a falling out and split, setting the stage for Crosby's solo career.&lt;ref name=kl.&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3094/biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1931, Crosby made his solo radio debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html|title=Bing Crosby, Singer|publisher=Radio Hall of Fame|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, he'd signed with both [[Brunswick Records]] and [[CBS Radio]].  Doing a weekly 15 minute radio broadcast, Crosby quickly became a huge hit.&lt;ref name=kl. /&gt;  His songs &quot;[[Out of Nowhere (Johnny Green song)|Out of Nowhere]]&quot;, &quot;[[Just One More Chance]]&quot;, &quot;[[At Your Command]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)]]&quot; were all among the best selling songs of 1931.&lt;ref name=kl. /&gt;

As the 1930s unfolded, Crosby became the leading singer in America. Ten of the top 50 songs for 1931 featured Crosby, either solo or with others. A so-called &quot;Battle of the Baritones&quot; with singing star [[Russ Columbo]] proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan &quot;Bing Was King.&quot;  Crosby signed a long-term deal with [[Jack Kapp]]'s new record company [[Decca Records|Decca]], and starred in his first full-length feature, 1932's ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'', the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures.

Around this time Crosby co-starred on radio with [[Carl Fenton|The Carl Fenton Orchestra]] on a popular [[CBS]] radio show.  By 1936, he'd replaced his former boss, [[Paul Whiteman]], as the host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', the weekly radio program where he remained for the next ten years. &quot;[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]]&quot;, which also showcased one of his then-trademark [[whistling]] interludes, became his theme song and signature tune.

Crosby's much-imitated style helped take popular singing beyond the kind of &quot;[[belt (music)|belting]]&quot; associated with boisterous performers like [[Al Jolson]], who had been obliged to reach the back seats in New York theatres without the aid of the microphone. As [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] noted in ''The Great American Popular Singers'', something new had entered American music, a style that might be called &quot;singing in American,&quot; with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet &quot;[[crooner]]&quot;.

Crosby made numerous live appearances before American troops fighting in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]]. He also learned how to pronounce German from written scripts, and would read propaganda broadcasts intended for the German forces. The nickname &quot;Der Bingle&quot; for him was understood to have become current among Crosby's German listeners, and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Bob Hope]].

==&quot;White Christmas&quot;==
The biggest hit of Crosby's career was his recording of [[Irving Berlin]]'s &quot;[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]&quot;, which he introduced through a radio broadcast during the 1942 Christmas season, and the movie ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]''. Crosby's recording hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to #1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another 16 times.  It topped the charts again in 1945, and for a third time in January 1947. The song remains the best-selling single of all time.&lt;ref name=kl. /&gt; According to [[Guinness World Records]], Crosby's recording of &quot;White Christmas&quot; has &quot;sold over 100 million copies around the world, with at least 50 million sales as singles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' 2007: ISBN 1-904994-11-3&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby's recording was so popular that he was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles.  Though the two versions are very similar, it is the 1947 recording which is most familiar today.  Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song's success, saying later that &quot;a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully.&quot;

He received critical acclaim for his performance as an alcoholic entertainer in ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'', and received his third [[Academy Award]] nomination. He co-starred with [[Bob Hope]] in seven  ''[[Road to]]'' musical comedies between 1940 and 1962, cementing the two entertainers as an on-and-off duo, despite never officially declaring themselves a &quot;team&quot; in the sense that [[Laurel and Hardy]] or [[Martin and Lewis]] were teams.  Appearing solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other, typically in a comically insulting fashion, during their various radio and film appearances.

By the late 1950s, Crosby's singing career had evolved into that of an avuncular elder statesman, and his albums [[Bing Sings Whilst Bregman Swings]] and [[Bing With A Beat]] sold reasonably well,&lt;ref name=kl. /&gt; even in the rock 'n roll era. In 1960, Crosby starred in ''[[High Time (film)|High Time]]'', a collegiate comedy with [[Fabian (entertainer)|Fabian]] and [[Tuesday Weld]] that foretold the emerging gap between older Crosby fans and a new generation of films and music.&lt;ref name=kl. /&gt;

===Television===
''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) was Crosby's first television production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at [[Hal Roach#Hal Roach Studios|Hal Roach Studios]] rather than performed live on the air. The &quot;telefilms&quot; were syndicated to individual television stations.

Crosby was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s. He was especially closely associated with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s variety show ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]''. He was the show's most frequent guest host, and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children. In the early 1970s he made two famous late appearances on the [[Flip Wilson Show]], singing duets with the comedian. Crosby's last TV appearance was a Christmas special filmed in London in September 1977 and aired just weeks after his death.  It was on this special that Crosby recorded a duet of ''[[Little Drummer Boy]]'' with the flamboyant rock star [[David Bowie]].  It was first released as a single five years later, and has since become a staple of holiday radio, and the final popular hit of Crosby's career.  At the end of the century, ''TV Guide'' listed the Crosby-Bowie duet as one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th century television.  He also discussed his final concert engagement in New York City in an interview on a popular talk show with [[Bill Boggs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://billboggs.com/bing_vid.htm Bing Crosby Video].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bing Crosby Productions, affiliated with [[Desilu Studios]] and later [[CBS Television Studios]], produced a number of television series, including Crosby's own unsuccessful [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Bing Crosby Show]]'' in the 1964–1965 season (with co-stars [[Beverly Garland]] and [[Frank McHugh]]).  The company produced two ABC [[medical drama]]s, ''[[Ben Casey]]'' (1961–1966) and ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'' (1963–1964), the popular ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' (1965–1971) military comedy on CBS, as well as the lesser-known show ''[[Slattery's People]]'' (1964–1965).

===Singing style and vocal characteristics===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Crosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone, rather than using the deep, loud &quot;vaudeville style&quot; associated with [[Al Jolson]] and others.  Crosby's love and appreciation of jazz music helped bring the genre to a wider mainstream audience.  Within the framework of the novelty singing style of [[The Rhythm Boys]], Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was firmly rooted in jazz.  He'd already been introduced to [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Bessie Smith]] prior to his first appearance on record.  Crosby and Armstrong would remain professionally friendly for decades, notably in the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', where they sang the duet &quot;Now You Has Jazz.&quot;  

During the early portion of his solo career (about 1931-1934), Crosby's emotional, often pleading style of [[crooning]] was extremely popular.  But Jack Kapp (manager of [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and later [[Decca Records|Decca]])  talked Crosby into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms, in favor of a straight-ahead clear vocal style.

Crosby also elaborated on a further idea of [[Al Jolson]]'s: phrasing, or the art of making a song's [[lyrics|lyric]] ring true. His success in doing so was influential.  &quot;I used to tell [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]] over and over,&quot; said [[Tommy Dorsey]], &quot;there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is the words, and that's the only thing that ought to for you, too.&quot;

Vocal critic Henry Pleasants wrote:
:&quot;[While] the octave B flat to B flat in Bing's voice at that time [1930s] is, to my ears, one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of listening to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of '[[Dardanella]]' with [[Louis Armstrong]] in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, and they tend to sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pleasants, H. (1985). The Great American Popular Singers.  Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career statistics===
Crosby's was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century. Although [[Billboard Magazine]] operated under different methodologies for the bulk of Crosby's career, his chart numbers remain astonishing: 383 chart singles, including 41 #1 hits. Crosby had separate charting singles in every calendar year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. Billboard's statistician [[Joel Whitburn]] determined Crosby to be America's most successful recording act of the 1930s, and again in the 1940s.

[[Image:Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in White Christmas trailer 3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Crosby with [[Danny Kaye]] in ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954)]]For 15 years (1934, 1937, 1940, 1943–1954), Crosby was among the top 10 in box office drawing power, and for five of those years (1944–1948) he was tops in the world.&lt;ref name=kl. /&gt; He sang four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning songs – &quot;Sweet Leilani&quot; (1937), &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1942), &quot;[[Swinging on a Star]]&quot; (1944), &quot;In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening&quot; (1951) – and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in ''[[Going My Way]]'' (1944).

He collected 23 gold and platinum records, according to the book &quot;Million Selling Records.&quot; The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958, by which point Crosby's record sales were barely a blip; prior to that point, gold records are awarded by an artist's own record company. Universal Music, current owner of Crosby's Decca catalog, has never requested RIAA certification for any of his hit singles.

In 1962, Crosby was given the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He has been inducted into the halls of fame for both radio and popular music.  In 2007 Crosby was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame, and in 2008 into the Western Music Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernmusic.com/performers/hof-crosby.html |title=Johnny Bond – WMA Hall of Fame |publisher=Westernmusic.com |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
===Mass media===
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2007}}

Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. (The live production of radio shows was also  reinforced by the musicians' union and [[ASCAP]], which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.)  In ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', historian John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional standard:
:&quot;[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed, and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. [[Fred Allen]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Phil Harris]], and, yes, Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.&quot;

Crosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of [[magnetic tape sound recording]] and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it.&lt;ref&gt;Hammar, Peter. Jack Mullin: The man and his machines. Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 37 (6): 490–496, 498, 500, 502, 504, 506, 508, 510, 512; June 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An afternoon with Jack Mullin. NTSC VHS tape, 1989 AES.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040603153341/www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_tape.htm ''History of Magnetic tape'', section: &quot;Enter Bing Crosby&quot;] (WayBack Machine)&lt;/ref&gt; He used his clout, both professional and financial, to innovate new methods of reproducing audio of his performances. But NBC (and competitor CBS) were also insistent, refusing to air prerecorded radio programs.  Crosby walked away from the network and stayed off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], his sponsor, that was settled out of court.  Crosby returned to the air for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 season.

The [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] network, on the other hand, had pre-recorded some of its programs as early as the 1938 run of ''[[The Shadow]]'' with [[Orson Welles]].  And the new [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network, which had been formed out of the sale of the old [[NBC]] Blue network in 1943 following a federal [[anti-trust]] action – was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by [[Philco]]. He would also get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch lacquer/[[aluminum disc]]s that played ten minutes per side at 33⅓ rpm.

Crosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for his golf game. And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the [[Jasper National Park]] Invitational Golf Tournament in September, just when the new radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason.

Though Crosby did want more time to tend his other business and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the [[microphones]] his way; the logistics of mic placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio since the beginning of the electrical era. No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name [[Minute Maid]]. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799353,00.html TIME Magazine story&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcription method posed problems, however. The acetate surface coating of the aluminum discs was little better than the wax that Edison had used at the turn of the century, with the same limited dynamic range and frequency response.

But [[Murdo MacKenzie]] of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German [[Magnetophon]] in June 1947—the same device that [[Jack Mullin]] had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] ordered his [[Ampex|Ampex company]], which he'd founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.

Crosby hired Mullin to start recording his ''Philco Radio Time'' show on his German-made machine in August 1947, using the same 50 reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] near [[Frankfurt]] while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The crucial advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:
:&quot;By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.&quot;

Mullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account: 
:&quot;In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it – thought it was very funny – but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This [[Ad libitum|ad lib]] way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.&quot;

Crosby invested US$50,000 in [[Ampex]] with an eye towards producing more machines. In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was taped with the new Ampex Model 200 tape recorder using the new Scotch 111 tape from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing ([[3M]]) company. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines: 
:&quot;One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.&quot;
Crosby had launched the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film ''[[Mr. Music]]'', Bing Crosby is seen singing into one of the new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else.  Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend [[Bob Hope]].

Mullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a [[videotape]] recorder. Television production was mostly live in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. 1950's ''The Fireside Theater'', sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]], was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the &quot;telefilms&quot; were syndicated to individual television stations.

Crosby did not remain a television producer, but continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE), gave the world's first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by [[Jack Mullin|John T. Mullin]] and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as &quot;blurred and indistinct&quot; images, using a modified [[Ampex]] 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3&amp;nbsp;mm) audio tape moving at 360&amp;nbsp;inches (9.1 m) per second.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tape Recording Used by Filmless 'Camera',&quot; ''New York Times'', Nov. 12, 1951, p. 21.

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2011}}
Crosby was a fan of [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] and bought his first racehorse in 1935. In 1937, he became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its [[Board of Directors]].  Operating from the [[Del Mar Racetrack]] at [[Del Mar, California]], the group included millionaire businessman [[Charles S. Howard]], who owned a successful racing stable that included [[Seabiscuit]].  His son, [[Lindsay C. Howard|Lindsay Howard]], became one of Crosby's closest friends; Crosby named his son [[Lindsay Crosby|Lindsay]] after him, and would purchase his 40-room [[Hillsborough, California|Hillsborough]] estate from Lindsay in 1965. 

Crosby and Lindsay Howard formed [[Binglin Stable]] to race and breed thoroughbred horses at a ranch in [[Moorpark, California|Moorpark]] in [[Ventura County, California]]. They also established the Binglin stock farm in Argentina, where they raced horses at Hipódromo de Palermo in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]]. A number of Argentine-bred horses were purchased and shipped to race in the United States. On August 12, 1938, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club hosted a $25,000 winner-take-all [[match race]] won by Charles S. Howard's [[Seabiscuit]] over Binglin's horse Ligaroti. In 1943, Binglin's horse Don Bingo won the [[Suburban Handicap]] at [[Belmont Park]] in [[Elmont, New York]].

The Binglin Stable partnership came to an end in 1953 as a result of a liquidation of assets by Crosby, who needed to raise enough funds to pay the hefty federal and state inheritance taxes on his deceased wife's estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Bing Crosby Breeders' Cup Handicap]] at [[Del Mar Racetrack]] is named in his honor.

Crosby was also a co-owner of the British colt [[Meadow Court]], with jockey [[Johnny Longden]]'s friend [[Max Bell]] .  Meadow Court won the 1965 [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]], and the [[Irish Derby]].  In the Irish Derby's winner's circle at the [[Curragh]], Crosby sang &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.&quot;

Though Crosby's stables had some success, he often joked about his horseracing failures as part of his radio appearances.  &quot;Crosby's horse finally came in&quot; became a running gag.

==Crosby the sportsman==
Crosby had an interest in sports. From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseball's [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Although he was passionate about his team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the [[1960 World Series|1960 World Series]], choosing to go to [[Paris]] with Kathryn and listen to the game on the radio. But Crosby had the [[NBC]] telecast of the game recorded on [[kinescope]].  The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by [[Bill Mazeroski]]'s [[walk-off home run]]. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/sports/baseball/24crosby.html?_r=1&amp;src=mv |title=In Bing Crosby's Wine Cellar, Vintage Baseball |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |publisher=The New York Times |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restored broadcast was shown on [[MLB Network]] in December 2010.  

Crosby was also an avid golfer, and in 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the [[Bob Jones Award]], the highest honor given by the [[United States Golf Association]] in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship.  He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Since 1937, the 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known—now the [[AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]]—has been a leading event in the world of professional golf. 

He conceived his tournament as a friendly little pro-am for his fellow members at Lakeside Golf Club and any stray touring pros who could use some pocket change. The first Clambake was played at [[Rancho Santa Fe, California|Rancho Santa Fe C.C.]], in northern San Diego county, where Crosby was a member. He kicked in $3,000 of his own money for the purse, which led inaugural champion Sam Snead to ask if he might get his $700 in cash instead of a check. Snead's suspicions notwithstanding, the tournament was a rollicking success, thanks to the participation of Lakeside's membership, which was heavy in North Hollywood entertainment figures. The 1937 event set the precedent that the tournament was as much about partying as it was about golf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgv.com/hof/member.php?member=1040 |title=World Golf Hall of Fame Member Profile |publisher=Wgv.com |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But there is also a serious side.  The tournament, revived on the Monterey Peninsula in 1947, has as of 2009 raised $93 million for local charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attpbgolf.com/charities/about-mpf.php|title=About the Monterey Peninsula Foundation|accessdate=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of ''[[The King of Jazz]]''.   Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap.  He competed in both the British and U.S. Amateur championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at [[Pebble Beach, California|Cypress Point]].

==Personal life==
Crosby was married twice, first to actress/nightclub singer [[Dixie Lee]] from 1930 until her death from [[ovarian cancer]] in 1952. They had four sons: [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]], twins [[Dennis Crosby|Dennis]] and [[Phillip Crosby|Phillip]], and [[Lindsay Crosby|Lindsay]]. The 1947 film ''[[Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman]]'' is indirectly based on her life. After Dixie's death, Crosby had relationships with actresses [[Inger Stevens]] and [[Grace Kelly]] before marrying the actress [[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]] in 1957. They had three children: [[Harry Crosby (actor)|Harry]] (who played Bill in ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]''), [[Mary Frances Crosby|Mary]] (best known for portraying [[Kristin Shepard]], the woman who shot [[J.R. Ewing]] on TV's ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]''), and [[Nathaniel Crosby|Nathaniel]].

Kathryn converted to Catholicism in order to marry the singer.  Crosby was also a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and actively campaigned for [[Wendell Willkie]] in 1940, arguing that [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] should serve only two terms.  After Willkie lost, Crosby decreed that he would never again make any open political contributions.

Crosby reportedly overindulged in alcohol in his youth, and may have been dismissed from Paul Whiteman's orchestra because of it, but he later got a handle on his drinking. ''[[Village Voice]]'' jazz critic and Crosby biographer [[Gary Giddins]] says that [[Louis Armstrong]]'s influence on Crosby &quot;extended to his love of marijuana.&quot; Crosby smoked it during his early career when it was still legal, and &quot;surprised interviewers&quot; in the 1960s and 70s by advocating its decriminalization. According to Giddins, Crosby told his son Gary to stay away from alcohol (&quot;It killed your mother&quot;&lt;ref name=Giddins181&gt;Giddins, 2001, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;) and suggested he smoke [[cannabis (drug)|pot]] instead.&lt;ref name=Giddins181/&gt; Gary said, &quot;There were other times when marijuana was mentioned and he'd get a smile on his face.&quot;&lt;ref name=Giddins181/&gt; Gary thought his father's pot smoking had influenced his easygoing style in his films. Crosby finally quit smoking his pipe following lung surgery in 1974.

After Crosby's death, his eldest son, Gary, wrote a highly critical memoir, ''Going My Own Way'', depicting his father as cold, remote, and both physically and psychologically abusive. Two of Crosby's other sons, Lindsay and Dennis, sided with Gary's claim and stated Crosby abused them as well.&lt;ref name=lk&gt;{{cite web|last=Haller |first=Scot |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20084544,00.html |title=The Sad Ballad of Bing and His Boys - Child Abuse, Kids &amp; Family Life, Bing Crosby |publisher=People.com |date=1983-03-21 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dennis also stated that Crosby would abuse Gary the most often.&lt;ref name=lk /&gt;  

Gary Crosby wrote:
:&quot;We had to keep a close watch on our actions... When one of us left a sneaker or pair of underpants lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until he went off to bed that night. Dad called it &quot;the Crosby lavalier.&quot; At the time the humor of the name escaped me...

:&quot;Satchel Ass&quot; or &quot;Bucket Butt&quot; or &quot;My Fat-assed Kid.&quot; That's how he introduced me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me into his office and had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...

:When I saw ''Going My Way'' I was as moved as they were by the character he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to the house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nospank.net/crosbyg.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed that Crosby's will had established a blind trust, with none of the sons receiving an inheritance until they reached the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-13/local/me-242_1_lindsay-crosby | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ashley | last=Dunn | date=December 13, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, younger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Gary's claims about their father.  Around the time Gary made his claim, Phillip stated to the press that &quot;Gary is a whining...crybaby, walking around with a 2-by-4 and just daring people to nudge it off.&quot;&lt;ref name=polc&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-01-20/bay-area/17409442_1_gary-crosby-bing-crosby-philip-crosby/2 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Leah Garchik's Personals | date=January 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Phillip did not deny that Crosby believed in corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=polc /&gt;  In an interview with People Magazine, Phillip stated that &quot;we never got an extra whack or a cuff we didn't deserve.&quot;&lt;ref name=polc /&gt;  In an interview conducted in 1999 by the Globe, Phillip said:
:&quot;My dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him.

:To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote ''Going My Own Way'' out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers.

:My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grudens, 2002, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
Gary Crosby died in 1995 at the age of 62, and 69-year-old Phillip Crosby died in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E5D61439F933A15752C0A9629C8B63 |title=Philip Crosby, 69, Son of Bing Crosby|publisher=New York Times |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lindsay and Dennis Crosby each committed suicide, shooting themselves with shotguns in 1989 and 1991, respectively.  [[Nathaniel Crosby]], Crosby's youngest son from his second marriage, was a high-level golfer who won the [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] at age 19 in 1981, at the time the youngest-ever winner of that event (a record later broken by [[Tiger Woods]]).  [[Harry Crosby (actor)|Harry Crosby]] is an investment banker who occasionally makes singing appearances. 

Widow [[Kathryn Crosby]] dabbled in local theater productions intermittently, and appeared in television tributes to her late husband.  [[Denise Crosby]], Dennis Crosby's daughter, is also an actress and is known for her role as [[Tasha Yar]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and for the recurring role of the Romulan [[Sela (Star Trek)|Sela]] (daughter of Tasha Yar) after her withdrawal from the series as a regular cast member. She also appeared in the film adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Pet Sematary]]''.  In 2006, Crosby's niece, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book &quot;Me and Uncle Bing.&quot;

==Failing health and death==

Following his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection of his right lung in 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to produce multiple albums and concert tours. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business, Crosby backed off the stage and fell into an orchestra pit, rupturing a disc in his back and requiring a month in the hospital. His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977; when the power went out, he continued singing without amplification. In September, Crosby, his family, and singer [[Rosemary Clooney]] began a concert tour of England that included two weeks at the [[London Palladium]]. While in England, Crosby recorded his final album, ''Seasons'', and his final TV Christmas special with guest [[David Bowie]]. His last concert was in [[The Brighton Centre]] four days before his death, with British entertainer Dame [[Gracie Fields]] in attendance. Crosby's last photograph was taken with Fields.

At the conclusion of his work in England, Crosby flew alone to Spain to hunt and play golf. Shortly after 6 p.m. on October 14, Crosby died suddenly from a massive heart attack after a round of 18 holes of golf near Madrid where he and his Spanish golfing partner had just defeated their opponents. It is widely written that his last words were &quot;That was a great game of golf, fellas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HFI/is_5_54/ai_101967390 |title=The Bing dynasty: on the 100th anniversary of Crosby's birth, we celebrate the granddaddy of celebrity golf |publisher=Golf Digest |date=2003-05 |accessdate=November 2, 2008 | first=Tom | last=Callahan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Bob Hope's Confessions of a Hooker: My Lifelong Love Affair With Golf]]'', the comedian recounts hearing that Crosby had been advised by a physician in England to only play nine holes of golf due to his heart condition.

In his 1990 autobiography ''Don't Shoot, It's Only Me!'' [[Bob Hope]] wrote, &quot;Dear old Bing. As we called him, the ''Economy-sized Sinatra''. And what a voice. God I miss that voice. I can't even turn on the radio around Christmas time without crying anymore.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Don't Shoot, It's Only Me!|first=Bob|last=Hope|year=1990|publisher=Random House Publishers|authorlink=Bob Hope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calypso musician [[Roaring Lion]] wrote a tribute song in 1939 entitled &quot;Bing Crosby&quot;, in which he wrote: &quot;Bing has a way of singing with his very heart and soul / Which captivates the world / His millions of listeners never fail to rejoice / At his golden voice...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Giddins, 2001, pp. 427–428.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal''', usually known simply as the '''Basel Convention''', is an international [[treaty]] that was designed to reduce the movements of [[hazardous waste]] between nations, and specifically to prevent transfer of hazardous waste from [[developed countries|developed]] to [[Less Developed Countries|less developed countries]] (LDCs). It does not, however, address the movement of radioactive waste. The Convention is also intended to minimize the amount and [[toxicity]] of wastes generated, to ensure their environmentally sound management as closely as possible to the source of generation, and to assist LDCs in environmentally sound management of the hazardous and other wastes they generate.

The Convention was opened for signature on 22 March 1989, and entered into force on 5 May 1992. A list of parties to the Convention, and their ratification status, can be found on the Basel Secretariat's [http://www.basel.int/ratif/convention.htm web page]. Of the 175 parties to the Convention, only [[Afghanistan]], [[Haiti]], and the [[United States]] have signed the Convention but not yet [[ratification|ratified]] it.

==History==
With the tightening of environmental laws (for example,, [[RCRA]]) in developed nations in the 1970s, disposal costs for hazardous waste rose dramatically. At the same time, globalization of shipping made transboundary movement of waste more accessible, and many LDCs were desperate for foreign currency. Consequently, the trade in hazardous waste, particularly to LDCs, grew rapidly.

One of the incidents which led to the creation of the Basel Convention was the [[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|''Khian Sea'' waste disposal incident]], in which a ship carrying incinerator ash from the city of Philadelphia in the United States after having dumped half of its load on a beach in Haiti, was forced away where it sailed for many months, changing its name several times. Unable to unload the cargo in any port, the crew was believed to have dumped much of it at sea.

Another is the 1988 Koko case in which 5 ships transported 8,000 barrels of hazardous waste from Italy to the small town of Koko in Nigeria in exchange for $100 monthly rent which was paid to a Nigerian for the use of his farmland.

These practices have been deemed &quot;Toxic Colonialism&quot; by many developing countries.

At its most recent meeting, November 27–December 1, 2006, the Conference of the Parties of the Basel Agreement focused on issues of [[electronic waste]] and the dismantling of ships.

According to Maureen Walsh in &quot;The global trade in hazardous wastes: domestic and international attempts to cope with a growing crisis in waste management&quot; 42 Cath. U. Law Review 103 (1992), only around 4% of hazardous wastes that come from OECD countries are actually shipped across international borders. These wastes include, among others, chemical waste, radioactive waste, municipal solid waste, asbestos, incinerator ash, and old tires. Of internationally shipped waste that comes from developed countries,  more than half is shipped for recovery and the remainder for final disposal. 

Increased trade in recyclable materials has led to an increase in a market for used products such as computers. This market is valued in billions of dollars. At issue is the distinction when used computers stop being a &quot;commodity&quot; and become a &quot;waste&quot;.

==Definition of ''hazardous waste''==
[[Image:Batterien-centimeter-inch-ruler.png|thumb|right|4.5-Volt, D, C, AA, AAA, 9-Volt, '''SR41/AG3''', '''SR44/AG13''' cells are all recyclable in most countries.]]
[[File:Button cells and 9v cells (3).png|thumb|right|200px|Several sizes of button and coin cell. 2 9v batteries were added as a size comparison. Enlarge to see the button and coin cells’ size code markings. They are all recyclable in both the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]] amongst others.]]

A waste will fall under the scope of the Convention if it is within the category of wastes listed in Annex I of the Convention and it does exhibit one of the hazardous characteristics contained in Annex III.&lt;ref&gt;art 1 al a&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words it must both be listed and contain a characteristic such as being explosive, flammable, toxic, or corrosive.  The other way that a waste may fall under the scope of the Convention is if it is defined as or considered to be a hazardous waste under the laws of either the exporting country, the importing country, or and of the countries of transit.&lt;ref&gt;art 1 al b&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the term disposal is made in Article 2 al 4 and just refers to annex IV, which gives a list of operations which are understood as disposal or recovery. The examples of disposal are broad and include also recovery, recycling.

Annex II lists other wastes such as household wastes and residue that comes from incinerating household waste. 

Radioactive waste that is covered under other international control systems and wastes from the normal operation of ships is not covered.

Annex IX attempts to define &quot;commodities&quot; which are not considered wastes and which would be excluded.

==Obligations==
In addition to conditions on the import and export of the above wastes, there are stringent requirements for notice, consent and tracking for movement of wastes across national boundaries. It is of note that the Convention places a general prohibition on the exportation or importation of wastes between Parties and non-Parties. The exception to this rule is where the waste is subject to another treaty that does not take away from the Basel Convention. The United States is a notable non-Party to the Convention and has a number of such agreements for allowing the shipping of hazardous wastes to Basel Party countries. 

The OECD Council also has its own control system that governs the trans-boundary movement of hazardous materials between OECD member countries. This allows, among other things, the OECD countries to continue trading in wastes with countries like the United States that have not ratified the Basel Convention. 

Parties to the Convention must honor import bans of other Parties.

Article 4 of the Basel Convention calls for an overall reduction of waste generation. By encouraging countries to keep wastes within their boundaries and as close as possible to its source of generation, the internal pressures should provide incentives for waste reduction and pollution prevention.

The Convention states that illegal hazardous waste traffic is criminal but contains no enforcement provisions.

According to Article 12, Parties are directed to adopt a protocol that establishes liability rules and procedures that are appropriate for damage that comes from the movement of hazardous waste across borders.

==Basel Ban Amendment==
After the initial adoption of the Convention, some LDCs and environmental organizations argued that it did not go far enough. Many nations and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] argued for a total ban on shipment of all hazardous waste to LDCs. In particular, the original Convention did not prohibit waste exports to any location except [[Antarctica]] but merely required a notification and consent system known as &quot;prior informed consent&quot; or PIC. Further, many waste traders sought to exploit the good name of recycling and begin to justify all exports as moving to recycling destinations. Many believed a full ban was needed including exports for recycling. These concerns led to several regional waste trade bans, including the [[Bamako Convention]]. 

Lobbying at the 1995 Basel conference by LDCs, [[Greenpeace]] and key European countries such as Denmark, led to a decision to adopt the [[Basel Ban Amendment]] to the Basel Convention. Not yet in force, but considered morally binding by signatories, the Amendment prohibits the export of hazardous waste from a list of developed (mostly [[OECD]]) countries to developing countries. The Basel Ban applies to export for any reason, including [[recycling]]. An area of special concern for advocates of the Amendment was the sale of ships for salvage, [[shipbreaking]]. The Ban Amendment was strenuously opposed by a number of industry groups as well as nations including [[Australia]] and [[Canada]]. The number of ratification for the entry-into force of the Ban Amendment is under debate: Amendments to the convention enter into force after ratification of &quot;three-fourths of the Parties who accepted them&quot; [Art. 17.5]; so far, the Parties of the Basel Convention could not yet agree whether this would be three fourth of the Parties that were Party to the Basel Convention when the Ban was adopted, or three fourth of the current Parties of the Convention[see Report of COP 9 of the Basel Convention]. The status of the amendment ratifications can be found on the Basel Secretariat's [http://www.basel.int/ratif/ban-alpha.htm web page]. The [[European Union]] fully implemented the Basel Ban in its [[Waste Shipment Regulation]] ([[EWSR]]), making it legally binding in all EU member states. Norway and Switzerland have similarly fully implemented the Basel Ban in their legislation.

In the light of the blockage concerning the entry into force of the Ban amendment, Switzerland and Indonesia have launched a “Country-led Initiative” (CLI) to discuss in an informal manner a way forward to ensure that the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, especially to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, do not lead to an unsound management of hazardous wastes. This discussion aims at identifying and finding solutions to the reasons why hazardous wastes are still brought to countries that are not able to treat them in a safe manner. It is hoped that the CLI will contribute to the realization of the objectives of the Ban Amendment. The Basel Convention's website informs about the progress of this initiative [http://www.basel.int/convention/cli/index.html]

In [[computer programming]], '''BASIC''' (an [[acronym]] which stands for '''Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code''') is a family of [[high-level programming language]]s designed to be easy to use.

The original [[Dartmouth BASIC]] was designed in 1964 by [[John George Kemeny]] and [[Thomas Eugene Kurtz]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]], [[United States|USA]] to provide computer access to non-science students. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s tended to do. The language and its variants became widespread on [[microcomputer]]s in the late 1970s and 1980s.

BASIC remains popular to this day in a handful of highly modified [[programming language dialect|dialect]]s and new languages influenced by BASIC such as [[Microsoft Visual Basic]]. In 2006, 59% of developers for the [[.NET platform]] used [[Visual Basic .NET]] as their only programming language.&lt;ref&gt;http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080228115634/http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS5656359853.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Before the mid-1960s, [[computers]] were extremely expensive and used only for special-purpose tasks. A simple [[batch processing]] arrangement ran only a single &quot;job&quot; at a time, one after another. But during the 1960s faster and more affordable computers became available. With this extra processing power, computers would sometimes sit idle, without jobs to run.

Programming languages in the batch programming era tended to be designed, like the machines on which they ran, for specific purposes (such as [[scientific formula]] calculations or business data processing or eventually for [[text editor|text editing]]). Since even the newer, less expensive machines were still major investments, there was a strong tendency to consider efficiency to be the most important feature of a language. In general, these specialized languages were difficult to use and had widely disparate [[syntax]].

As prices decreased, the possibility of sharing computer access began to move from research labs to commercial use. Newer computer systems supported [[time-sharing]], a system which allows multiple users or processes to use the [[CPU]] and memory. In such a system the [[operating system]] alternates between running processes, giving each one running time on the CPU before switching to another. The machines had become fast enough that most users could feel they had the machine all to themselves. In theory, timesharing reduced the cost of computing tremendously, as a single machine could be shared among hundreds of users.

=== Early years: the mainframe and mini-computer era ===

The original BASIC language was designed in 1964 by [[John George Kemeny|John Kemeny]] and [[Thomas Eugene Kurtz|Thomas Kurtz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cis-alumni.org/TKurtz.html Thomas E. Kurtz - History of Programming Languages]&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented by a team of Dartmouth students under their direction. The acronym is tied to the name of an unpublished paper by Thomas Kurtz and is not a [[backronym]], as is sometimes suggested in older versions of [[The Jargon File]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/BASIC.html]&lt;/ref&gt; BASIC was designed to allow students to write programs for the [[Dartmouth Time-Sharing System]]. It was intended to address the complexity issues of older languages with a new language design specifically for the new class of users that time-sharing systems allowed—that is, a less technical user who did not have the mathematical background of the more traditional users and was not interested in acquiring it. Being able to use a computer to support teaching and research was quite novel at the time. In the following years, as other dialects of BASIC appeared, Kemeny and Kurtz's original BASIC dialect became known as ''[[Dartmouth BASIC]]''.

The eight design principles of BASIC were:
# Be easy for beginners to use.
# Be a [[general-purpose programming language]].
# Allow advanced features to be added for experts (while keeping the language simple for beginners).
# Be [[interactive]].
# Provide clear and friendly [[error message]]s.
# Respond quickly for small programs.
# Not to require an understanding of computer hardware.
# Shield the user from the operating system.

The language was based partly on [[Fortran|FORTRAN II]] and partly on [[ALGOL 60]], with additions to make it suitable for timesharing. (The features of other time-sharing systems such as [[JOSS]] and [[CORC]], and to a lesser extent [[LISP]], were also considered.) It had been preceded by other teaching-language experiments at Dartmouth such as the DARSIMCO (1956) and DOPE (1962 implementations of SAP and DART (1963) which was a simplified FORTRAN II). Initially, BASIC concentrated on supporting straightforward mathematical work, with [[matrix (math)|matrix]] arithmetic support from its initial implementation as a batch language and full string functionality being added by 1965. BASIC was first implemented on the [[GE-200 series|GE-265]] [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] which supported multiple [[computer terminal|terminals]]. At the time of its introduction, it was a [[compiler|compiled]] language. It was also quite efficient, beating FORTRAN II and ALGOL 60 implementations on the 265 at several fairly computationally intensive (at the time) programming problems such as numerical integration by [[Simpson's Rule]].

The designers of the language decided to make the compiler available free of charge so that the language would become widespread. They also made it available to high schools in the [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] area and put a considerable amount of effort into promoting the language. College preparatory schools such as [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] became part of this system (programs were stored on punch-cards) and future software architect [[Earl Killian]] developed an avid interest in computers in the early 1970s by using BASIC. As a result, knowledge of BASIC became relatively widespread (for a computer language) and BASIC was implemented by a number of manufacturers, becoming fairly popular on newer [[minicomputer]]s like the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series and the [[Data General Nova]]. The BASIC language was also central to the [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]] system in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the [[Pick operating system]]. In these instances the language tended to be implemented as an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], instead of (or in addition to) a [[compiler]].

Several years after its release, highly respected computer professionals, notably [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]], expressed their opinions that the use of [[GOTO]] statements, which existed in many languages including BASIC, promoted poor programming practices. In a 1968 letter, Dutch computer scientist [[Edsger Dijkstra]] considered programming languages using GOTO statements for program structuring purposes harmful for the productivity of the programmer as well as the quality of the resulting code (&quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot;, ''Communications of the ACM'' Volume 11, 147-148. 1968).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/&lt;/ref&gt; The letter, which contributed the phrase &quot;''[[considered harmful]]''&quot; to programming jargon, did not mention any particular programming language; instead it states that the overuse of GOTO is damaging and gives technical reasons why this should be so. In a 1975 tongue-in-cheek article, &quot;How do We Tell Truths that Might Hurt&quot;, ''Sigplan Notices'' Volume 17 No. 5, Dijkstra gives a list of uncomfortable &quot;truths&quot;, including his opinion of several programming languages of the time. BASIC is one of his targets (&quot;It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, some also derided BASIC as too slow (most interpreted versions are slower than equivalent compiled versions) or too simple (many versions, especially for small computers, left out important features and capabilities).

=== Explosive growth: the home computer era ===
[[Image:Msxbasic.png|thumb|[[MSX BASIC]] version 3.0]]
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2010}}

Notwithstanding the language's use on several minicomputers, it was the introduction of the [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] [[Altair 8800]] &quot;kit&quot; [[microcomputer]] in 1975 that provided BASIC a path to universality. Most programming languages required suitable text editors, large amounts of memory and available disk space, whereas the early microcomputers had no resident editors, limited memory and often substituted recordable audio tapes for disk space. All these issues allowed a language like BASIC, in its interpreted form with a built-in code editor, to operate within those constraints.

BASIC also had the advantage that it was fairly well known to the young designers and computer hobbyists who took an interest in microcomputers, and generally worked in the electronics industries of the day. Kemeny and Kurtz's earlier proselytizing paid off in this respect and the few hobbyists' journals of the era were filled with columns that made mentions of the language or focused entirely on one version compared to others.

One of the first to appear for the [[Intel 8080|8080]] machines like the Altair was [[Tiny BASIC programming language|Tiny BASIC]], a simple BASIC implementation originally written by [[Li-Chen Wang|Dr. Li-Chen Wang]], and then ported onto the Altair by Dennis Allison at the request of [[Bob Albrecht]] (who later founded [[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]). The Tiny BASIC design and the full source code were published in 1976 in [[DDJ]].

In 1975, MITS released [[Altair BASIC]], developed by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] as the company Micro-Soft, which grew into today's corporate giant, [[Microsoft]]. The first Altair version was co-written by Gates, Allen, and [[Monte Davidoff]]. Versions of [[Microsoft BASIC]] (also known then, and most widely as '''M BASIC''' or '''[[MBASIC]]''') was soon bundled with the original [[floppy disk]]-based [[CP/M]] computers, which became widespread in small business environments. As the popularity of BASIC on CP/M spread, newer computer designs also introduced their own version of the language, or had Micro-Soft port its version to their platform.

When three major new computers were introduced in what [[Byte Magazine]] would later call the &quot;1977 Trinity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.byte.com/art/9509/sec7/art15.htm |title = Most Important Companies |accessdate = 2008-06-10 |author = |month = September | year = 1995 |work = [[Byte Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; all three had BASIC as their primary programming language and operating environment. [[Commodore Business Machines]] paid a one-time fee for an unlimited license to a version of Micro-Soft BASIC that was ported to the [[MOS 6502]] in their [[PET computer|PET]] computer, while [[Apple II family|Apple II]] and [[TRS-80]] both introduced new, largely similar versions of the language. The similarities are striking because the first 50 [[token]]s, used for conserving memory, were all the same. As new companies entered the field, additional versions were added that subtly changed the BASIC family. The [[Atari 8-bit family]] had their own [[Atari BASIC]] that was modified in order to fit on an 8 kB ROM cartridge. The [[BBC]] published [[BBC BASIC]], developed for them by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]], incorporating many extra structuring keywords. Most of the [[home computer]]s of the 1980s had a [[read-only memory|ROM]]-resident BASIC interpreter, allowing the machines to boot directly into BASIC. Because of this legacy, there are more [[programming language dialect|dialects]] of BASIC than there are of any other programming language.

As the popularity of BASIC grew in this period, magazines (such as ''[[Creative Computing|Creative Computing Magazine]]'' in the US) published complete source code in BASIC for games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC's straightforward nature, it was a simple matter to [[Type-in program|type in the code]] from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Correcting the publishing errors that frequently occurred in magazine listings was an educational exercise in itself.

BASIC source code was also published in fully-fledged books: the seminal examples being [[David H. Ahl|David Ahl]]'s [[BASIC Computer Games]] series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames Table of Contents: BASIC Computer Games&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames Table of Contents: More BASIC Computer Games]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames Table of Contents: Big Computer Games]&lt;/ref&gt; Later packages, such as [[Learn to Program BASIC]] would also have gaming as an introductory focus.

[[File:IBM Cassette BASIC.png|thumb|[[IBM Cassette BASIC]] 1.10]]

As early as 1979 Microsoft was in negotiations with IBM to supply their IBM PCs with an [[IBM Cassette BASIC]] (BASIC C) inside BIOS. Microsoft sold several versions of BASIC for [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC-DOS]] including [[IBM Disk BASIC]] (BASIC D), [[IBM BASICA]] (BASIC A), [[Microsoft GW-BASIC interpreter|GW-BASIC]] (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM's ROM) and [[QuickBASIC]]. Turbo [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-publisher [[Borland]] published [[Turbo BASIC programming language|Turbo BASIC]] 1.0 in 1985 (successor versions are still being marketed by the original author under the name [[PowerBASIC programming language|PowerBASIC]]). Microsoft wrote the windowing based [[AmigaBASIC]] that was supplied with version 1.1 of the pre-emptive multitasking GUI Amiga computers (late 1985/ early 1986), although the product unusually did not bear any Microsoft marks.

These languages introduced many extensions to the original home computer BASIC, such as improved [[string manipulation]] and graphics support, access to the [[file system]] and additional [[data types]]. More important were the facilities for [[structured programming]], including additional [[control structures]] and proper [[subroutine]]s supporting [[local variable]]s. The new graphical features of these languages also helped lay the groundwork for PC [[video game|video gaming]], with BASIC programs like [[DONKEY.BAS]] showing what the PC could do.

However, by the latter half of the 1980s newer computers were far more capable with more resources. At the same time, computers had progressed from a hobbyist interest to tools used primarily for applications written by others, and programming became less important for most users. BASIC started to recede in importance, though numerous versions remained available. Compiled BASIC or [[CBASIC]] is still used in many [[IBM 4690 OS]] point of sale systems.

BASIC's fortunes reversed once again with the introduction of [[Visual Basic]] by Microsoft. It is somewhat difficult to consider this language to be BASIC, because of the major shift in its orientation towards an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] and [[event-driven programming|event-driven]] perspective. The only significant similarity to older BASIC dialects was familiar syntax. Syntax itself no longer &quot;fully defined&quot; the language, since much development was done using &quot;drag and drop&quot; methods without exposing all code for commonly used objects such as buttons and scrollbars to the developer. While this could be considered an evolution of the language, few of the distinctive features of early [[Dartmouth BASIC]], such as [[line number]]s and the &lt;code&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt; keyword, remain (although Visual Basic still uses &lt;code&gt;INPUT&lt;/code&gt; to read data from files, and &lt;code&gt;INPUTBOX&lt;/code&gt; is available for direct user input; line numbers can also optionally be used in all VB versions, even VB.NET, albeit they cannot be used in certain places, for instance before &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt;).

Ironically given the origin of BASIC as a &quot;beginner's&quot; language, and apparently even to the surprise of many at Microsoft who still initially marketed Visual Basic or &quot;VB&quot; as a language for hobbyists, the language had come into widespread use for small custom business applications shortly after the release of VB version 3.0, which is widely considered the first relatively stable version. While many advanced programmers still scoffed at its use, VB met the needs of small businesses efficiently wherever processing speed was less of a concern than easy development. By that time, computers running Windows 3.1 had become fast enough that many business-related processes could be completed &quot;in the blink of an eye&quot; even using a &quot;slow&quot; language, as long as massive amounts of data were not involved. Many small business owners found they could create their own small yet useful applications in a few evenings to meet their own specialized needs. Eventually, during the lengthy lifetime of VB3, knowledge of Visual Basic had become a marketable job skill. The language, like [[QBasic]] before it, also became a favourite for amateur game development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[File:TriBasicExample.png|thumb|Three modern Basic variants: [[Mono (software)|Mono]] Basic, [[OpenOffice.org Basic]] and [[Gambas]]]]

Many BASIC dialects have also sprung up in the last few years, including [[Bywater BASIC]] and [[True BASIC]] (the direct successor to Dartmouth BASIC from a company controlled by Kurtz). One notable variant is [[RealBasic]] which although first released in 1998 for Macintosh computers, has since 2005 fully compiled programs for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and 32-bit x86 Linux, from the same object-oriented source code. RealBasic compiled programs may execute natively on these platforms as services, consoles or windowed applications. However in keeping with BASIC tradition, single-platform hobbyist versions are also still maintained. Many other BASIC variants and adaptations have been written by hobbyists, equipment developers, and others, as it is a relatively simple language to develop translators for. More complex examples of free software BASIC implementations (development tools and compilers) include [[Gambas]] and [[FreeBASIC]].

The ubiquity of BASIC interpreters on personal computers was such that textbooks once included simple &quot;Try It In BASIC&quot; exercises that encouraged students to experiment with mathematical and computational concepts on classroom or home computers. Futurist and sci-fi writer [[David Brin]] mourned the loss of ubiquitous BASIC in a 2006 ''Salon'' article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2006/09/14/basic/index_np.html Why Johnny Can't Code], By David Brin, Sept. 14, 2006, Salon Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax ==
=== Typical BASIC keywords ===
{{Prose|date=March 2011}}

; Data manipulation:
* LET: assigns a value (which may be the result of an [[Expression (programming)|expression]]) to a variable.
* DATA: holds a list of values which are assigned sequentially using the READ Command.

; Program flow control:
* IF ... THEN ... ELSE: used to perform comparisons or make decisions.
* FOR ... TO ... {STEP} ... NEXT: repeat a section of code a given number of times. A variable that acts as a counter is available within the [[Control flow#Loops|loop]].
* WHILE ... WEND and REPEAT ... UNTIL: repeat a section of code while the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after.
* DO ... LOOP {WHILE} or {UNTIL}: repeat a section of code Forever or While/Until the specified condition is true . The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after.
* GOTO: jumps to a numbered or labelled line in the program.
* GOSUB: temporarily jumps to a numbered or labelled line, returning to the following line after encountering the RETURN Command. This is used to implement [[subroutine]]s.
* ON ... GOTO/GOSUB: chooses where to jump based on the specified conditions. See [[Switch statement]] for other forms.

; Input and output:
* PRINT: displays a message on the screen or other output device.
* INPUT: asks the user to enter the value of a variable. The statement may include a prompt message.
* TAB or AT: sets the position where the next character will be shown on the screen or printed on paper.

; Miscellaneous:
* REM: holds a programmer's comment; often used to give a title to the program and to help identify the purpose of a given section of code.

=== Data types and variables ===

Minimal versions of BASIC had only integer variables and single-letter variable names. More powerful versions of BASIC offered floating-point arithmetic, and variables could be labelled with names six or more characters long.

[[String (computer science)|String]] variables are usually distinguished in many microcomputer dialects by having $ suffixed to their name, and string values are typically enclosed in quotation marks.

Arrays in BASIC could contain integers, floating point or string variables.

Some dialects of BASIC supported [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices and matrix operations]], useful for the solution of sets of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. These dialects would support matrix operations such as assignment, addition, multiplication (of compatible matrix types), and evaluation of a determinant. Microcomputer dialects often lacked this data type and required a programmer to provide subroutines to carry out equvalent operations.

=== Examples ===

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
&lt;!-- needs an example of dartmouth basic --&gt;

New BASIC programmers on a home computer might start with a simple program similar to the [[Hello world program]] made famous by [[Kernighan and Ritchie]]. This generally involves simple use of the language's PRINT statement to display the message (such as the programmer's name) to the screen. Often an [[infinite loop]] was used to fill the display with the message. Most first generation BASIC languages such as [[MSX BASIC]] and [[GW-BASIC]] supported simple data types, loop cycles and arrays. The following example is written for GW-BASIC, but will work in most versions of BASIC with minimal changes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;QBasic&quot;&gt;
10 INPUT &quot;What is your name: &quot;, U$
20 PRINT &quot;Hello &quot;; U$
30 INPUT &quot;How many stars do you want: &quot;, N
40 S$ = &quot;&quot;
50 FOR I = 1 TO N
60 S$ = S$ + &quot;*&quot;
70 NEXT I
80 PRINT S$
90 INPUT &quot;Do you want more stars? &quot;, A$
100 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN GOTO 90
110 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)
120 IF A$ = &quot;Y&quot; OR A$ = &quot;y&quot; THEN GOTO 30
130 PRINT &quot;Goodbye &quot;; U$
140 END
&lt;/source&gt;
The resulting dialog might resemble:

 What is your name: Mike
 Hello Mike
 How many stars do you want: 7
 *******
 Do you want more stars? yes
 How many stars do you want: 3
 ***
 Do you want more stars? no
 Goodbye Mike

Second generation BASICs (for example [[QuickBASIC]] and [[PowerBASIC]]) introduced a number of features into the language, primarily related to structured and procedure-oriented programming. Usually, [[line number]]ing is omitted from the language and replaced with [[Label (programming language)|label]]s (for [[GOTO]]) and [[Subroutine|procedure]]s to encourage easier and more flexible design.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBvsQB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/73084|title=Differences Between GW-BASIC and QBasic|date=2003-05-12|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;QBasic&quot;&gt;
INPUT &quot;What is your name: &quot;, UserName$
PRINT &quot;Hello &quot;; UserName$
DO
  INPUT &quot;How many stars do you want: &quot;, NumStars
  Stars$ = STRING$(NumStars, &quot;*&quot;)
  PRINT Stars$
  DO
    INPUT &quot;Do you want more stars? &quot;, Answer$
  LOOP UNTIL Answer$ &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
  Answer$ = LEFT$(Answer$, 1)
LOOP WHILE UCASE$(Answer$) = &quot;Y&quot;
PRINT &quot;Goodbye &quot;; UserName$
&lt;/source&gt;

Third generation BASIC dialects such as [[Visual Basic]], [[REALbasic]], [[StarOffice Basic]] and [[BlitzMax]] introduced features to support object-oriented and event-driven programming paradigm. Most built-in procedures and functions now represented as ''methods'' of standard objects rather than ''operators''.

The following example is in [[Visual Basic .NET]]:

This is a '''list of the [[emperor]]s of the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman or Byzantine Empire]]'''. This list does not include numerous co-emperors who never attained sole or senior status as rulers, nor the various usurpers or rebels who claimed the imperial title (on whom see [[List of Byzantine usurpers]]).

This list begins with [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Roman emperor, who founded [[Constantinople]], and who was regarded by the later Byzantine emperors as the model ruler. [[Diocletian]] before him is sometimes considered the first &quot;Byzantine&quot; emperor in a political sense, as he replaced the republican trappings of the office with a straightforward [[autocracy]], marking the transition from the [[Principate]] to the absolutist [[Dominate]], a more typically oriental and Hellenistic form of monarchy that would characterize the Byzantine Empire. It was under Constantine however that the major characteristics of the Byzantine state emerged: a Roman polity centered at Constantinople and culturally dominated by the Greek East, with Christianity as the state religion.

All Byzantine Emperors regarded themselves as Roman Emperors,&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, Richard. &quot;The Byzantine Empire.&quot; Middle Ages. World Cultures. 4 June 2007 [http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/BYZ.HTM].&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;Byzantine&quot; being coined firstly by Western historiography much later, in the 16th century. Although the barbarian West recognized the Eastern Empire's claim to the Roman legacy for several centuries, on 25 December 800, [[Pope Leo III]] crowned [[List of Frankish kings|King of Franks]] [[Charlemagne]] as the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] (which eventually led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) due to uneasy relations with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox East]], an act which was much resented by the Byzantines. This happened after the coronation of [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]], who, as a woman, was not recognised by the [[Pope|Pope of Rome]] to have a right to the throne.

The title of all Emperors listed preceding [[Heraclius]] was officially ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', although various other titles such as ''[[Dominus (title)|Dominus]]'' were used as well. For official purposes, their names were preceded by ''[[Imperator]] [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and followed by ''Augustus''. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'' (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant generally &quot;king&quot;, &quot;[[Monarch|sovereign]]&quot; but now was used in place of '''Imperator''. Following the establishment of a rival Empire in Western Europe (the [[Holy Roman Empire]]), the title ''[[Autokrator]]'' (Gr. Αυτοκράτωρ) was also increasingly used. In the later centuries of the Empire, the emperor could be often referred to by Western Christians as the &quot;Emperor of the Greeks,&quot; though they still considered themselves &quot;Roman&quot; Emperors.  Towards the end of the Empire, they referred to themselves as &quot;[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans.&quot;

[[Image:Sensitive-dependency.svg|thumb|300px|Point [[attractor]]s in 2D [[phase space]].]]

In [[chaos theory]], the '''butterfly effect''' is the ''sensitive dependence on initial conditions''; where a small change at one place in a [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences to a later state. For example, the presence or absence of a butterfly flapping its wings could lead to creation or absence of a hurricane.

Although the butterfly effect may appear to be an esoteric and unusual behavior, it is exhibited by very simple systems: for example, a [[ball]] placed at the crest of a hill might roll into any of several valleys depending on slight differences in initial position.

The term &quot;butterfly effect&quot; itself is related to the meteorological work of [[Edward Lorenz]], who popularized the term.

The butterfly effect is a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in fiction when presenting scenarios involving [[time travel]] and with &quot;what if&quot; cases where one storyline diverges at the moment of a seemingly minor event resulting in two significantly different outcomes.

==Theory==
[[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Recurrence]], the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather), since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

==Origin of the concept and the term==

The term &quot;butterfly effect&quot; itself is related to the work of [[Edward Lorenz]], and it is based in [[chaos theory]] and sensitive dependence on initial conditions, already described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1890.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolframscience.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c Some Historical Notes: History of Chaos Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, say in meteorology.
In 1898,&lt;ref name=&quot;wolframscience.com&quot;/&gt; [[Jacques Hadamard]] noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature, and [[Pierre Duhem]] discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolframscience.com&quot;/&gt; The idea that one [[butterfly]] could eventually have a far-reaching [[ripple effect]] on subsequent historic events seems first to have appeared in &quot;[[A Sound of Thunder]]&quot;, a 1952 short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] about time travel ([[Butterfly_effect_in_popular_culture#Literature_and_print|see Literature and print here]]) although Lorenz made the term popular. In 1961, Lorenz was using a numerical computer model to rerun a weather prediction, when, as a shortcut on a number in the sequence, he entered the decimal .506 instead of entering the full .506127. The result was a completely different weather scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mathis |first=Nancy |title=Storm Warning: The Story of a Killer Tornado |page=x |location= |publisher=Touchstone |year=2007 |isbn=0743280532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz published his findings in a 1963 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|year=1963|month=March|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=3 June 2010|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] noting{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;!-- verbatim citation does not appear in &quot;Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow&quot; --&gt; that &quot;One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a [[Gull|seagull]]'s  wings could change the course of weather forever.&quot;  Later speeches and papers by Lorenz used the more poetic [[butterfly]].  According to Lorenz, when Lorenz failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title. Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clearnightsky.com/node/428|title=Butterfly Effects - Variations on a Meme|work=[http://www.clearnightsky.com clearnightsky.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different.  While the butterfly does not &quot;cause&quot; the tornado in the sense of providing the energy for the tornado, it does &quot;cause&quot; it in the sense that the flap of its wings is an essential part of the initial conditions resulting in a tornado, and without that flap that particular tornado would not have existed.

|colspan=3| These figures show two segments of the three-dimensional evolution of two trajectories (one in blue, the other in yellow) for the same period of time in the [[Lorenz attractor]] starting at two initial points that differ only by 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; in the x-coordinate. Initially, the two trajectories seem coincident, as indicated by the small difference between the ''z'' coordinate of the blue and yellow trajectories, but for ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;23 the difference is as large as the value of the trajectory.  The final position of the cones indicates that the two trajectories are no longer coincident at ''t''=30.

==Mathematical definition==
A [[dynamical system]]  displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate. The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If ''M'' is the state space for the map &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt; displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any δ&gt;0, there are y in ''M'', with &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(x, y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^\tau(x), f^\tau(y)) &gt; exp(a\tau) d(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].

==Examples ==

The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of weather; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in [[semiclassical]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic [[Kepler problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Postmodern Quantum Mechanics |first=E.

Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different Hamiltonians.  They investigate the level of sensitivity of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Quantum Chaotic Environments, the Butterfly Effect, and Decoherence |first=Zbyszek P. |last=Karkuszewski |first2=Christopher |last2=Jarzynski |first3=Wojciech H. |last3=Zurek |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=89 |issue=17 |year=2002 |pages=170405 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.170405 |bibcode=2002PhRvL..89q0405K|arxiv = quant-ph/0111002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poulin et al. present a quantum algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which “measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected to slightly different dynamics.” They consider fidelity decay to be “the closest quantum analog to the (purely classical) butterfly effect.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Poulin |first=David |last2=Blume-Kohout |first2=Robin |last3=Laflamme |first3=Raymond |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Ollivier |first4=Harold |year=2004 |title=Exponential Speedup with a Single Bit of Quantum Information: Measuring the Average Fidelity Decay |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=92 |issue=17 |pages=177906 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.177906 |bibcode=2004PhRvL..92q7906P|arxiv = quant-ph/0310038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given [[Hamiltonian system]], the [[quantum butterfly]] effect considers the effect of a small change in the [[Hamiltonian system]] with a given initial position and velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;iqc.ca&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=A Rough Guide to Quantum Chaos |first=David |last=Poulin |url=http://www.iqc.ca/publications/tutorials/chaos.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=A. |last=Peres |title=Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods |publisher=Kluwer Academic |location=Dordrecht |year=1995 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This quantum butterfly effect has been demonstrated experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Quantum amplifier: Measurement with entangled spins |first=Jae-Seung |last=Lee |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=A.

'''Borland Software Corporation''' is a [[Computer software|software]] company first headquartered in [[Scotts Valley, California]], [[Cupertino, California]] and finally [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;austinhq&quot;&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.borland.com/us/company/news/press_releases/2007/04_16_07_borland_to_relocate_corporate_headquarters.html|date=April 16, 2007|publisher=Borland|title=Borland to Relocate Corporate Headquarters to Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now a [[Micro Focus]] subsidiary. It was founded in 1983 by Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, Mogens Glad and [[Philippe Kahn]].

==History==
===The 1980s: Foundations===
Three Danish citizens, Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, and Mogens Glad, founded Borland Ltd. in August 1981 to develop products like Word Index for the [[CP/M]] operating system using an off-the-shelf company. However, response to the company's products at the CP/M-82 show in San Francisco showed that a U.S. company would be needed to reach the American market. They met [[Philippe Kahn]], who had just moved to Silicon Valley, and who had been a key developer of the [[Micral]]. The three Danes had embarked, at first successfully, on marketing software first from Denmark, and later from Ireland, before running into some challenges at the time when they met Philippe Kahn. The partnership seems to have benefited all involved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Philippe Kahn was at all times Chairman, President, and CEO of Borland Inc. from its inception in 1983 until he left in 1995. Main shareholders at the incorporation of Borland were Niels Jensen (250,000 shares), Ole Henriksen (160,000), Mogens Glad (100,000), and Philippe Kahn (80,000).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Borland successfully launched a series of blockbusters that included [[Turbo Pascal]], [[SideKick]], SuperKey, and Lightning, all developed in Denmark. According to the London IPO filings, the management team was Philippe Kahn as President, Spencer Ozawa as VP of Operations, Marie Bourget as CFO, and Spencer Leyton as VP of business development, while all software development was continuing to take place in Denmark and later London as the Danish co-founders moved there. While the Danes remained majority shareholders, board members included Philippe Kahn, Tim Berry, John Nash, and David Heller. With the assistance of John Nash and David Heller, both British members of the Borland Board, the company was taken public on London's Unlisted Securities Market (USM) in 1986. [[Schroders]] was the lead investment banker.

A first US IPO followed in 1989 after Ben Rosen joined the Borland board with [[Goldman Sachs]] as the lead banker and a second offering in 1991 with Lazard as the lead banker. All offerings were very successful and over-subscribed.

Borland developed a series of well-regarded software development tools. Its first product was Turbo Pascal in 1983, developed by [[Anders Hejlsberg]] (who later developed .NET and C# for Microsoft) and before Borland acquired the product sold in Scandinavia under the name of Compas Pascal. 1984 saw the launch of SideKick, a time organization, notebook, and calculator utility, notable for being a [[Terminate and Stay Resident]] (TSR) program.

In 1985 Borland acquired Analytica and its Reflex database product. The engineering team of Analytica, managed by [[Brad Silverberg]] and including Reflex co-founder [[Adam Bosworth]], became the core of Borland's engineering team in the USA. Brad Silverberg was VP of engineering until he left in early 1990 to head up the Personal Systems division at [[Microsoft]]. Adam Bosworth initiated and headed up the [[Quattro Pro|Quattro]] project until moving to Microsoft later in 1990 to take over the project which eventually became [[Microsoft Access|Access]].

In 1987 Borland purchased Wizard Systems and incorporated portions of the Wizard C technology into [[Turbo C]]. Bob Jarvis, the author of Wizard C became a Borland employee. Turbo C was released on May 18, 1987 and an estimated 100,000 copies were shipped in the first month of its release. This apparently drove a wedge between Borland and Niels Jensen and the other members of his team who had been working on a brand new series of compilers at their London development centre. An agreement was reached and they spun off a company called Jensen &amp; Partners International(JPI), later [[TopSpeed]]. JPI first launched a MS-DOS compiler named JPI Modula-2, that later became TopSpeed Modula-2, and followed up with TopSpeed C, TopSpeed C++ and TopSpeed Pascal compilers for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. The TopSpeed compiler technology exists today as the underlying technology of the [[Clarion (programming language)|Clarion]] 4GL programming language, a Windows development tool.

In September 1987 Borland purchased Ansa-Software, including their [[Borland Paradox|Paradox]] (version 2.0) [[database]] management tool. Richard Schwartz, CEO of Ansa, became Borland's CTO and Ben Rosen joined the Borland board.

The [[Quattro Pro]] spreadsheet was launched in 1989 with, at the time, a notable improvement and charting capabilities. Lotus Development, under the leadership of [[Jim Manzi]] sued Borland for copyright infringement (see &quot;[[look and feel]]&quot;). The litigation brought forward Borland's open standards position as opposed to Lotus' closed approach. Borland, under Kahn's leadership took a position of principle and announced that they would defend against Lotus' legal position and &quot;fight for programmer's rights&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} After 6 years of litigation, the United States Supreme Court validated Borland's position and Lotus lost the case.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Additionally, Borland was known for its practical and creative approach towards [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]] and [[intellectual property]] (IP), introducing its &quot;Borland no-nonsense license agreement&quot;. This allowed the developer/user to utilize its products &quot;just like a book&quot;; he or she was allowed to make multiple copies of a program, as long as only one copy was in use at any point in time.

===The 1990s: Rise and change===
In September 1991 Borland purchased [[Ashton-Tate]], bringing the [[dBase]] and [[InterBase]] databases to the house, in an all stock transaction. Competition with Microsoft was fierce. [[Microsoft]] launched the competing database [[Microsoft Access]] and bought the dBase clone [[FoxPro]] in 1992, undercutting Borland's prices. During the early 1990s Borland's implementation of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] outsold Microsoft's. Borland survived as a company, but no longer had the dominance in software tools that it once had. It has gone through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, now a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.

The internal problems that arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were a large part of the fall. Ashton-Tate's product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compuvision.info/delayed-graphical-products-put-dent-in-borlands-image.html Delayed Graphical Products Put Dent in Borland’s Image], PC Week, April 20, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Borland had had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the [[ObjectVision]] team, redeployed) headed by [[Bill Turpin]] to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase and dBASE never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

A change in market conditions also contributed to Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an excellent job marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technical folks to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.

During 1993 Borland explored ties with [[WordPerfect]] as a possible way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft's nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows. The eventual joint company effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant in-roads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought by Novell. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and Paradox to [[Novell]] for $140 million in cash,{{Dubious|date=November 2008}} repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.

[[Philippe Kahn]] and the Borland board came to a disagreement on how to focus the company, and Philippe Kahn resigned as Chairman, CEO and President of Borland, a position he had held for 12 years, in January 1995. However, the parting was amicable as Kahn remained on the Borland board until November 7, 1996, when he resigned from that position.&lt;ref name=&quot;KahnBoard&quot;&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borland named [[Gary Wetsel]] as CEO, but he resigned in July 1996. [[William F. Miller]] was interim CEO until September of that year, when [[Whitney G. Lynn]] became interim president and CEO and then continued to have a succession of CEOs including [[Dale Fuller]] and [[Tod Nielsen]].

[[Philippe Kahn]] co-founded [[Starfish Software]] in 1994 and pioneered wireless synchronization. The company is now owned by [[Nokia]]. Kahn then founded [[LightSurf]] in 1998.

The [[Borland Delphi|Delphi 1]] [[rapid application development]] (RAD) environment was launched in 1995, under the leadership of [[Anders Hejlsberg]].

In 1996 Borland acquired Open Environment Corp (OEC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18275531.html Borland to Acquire Open Environment Corporation] ''Business Wire'', May 13, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; a Cambridge based company founded by [[John J. Donovan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/dsVQy.93Hk.c.htm Acqusition Press Release] ''SEC'', May 13, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Inprise years, and name changes===
On November 25, 1996, [[Del Yocam]] was hired as Borland CEO and Chairman.

In 1997, Borland sold [[Paradox (database)|Paradox]] to [[Corel]],{{Dubious|date=November 2008}} but—importantly—retained all development rights for the core [[BDE]].  In November 1997, Borland acquired [[Visigenic]], a middleware company that was focused on implementations of [[CORBA]].

On April 29, 1998, Borland refocused its efforts on targeting enterprise applications development, and went through a name change to Inprise Corporation (the name came from the slogan ''Integrating the Enterprise''). The idea was to integrate Borland's tools, [[Borland Delphi|Delphi]], [[C++ Builder]], and [[JBuilder]] with enterprise environment software, including Visigenic's implementations of CORBA, [[Visibroker]] for C++ and Java, and the new emerging product, [[Application Server]].

For a number of years (both before and during the Inprise name) Borland suffered from serious financial losses and very poor public image. When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland had gone out of business.
In March 1999, dBase was sold to KSoft, Inc. which was soon renamed to dBASE Inc. (In 2004 dBASE Inc. was renamed to dataBased Intelligence, Inc.).

In 1999, in the middle of Borland's identity crisis, Dale L. Fuller replaced CEO [[Del Yocam]]. At this time Fuller's title was &quot;interim president and CEO.&quot; The &quot;interim&quot; was dropped in December 2000.  [[Keith Gottfried]] served in senior executive positions with the company from 2000 to 2004.

A proposed merger between Inprise and Corel was announced in February 2000, aimed at producing [[Linux]] based products. The scheme was abandoned when Corel's shares fell and it became clear that there was really no strategic fit.

[[InterBase|InterBase 6.0]] was made available as an [[open source]] product in July 2000.

===Borland reborn in name and fame===
In January 2001, the Inprise name was abandoned and the company became &quot;Borland&quot; once more.

Under the Borland name and a new management team headed by President and CEO Dale L. Fuller, a now-smaller and profitable Borland refocused on Delphi, and created a version of Delphi and C++ Builder for Linux, both under the name [[Kylix programming tool|Kylix]]. This brought Borland's expertise in [[Integrated Development Environment]]s to the Linux platform for the first time. Kylix was launched in 2001.

Plans to spin off the [[InterBase]] division as a separate company were abandoned after Borland and the people who were to run the new company could not agree on terms for the separation. Borland stopped open source releases of InterBase and has developed and sold new versions at a fast pace.

Delphi 6 became the first Integrated Development Environment to support web services. All of the company's development platforms now support web services.

[[CSharpBuilder|C#Builder]] was released in 2003 as a native [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] development tool, competing with [[Visual Studio .NET]]. As of the 2005 release, C#Builder, Delphi for Win32, and Delphi for .NET have been combined into a single IDE called &quot;Borland Developer Studio&quot; (though the combined IDE is still popularly known as &quot;Delphi&quot;). In late 2002 Borland purchased design tool vendor TogetherSoft and tool publisher [[Starbase Corporation|Starbase]], makers of the [[StarTeam]] configuration management tool and the [[CaliberRM]] requirements management tool. The latest releases of [[JBuilder]] and Delphi integrate these tools to give developers a broader set of tools for development.

Former CEO Dale Fuller was fired in July 2005 after a series of financial and commercial blunders, but remained on the board of directors. Former COO Scott Arnold took the title of interim president and chief executive officer until November 8, 2005, when it was announced that [[Tod Nielsen]] would take over as CEO effective November 9, 2005.  Nielsen remained with the company until January 2009, when he accepted the position of [[Chief Operating Officer]] at [[VMware]];&lt;ref name=cnetnews20090106&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10787_3-10133309-60.html ''VMware hires away Borland CEO''], CNet News, January 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  CFO Erik Prusch then took over as Acting President and CEO.&lt;ref name=cnetnews20090106/&gt;

In October 2005, Borland acquired Legadero, in order to add its IT Management and Governance (ITM&amp;G) suite, called Tempo, to the Borland product line.

On February 8, 2006, Borland announced the divestiture of their [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] division, including [[Borland Delphi|Delphi]], [[JBuilder]], and [[InterBase]]. At the same time they announced the planned acquisition of [[Segue Software]], a maker of software test and quality tools, in order to concentrate on Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). The new spinoff is called [[CodeGear]].

On March 20, 2006, Borland announced its acquisition of Gauntlet Systems, a provider of technology that screens software under development for quality and security.

On November 14, 2006, Borland announced its decision to separate the Developer Tools Group into a wholly owned subsidiary focused on maximizing developer productivity. The newly formed operation, CodeGear, will be responsible for advancing the four primary product lines formerly associated with Borland’s Integrated Development Environment (IDE) business.

In early 2007 Borland rolled out a new company tagline, branding and go to market focus around Open Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) – defining it as the segment of the ALM market in which vendors’ solutions are flexible enough to support a customer’s specific processes, tools and platforms.

In April 2007, Borland announced that it would be relocating its headquarters and R&amp;D facilities to [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;austinhq&quot; /&gt; It also has development centers at [[Singapore]], [[Santa Ana, California]], and [[Linz]], Austria.

On May 7, 2008, Borland announced the sale of CodeGear division to [[Embarcadero Technologies]] for an expected $23 million price and $7 million in CodeGear accounts receivables retained by Borland.

On May 6, 2009, the company announced it was to be acquired by [[Micro Focus]] for $75 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxbusiness.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/technology/borland-bought-micro-focus--mln/ Foxbusiness.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The transaction was approved by Borland shareholders on July 22, 2009, with Micro Focus acquiring the company for $1.50/share.&lt;ref name=&quot;shareholderapproval&quot;&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20090722006307&amp;newsLang=en|date=July 22, 2009|publisher=BusinessWire|title=Borland Announces Stockholder Approval of Micro Focus Merger Agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Micro Focus shareholder approval and the required corporate filings, the transaction was completed in late July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://microfocus.com/Solutions/TestingASQ/WelcomeBorlandCustomers/PressRelease.asp ''Micro Focus International plc completes acquisition of Borland Software Corporation''] Micro Focus press release, undated, retrieved July 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The ''San Jose Mercury News'' reported that, &quot;Philippe Kahn, who founded the company in 1983 and headed it until 1994, called the deal a 'great fit and synergism for both companies and excellent outcome for employees, customers and shareholders.'&quot;&lt;ref name=MercuryNews&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/centralcoast/ci_12309355 ''Borland bought by Micro Focus for $75M''], ''San Jose Mercury News'', May 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
