===Sex-selective===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion}}

[[Medical ultrasonography|Sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to [[sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion]], or the termination of a fetus based on sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.

It is suggested that sex-selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some places. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and India.&lt;ref&gt;Banister, Judith. (1999-03-16). [http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/ebspr96a.html Son Preference in Asia – Report of a Symposium]. Retrieved 2006-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the economic role of men, the costs associated with [[dowry|dowries]], and a common Indian tradition which dictates that [[funeral|funeral rites]] must be performed by a male relative have led to a cultural preference for sons.&lt;ref&gt;Mutharayappa, Rangamuthia, Kim Choe, Minja, Arnold, Fred, and Roy, T.K. (1997). [http://www2.eastwestcenter.org/pop/misc/subj-3.pdf Son Preferences and Its Effect on Fertility in India]. ''National Family Health Survey Subject Reports, Number 3.'.' Retrieved 2006-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread availability of diagnostic testing, during the 1970s and '80s, led to advertisements for services which read, &quot;Invest 500 [[rupee]]s &amp;#91;for a sex test&amp;#93; now, save 50,000 rupees &amp;#91;for a dowry&amp;#93; later.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Rita |last=Patel |year=1996 |month=Fall |title=The practice of sex selective abortion in India: May you be the mother of a hundred sons |journal=Carolina Papers in International Health and Development |volume=7 |url=http://cgi.unc.edu/research/pdf/abortion.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qWhqeiZq |archivedate=2010-06-16 |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the male-to-female [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] in India was skewed from its biological norm of 105 to 100, to an average of 108 to 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sudha |first=S. |year=1999 |month=July |title=Female Demographic Disadvantage in India 1981–1991: Sex Selective Abortions and Female Infanticide |journal=Development and Change |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=585–618 |doi=10.1111/1467-7660.00130 |url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/organizations/healthnet/gender/docs/sudha.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030101210623/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/organizations/healthnet/gender/docs/sudha.html |archivedate=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2008-12-03 |last2=Rajan |first2=S.

In the People's Republic of China, there is also a historic son preference. The implementation of the one-child policy in 1979, in response to population concerns, led to an increased disparity in the sex ratio as parents attempted to circumvent the law through sex-selective abortion or the abandonment of unwanted daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Maureen J. |last=Graham |year=1998 |month=June |title=Son Preference in Anhui Province, China |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=2 |url=http://www.agi-usa.org/pubs/journals/2407298.html |accessdate=2008-12-03 |doi=10.2307/2991929 |page=72 |author2=Larsen |author3=Xu|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080620084622/http%3A//www.agi-usa.org/pubs/journals/2407298.html |archivedate = June 20, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-selective abortion might be an influence on the shift from the baseline male-to-female birth rate to an elevated national rate of 117:100 reported in 2002.

===Anti-abortion violence===
{{Main|Anti-abortion violence}}
Doctors and facilities that provide abortion have been subjected to various forms of violence, including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, stalking, assault, arson, and bombing. Anti-abortion violence has been classified by governmental and scholarly sources as [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, G.

In the United States, four abortion providers—Drs. [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]], [[John Britton (doctor)|John Britton]], [[Barnett Slepian]], and [[George Tiller]]—have been assassinated. Attempted assassinations have also taken place in the United States and Canada, and other personnel at abortion clinics, including receptionists and security guards, have been killed in the United States and Australia. Hundreds of bombings, arsons, acid attacks, invasions, and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have also occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Death of Dr. Gunn |work= [[New York Times]] |date=12 March 1993 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/opinion/the-death-of-dr-gunn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;naf&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[National Abortion Federation]] | year = 2009 | url = http://www.prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/violence_stats.pdf | format = PDF | title = Incidence of Violence &amp; Disruption Against Abortion Providers in the U.S. &amp; Canada | accessdate = February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], [[Scott Roeder]], [[Shelley Shannon]], and [[Paul Jennings Hill]], the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g26 |work=The Guardian |date=February 3, 1999 |title=The bomber under siege |first=Julian |last=Borger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art, literature and film===
Art serves to humanize the abortion issue and illustrates the myriad of decisions and consequences it has. One of the [[History of abortion#5th century to 18th century|earliest]] known representations of abortion is in a [[bas relief]] at [[Angkor Wat]] (c. 1150). Pro-life activist [[Børre Knudsen]] was linked to a 1994 art theft as part of a pro-life drive in [[Norway]] surrounding the [[1994 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Art theft&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Various options and realities of abortion have been dramatized in film. In ''[[Riding in Cars with Boys]]'' (2001) an underage woman carries her pregnancy to term as abortion is not an affordable option, moves in with the father and finds herself involved with drugs, has no opportunities, and questioning if she loves her child. While in ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007) a 16-year-old initially goes to have an abortion but decides to bear the child and allow a wealthy couple to adopt it. Other films ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' (1987) and ''[[If These Walls Could Talk]]'' (1996) explore the availability, affordability and dangers of illegal abortions. The emotional impact of dealing with an unwanted pregnancy alone is the focus of ''Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her'' (2000) and ''[[Circle of Friends (1995 film)|Circle of Friends]]'' (1995). As a marriage was in trouble in the ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974) [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]] knew the relationship was over when she aborted &quot;a son&quot; in secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGodfather&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==In other animals==
{{See|Miscarriage#In other animals}}
Spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals. For example, in sheep, it may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, James. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjmvGj-fB2&amp;sig=8qH_WrPR08YEwPKr_c6PHDUOMmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=erDbSeSVBoz4MY-F7M4I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#PPA124,M1 Sheep Husbandry in Canada]'', p. 124 (1911). &lt;/ref&gt; In cows, abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as [[Brucellosis]] or [[Campylobacter]], but can often be controlled by vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en &quot;Beef cattle and Beef production: Management and Husbandry of Beef Cattle”], ''Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion may also be induced in animals, in the context of [[animal husbandry]]. For example, abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly, or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant, or that are pregnant with twin foals.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, Angus et al. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jlZAT-9VwUIC&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=%22induce+abortion%22+and+husbandry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6T9w3LtpsI&amp;sig=aEYDFpnMIbLaKlstxK1MGK2rxwQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eLTbSY7EO5muMrXUkMkI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7 Equine Reproduction]'', p. 563 (Wiley-Blackwell 1993). &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feticide]] can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Joel W|date=5 May 1983|title=Induced abortion and social factors in wild horses|journal=Nature|location=London|volume=303|pages=59–61|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v303/n5912/abs/303059a0.html|doi=10.1038/303059a0|pmid=6682487|issue=5912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pluháček|first=Jan|year=2000|title=Male infanticide in captive plains zebra, Equus burchelli|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|pages=689–694|url=http://af.czu.cz/~bartos/publications/pdf/Pluhacek_Bartos_2000_AB.pdf|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1371|pmid=10792924|last2=Bartos|first2=L|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pluháček|first=Jan|year=2005|title=Further evidence for male infanticide and feticide in captive plains zebra, Equus burchelli|journal=Folia Zool.|volume=54|issue=3|pages= 258–262|url=http://www.ivb.cz/folia/54/3/258-262.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the frequency in the wild has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JW|first=Fitzpatrick|date=October 1991|title=Changes in herd stallions among feral horse bands and the absence of forced copulation and induced abortion |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|volume=29|issue=3|pages=217–219|issn=0340-5443 (Print) 1432-0762 (Online)|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k1543n1548987255/}} {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male [[Gray langur]] monkeys may attack females following male takeover, causing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/BF02435859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Abstract of title */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[law]], an '''abstract''' is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long [[legal document]] or of several related legal papers.

==Abstract of title==
{{Unreferenced/sandbox|section|type=Law|date=November 2007}}

{{Main|Abstract of title}}
The Abstract of Title, used in [[real estate]] transactions, is the more common form of abstract. An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all [[deed]]s, [[will (law)|wills]], [[mortgage law|mortgages]], and other documents that affect [[ownership]] of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.

==Clear title==
{{Unreferenced/sandbox|section|type=Law|date=November 2007}}
A clear title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaks{{Clarify|reason= does this mean &quot;it shews an unbroken chain&quot;?|date=February 2011}}in the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.

==Patent law==
In the context of [[patent]] law and specifically in [[prior art]] searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step]] (or [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obviousness]] in [[United States]] patent law) of an invention. Under [[United States patent law]], the abstract may be called &quot;Abstract of the Disclosure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0600_608_01_b.htm 608.01(b) Abstract of the Disclosure]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative process==
Certain government bureaucracies, such as a ''department of motor vehicles'' will issue an '''abstract''' of a completed transaction or an updated record intended to serve as a proof of compliance with some administrative requirement. This is often done in advance of the update of reporting databases and/or the issuance of official documents.

&lt;!--Editorial consensus here, as well as most scholarly opinion, is that various German principalities that provided
    so-called &quot;Hessians&quot; to the British war effort are NOT considered formal belligerents in this war.
    If you believe otherwise, feel free to raise the matter on the discussion page.  Adding &quot;Hessians&quot;,
    &quot;Hesse&quot;, &quot;Hesse-Kassel&quot;, and other German states is likely to be reverted otherwise.

The '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775–1783) or '''American War of Independence''',&lt;ref&gt;British writers generally favor &quot;American War of Independence&quot;, &quot;American Rebellion&quot;, or &quot;War of American Independence&quot;. See Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture, ''Bibliography'' at the [http://revolution.h-net.msu.edu/bib.html Michigan State University] for usage in titles.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''Revolutionary War''', began as a war between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] in [[North America]], and ended in a [[global war]] between several European [[great power]]s. The war was the result of the political [[American Revolution]], which galvanized around the dispute between the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] and colonists  opposed to the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], which the Americans protested as unconstitutional.  The Parliament insisted on its right to tax colonists; the Americans claimed their rights as Englishmen to [[No Taxation without Representation]]. The Americans formed a unifying [[Continental Congress]] and a shadow government in each colony.  The American boycott of British tea led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773. London responded by ending self government in Massachusetts and putting it under the control of the army with General [[Thomas Gage]] as governor. In April of 1775, Gage sent a contingent of troops out of Boston to seize rebel arms. Local militia, known as '[[minutemen]],'  confronted the British troops and nearly destroyed the British column. The [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] ignited the war.  Any chance of a compromise ended when the colonies declared independence and formed a new nation, the [[United States of America]] in July 1776.

[[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] all secretly provided [[Franco-American alliance#Background|supplies, ammunition and weapons]] to the revolutionaries starting early in 1776. After early British success, the war became a standoff. The British used their naval superiority to capture and occupy American coastal cities while the rebels largely controlled the countryside, where 90 percent of the population lived.  British strategy relied on mobilizing [[Loyalist_(American_Revolution)|Loyalist militia]], and was never fully realized.  A British invasion from Canada ended in the capture of the British army at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777. That American victory persuaded France [[France in the American Revolutionary War|to enter the war]] openly in early 1778, balancing the two sides' military strength. [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]]—French allies—also went to war with Britain over the next two years, threatening an [[Armada of 1779|invasion of Great Britain]] and severely testing British military strength with campaigns in Europe. [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|Spain's involvement]] culminated in the [[Battle of Pensacola (1781)|expulsion]] of British armies from [[West Florida]], securing the American southern flank.

French involvement proved decisive. A French [[Battle of the Chesapeake|naval victory in the Chesapeake]] forced a second British army to surrender at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in 1781. In 1783, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the war and recognized the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded roughly by what is now [[Canada]] to the north, [[Florida]] to the south, and the [[Mississippi River]] to the west.

===American armies and militias===
{{Main|Continental Army|Minutemen}}

[[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|right|300px|Population density in the [[American Colonies]] in 1775]]
When the war began, the 13 colonies lacked a professional army or navy. Each colony sponsored local [[militia]]. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the [[Battles of the American Revolutionary War|battles]] of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]], and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used [[Partisan (military)|partisan warfare]] but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when [[British Regulars|British regulars]] were not in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;59. On militia see Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;707, and Weigley (1973), ch.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established (on paper) a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as [[commander-in-chief]]. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war. The [[United States Marine Corps]] traces its institutional roots to the [[Continental Marines]] of the war, formed at [[Tun Tavern]] in [[Philadelphia]], by a resolution of the [[Continental Congress]] on November 10, 1775, a date regarded and celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the beginning of 1776, Washington's army had 20,000 men, with two-thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread&quot;&gt;Crocker (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the American Revolution in 1783, both the [[Continental Navy]] and Continental Marines were disbanded. About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time.

Armies were small by European standards of the era, largely attributable to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities on the American side.&lt;ref&gt;Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;264 says the largest force Washington commanded was &quot;under 17,000&quot;; Duffy (1987), p.&amp;nbsp;17, estimates Washington's maximum was &quot;only 13,000 troops&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also difficult for Great Britain to transport troops across the Atlantic and they depended on local supplies that the Patriots tried to cut off. By comparison, Duffy notes that [[Frederick the Great]] usually commanded from 23,000 to 50,000 in battle. Both figures pale in comparison to the armies that would be fielded in the early 19th century, where troop formations approached or exceeded 100,000 men.

===Loyalists===
{{Main|Loyalist (American Revolution)}}

Historians&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;235&lt;/ref&gt; have estimated that approximately 40 to 45 percent of the colonists supported the rebellion, while 15 to 20 percent remained loyal to the Crown. The rest attempted to remain neutral and kept a low profile.

At least 25,000 Loyalists fought on the side of the British. Thousands served in the Royal Navy. On land, Loyalist forces fought alongside the British in most battles in North America. Many Loyalists fought in partisan units, especially in the Southern theater.&lt;ref&gt;Savas and Dameron (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;xli&lt;/ref&gt;

The British military met with many difficulties in maximizing the use of Loyalist factions. British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] wrote, &quot;In the American war it was clear to both royal generals and revolutionaries that organized and significant Loyalist activity would require the presence of British forces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; In the South, the use of Loyalists presented the British with &quot;major problems of strategic choice&quot; since while it was necessary to widely disperse troops in order to defend Loyalist areas, it was also recognized that there was a need for &quot;the maintenance of large concentrated forces able&quot; to counter major attacks from the American forces.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;13–14&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the British were forced to ensure that their military actions would not &quot;offend Loyalist opinion&quot;, eliminating such options as attempting to &quot;live off the country&quot;, destroying property for intimidation purposes, or coercing payments from colonists (&quot;laying them under contribution&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt;

===British armies and auxiliaries===
{{further|[[History of the British Army#American War of Independence|History of the British Army: American War of Independence]]}}

Early in 1775, the [[British Army]] consisted of about 36,000 men worldwide, but wartime recruitment steadily increased this number. Great Britain had a difficult time appointing general officers, however. General [[Thomas Gage]], in command of British forces in North America when the rebellion started, was criticized for being too lenient (perhaps influenced by his [[Margaret Kemble Gage|American wife]]). General [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst]] turned down an appointment as commander in chief due to an unwillingness to take sides in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Admiral [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] turned down a command, saying &quot;I cannot draw the sword in such a cause.&quot; The [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham|Earl of Effingham]] publicly resigned his commission when his [[Cheshire Regiment|22nd Regiment of foot]] was posted to America, and [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] and [[John Burgoyne]] were [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]] who opposed military solutions to the American rebellion. Howe and [[Henry Clinton (1730–1795)|Henry Clinton]] stated that they were unwilling participants in the war and were only following orders.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;77&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the war, Great Britain signed treaties with various [[Germans in the American Revolution|German]] states, which supplied about 30,000 soldiers. Germans made up about one-third of the British troop strength in North America. [[Hesse-Kassel]] contributed more soldiers than any other state, and German soldiers became known as &quot;[[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]]&quot; to the Americans. Revolutionary speakers called German soldiers &quot;foreign mercenaries,&quot; and they are scorned as such in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. By 1779, the number of British and German troops stationed in North America was over 60,000, although these were spread from Canada to Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;27–29; Boatner (1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–26&lt;/ref&gt; About 10,000 Loyalist Americans under arms for the British are included in these figures.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;240; figure for 1780.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary of State at War [[Lord Barrington]] and the Adjutant-General [[Edward Harvey]] were both strongly opposed to outright war on land. In 1766 Barrington had recommended withdrawing the army from the 13 Colonies to Canada, Nova Scotia and Florida. At the beginning of the war he urged a naval blockade, which would quickly damage the colonists' trading activities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Americans===
[[File:American Foot Soldiers.jpg|thumb|This 1780 drawing of American soldiers from the Yorktown campaign shows a black infantryman from the [[1st Rhode Island Regiment]].]]
[[African Americans in the Revolutionary War|African Americans]]—slave and free—served on both sides during the war. The British recruited slaves belonging to [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] masters and promised freedom to those who served. Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Another all-black unit came from [[Haiti]] with French forces. At least 5,000 black soldiers fought for the Revolutionary cause.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;64–69 (Revolutionary all-black units)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of slaves escaped during the war and joined British lines; others simply moved off into the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves, now freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;   Altogether, the British were estimated to evacuate nearly 20,000 freedmen (including families) with other Loyalists and their troops at the end of the war.  More than 3,000 freedmen were resettled in Nova Scotia; others were transported to the West Indies of the Caribbean islands, and some to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071012032555/http://americanrevolution.com/AfricanAmericansInTheRevolution.htm &quot;&quot;African Americans In The Revolutionary Period], American Revolution&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Americans===
Most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] east of the [[Mississippi River]] were affected by the war, and many communities were divided over the question of how to respond to the conflict. Though a few tribes were on friendly terms with the Americans, most Native Americans opposed the United States as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Native Americans fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the [[Iroquois]] tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;393; Boatner (1974), p.&amp;nbsp;545&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was shattered as a result of the conflict; although the Confederacy did not take sides, the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] nations sided with the British. Members of the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] fought on both sides.  Many [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the [[Sullivan Expedition]] on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes which had sided with the British. Both during and after the war friction between the Mohawk leaders [[Joseph Louis Cook]] and [[Joseph Brant]], who had sided with the Americans and the British respectively, further exacerbated the split.

[[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Seminole]] allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, a force of 800 Creeks destroyed American settlements along the [[Broad River (Georgia)|Broad River]] in Georgia. Creek warriors also joined [[Thomas Brown (loyalist)|Thomas Brown's]] raids into South Carolina and assisted Britain during the [[Siege of Savannah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Harry M.|title=The war for independence and the transformation of American society|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kgqa4_OBcIkC&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=25 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857286564|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Native Americans were involved in the fighting between Britain and Spain on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and up the Mississippi River—mostly on the British side. Thousands of Creeks, [[Chickasaw]]s, and [[Choctaw]]s fought in or near major battles such as the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]], the [[Battle of Mobile (1781)|Battle of Mobile]], and the [[Siege of Pensacola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Greg|title=Pre-removal Choctaw history: exploring new paths|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jGFmNPevedUC&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=30 April 2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806139166|pages=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex, race, class===
Pybus (2005) estimates that about 20,000 slaves defected to or were captured by the British, of whom about 8,000 died from disease or wounds or were recaptured by the Patriots, and 12,000 left the country at the end of the war, for freedom in Canada or slavery in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Cassadra Pybus, &quot;Jefferson's Faulty Math: the Question of Slave Defections in the American Revolution.&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 2005 62(2): 243-264. Issn: 0043-5597 Fulltext: in [[History Cooperative]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baller (2006) examines family dynamics and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;William Baller, &quot;Farm Families and the American Revolution.&quot; ''Journal of Family History'' (2006) 31(1): 28-44. Issn: 0363-1990 Fulltext: online in [[EBSCO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonnell, (2006) shows a grave complication in Virginia's mobilization of troops was the conflicting interests of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified commitment to the Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slaveowning planters, [[Plain Folk of the Old South|the middling yeomen]] (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class divisiveness as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. McDonnell, &quot;Class War: Class Struggles During the American Revolution in Virginia,&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 2006 63(2): 305–344.

===Massachusetts===
&lt;!-- this section is a brief summary of the &quot;Boston campaign&quot; article, so add additional details there rather than here.--&gt;
{{Main|Boston campaign}}

Before the war, [[Boston]] had been the center of much revolutionary activity, leading to the punitive [[Massachusetts Government Act]] in 1774 that ended local government. Popular resistance to these measures, however, compelled the newly appointed royal officials in Massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in Boston. Lieutenant General [[Thomas Gage]], the British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|North American commander-in chief]], commanded four regiments of British regulars (about 4,000 men) from his headquarters in Boston, but the countryside was in the hands of the Revolutionaries.  

[[File:British Army in Concord Detail.jpg|thumb|left|The British marching to [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] in April 1775]]

On the night of April 18, 1775, General Gage sent 700 men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. Riders including [[Paul Revere]] alerted the countryside, and when British troops entered [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] on the morning of April 19, they found 77 [[Minutemen (militia)|minutemen]] formed up on the village green. Shots were exchanged, killing several minutemen. The British moved on to Concord, where a detachment of three companies was engaged and routed at the North Bridge by a force of 500 minutemen. As the British retreated back to Boston, thousands of militiamen attacked them along the roads, inflicting great damage before timely British reinforcements prevented a total disaster. With the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], the war had begun.

The militia converged on Boston, [[siege of Boston|bottling up the British]] in the city. About 4,500 more British soldiers arrived by sea, and on June 17, 1775, British forces under General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] seized the Charlestown peninsula at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The Americans fell back, but British losses were so heavy that the attack was not followed up. The siege was not broken, and Gage was soon replaced by Howe as the British commander-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;75–77&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1775, newly appointed General Washington arrived outside Boston to take charge of the colonial forces and to organize the Continental Army. Realizing his army's desperate shortage of gunpowder, Washington asked for new sources. Arsenals were raided and some manufacturing was attempted; 90% of the supply (2 million pounds) was imported by the end of 1776, mostly from France.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson (1925), pp.&amp;nbsp;271–281&lt;/ref&gt;   Patriots in New Hampshire had seized powder, muskets and cannon from [[Fort William and Mary]] in Portsmouth Harbor in late 1774.&lt;ref&gt;* Elwin L.

The standoff continued throughout the fall and winter. In early March 1776, heavy cannons that the patriots had [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured at Fort Ticonderoga]] were brought to Boston by Colonel [[Henry Knox]], and [[fortification of Dorchester Heights|placed on Dorchester Heights]]. Since the artillery now overlooked the British positions, Howe's situation was untenable, and the British [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|fled]] on March 17, 1776, sailing to their naval base at [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S.

Three weeks after the siege of Boston began, a troop of militia volunteers led by [[Ethan Allen]] and [[Benedict Arnold]] [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured Fort Ticonderoga]], a strategically important point on [[Lake Champlain]] between New York and the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]]. After that action they also raided [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort St. John's]], not far from Montreal, which alarmed the population and the authorities there. In response, Quebec's governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] began fortifying St. John's, and opened negotiations with the [[Iroquois]] and other Native American tribes for their support. These actions, combined with lobbying by both Allen and Arnold and the fear of a British attack from the north, eventually persuaded the Congress to authorize an invasion of Quebec, with the goal of driving the British military from that province. (Quebec was then frequently referred to as ''Canada'', as most of its territory included the former French Province of [[Canada, New France|Canada]].)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Desjardin, ''Through a Howling Wilderness: Benedict Arnold's March to Quebec, 1775'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Quebec-bound expeditions were undertaken. On September 28, 1775, Brigadier General [[Richard Montgomery]] marched north from [[Fort Ticonderoga]] with about 1,700 militiamen, [[Siege of Fort St. Jean|besieging and capturing Fort St. Jean]] on November 2 and then Montreal on November 13. General Carleton escaped to [[Quebec City]] and began preparing that city for an attack. The [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec|second expedition]], led by Colonel Arnold, went through the wilderness of what is now northern Maine. Logistics were difficult, with 300 men turning back, and another 200 perishing due to the harsh conditions. By the time Arnold reached Quebec City in early November, he had but 600 of his original 1,100 men. Montgomery's force joined Arnold's, and they [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attacked Quebec City]] on December 31, but were defeated by Carleton in a battle that ended with Montgomery dead, Arnold wounded, and over 400 Americans taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Sterne Randall]], &quot;Benedict Arnold at Quebec,&quot; ''MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History,'' Summer 1990, Vol. 2 Issue 4, pp 38-49&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining Americans held on outside Quebec City until the spring of 1776, suffering from poor camp conditions and smallpox, and then withdrew when a squadron of British ships under [[Sir Charles Douglas|Captain Charles Douglas]] arrived to relieve the siege.&lt;ref&gt;Desjardin, ''Through a Howling Wilderness: Benedict Arnold's March to Quebec, 1775'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt was made by the Americans to push back towards Quebec, but they failed at [[Battle of Trois-Rivières|Trois-Rivières]] on June 8, 1776. Carleton then launched his own invasion and defeated Arnold at the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] in October. Arnold fell back to Fort Ticonderoga, where the invasion had begun. While the invasion ended as a disaster for the Americans, Arnold's efforts in 1776 delayed a full-scale British counteroffensive until the [[Saratoga campaign]] of 1777.

The invasion cost the Americans their base of support in British public opinion, &quot;So that the violent measures towards America are freely adopted and countenanced by a majority of individuals of all ranks, professions, or occupations, in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1960), p.&amp;nbsp;203.&lt;/ref&gt; It gained them at best limited support in the population of Quebec, which, while somewhat supportive early in the invasion, became less so later during the occupation, when American policies against suspected Loyalists became harsher, and the army's hard currency ran out. Two small regiments of [[Canadien]]s were recruited during the operation, and they were with the army on its retreat back to Ticonderoga.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Lefkowitz, ''Benedict Arnold's Army: The 1775 American Invasion of Canada during the Revolutionary War'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York and New Jersey===
{{Main|New York and New Jersey campaign}} &lt;!-- This is a brief summary of the &quot;New York and New Jersey campaigns&quot; article. Add more details there rather than here. --&gt;
[[File:BattleofLongisland.jpg|thumb|left|American soldiers in the [[Battle of Long Island]], 1776]]

Having withdrawn his army from Boston, General Howe now focused on capturing New York City, which then was limited to the southern tip of Manhattan Island. To defend the city, General Washington spread about 20,000 soldiers along the shores of New York's harbor, concentrated on [[Long Island]] and [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;51–52,83&lt;/ref&gt; While British and recently hired [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] troops were assembling across the upper harbor on [[Staten Island]] for the campaign, and Washington had the newly issued [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of American Independence]] read to his men.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; No longer was there any possibility of compromise. On August 27, 1776, after landing about 22,000 men on Long Island, the British drove the Americans back to [[Brooklyn Heights]], securing a decisive British victory in the [[Battle of Long Island|largest battle of the entire Revolution]]. Howe then laid [[siege]] to fortifications there. In a feat considered by many historians to be one of his most impressive actions as Commander in Chief, Washington personally directed the [[withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of his entire remaining army and all their supplies across the [[East River]] in one night without discovery by the British or significant loss of men and [[materiel]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;91–101&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[Staten Island Peace Conference|failed peace conference]] on September 11, Howe resumed the attack. On September 15, Howe [[Landing at Kip's Bay|landed about 12,000 men]] on lower Manhattan, quickly taking control of New York City. The Americans withdrew north up the island to Harlem Heights, where they [[Battle of Harlem Heights|skirmished the next day]] but held their ground. When Howe moved to encircle Washington's army in October, the Americans again fell back, and a [[Battle of White Plains|battle at White Plains]] was fought on October 28.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;102–111&lt;/ref&gt; Again Washington retreated, and Howe returned to Manhattan and captured [[Fort Washington (New York)|Fort Washington]] in mid November, taking about 2,000 prisoners (with an additional 1,000 having been captured during the battle for Long Island). Thus began [[Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War|the infamous &quot;prison ships&quot; system]] the British maintained in New York for the rest of the war, in which more American soldiers and sailors [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument|died of neglect]] than died in every battle of the entire war, combined.&lt;ref&gt;Stiles, Henry Reed. &quot;Letters from the prisons and prison-ships of the revolution&quot;.

Howe then detached General Clinton to seize [[Newport, Rhode Island]], while [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Lord Cornwallis]] continued to chase Washington's army through [[New Jersey]], until the Americans withdrew across the [[Delaware River]] into Pennsylvania in early December.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;115–137&lt;/ref&gt; With the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season, the British entered winter quarters. Although Howe had missed several opportunities to crush the diminishing American army, he had killed or captured over 5,000 Americans.

The outlook of the Continental Army was bleak. &quot;These are the times that try men's souls,&quot; wrote [[Thomas Paine]], who was with the army on the retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;138–140&lt;/ref&gt; The army had dwindled to fewer than 5,000 men fit for duty, and would be reduced to 1,400 after enlistments expired at the end of the year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Congress had abandoned Philadelphia in despair, although popular resistance to British occupation was growing in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;143–205&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Emanuel Leutze]]'s stylized depiction of ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' (1851)]]
Washington decided to take the offensive, [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|stealthily crossing the Delaware]] on Christmas night and capturing nearly 1,000 Hessians at the [[Battle of Trenton]] on December 26, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;206–259&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwallis marched to retake Trenton but was first [[Battle of the Assunpink Creek|repulsed]] and then outmaneuvered by Washington, who successfully attacked the British rearguard at [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] on January 3, 1777.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;277–343&lt;/ref&gt; Washington then entered winter quarters at [[Morristown, New Jersey]], having given a morale boost to the American cause. New Jersey militia continued to harass British and Hessian forces [[Forage War|throughout the winter]], forcing the British to retreat to their base in and around New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;345–358&lt;/ref&gt;

At every stage the British strategy assumed a large base of Loyalist supporters would rally to the King given some military support. In February 1776 Clinton took 2,000 men and a naval squadron to invade North Carolina, which he called off when he learned the Loyalists had been crushed at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]]. In June he tried to seize [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the leading port in the South, hoping for a simultaneous rising in South Carolina. It seemed a cheap way of waging the war but [[Battle of Sullivan's Island|it failed]] as the naval force was defeated by the forts and because no local Loyalists attacked the town from behind. The Loyalists were too poorly organized to be effective, but as late as 1781 senior officials in London, misled by Loyalist exiles, placed their confidence in their rising. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Saratoga and Philadelphia===

When the British began to plan operations for 1777, they had two main armies in North America: Carleton's army in Quebec, and Howe's army in New York. In London, [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Germain]] approved campaigns for these armies which, because of miscommunication, poor planning, and rivalries between commanders, did not work in conjunction. Although Howe successfully captured Philadelphia, the northern army was lost in a disastrous surrender at Saratoga. Both Carleton and Howe resigned after the 1777 campaign.

====Saratoga campaign====
{{Main|Saratoga campaign}}

&lt;!-- This is a brief summary of the &quot;Saratoga campaign&quot; article. Add details there rather than here. --&gt;
The first of the 1777 campaigns was an expedition from Quebec led by General [[John Burgoyne]]. The goal was to seize the [[Lake Champlain]] and [[Hudson River]] corridor, effectively isolating [[New England]] from the rest of the American colonies. Burgoyne's invasion had two components: he would lead about 8,000 men along Lake Champlain towards [[Albany, New York]], while a second column of about 2,000 men, led by [[Barry St. Leger]], would move down the [[Mohawk River]] Valley and link up with Burgoyne in Albany, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;84&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoyne set off in June, and [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|recaptured Fort Ticonderoga]] in early July. Thereafter, his march was slowed by the Americans who literally knocked down trees in his path, and by his army's extensive baggage train. A detachment sent out to seize supplies was decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Bennington]] by American militia in August, depriving Burgoyne of nearly 1,000 men.

Meanwhile, St. Leger—more than half of his force Native Americans led by [[Sayenqueraghta]]—had [[Siege of Fort Stanwix|laid siege to Fort Stanwix]]. American militiamen and their Native American allies marched to relieve the siege but were ambushed and scattered at the [[Battle of Oriskany]]. When a second relief expedition approached, this time led by Benedict Arnold, St. Leger's Indian support abandoned him, forcing him to break off the siege and return to Quebec.

Burgoyne's army had been reduced to about 6,000 men by the loss at Bennington and the need to garrison Ticonderoga, and he was running short on supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Ketchum (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;285–323&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these setbacks, he determined to push on towards Albany. An American army of 8,000 men, commanded by the General [[Horatio Gates]], had entrenched about 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Saratoga, New York]]. Burgoyne tried to outflank the Americans but was checked at the [[Battle of Freeman's Farm|first battle of Saratoga]] in September. Burgoyne's situation was desperate, but he now hoped that help from Howe's army in New York City might be on the way. It was not: Howe had instead sailed away on his expedition to capture Philadelphia. American militiamen flocked to Gates' army, swelling his force to 11,000 by the beginning of October. After being badly beaten at the [[Battle of Bemis Heights|second battle of Saratoga]], Burgoyne surrendered on October 17.

Saratoga was the turning point of the war. Revolutionary confidence and determination, suffering from Howe's successful occupation of Philadelphia, was renewed. What is more important, the victory encouraged [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France]] to make an open alliance with the Americans, after two years of semi-secret support. For the British, the war had now become much more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;188–98&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philadelphia campaign====
{{Main|Philadelphia campaign}}

&lt;!-- This is a brief summary of the &quot;Philadelphia campaign&quot; article. Add details there rather than here. --&gt;
Having secured New York City in 1776, General Howe concentrated on capturing Philadelphia, the seat of the Revolutionary government, in 1777. He moved slowly, landing 15,000 troops in late August at the northern end of [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Washington positioned his 11,000 men between Howe and Philadelphia but was driven back at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777. The Continental Congress again abandoned Philadelphia, and on September 26, Howe finally outmaneuvered Washington and marched into the city unopposed. Washington unsuccessfully [[Battle of Germantown|attacked the British encampment in nearby Germantown]] in early October and then retreated to watch and wait.

After repelling a British attack at [[Battle of White Marsh|White Marsh]], Washington and his army encamped at [[Valley Forge]] in December 1777, about 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) from Philadelphia, where they stayed for the next six months. Over the winter, 2,500 men (out of 10,000) died from disease and exposure. The next spring, however, the army emerged from Valley Forge in good order, thanks in part to a training program supervised by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], who introduced the most modern [[Prussia]]n methods of organization and tactics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

General Clinton replaced Howe as British commander-in-chief. French entry into the war had changed British strategy, and Clinton abandoned Philadelphia to reinforce New York City, now vulnerable to French naval power. Washington shadowed Clinton on his withdrawal and forced a strategic victory at the [[Battle of Monmouth|battle at Monmouth]] on June 28, 1778, the last major battle in the north. Clinton's army went to New York City in July, arriving just before a French fleet under [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|Admiral d'Estaing]] arrived off the American coast. Washington's army returned to [[White Plains, New York]], north of the city. Although both armies were back where they had been two years earlier, the nature of the war had now changed.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;175–188&lt;/ref&gt;

==An international war, 1778–1783==
{{Main|Franco-American alliance}}

In 1778, the war over the rebellion in North America became international, spreading not only to Europe but to European colonies in the West Indies and in India. From 1776 France had informally been involved, with [[French people|French]] admiral [[Louis-René Levassor de Latouche Tréville|Latouche Tréville]] having provided [[France in the American Revolutionary War#French involvement|supplies, ammunition and guns]] from France to the United States after [[Thomas Jefferson]] had encouraged a French alliance, and guns such as [[Florent-Jean de Vallière|de Valliere]] type were used, playing an important role in such battles as the [[Battles of Saratoga|Battle of Saratoga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/spar/historyculture/french-field_4pdr.htm Springfield Armory]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington]] wrote about the French supplies and guns in a letter to General [[William Heath|Heath]] on May 2, 1777. After learning of the American victory at Saratoga, France signed the [[Treaty of Alliance]] with the United States on February 6, 1778, formalizing the [[Franco-American alliance]] negotiated by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Spain entered the war as an ally of France in June 1779, a renewal of the [[Bourbon Family Compact]]. Unlike France, Spain initially refused to recognize the independence of the United States, because Spain was not keen on encouraging similar anti-colonial rebellions in the [[Spanish Empire]]. Both countries had quietly provided assistance to the Americans since the beginning of the war, hoping to dilute British power. So too had the [[Dutch Republic]], which was formally brought into the war at the end of 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1987) ch 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punish the Americans==
In London [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] gave up hope of subduing America by more armies while Britain had a European war to fight. &quot;It was a joke,&quot; he said, &quot;to think of keeping Pennsylvania.&quot; There was no hope of recovering New England. But the King was determined &quot;never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan (1912), vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; His plan was to keep the 30,000 men garrisoned in New York, Rhode Island, Quebec, and Florida; other forces would attack the French and Spanish in the West Indies. To punish the Americans the King planned to destroy their coasting-trade, bombard their ports; sack and burn towns along the coast (as [[Benedict Arnold]] [[Battle of Groton Heights|did to New London, Connecticut]] in 1781), and turn loose the Native Americans to attack civilians in frontier settlements. These operations, the King felt, would inspire the Loyalists; would splinter the Congress; and &quot;would keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse&quot; and they would beg to return to his authority.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan (1912), vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; The plan meant destruction for the Loyalists and loyal Native Americans, an indefinite prolongation of a costly war, and the risk of disaster as the French and Spanish assembled an armada to invade the British Isles. The British planned to re-subjugate the rebellious colonies after dealing with the Americans' European allies.

When the war began, the British had overwhelming naval superiority over the American colonists. The [[Royal Navy]] had over 100 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] and many frigates and smaller craft, although this fleet was old and in poor condition, a situation which would be blamed on [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. During the first three years of the war, the Royal Navy was primarily used to transport troops for land operations and to protect commercial shipping. The American colonists had no [[ships of the line]], and relied extensively on [[privateer]]ing to harass British shipping. The privateers caused worry disproportionate to their material success, although those operating out of French [[English Channel|channel]] ports before and after France joined the war caused significant embarrassment to the Royal Navy and inflamed Anglo-French relations. About 55,000 American sailors served aboard the privateers during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmm.org/revolution.html Privateers or Merchant Mariners help win the Revolutionary War]&lt;/ref&gt; The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/privateer.htm Privateers]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Continental Congress]] authorized the creation of a small [[Continental Navy]] in October 1775, which was primarily used for [[commerce raiding]]. [[John Paul Jones]] became the first great American naval hero, capturing [[HMS Drake (1777)|HMS ''Drake'']] on April 24, 1778, the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;331–46&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Siege and Relief of Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782|The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar]]'', September 13, 1782, by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]

France's formal entry into the war meant that British naval superiority was now contested. The Franco-American alliance began poorly, however, with failed operations at [[Battle of Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] in 1778 and [[Siege of Savannah|Savannah, Georgia]], in 1779. Part of the problem was that France and the United States had different military priorities: France hoped to capture British possessions in the [[West Indies]] before helping to secure American independence. While French financial assistance to the American war effort was already of critical importance, French military aid to the Americans would not show positive results until the arrival in July 1780 of a large force of soldiers led by the [[Comte de Rochambeau]].

Spain entered the war as a French ally with the goal of recapturing [[Gibraltar]] and [[Minorca]], which it had lost to the British in 1704. [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Gibraltar was besieged]] for more than three years, but the British garrison stubbornly resisted and was resupplied twice: once after Admiral [[George Rodney|Rodney]]'s victory over [[Juan de Lángara]] in the 1780 [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|&quot;Moonlight Battle&quot;]], and again after Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] fought [[Luis de Córdova y Córdova]] to a draw in the [[Battle of Cape Spartel]]. Further Franco-Spanish efforts to capture Gibraltar were unsuccessful. One notable success took place on February 5, 1782, when Spanish and French forces [[Invasion of Minorca, 1781|captured Minorca]], which Spain retained after the war. Ambitious plans for an invasion of Great Britain in 1779 [[Armada of 1779|had to be abandoned]].

There was much action in the West Indies, especially in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Although France lost [[Battle of St. Lucia|St. Lucia]] early in the war, its navy dominated the West Indies, capturing [[Invasion of Dominica|Dominica]], [[French capture of Grenada 1779|Grenada]], [[French capture of Saint Vincent|Saint Vincent]], [[French capture of Montserrat|Montserrat]], [[Invasion of Tobago|Tobago]] and [[Battle of St. Kitts|St. Kitts]]. [[Dutch Antilles|Dutch possessions]] in the West Indies and South America [[Dutch West Indies campaign|were captured]] by Britain [[Recapture of Demerara and Essequibo|but later recaptured]] by France and restored to the [[Dutch Republic]]. France successfully conquered the [[French capture of the Turks and Caicos Islands|Turks and Caicos]] archipelago. At the [[Battle of the Saintes]] in April 1782, a victory by Rodney's fleet over the French [[François Joseph Paul, marquis de Grasetilly, comte de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse]] frustrated the hopes of France and Spain to take [[Jamaica]] and other colonies from the British. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez|Count Bernardo de Gálvez]], the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana|governor]] of [[Spanish Louisiana|Louisiana]], quickly removed the British from their outposts on the lower [[Mississippi River]] in 1779 in actions at [[Battle of Fort Bute|Manchac]] and [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Baton Rouge]] in British [[West Florida]]. Gálvez then captured [[Battle of Fort Charlotte|Mobile]] in 1780 and [[Siege of Pensacola|stormed and captured]] the British citadel and capital of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] in 1781. On May 8, 1782, Gálvez [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|captured]] the British naval base at [[New Providence]] in [[the Bahamas]]; it was [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|recovered]] by British Loyalists in 1783. Gálvez' actions led to the Spanish acquisition of [[East Florida|East]] and West Florida in the peace settlement, denied the British the opportunity of encircling the American rebels from the south, and kept open a vital conduit for supplies to the American frontier. The Continental Congress cited Gálvez in 1785 for his aid during the revolution and George Washington took him to his right during the first [[Independence Day (United States)|parade of July 4]].&lt;ref&gt;Heintze, “A Chronology of Notable Fourth of July Celebration Occurrences”.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jaillot-Elwe, Norteamerica, 1792.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Norteamerica, 1792, Jaillot-Elwe, Florida's borders after Bernardo Gálvez's military actions.]]
[[Central America]] was also subject to conflict between Britain and Spain, as Britain sought to expand its influence beyond coastal logging and fishing communities in present-day [[Belize]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]]. Expeditions against [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa|San Fernando de Omoa]] in 1779 and San Juan in 1780 (the latter famously led by a young [[Horatio Nelson]]) met with only temporary success before being abandoned due to disease. The Spanish colonial leaders, in turn, could not completely eliminate British influences along the [[Mosquito Coast]]. Except for the French acquisition of [[Tobago]], sovereignty in the West Indies was returned to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' in the peace of 1783.

===India and the Netherlands===
{{Campaignbox American War of Independence: East Indies}}

When word reached [[India]] in 1778 that France had entered the war, British military forces moved quickly to capture French colonial outposts there, [[Siege of Pondicherry (1778)|capturing Pondicherry]] after two months of siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riddick23_5&quot;&gt;Riddick (2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;23–25&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of the French-controlled port of [[Mahé, India|Mahé]] on India's west coast motivated [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]'s ruler, [[Hyder Ali]] (who was already upset at other British actions, and benefited from trade through the port), to open the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in 1780. Ali, and later his son [[Tipu Sultan]], almost drove the British from southern India but was frustrated by weak French support, and the war ended ''status quo ante bellum'' with the 1784 [[Treaty of Mangalore]]. French opposition was led in 1782 and 1783 by Admiral the [[Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Baillie de Suffren]], who [[Capture of Trincomalee|recaptured Trincomalee]] from the British and fought five celebrated, but largely inconclusive, naval engagements against British Admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher155_8&quot;&gt;Fletcher (1909), pp.&amp;nbsp;155–158&lt;/ref&gt; France's Indian colonies were returned after the war.

[[File:Suffren meeting with Haider Ali J B Morret engraving 1789.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre André de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Suffren]] meeting with ally [[Hyder Ali]] in 1783. J.B. Morret engraving, 1789]]
The Dutch Republic, nominally neutral, had been trading with the Americans, exchanging Dutch arms and munitions for American colonial wares (in contravention of the British ''[[Navigation Acts]]''), primarily through activity based in [[St. Eustatius]], before the French formally entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;Edler (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;37–38, 42–62; The American trade via St. Eustatius was very substantial. In 1779 more than 12,000 [[hogshead]]s of tobacco and 1.5 million ounces of indigo were shipped from the Colonies to the island in exchange for naval supplies and other goods; Edler, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The British considered this trade to include contraband military supplies and had attempted to stop it, at first diplomatically by appealing to previous treaty obligations, interpretation of whose terms the two nations disagreed on, and then by searching and seizing Dutch merchant ships. The situation escalated when the British [[Affair of Fielding and Bylandt|seized a Dutch merchant convoy sailing under Dutch naval escort]] in December 1779, prompting the Dutch to join the [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]]. Britain responded to this decision by declaring war on the Dutch in December 1780, sparking the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]].&lt;ref&gt;Edler (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;95–173&lt;/ref&gt; The war was a military and economic disaster for the Dutch Republic. Paralyzed by internal political divisions, it could not respond effectively to British blockades of its coast and the capture of many of its colonies. In the 1784 peace treaty between the two nations, the Dutch lost the Indian port of [[Negapatam]] and were forced to make trade concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Edler (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;233–246&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Republic signed a friendship and trade agreement with the United States in 1782, and was the second country (after France) to formally recognize the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edler (1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;205–232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern theater==
{{Main|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War}}

During the first three years of the American Revolutionary War, the primary military encounters were in the north, although some attempts to organize Loyalists were defeated, a British [[Battle of Sullivan's Island|attempt at Charleston, South Carolina]] failed, and a variety of efforts to attack British forces in [[East Florida]] failed. After French entry into the war, the British turned their attention to the southern colonies, where they hoped to regain control by recruiting Loyalists. This southern strategy also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean, where the British needed to defend economically important possessions against the French and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banastre-Tarleton-by-Joshua-Reynolds.jpg|thumb|upright|The British Lt. Col. [[Banastre Tarleton]]. Painting by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1782.]]

On December 29, 1778, an expeditionary corps from Clinton's army in New York captured [[Savannah, Georgia]]. An attempt by French and American forces to [[Siege of Savannah|retake Savannah]] failed on October 9, 1779. Clinton then [[siege of Charleston|besieged Charleston]], capturing it and most of the southern Continental Army on May 12, 1780. With relatively few casualties, Clinton had seized the South's biggest city and seaport, providing a base for further conquest.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Gordon and John Keegan, ''South Carolina and the American Revolution: A Battlefield History'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The remnants of the southern Continental Army began to withdraw to [[North Carolina]] but were pursued by Lt. Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]], who defeated them at the [[Waxhaw Massacre|Waxhaws]] on May 29, 1780. With these events, organized American military activity in the region collapsed, though the war was carried on by partisans such as [[Francis Marion]]. Cornwallis took over British operations, while [[Horatio Gates]] arrived to command the American effort. On August 16, 1780, Gates was defeated at the [[Battle of Camden]], setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh F. Rankin, ''North Carolina in the American Revolution'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornwallis' victories quickly turned, however. One wing of his army was utterly defeated at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] on October 7, 1780, and Tarleton was decisively defeated by [[Daniel Morgan]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781. General [[Nathanael Greene]], who replaced General Gates, proceeded to wear down the British in a series of battles, each of them tactically a victory for the British but giving no strategic advantage to the victors. Greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous: &quot;We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again.&quot; By March, Greene's army had grown to the point were he felt that he could face Cornwallis directly. In the key [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], Cornwallis defeated Greene, but at tremendous cost, and without breaking Greene's army. He retreated to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] for resupply and reinforcement, after which he moved north into [[Virginia]], leaving the Carolinas and Georgia open to Greene.&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1781, a British force under [[Benedict Arnold]] landed in Virginia, and began moving through the Virginia countryside, destroying supply depots, mills, and other economic targets. In February, General Washington dispatched [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]] to counter Arnold, later also sending General [[Anthony Wayne]]. Arnold was reinforced with additional troops from New York in March, and his army was joined with that of Cornwallis in May. Lafayette skirmished with Cornwallis, avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements. Cornwallis could not trap Lafayette, and upon his arrival at [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in June, received orders from General Clinton to establish a fortified naval base in Virginia. Following these orders, he fortified [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], and, shadowed by Lafayette, awaited the arrival of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cecere, ''Great Things are Expected from the Virginians: Virginia in the American Revolution'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern and western frontier==
{{Further|[[Western theater of the American Revolutionary War]]}}
[[File:Ftsackville.gif|thumb|left|[[George Rogers Clark]]'s 180 mile (290 km) winter march led to the capture of General [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec]]

West of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and along the border with Quebec, the American Revolutionary War was an &quot;[[American Indian Wars|Indian War]]&quot;. Most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] supported the British. Like the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy, tribes such as the [[Cherokee]]s and the [[Shawnee]]s split into factions. The British supplied their native allies with muskets and gunpowder and advised, while Loyalists led raids against civilian settlements, especially in New York, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. Joint Iroquois-Loyalist attacks in the [[Wyoming Valley massacre|Wyoming Valley]] and at [[Cherry Valley massacre|Cherry Valley]] in 1778 provoked Washington to send the [[Sullivan Expedition]] into western New York during the summer of 1779. There was little fighting as Sullivan systematically destroyed the Indians' winter food supplies, forcing them to flee permanently to British bases in Quebec and the Niagara Falls area.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Gordon Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ohio Country]] and the [[Illinois Country]], the Virginia frontiersman [[George Rogers Clark]] attempted to neutralize British influence among the Ohio tribes by capturing the outposts of [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]] and Cahokia and [[Battle of Vincennes|Vincennes]] in the summer of 1778. When General [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], the British commander at [[Detroit]], retook Vincennes, Clark returned in a surprise march in February 1779 and captured Hamilton.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell Hayes Harrison, ''George Rogers Clark and the War in the West'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1782, Pennsylvania militiamen killed about a hundred neutral Native Americans in the [[Gnadenhütten massacre]]. In the last major encounters of the war, a force of 200 Kentucky militia was defeated at the [[Battle of Blue Licks]] in August 1782.

==Yorktown and the surrender of Cornwallis==
{{Main|Siege of Yorktown}}
[[File:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|''Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown'' by ([[John Trumbull]], 1797)]]

The northern, southern, and naval theaters of the war converged in 1781 at [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. Cornwallis, having been ordered to occupy a fortified position that could be resupplied (and evacuated, if necessary) by sea, had settled in Yorktown, on the York River, which was navigable by sea-going vessels. Aware that the arrival of the French fleet from the West Indies would give the allies control of the Chesapeake, Washington began moving the American and French forces south toward Virginia in August. In early September, French naval forces defeated a British fleet at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], cutting off Cornwallis' escape. When Washington arrived outside Yorktown, the combined Franco-American force of 18,900 men began [[Siege of Yorktown|besieging Cornwallis]] in early October. For several days, the French and Americans bombarded the British defenses, and then began taking the outer positions. Cornwallis decided his position was becoming untenable, and he surrendered his entire army of over 7,000 men on October 19, 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ferrie, ''The World Turned Upside Down: George Washington and the Battle of Yorktown'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the surrender at Yorktown, King George lost control of Parliament to the peace party, and there were no further major military activities in North America. The British had 30,000 garrison troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah.&lt;ref&gt;Mackesy, p.&amp;nbsp;435.&lt;/ref&gt; The war continued elsewhere, including the siege of Gibraltar and naval operations in the East and West Indies, until peace was agreed in 1783.

==Treaty of Paris==
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}

In London, as political support for the war [[wiktionary:plummet|plummeted]] after Yorktown, [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford|Lord North]] resigned in March 1782. In April 1782, the Commons voted to end the war in America. Preliminary peace articles were signed in Paris at the end of November, 1782; the formal end of the war did not occur until the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaties of Versailles]] were signed on September 3, 1783. The last British troops [[Evacuation Day (New York)|left New York City]] on November 25, 1783, and the United States [[Congress of the Confederation]] ratified the Paris treaty on January 14, 1784.

Britain negotiated the Paris peace treaty without consulting her Native American allies and ceded all Native American territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the United States. Full of resentment, Native Americans reluctantly confirmed these land cessions with the United States in a series of treaties, but the fighting would be renewed in conflicts along the frontier in the coming years, the largest being the [[Northwest Indian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Benn (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt; The British would continue to support the Indians against the new American nation especially when hostilities resumed [[War of 1812|29 years later]]

==Historical assessment==
===Advantages and disadvantages of the opposing sides===
The Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, and no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. At first, the Americans had no international allies. However the American cause eventually attracted alliances and supporters, especially from France, the Netherlands, and Spain. The British had no supporters throughout the conflict, apart from small German states that were willing to send troops (&quot;Hessians&quot;) to do much of the fighting. The Americans had a large, relatively prosperous population (when compared to other colonies) that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army that the Congress set up.&lt;ref&gt;Pole and Greene, eds. '' Companion to the American Revolution'' ch 36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain had a large, efficient, and well-financed government, with good credit, and the largest and best navy in the world. Its army was relatively small, but the officer corps and noncommissioned officers were professionals with high levels of skill and many years of experience. Distance was a major problem: most troops and supplies had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. The British usually had [[military logistics|logistical]] problems whenever they operated away from port cities. Additionally, ocean travel meant that British communications were always about two months out of date: by the time British generals in America received their orders from London, the military situation had usually changed.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;298, 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppressing a rebellion in America also posed other problems. Since the colonies covered a large area and had not been united before the war, there was no central area of strategic importance. In Europe, the capture of a capital often meant the end of a war; in America, when the British seized cities such as New York, Philadelphia or Boston, the war continued unabated. Furthermore, the large size of the colonies meant that the British lacked the manpower to control them by force. Once any area had been occupied, troops had to be kept there or the Revolutionaries would regain control, and these troops were thus unavailable for further offensive operations. In addition, despite the professionalism and discipline of the British troops, unfamiliar guerrilla warfare and skirmishing greatly hindered their gains early on. The British had sufficient troops to defeat the Americans on the battlefield but not enough to simultaneously occupy the colonies. This manpower shortage became critical after French and Spanish entry into the war, because British troops had to be dispersed in several [[theater (warfare)|theaters]], where previously they had been concentrated in America.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;298, 306; Black (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;29, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Revolution Campaigns 1775 to 1781.jpg|thumb|Map of campaigns in the Revolutionary War]]
The British also had the difficult task of fighting the war while simultaneously retaining the allegiance of Loyalists. Loyalist support was important, since the goal of the war was to keep the colonies in the British Empire, but this imposed numerous military limitations. Early in the war, the Howe brothers served as peace commissioners while simultaneously conducting the war effort, a dual role which may have limited their effectiveness. Additionally, the British could have recruited more slaves and Native Americans to fight the war, but this would have alienated many Loyalists, even more so than the controversial hiring of German mercenaries. The need to retain Loyalist allegiance also meant that the British could not use the harsh methods of suppressing rebellion they employed in Ireland and Scotland. Even with these limitations, many potentially neutral colonists were nonetheless driven into the ranks of the Revolutionaries because of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;14–16 (Harsh methods), pp.&amp;nbsp;35, 38 (slaves and Indians), p.&amp;nbsp;16 (neutrals into revolutionaries)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs of the war===
====Casualties====
The total loss of life resulting from the American Revolutionary War is unknown. As was typical in the wars of the era, disease claimed more lives than battle. Between 1775 and 1782, a [[North American smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic]] raged across much of North America, killing more than 130,000 people. Historian [[Joseph Ellis]] suggests that Washington's decision to have his troops [[inoculation|inoculated]] against the [[smallpox]] epidemic was one of his most important decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Smallpox epidemic: Fenn, p.&amp;nbsp;275. A great number of these smallpox deaths occurred outside the theater of war—in Mexico or among Native Americans west of the Mississippi River. Washington and inoculation: Ellis, p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 25,000 American Revolutionaries died during active military service. About 8,000 of these deaths were in battle; the other 17,000 recorded deaths were from disease, including about 8,000–12,000 who died of starvation or disease brought on by deplorable conditions while [[POW|prisoners of war]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Burrows&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2008/5/2008_5_54.shtml Edwin G. Burrows] &quot;Patriots or Terrorists?,&quot; ''American Heritage'', Fall 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; most in rotting British [[Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War|prison ships]] in New York. This tally of deaths from disease is undoubtedly too low, however; 2,500 Americans died while encamped at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-78 alone. The number of Revolutionaries seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000. The total American military [[casualty (person)|casualty]] figure was therefore as high as 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;American dead and wounded: Shy, pp.&amp;nbsp;249–50. The lower figure for number of wounded comes from Chambers, p.&amp;nbsp;849.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 171,000 sailors served for the British during the war; about 25 to 50 percent of them had been [[impressment|pressed]] into service. About 1,240 were killed in battle, while 18,500 died from disease. The greatest killer was [[scurvy]], a disease known to be easily preventable by issuing lemon juice to sailors. About 42,000 British sailors [[desertion|deserted]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Mackesy (1964), pp.&amp;nbsp;6, 176 (British seamen)&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 1,200 Germans were killed in action and 6,354 died from illness or accident. About 16,000 of the remaining German troops returned home, but roughly 5,500 remained in the United States after the war for various reasons, many eventually becoming American citizens. No reliable statistics exist for the number of casualties among other groups, including Loyalists, British regulars, Native Americans, French and Spanish troops, and civilians.

====Financial costs====
The British spent about £80 million and ended with a [[national debt]] of £250 million, which it easily financed at about £9.5 million a year in interest. The French spent 1.3 billion livres (about £56 million). Their total national debt was £187 million, which they could not easily finance; over half the French national revenue went to debt service in the 1780s. The debt crisis became a major enabling factor of the [[French Revolution]] as the government could not raise taxes without public approval.&lt;ref&gt;Tombs (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;179&lt;/ref&gt; The United States spent $37 million at the national level plus $114 million by the states. This was mostly covered by loans from France and the Netherlands, loans from Americans, and issuance of an increasing amount of paper money (which became &quot;not worth a continental.&quot;) The U.S. finally solved its debt and currency problems in the 1790s when [[Alexander Hamilton]] spearheaded the establishment of the [[First Bank of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--And Spain?--&gt;

[[File:Galvanometer 1890 drawing.png|thumb|200px|Current can be measured by a [[galvanometer]], via the deflection of a magnetic needle in the magnetic field created by the current.]]

The '''ampere''' (symbol: A) is the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[electric current]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BIPMdefinition&quot;&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/ampere.html BIPM official definition]&lt;/ref&gt; (symbol: I) and is one of the seven&lt;ref&gt;The other six are the [[metre]], [[kelvin]], [[second]], [[Mole (unit)|mole]], [[candela]] and the [[kilogram]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[SI base unit]]s. It is named after [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of electrodynamics. In practice, its name is often shortened to '''amp'''.

In practical terms, the ampere is a measure of the amount of [[electric charge]] passing a point per unit time. Around 6.241&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[electron]]s, or one [[coulomb]], passing a given point each second constitutes one ampere.&lt;ref&gt;Bodanis, David. (2005). ''Electric Universe.'' New York: Three Rivers Press&lt;/ref&gt;

This force is used in the formal definition of the ampere which states that it is &quot;the constant current which will produce an attractive force of 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt; [[newton (unit)|newton]] per metre of length between two straight, parallel conductors of infinite length and negligible circular [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] placed one [[metre]] apart in a [[vacuum]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIPMdefinition&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul M.

In terms of Ampère's force law,
:&lt;math&gt;2 \times 10^{-7}\ {\rm\tfrac N m}=2 \times k_A\frac{{\rm A}\cdot {\rm A}}{{\rm m}}&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt;1\ {\rm A}=\sqrt{\frac{2\times 10^{-7}\rm\ N}{2\times k_A}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[SI]] unit of charge, the [[coulomb]], &quot;is the quantity of electricity carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]]. (2006).[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf ''The International System of Units (SI)''], 8th ed. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second:
:&lt;math&gt;\rm 1\ A=1\tfrac C s&lt;/math&gt;
That is, in general, charge ''Q'' is determined by steady current ''I'' flowing for a time ''t'' as ''Q'' = ''It''.

== History ==
The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS system]] electromagnetic unit of current (now known as the [[abampere]]), the amount of current which generates a force of two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML A short history of the SI units in electricity]&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the [[International System of Units|MKSA system]] would be conveniently sized.

The &quot;international ampere&quot; was an early realisation of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit {{val|0.001118000}} grams of silver per second from a [[silver nitrate]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm History of the ampere]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is 0.99985&amp;nbsp;A.

== Realization ==

The ampere is most accurately realised using a [[watt balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's Law]] from the units of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html Practical realisation of unit definitions: Electrical quantities]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, techniques to establish the realisation of an ampere have a [[relative uncertainty]] of approximately a few parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and involve realisations of the watt, the ohm and the volt.&lt;ref name=SI_brochre&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html BIPM SI brochure; Appendix 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed future definition ==
Rather than a definition in terms of the force between two current-carrying wires, it has been [[New SI definitions|proposed to define the ampere]] in terms of the rate of flow of elementary charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm Beyond the Kilogram: Redefining the International System of Units]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since a [[coulomb]] is approximately equal to {{val|6.24150948|e=18}} [[elementary charge]]s, one ampere is approximately equivalent to {{val|6.24150948|e=18}} elementary charges per second{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, such as [[electron]]s, moving past a boundary in one second. The proposed change would define 1 A as being the current in the direction of flow of a particular number of elementary charges per second. In 2005, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) agreed to study the proposed change. The new definition is expected to be [[New SI definitions|formally proposed]] at the 25th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 2015.

== Everyday examples ==
The current drawn by typical systems is usually dictated by the power ([[watts]]) consumed by the system and voltage supplied. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.

=== Portable gadgets ===
*Hearing aid (typically 1&amp;nbsp;mW at 1.4&amp;nbsp;V): 0.7&amp;nbsp;mA

=== Motorcars - 12&amp;nbsp;V DC ===
A typical motor car has a 12&amp;nbsp;V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:
*Headlights (typically 60&amp;nbsp;W): 5&amp;nbsp;A each.
*Instrument panel light (typically 2&amp;nbsp;W): 166&amp;nbsp;mA.
*Starter Motor (typically 1-2&amp;nbsp;kW): 80-160&amp;nbsp;A

=== US domestic supply - 120&amp;nbsp;V AC ===
Most United States domestic power suppliers run at 120&amp;nbsp;V.

Household [[circuit breaker]]s typically provide a maximum of 15&amp;nbsp;A or 20&amp;nbsp;A of current to a given set of outlets.

=== European domestic supply - 230&amp;nbsp;V AC ===
Most European domestic power supplies run at 230&amp;nbsp;V, so the current drawn for a particular appliance will be less than for an equivalent United States appliance.  This means that lighter (and cheaper) cabling can be used.

The current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:
*Toaster, kettle (2&amp;nbsp;kW): 9&amp;nbsp;A
*Immersion heater (4.6&amp;nbsp;kW): 20&amp;nbsp;A
*Tungsten light bulb (60&amp;nbsp;W - 100&amp;nbsp;W): 250&amp;nbsp;mA - 450&amp;nbsp;mA
*22&amp;nbsp;inch/56&amp;nbsp;cm Portable Television (35&amp;nbsp;W): 150&amp;nbsp;mA

[[Image:Euclid flowchart 1.png|200px|thumb|lright| [[Flow chart]] of an algorithm ([[Euclid's algorithm]]) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≤ A yields &quot;yes&quot; (or true) (more accurately the ''number'' ''b'' in location B is less than or equal to the ''number'' ''a'' in location A) THEN the algorithm specifies B ← B - A (meaning the number ''b'' - ''a'' replaces the old ''b''). Similarly IF A &gt; B THEN A ← A - B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).]]

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], an '''algorithm''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|en-us-algorithm.ogg|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə|r|ɪ|ð|ə|m}}) is an [[effective method]] expressed as a finite list&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words&quot; (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; of well-defined instructions&lt;ref&gt;Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: &quot;There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations&quot; (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers)  . . . this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality&quot;, (Rogers 1987:1).&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms are used for [[calculation]], [[data processing]], and [[automated reasoning]].

Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[null]]),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[|quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins&quot; (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, will proceed through a finite &lt;ref&gt;&quot;A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'&quot; (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing &quot;output&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs&quot; (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: &quot;a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice&quot; Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt;

A partial formalization of the concept began with attempts to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (the &quot;decision problem&quot;) posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define &quot;[[effective calculability]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;effective method&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225&lt;/ref&gt; those formalizations included the [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]–[[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]–[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s of 1930, 1934 and 1935, [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] of 1936, [[Emil Post]]'s &quot;[[Formulation 1]]&quot; of 1936, and [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machines]] of 1936–7 and 1939.

While there is no generally accepted ''formal'' definition of &quot;algorithm,&quot; an informal definition could be &quot;a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; For some people, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually; for others, a program is only an algorithm if it stops before a given number of calculation steps.&lt;ref&gt;Stone simply requires that &quot;it must terminate in a finite number of steps&quot; (Stone 1973:7-8).&lt;/ref&gt;

A prototypical example of an algorithm is [[Euclid's algorithm]] to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the flow chart above and as an example in a later section.

{{Harvtxt|Boolos|Jeffrey|1974, 1999}} offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †&quot;smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons&quot;) to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give '''explicit instructions for determining the ''n''th member of the set''', for arbitrary finite ''n''. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which '''they could be followed by a computing machine''', or by a '''human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols'''&lt;ref&gt;Boolos and Jeffrey 1974,1999:19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term &quot;enumerably infinite&quot; means &quot;countable using integers perhaps extending to infinity.&quot; Thus Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that &quot;creates&quot; output integers from an ''arbitrary'' &quot;input&quot; integer or integers that, in theory, can be chosen from 0 to infinity. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as '''y = m + n''' — two arbitrary &quot;input variables&quot; '''m''' and '''n''' that produce an output '''y'''. But various authors' attempts to define the notion (see more at [[Algorithm characterizations]]) indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):
:Precise instructions (in language understood by &quot;the computer&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1972:5&lt;/ref&gt; for a fast, efficient, &quot;good&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7 states: &quot;In practice we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' agorithms ... one criterion of goodness is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm ... other criteria are the adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicty and elegance, etc.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; process that specifies the &quot;moves&quot; of &quot;the computer&quot; (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1973:6&lt;/ref&gt; to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols '''m''' and '''n''', symbols '''+''' and '''=''' ... and &quot;effectively&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:7-8 states that there must be &quot;a procedure that a robot [i.e. computer] can follow in order to determine pecisely how to obey the instruction&quot;. Stone adds finiteness of the process, and definiteness (having no ambiguity in the instructions) to this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; produce, in a &quot;reasonable&quot; time,&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, loc. cit&lt;/ref&gt; output-integer '''y''' at a specified place and in a specified format.

The concept of ''algorithm'' is also used to define the notion of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]]. That notion is central for explaining how [[formal system]]s come into being starting from a small set of [[axiom]]s and rules. In [[logic]], the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of ''algorithm'' that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.

== Formalization ==
&lt;!-- If you change this heading's title, [[Computer program]] links here. --&gt;
Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many [[computer program]]s contain algorithms that specify the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):
&lt;blockquote&gt; Minsky: &quot;But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could &quot;naturally&quot; be called effective, can in fact be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments . . . in its favor are hard to refute&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minsky 1967:105&quot;&gt;Minsky 1967:105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;Gurevich: &quot;...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich 2000:1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data is read from an input source, written to an output device, and/or stored for further processing. Stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more [[data structure]]s.

For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).

Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation will always be critical to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting &quot;from the top&quot; and going &quot;down to the bottom&quot;, an idea that is described more formally by ''[[control flow|flow of control]]''.

So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of [[imperative programming]]. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, &quot;mechanical&quot; means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the [[assignment operation]], setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of &quot;[[memory]]&quot; as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.

For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]] .

=== Termination ===
Some writers restrict the definition of ''algorithm'' to procedures that eventually finish. In such a category Kleene places the &quot;''decision procedure'' or ''decision method'' or ''algorithm'' for the question&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:136&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including Kleene, include procedures that could run forever without stopping; such a procedure has been called a &quot;computational method&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1997:5&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;''calculation procedure'' or ''algorithm'' (and hence a ''calculation problem'') in relation to a general question which requires for an answer, not yes or no, but '''the exhibiting of some object'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Boldface added, Kleene 1952:137&lt;/ref&gt;

Minsky makes the pertinent observation, in regards to determining whether an algorithm will eventually terminate (from a particular starting state):
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if the length of the process isn't known in advance, then &quot;trying&quot; it may not be decisive, because if the process does go on forever—then at no time will we ever be sure of the answer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minsky 1967:105&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As it happens, no other method can do any better, as was shown by [[Alan Turing]] with his celebrated result on the undecidability of the so-called [[halting problem]]. There is no algorithmic procedure for determining whether or not arbitrary algorithms terminate from given starting states. The analysis of algorithms for their likelihood of termination is called [[termination analysis]].

See the examples of (im-)&quot;proper&quot; subtraction at [[partial function]] for more about what can happen when an algorithm fails for certain of its input numbers—e.g., (i) non-termination, (ii) production of &quot;junk&quot; (output in the wrong format to be considered a number) or no number(s) at all (halt ends the computation with no output), (iii) wrong number(s), or (iv) a combination of these. Kleene proposed that the production of &quot;junk&quot; or failure to produce a number is solved by having the algorithm detect these instances and produce e.g., an error message (he suggested &quot;0&quot;), or preferably, force the algorithm into an endless loop.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:325&lt;/ref&gt; Davis (1958) does this to his subtraction algorithm—he fixes his algorithm in a second example so that it is proper subtraction and it terminates.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1958:12–15&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the logical outcomes &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; Kleene (1952) also proposes the use of a third logical symbol &quot;u&quot; — undecided&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:332&lt;/ref&gt; — thus an algorithm will always produce ''something'' when confronted with a &quot;proposition&quot;. The problem of wrong answers must be solved with an independent &quot;proof&quot; of the algorithm e.g., using induction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We normally require auxiliary evidence for this [that the algorithm correctly defines a [[mu recursive function]]], e.g, in the form of an inductive proof that, for each argument value, the computation terminates with a unique value.&lt;ref&gt;Minsky 1967:186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Expressing algorithms ===
Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including [[natural language]]s, [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart]]s, [[programming language]]s or [[control table]]s (processed by [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]]). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements, while remaining independent of a particular implementation language. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given [[Turing machine]] program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at [[finite state machine]] and [[state transition table]]), as flowcharts (see more at [[state diagram]]), or as a form of rudimentary [[machine code]] or [[assembly code]] called &quot;sets of quadruples&quot; (see more at [[Turing machine]]).

Sometimes it is helpful in the description of an algorithm to supplement small &quot;flow charts&quot; (state diagrams) with natural-language and/or arithmetic expressions written inside &quot;[[block diagram]]s&quot; to summarize what the &quot;flow charts&quot; are accomplishing.

Representations of algorithms are generally classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:157&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1 High-level description''':
:: &quot;...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head.&quot;
*'''2 Implementation description''':
:: &quot;...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level we do not give details of states or transition function.&quot;
*'''3 Formal description''':
:: Most detailed, &quot;lowest level&quot;, gives the Turing machine's &quot;state table&quot;.

:''For an example of the simple algorithm &quot;Add m+n&quot; described in all three levels see [[Algorithm examples]].''

== Implementation ==
Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as [[computer programs]]. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological [[neural network]] (for example, the [[human brain]] implementing [[arithmetic]] or an insect looking for food), in an [[electrical circuit]], or in a mechanical device.

== Computer algorithms ==
[[File:Euclid's algorithm structured blocks 1.png|thumb|right| Flowchart examples of the canonical Böhm-Jacopini structures: the SEQUENCE (rectangles descending the page), the WHILE-DO and the IF-THEN-ELSE. The three structures are made of the primitive conditional GOTO (IF ''test''=true THEN GOTO step xxx) (a diamond), the unconditional GOTO (rectangle), various assignment operators (rectangle), and HALT (rectangle). Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100,114).]]

In [[computer systems]], an algorithm is basically an instance of [[logic]] written in [[software]] by software developers to be effective for the intended &quot;target&quot; computer(s), in order for the target machines to produce ''output'' from given ''input'' (perhaps null).

'''&quot;Elegant&quot; (compact) programs, &quot;good&quot; (fast) programs ''': The notion of &quot;simplicity and elegance&quot; appears informally in Knuth and precisely in Chaitin:
:Knuth: &quot;. . .we want ''good'' algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion . . . is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm . . .. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7&lt;/ref&gt;

:Chaitin: &quot; . . . a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin 2005:32&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaitin prefaces his definition with: &quot;I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'&quot; -- such a proof would solve the [[Halting problem]] (ibid).

'''Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm''': For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This will be true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that &quot;It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of ''algorithm'', i.e. procedure and the notion of ''function computable by algorithm'', i.e. mapping yielded by procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1987:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness) -- an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example of using Euclid's algorithm will be shown below.

'''Computers (and computors), models of computation''': A computer (or human &quot;computor&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In his essay &quot;Calculations by Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis&quot; Seig 2002:390 credits this distinction to Robin Gandy, cf Wilfred Seig, et. al., 2002 ''Reflections on the foundations of mathematics: Essays in honor of Solomon Feferman'', Association for Symbolic Logic, A. K Peters Ltd, Natick, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a restricted type of machine, a &quot;discrete deterministic mechanical device&quot;&lt;ref&gt;cf Gandy 1980:126, Robin Gandy ''Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms'' appearing on pp.123-148 in J. Barwise et. al. 1980 ''The Kleene Symposium'', North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; that blindly follows its instructions.&lt;ref&gt;A &quot;robot&quot;: &quot;A computer is a robot that will perform any task that can be described as a sequence of instructions&quot; cf Stone 1972:3&lt;/ref&gt; Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models&lt;ref&gt;Lambek’s &quot;abacus&quot; is a &quot;countably infinite number of locations (holes, wires etc.) together with an unlimited supply of counters (pebbles, beads, etc). The locations are distinguishable, the counters are not&quot;. The holes will have unlimited capacity, and standing by is an agent who understands and is able to carry out the list of instructions&quot; (Lambek 1961:295). Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as &quot;an indefinitely large number of locations . . . an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program&quot; (Melzak 1961:283). B-B-J (loc. cit.) add the stipulation that the holes are &quot;capable of holding any number of stones&quot; (p. 46). Both Melzak and Lambek appear in ''The Canadian Mathematical Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3, September 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable ''locations'', (ii) discrete, indistinguishable ''counters''&lt;ref&gt;If no confusion will result, the word &quot;counters&quot; can be dropped, and a location can be said to contain a single &quot;number&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are ''effective'' relative to the capability of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We say that an instruction is ''effective'' if there is a procedure that the robot can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction&quot; (Stone 1972:6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's &quot;abacus&quot; model in his &quot;Very Simple Bases for Computability&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;cf Minsky 1967: Chapter 11 &quot;Computer models&quot; and Chapter 14 &quot;Very Simple Bases for Computability&quot; pp. 255-281 in particular&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minsky machine|Minsky's machine]] proceeds sequentially through its five (or six depending on how one counts) instructions unless either a conditional IF - THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three ''assignment'' (replacement, substitution)&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:3.&lt;/ref&gt; operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L - 1).&lt;ref&gt;But always preceded by IF-THEN to avoid improper subtraction.&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely will a programmer have to write &quot;code&quot; with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is [[Turing complete]] with only four general ''types'' of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.&lt;ref&gt;However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction &quot; Z ← 0 &quot;; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx will be unconditional.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simulation of an algorithm: computer(computor) language''': Knuth advises the reader that &quot;the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can ''effectively'' execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't then for the algorithm to be effective it must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1972:5. Methods for extracting roots are not trivial: see [[Methods of computing square roots]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that the programmer must know a &quot;language&quot; that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).

But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes &quot;even if we base [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of ''simulation'' enters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cf page 875 in Peter van Emde Boas's &quot;Machine Models and Simulation&quot; in [[Jan van Leeuwen]] ed., 1990, &quot;Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science. Volume A: algoritms and Compexity&quot;, The MIT Press/Elsevier, ISBN 0-444-88071-2 (Volume A).&lt;/ref&gt; When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a &quot;modulus&quot; (division) instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's &quot;decrement&quot;).

'''Structured programming, canonical structures''': Per the [[Church-Turing thesis]] any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be [[Turing complete]], and per Minsky's demonstrations Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that while &quot;undisciplined&quot; use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in &quot;[[spaghetti code]]&quot; a programmer can write structured programs using these instructions; on the other hand &quot;it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Kemeney]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] 1985 ''Back to Basic: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, MA, ISBN 0-201-13433-0.&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe augments the three Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures:&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:101&lt;/ref&gt; SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:142&lt;/ref&gt; An additional benefit of a structured program will be one that lends itself to [[proof of correctness|proofs of correctness]] using [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973 section 1.2.1, expanded by Tausworthe 1977 at pages 100ff and Chapter 9.1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canonical flowchart symbols&lt;ref&gt;cf Tausworthe 1977&lt;/ref&gt;''': The graphical aide called a [[flowchart]] offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only 4: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can &quot;nest&quot; in rectangles but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in an (unsorted) list of numbers. The solution necessarily requires looking at every number in the list, but only once at each. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description English prose, as:

'''High-level description:'''
# Assume the first item is largest.
# Look at each of the remaining items in the list and if it is larger than the largest item so far, make a note of it.
# The last noted item is the largest in the list when the process is complete.

'''(Quasi-)formal description:'''
Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in [[pseudocode]] or [[pidgin code]]:

{{algorithm-begin|name=LargestNumber}}
   Input: A non-empty list of numbers ''L''.
   Output: The ''largest'' number in the list ''L''.

   ''largest'' ← ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
   '''for each''' ''item'' '''in''' the list ''(Length(L)≥1)'', '''do'''
     '''if''' the ''item'' &gt; ''largest'', '''then'''
       ''largest'' ← the ''item''
   '''return''' ''largest''

=== Euclid’s algorithm ===

[[File:Euclid's algorithm Book VII Proposition 2 2.png|250px|thumb|right|The example-diagram of Euclid's algorithm from T.L. Heath 1908 with more detail added. Euclid does not go beyond a third measuring and gives no numerical examples. Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: &quot;I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtact this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 will be left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7.&quot; Heath comments that &quot;The last phrase is curious, but the meaning of it is obvious enough, as also the meaning of the phrase about ending &quot;at one and the same number&quot;(Heath 1908:300).]]

Euclid’s algorithm appears as Proposition II in Book VII (&quot;Elementary Number Theory&quot;) of his ''Elements''.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1908:300; Hawking’s Dover 2005 edition derives from Heath.&lt;/ref&gt;  Euclid poses the problem: &quot;Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure&quot;. He defines &quot;A number [to be] a multitude composed of units&quot;: a counting number, a positive integer not including 0. And to &quot;measure&quot; is to place a shorter measuring length ''s'' successively (''q'' times) along longer length ''l'' until the remaining portion ''r'' is less than the shorter length ''s''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot; 'Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself.' This is a neat abbreviation for saying, measure along BA successive lengths equal to CD until a point F is reached such that the length FA remaining is less than CD; in other words, let BF be the largest exact multiple of CD contained in BA&quot; (Heath 1908:297&lt;/ref&gt; In modern words, remainder ''r = l - q*s'', ''q'' being the quotient, or remainder ''r'' is the &quot;modulus&quot;, the integer-fractional part left over after the division.&lt;ref&gt;For modern treatments using division in the algorithm see Hardy and Wright 1979:180, Knuth 1973:2 (Volume 1), plus more discussion of Euclid's algorithm in Knuth 1969:293-297 (Volume 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Euclid’s method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be 0, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”, a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields 0).

Euclid's original proof adds a third: the two lengths are not prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a [[reductio ad absurdum]] proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the ''greatest''.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid covers this question in his Proposition 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another it yields the number &quot;1&quot; for their common measure. So to be precise the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.

==== Computer (computor) language for Euclid's algorithm ====
Only a few instruction ''types'' are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.
* A ''location'' is symbolized by upper case letter(s), e.g. S, A, etc.
* The varying quantity (number) in a location will be written in lower case letter(s) and (usually) associated with the location's name. For example, location L at the start might contain the number ''l'' = 3009.

==== An inelegant program for Euclid's algorithm ====
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Inelegant program 1.png|thumb|right|&quot;Inelegant&quot; is a translation of Knuth's version of the algorithm with a subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use of division (or a &quot;modulus&quot; instruction). Derived from Knuth 1973:2-4. Depending on the two numbers &quot;Inelegant&quot; may compute the g.c.d. in fewer steps than &quot;Elegant&quot;.]]

The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's 4-step version of Euclid's and Nichomachus', but rather than using division to find the remainder it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length ''s'' from the remaining length ''r'' until ''r'' is less than ''s''. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2-4:

'''INPUT''':
: 1 [Into two locations L and S put the numbers ''l'' and ''s'' that represent the two lengths]: INPUT L, S
: 2 [Initialize R: make the remaining length ''r'' equal to the starting/initial/input length ''l''] R ← L

'''E0: [Insure ''r'' ≥ ''s''.]'''
: 3 [Insure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R]: IF R &gt; S THEN the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchange-steps 4, 5 and 6: GOTO step 6 ELSE swap the contents of R and S.]
: 4 L ← R (this first step is redundant, but will be useful for later discussion).

==== An elegant program for Euclid's algorithm ====
The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only 6 core instructions to do what 13 are required to do by &quot;Inelegant&quot;; worse, &quot;Inelegant&quot; requires more ''types'' of instructions. The flowchart of &quot;Elegant&quot; can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language the steps are numbered, and the instruction LET [ ] = [ ] is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.
&lt;pre&gt;
   5 REM Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
   6 PRINT &quot;Type two integers greater than 0&quot;
   10 INPUT A,B
   20 IF B=0 THEN GOTO 80
   30 IF A &gt; B THEN GOTO 60
   40 LET B=B-A
   50 GOTO 20
   60 LET A=A-B
   70 GOTO 20
   80 PRINT A
   90 END
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''How &quot;Elegant&quot; works''': In place of an outer &quot;Euclid loop&quot;, &quot;Elegant&quot; shifts back and forth between two &quot;co-loops&quot;, an A &gt; B loop that computes A ← A - B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B - A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend - Subtrahend), the minuend can become ''s'' (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new ''r'' (the length to be measured); in other words the &quot;sense&quot; of the subtraction reverses.

=== Testing the Euclid algorithms ===
Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source&lt;ref&gt;http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII2.html&lt;/ref&gt; uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two relatively-prime numbers 14157 and 5950.

But exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will &quot;Inelegant&quot; perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for &quot;Elegant&quot;: B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? (&quot;Inelegant&quot; computes forever in all cases; &quot;Elegant&quot; computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if ''negative'' numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that [[instantiate]]s it) is a [[partial function]] rather than a [[total function]]. A notable failure due to exceptions is the [[Ariane V]] rocket failure.

'''Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction''': Knuth demonstrates the application of [[mathematical induction]] to an &quot;extended&quot; version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes &quot;a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:13-18. He credits &quot;the formulation of algorithm-proving in terms of asertions and induction&quot; to R. W. Floyd, Peter Naur, C. A. R. Hoare, H. H. Goldstine and J. von Neumann. Tausworth 1977 borrows Knuth's Euclid example and extends Knuth's method in section 9.1 ''Formal Proofs'' (pages 288-298).&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1997:294&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms ===
'''Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed) ''': With only 6 core instructions, &quot;Elegant&quot; is the clear winner compared to &quot;Inelegant&quot; at 13 instructions. However, &quot;Inelegant&quot; is ''faster'' (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). [[Algorithm analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:7 (Vol. I), and his more-detailed analyses on pp. 1969:294-313 (Vol II).&lt;/ref&gt; indicates why this is the case: &quot;Elegant&quot; does ''two'' conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas &quot;Inelegant&quot; only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, ''on average'' much time is wasted doing a &quot;B = 0?&quot; test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.

'''Can the algorithms be improved?''': Once the programmer judges a program &quot;fit&quot; and &quot;effective&quot; -- that is, it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes, can it be improved?

The compactness of &quot;Inelegant&quot; can be improved by the elimination of 5 steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;&lt;ref&gt;Breakdown occurs when an algorithm tries to compact itself. Success would solve the [[Halting problem]].&lt;/ref&gt; rather, it can only be done [[heuristics|heuristically]], i.e. by exhaustive search (examples to be found at [[Busy beaver]]), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of [[inductive reasoning]], etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with &quot;Elegant&quot; provides a hint that these steps together with steps 2 and 3 can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from 13 to 8, which makes it &quot;more elegant&quot; than &quot;Elegant&quot; at 9 steps.

The speed of &quot;Elegant&quot; can be improved by moving the B=0? test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of 3 instructions (B=0?, A=0?, GOTO). Now &quot;Elegant&quot; computes the example-numbers faster; whether for any given A, B and R, S this is always the case would require a detailed analysis.

== Algorithmic analysis ==
{{Main|Analysis of algorithms}}
It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the [[analysis of algorithms]] to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(''n''), using the [[big O notation]] with ''n'' as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore it is said to have a space requirement of ''O(1)'', if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(''n'') if it is counted.

Different algorithms may  complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '[[algorithmic efficiency|effort]]' than others. For example, a [[binary search]] algorithm will usually outperform a [[Brute-force search|brute force]] sequential search when used for [[lookup table|table lookup]]s on sorted lists.

=== Formal versus empirical ===
{{Main|Empirical algorithmics|Profiling (computer programming)|Program optimization}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
The [[analysis of algorithms|analysis and study of algorithms]] is a discipline of [[computer science]], and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific [[programming language]] or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually [[pseudocode]] is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware / software platforms and their [[algorithmic efficiency]] is eventually put to the test using real code.

Empirical testing is useful because it may  uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. [[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmark]]s may  be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after [[program optimization]].

== Classification ==
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

=== By implementation ===
One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.

* '''Recursion''' or '''iteration''': A [[recursive algorithm]] is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition matches, which is a method common to [[functional programming]]. [[Iteration|Iterative]] algorithms use repetitive constructs like [[Control flow#Loops|loops]] and sometimes additional data structures like [[Stack (data structure)|stacks]] to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, [[towers of Hanoi]] is well understood in recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.
* '''Logical''': An algorithm may  be viewed as controlled [[Deductive reasoning|logical deduction]]. This notion may  be expressed as: '''Algorithm = logic + control'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The logic component expresses the axioms that may  be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the [[logic programming]] paradigm. In pure logic programming languages the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]]: a change in the axioms has a well-defined change in the algorithm.
* '''Serial''' or '''parallel''' or '''distributed''': Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to [[parallel algorithm]]s or [[distributed algorithms]]. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a [[Computer Network|network]]. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms, and are called inherently serial problems.
* '''Deterministic''' or '''non-deterministic''': [[Deterministic algorithm]]s solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas [[non-deterministic algorithm]]s solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of [[heuristics]].
* '''Exact''' or '''approximate''': While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [[approximation algorithm]]s seek an approximation that is close to the true solution. Approximation may  use either a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems.
* '''Quantum algorithm''': [[Quantum algorithm]] run on a realistic model of [[quantum computation]]. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of quantum computation such as [[quantum superposition]] or [[quantum entanglement]].

=== By design paradigm ===
Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories will include many different types of algorithms. Some commonly found paradigms include:

* '''[[Brute force search|Brute-force]]''' or '''exhaustive search'''.  This is the naïve method of trying every possible solution to see which is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamental Concepts for the Software Quality Engineer |author=Sue Carroll, Taz Daughtrey |pages=282 et seq.|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bz_cl3B05IcC&amp;pg=PA282 |isbn=9780873897204 |date=2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Divide and conquer'''. A [[divide and conquer algorithm]] repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually [[recursion|recursively]]) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is [[mergesort|merge sorting]]. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a '''decrease and conquer algorithm''', that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage will be more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[binary search algorithm]].
* '''[[Dynamic programming]]'''. When a problem shows [[optimal substructure]], meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems, and [[overlapping subproblems]], meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called ''dynamic programming'' avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [[memoization]] go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a [[Mathematical table|table]] of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.
* '''The greedy method'''. A [[greedy algorithm]] is similar to a [[dynamic programming|dynamic programming algorithm]], but the difference is that solutions to the subproblems do not have to be known at each stage; instead a &quot;greedy&quot; choice can be made of what looks best for the moment. The greedy method extends the solution with the best possible decision (not all feasible decisions) at an algorithmic stage based on the current local optimum and the best decision (not all possible decisions) made in a previous stage. It is not exhaustive, and does not give an accurate answer to many problems. But when it works, it will be the fastest method. The most popular greedy algorithm is finding the minimal spanning tree as given by [[Huffman coding|Huffman Tree]], [[kruskal's algorithm|Kruskal]], [[Prim's algorithm|Prim]], [[Sollin's algorithm|Sollin]].
* '''Linear programming'''. When solving a problem using [[linear programming]], specific [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] involving the inputs are found and then an attempt is made to maximize (or minimize) some linear function of the inputs. Many problems (such as the [[Maximum flow problem|maximum flow]] for directed graphs) can be stated in a linear programming way, and then be solved by a 'generic' algorithm such as the [[simplex algorithm]]. A more complex variant of linear programming is called integer programming, where the solution space is restricted to the [[integers]].
* '''[[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction]]'''. This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better known problem for which we have (hopefully) [[asymptotically optimal]] algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one [[selection algorithm]] for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion).  This technique is also known as ''transform and conquer''.
* '''Search and enumeration'''. Many problems (such as playing [[chess]]) can be modeled as problems on [[graph theory|graphs]]. A [[graph exploration algorithm]] specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes [[search algorithm]]s, [[branch and bound]] enumeration and [[backtracking]].
# [[Randomized algorithm]]s are those that make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly); for some problems, it can in fact be proven that the fastest solutions must involve some [[randomness]]. There are two large classes of such algorithms:
## [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. [[RP (complexity)|RP]] is the subclass of these that run in [[polynomial time]])
## [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. [[Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time|ZPP]].
# In [[optimization problem]]s, [[heuristic]] algorithms do not try to find an optimal solution, but an approximate solution where the time or resources are limited. They are not practical to find perfect solutions. An example of this would be [[local search (optimization)|local search]], [[tabu search]], or [[simulated annealing]] algorithms, a class of heuristic probabilistic algorithms that vary the solution of a problem by a random amount. The name &quot;simulated annealing&quot; alludes to the metallurgic term meaning the heating and cooling of metal to achieve freedom from defects. The purpose of the random variance is to find close to globally optimal solutions rather than simply locally optimal ones, the idea being that the random element will be decreased as the algorithm settles down to a solution. [[Approximation algorithms]] are those heuristic algorithms that additionally provide some bounds on the error. [[Genetic algorithm]]s attempt to find solutions to problems by mimicking biological [[evolution]]ary processes, with a cycle of random mutations yielding successive generations of &quot;solutions&quot;. Thus, they emulate reproduction and &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. In [[genetic programming]], this approach is extended to algorithms, by regarding the algorithm itself as a &quot;solution&quot; to a problem.

=== By field of study ===
{{See also|List of algorithms}}
Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, [[merge algorithm]]s, [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]], [[graph theory|graph algorithms]], [[string algorithms]], [[computational geometry|computational geometric algorithms]], [[combinatorial|combinatorial algorithms]], [[medical algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], [[cryptography]], [[data compression]] algorithms and [[parsing|parsing techniques]].

Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may  improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry, but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.

=== By complexity ===
{{See also|Complexity class| Parameterized complexity}}
Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size. There is a wide variety: some algorithms complete in linear time relative to input size, some do so in an exponential amount of time or even worse, and some never halt. Additionally, some problems may  have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.

Burgin (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;24) uses a generalized definition of algorithms that relaxes the common requirement that the output of the algorithm that computes a function must be determined after a finite number of steps.  He defines a super-recursive class of algorithms as &quot;a class of algorithms in which it is possible to compute functions not computable by any Turing machine&quot; (Burgin 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;107). This is closely related to the study of methods of [[hypercomputation]].

==Continuous algorithms==
The adjective &quot;continuous&quot; when applied to the word &quot;algorithm&quot; can mean:
# An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations – such algorithms are studied in [[numerical analysis]]; or
# An algorithm in the form of a [[differential equation]] that operates continuously on the data, running on an [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=sgDHJlafMskC Adaptation and learning in automatic systems], page 54, Ya. Z. Tsypkin, Z. J. Nikolic, Academic Press, 1971, ISBN 978-0-12-702050-1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
:''See also: [[Software patents]] for a general overview of the patentability of software, including computer-implemented algorithms.''

Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute &quot;processes&quot; (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in [[Gottschalk v. Benson]]). However, practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in [[Diamond v. Diehr]], the application of a simple [[feedback]] algorithm to aid in the curing of [[synthetic rubber]] was deemed patentable. The [[Software patent debate|patenting of software]] is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially [[data compression]] algorithms, such as [[Unisys]]' [[Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|LZW patent]].

Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see [[export of cryptography]]).

==Etymology ==
The word ''&quot;Algorithm&quot;'' or ''&quot;Algorism&quot;'' in some other writing versions, comes from the name [[Al-Khwārizmī]] (c. 780-850), a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[geographer]] and a [[scholar]] in the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]], whose name means ''&quot;the native of [[Khwarezm|Kharazm]]&quot;'', a city that was part of the [[Greater Iran]] during his era and now is in modern day [[Uzbekistan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;toomer&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|[[G.

This title means &quot;Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians&quot;, where &quot;Algoritmi&quot; was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3Sfrxde0CXIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor of Algebra], by Corona Brezina (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through his other book, the [[Al-Jabr|Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Boyer_Foremost_Text.html Foremost mathematical texts in history], according to [[Carl B. Boyer]].&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Latin, ''algorismus'', the corruption of his name, simply meant the &quot;decimal number system&quot; that is still the meaning of modern English [[algorism]]. In 17th century French the word's form, but not its meaning, changed to ''algorithme''. English adopted the French very soon afterwards, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that &quot;Algorithm&quot; took on the meaning that it has in modern English.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of algorithm at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/algorithm Dictionary.Reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History: Development of the notion of &quot;algorithm&quot; ==
=== Discrete and distinguishable symbols ===
'''Tally-marks''': To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks, or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually [[Roman numerals]] and the [[abacus]] evolved (Dilson, p.&amp;nbsp;16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in [[unary numeral system]] arithmetic used in [[Turing machine]] and [[Post–Turing machine]] computations.

=== Manipulation of symbols as &quot;place holders&quot; for numbers: algebra ===
The work of the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek geometers]] ([[Euclidean algorithm]]), [[Islamic mathematics|Persian mathematician]] [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwarizmi]] (from whose name the terms &quot;[[algorism]]&quot; and &quot;algorithm&quot; are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in [[Leibniz]]'s notion of the [[calculus ratiocinator]] (ca 1680):
{{quote|A good century and a half ahead of his time, Leibniz proposed an algebra of logic, an algebra that would specify the rules for manipulating logical concepts in the manner that ordinary algebra specifies the rules for manipulating numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Mechanical contrivances with discrete states ===
'''The clock''': Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven [[clock]] as &quot;The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]&quot;, in particular the [[verge escapement]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:24&lt;/ref&gt; that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. &quot;The accurate automatic machine&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:26&lt;/ref&gt; led immediately to &quot;mechanical [[automata theory|automata]]&quot; beginning in the 13th century and finally to &quot;computational machines&quot; – the [[difference engine]] and [[analytical engine]]s of [[Charles Babbage]] and Countess [[Ada Lovelace]].&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:33–34, 204–206)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logical machines 1870 – [[Stanley Jevons]]' &quot;logical abacus&quot; and &quot;logical machine&quot;''': The technical problem was to reduce [[Boolean equation]]s when presented in a form similar to what are now known as [[Karnaugh map]]s. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple &quot;abacus&quot; of &quot;slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically . . . More recently however I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may  be called a '''Logical Machine'''&quot; His machine came equipped with &quot;certain moveable wooden rods&quot; and &quot;at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] . . .&quot;. With this machine he could analyze a &quot;[[syllogism]] or any other simple logical argument&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from W. Stanley Jevons 1880 ''Elementary Lessons in Logic: Deductive and Inductive'', Macmillan and Co., London and New York. Republished as a googlebook; cf Jevons 1880:199–201. Louis Couturat 1914 ''the Algebra of Logic'', The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago and London. Republished as a googlebook; cf Couturat 1914:75–76 gives a few more details; interestingly he compares this to a typewriter as well as a piano. Jevons states that the account is to be found at Jan . 20, 1870 ''The Proceedings of the Royal Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons 1880:199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Another logician [[John Venn]], however, in his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: &quot;I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines&quot;; see more at [[Algorithm characterizations]]. But not to be outdone he too presented &quot;a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's ''abacus'' ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may  be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from John Venn 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', Macmillan and Co., London. Republished as a googlebook. cf Venn 1881:120–125. The interested reader can find a deeper explanation in those pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony—the electromechanical relay''': Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the [[Jacquard loom]] (1801), precursor to [[Hollerith cards]] (punch cards, 1887), and &quot;telephone switching technologies&quot; were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers.&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Newell diagram 1971:39, cf. Davis 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century the [[telegraph]], the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as &quot;dots and dashes&quot; a common sound. By the late 19th century the [[ticker tape]] (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the [[Teletype]] (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of [[Baudot code]] on tape.

'''Telephone-switching networks''' of electromechanical [[relay]]s (invented 1835) was behind the work of [[George Stibitz]] (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the &quot;burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. &quot;He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;* Melina Hill, Valley News Correspondent, ''A Tinkerer Gets a Place in History'', Valley News West Lebanon NH, Thursday March 31, 1983, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two &quot;binary states&quot; ''open'' and ''closed''):
: It was only with the development, beginning in the 1930s, of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays, that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics during the 1800s up to the mid-1900s ===
'''Symbols and rules''': In rapid succession the mathematics of [[George Boole]] (1847, 1854), [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879), and [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'' (1888) was &quot;the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:81ff&lt;/ref&gt;

But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is &quot;perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a &quot; 'formula language', that is a ''lingua characterica'', a language written with special symbols, &quot;for pure thought&quot;, that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary on Frege's ''Begriffsschrift, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought'' in van Heijenoort 1967:1&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in their [[Principia Mathematica]] (1910–1913).

'''The paradoxes''': At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (1897), the [[Russell paradox]] (1902–03), and the [[Richard Paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1906, cf. Kleene 1952:36–40&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant considerations led to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s paper (1931) — he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of [[recursion]] to numbers.

'''Effective calculability''': In an effort to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an &quot;effective method&quot; or &quot;effective calculation&quot; or &quot;effective calculability&quot; (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: [[Alonzo Church]], [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J.B. Rosser]]'s [[λ-calculus]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. footnote in Alonzo Church 1936a in Davis 1965:90 and 1936b in Davis 1965:110&lt;/ref&gt; a finely honed definition of &quot;general recursion&quot; from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of [[Jacques Herbrand]] (cf. Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935–6 in Davis 1965:237ff, Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:255ff&lt;/ref&gt; Church's proof&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in Davis 1965:88ff&lt;/ref&gt; that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, [[Emil Post]]'s definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction.&lt;ref&gt;cf. &quot;Formulation I&quot;, Post 1936 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Turing]]'s proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his &quot;a- [automatic-] machine&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:116ff&lt;/ref&gt; – in effect almost identical to Post's &quot;formulation&quot;, [[J. Barkley Rosser]]'s definition of &quot;effective method&quot; in terms of &quot;a machine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:226&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. C. Kleene]]'s proposal of a precursor to &quot;[[Church thesis]]&quot; that he called &quot;Thesis I&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:273–274&lt;/ref&gt; and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis &quot;Church's Thesis&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:300, 317&lt;/ref&gt; and proposing &quot;Turing's Thesis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:376&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936–7, 1939)===
Here is a remarkable coincidence of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations—and they yield virtually identical definitions.

[[Emil Post]] (1936) described the actions of a &quot;computer&quot; (human being) as follows:
:&quot;...two concepts are involved: that of a ''symbol space'' in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable ''set of directions''.

His symbol space would be
:&quot;a two way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes... The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.

:&quot;One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes....

:&quot;A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem. This process will terminate only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; See more at [[Post–Turing machine]]

[[Alan Turing]]'s work&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in Davis 1965, Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt; preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: &quot;Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and Teletypes we might conjecture that all were influences.

Turing—his model of computation is now called a [[Turing machine]] — begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and &quot;states of mind&quot;. But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7:116)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may  suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book....I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may  be printed is finite....

:&quot;The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his &quot;state of mind&quot; at that moment. We may  suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...

:&quot;Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136&quot;&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's reduction yields the following:
:&quot;The simple operations must therefore include:
::&quot;(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares
::&quot;(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.
&quot;It may  be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must therefore be taken to be one of the following:
::&quot;(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.
::&quot;(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind&quot;

:&quot;We may  now construct a machine to do the work of this computer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136&quot;/&gt;

A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:
:&quot;A function is said to be &quot;effectively calculable&quot; if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition . . . [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to Gödel, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing and Post] . . . We may  take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability . . . .
::&quot;† We shall use the expression &quot;computable function&quot; to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let &quot;effectively calculable&quot; refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943) ===
'''[[J. Barkley Rosser]]''' boldly defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (boldface added):
:&quot;'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that '''an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer'''. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.&quot; (Rosser 1939:225–6)

Rosser's footnote #5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I'' (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–7) in their mechanism-models of computation.

'''[[Stephen C. Kleene]]''' defined as his now-famous &quot;Thesis I&quot; known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):
:&quot;12. '''Algorithmic theories'''... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; to the question, &quot;is the predicate value true?&quot;&quot; (Kleene 1943:273)

=== History after 1950 ===
A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of &quot;algorithm&quot;, and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, [[foundations of mathematics]] (especially the [[Church–Turing thesis]]) and [[philosophy of mind]] (especially arguments around [[artificial intelligence]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Doperwt rijserwt peulen Pisum sativum.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Peas are an annual plant.]]

An '''annual plant''' is a plant that usually germinates, flowers, and dies in a year or season. True annuals will only live longer than a year if they are prevented from setting seed. Some seedless plants can also be considered annuals even though they do not grow a flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-63859 Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In gardening, annual often refers to a plant grown outdoors in the spring and summer and surviving just for one growing season. 
Many food plants are, or are grown as, annuals, including virtually all domesticated [[Cereal|grain]]s. Some [[perennial plant|perennials]] and [[biennial plant|biennials]] are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience, particularly if they are not considered [[hardiness (plants)|cold hardy]] for the local climate. [[Carrot]], [[celery]] and [[parsley]] are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots, petioles and leaves, respectively. [[Tomato]], [[sweet potato]] and [[bell pepper]] are tender perennials usually grown as annuals.

Ornamental annual perennials commonly grown as annuals are [[impatiens]], [[begonia|wax begonia]], [[snapdragon]], ''[[Pelargonium]]'', [[coleus]] and [[petunia]].

One seed-to-seed life cycle for an annual can occur in as little as a month in some species, though most last several months. [[Brassica rapa|Oilseed rapa]] can go from seed-to-seed in about five weeks under a bank of [[fluorescent lamp]]s in a school classroom. Many desert annuals are therophytes,&lt;ref name=&quot;introduction_to_world_vegetation&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Collinson | first1 = A. S. | title = Introduction to world vegetation | date = 1988 | publisher = Unwin Hyman | location = London  | isbn = 978-0-04-581031-4 | pages = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because their seed-to-seed life cycle is only weeks and they spend most of the year as seeds to survive dry conditions.

Examples of true annuals include [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[lettuce]], [[pea]]s, [[watermelon]], [[bean]]s, [[zinnia]] and [[Tagetes|marigold]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridata.com www.floridata.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer==
{{anchor|Summer annuals}}
'''Summer annuals''' sprout, flower, produce seed, and die during the warmer months of the year.

The lawn weed [[crabgrass]] is a summer annual.
The Dragon Wing Begonia is a summer annual.

==Winter==
{{anchor|Winter annuals}}
'''Winter annuals''' germinate in autumn or winter, live through the winter, then bloom in winter or spring.

The plants grow and bloom during the cool season when most other plants are dormant or other annuals are in seed form waiting for warmer weather to germinate. Winter annuals die after flowering and setting seed. The seeds germinate in the fall or winter when the soil temperature is cool.

Winter annuals typically grow low to the ground, where they are usually sheltered from the coldest nights by snow cover, and make use of warm periods in winter for growth when the snow melts. Some common winter annuals include [[henbit]], [[deadnettle]], [[chickweed]], and [[winter cress]].

Winter annuals are important ecologically, as they provide vegetative cover that prevents soil erosion during winter and early spring when no other cover exists and they provide fresh vegetation for animals and birds that feed on them. Although they are often considered to be weeds in gardens, this viewpoint is not always necessary, as most of them die when the soil temperature warms up again in early to late spring when other plants are still dormant and have not yet leafed out.

Even though they do not compete directly with cultivated plants, sometimes winter annuals are considered a pest in commercial agriculture, because they can be hosts for insect pests or fungal diseases (ovary smut - Microbotryum sp) which attack crops being cultivated.  Ironically, the property that they prevent the soil from drying out can also be problematic for commercial agriculture.

==Molecular genetics==
In 2008, it was discovered that the inactivation of only two genes in one species of annual plant leads to the conversion into a perennial plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997783&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers deactivated the SOC1 and FUL genes in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', which control flowering time. This switch established phenotypes common in perennial plants, such as wood formation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''anthophytes''' were thought to be a [[clade]] comprising plants bearing flower-like structures.  The group contained the [[angiosperms]] - the extant flowering plants - as well as the [[Gnetales]] and the extinct [[Bennettitales]].

Detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic.&lt;ref name=Crepet2000/&gt;  This makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around {{Ma|300}}.&lt;ref name=Nam2003&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nam J. et al.  | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/20/9/1435 |title=Antiquity and Evolution of the MADS-Box Gene Family Controlling Flower Development in Plants | journal=Mol.

Some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of fossils ([[Glossopteris|glossopterids]], ''[[Pentoxylon]]'', [[Bennettitales]], and ''[[Caytonia]]''), but not the Gnetales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/1133/1/3 | title = The Year in Evolutionary Biology 2008 | date = published June 2008 | journal = Ann.

'''Mouthwash''' or '''mouth rinse''' is a product used to enhance [[oral hygiene]].  Some manufacturers of mouthwash claim that [[antiseptic]] and anti-plaque mouth rinse kill the [[Dental plaque|bacterial plaque]] causing [[Dental caries|cavities]], [[gingivitis]], and [[bad breath]]. Anti-cavity mouth rinse uses [[fluoride]] to protect against [[tooth decay]]. It is, however, generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both [[toothbrush|brushing]] and [[flossing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunsolley&quot;&gt;Gunsolley JC. A meta-analysis of six-month studies of antiplaque and antigingivitis agents. ''J Am Dent Assoc''. 2006 Dec;137(12):1649-57. PMID 17138709&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tal&quot;&gt;Tal H, Rosenberg M. Estimation of dental plaque levels and gingival inflammation using a simple oral rinse technique. ''J Periodontol''. 1990 Jun;61(6):339-42. PMID 2366142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6799764 Listerine no replacement for flossing?&lt;/ref&gt; As per the [[American Dental Association]], regular brushing and proper flossing are enough in most cases although the ADA has placed its Seal of Approval on many mouthwashes containing alcohol (in addition to regular dental check-ups).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ada.org/prof/resources/pubs/jada/patient/patient_01.pdf Simple Routine for Basic Oral Care&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mouthwash may also be used to help remove [[mucus]] and food particles deeper down in the throat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Alcoholic and strongly flavored mouthwash may cause coughing when used for this purpose.

==History==
The first known references to mouth rinsing is in [[Ayurveda]] and [[Chinese medicine]], about 2700 BC, for treatment of [[gingivitis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Later, in the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, mouth rinsing following mechanical cleansing became common among the upper classes, and [[Hippocrates]] recommended a mixture of salt, [[alum]], and vinegar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischman&quot;&gt;Fischman SL. The history of oral hygiene products: how far have we come in 6000 years? ''Periodontol 2000''. 1997 Oct;15:7-14. PMID 9643227.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish [[Talmud]], dating back about 1800 years, suggests a cure for gum ailments containing &quot;dough water&quot; and olive oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shifman&quot;&gt;Shifman A, Orenbuch S, Rosenberg M. Bad breath&amp;mdash;a major disability according to the Talmud. ''Isr Med Assoc J''. 2002 Oct;4(10):843-5. PMID 12389360.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], the famous 17th century [[microscopist]], discovered living organisms (living, because they were motile) in deposits on the teeth (what we now call [[dental plaque]]). He also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in Delft. He experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water. Next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a rather foul mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque. He concluded&amp;mdash;correctly&amp;mdash;that the mouthwash either did not reach, or was not present long enough, to kill the plaque organisms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

That remained the state of affairs until the late 1960s when Harald Loe (at the time a professor at the [[Royal Dental College]] in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]]) demonstrated that a [[chlorhexidine]] compound could prevent the build-up of dental plaque. The reason for chlorhexidine effectiveness is that it strongly adheres to surfaces in the mouth and thus remains present in effective concentrations for many hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loe&quot;&gt;Budtz-Jörgensen E, Löe H. Chlorhexidine as a denture disinfectant in the treatment of denture stomatitis. ''Scand J Dent Res''. 1972:80:457-464.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the build-up in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis (inflammation of the gums), in addition to fighting bad breath. Many of these solutions aim to control the Volatile Sulfur Compound (VSC)-creating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosy&quot;&gt;Bosy A, Kulkarni GV, Rosenberg M, McCulloch CA. Relationship of oral malodor to periodontitis: evidence of independence in discrete subpopulations. ''J Periodontol''. 1994 Jan;65(1):37-46. PMID 8133414.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loesche&quot;&gt;Loesche WJ, Kazor C. Microbiology and treatment of halitosis. ''Periodontol 2000''. 2002;28:256-79. PMID 12013345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Common use involves rinsing the mouth with about 20[[milliliter|ml]] (2/3 [[fluid ounce|fl oz]]) of mouthwash two times a day after brushing. The wash is typically swished or [[gargling|gargled]] for about half a minute and then spat out. In some brands, the [[expectorate]] is stained, so that one can see the bacteria and debris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kozlovsky&quot;&gt;Kozlovsky A, Goldberg S, Natour I, Rogatky-Gat A, Gelernter I, Rosenberg M. Efficacy of a 2-phase oil: water mouthrinse in controlling oral malodor, gingivitis, and plaque. ''J Periodontol''. 1996 Jun;67(6):577-82. PMID 8794967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg1&quot;&gt;Rosenberg M, Gelernter I, Barki M, Bar-Ness R. Day-long reduction of oral [[malodor]] by a two-phase oil: water mouthrinse as compared to [[chlorhexidine]] and placebo rinses. ''J Periodontol''. 1992 Jan;63(1):39-43. PMID 1552460.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains [[sodium lauryl sulfate]], since the anionic compounds in the SLS [[toothpaste]] can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthrinse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg2&quot;&gt;Rosenberg M. The science of bad breath. ''Sci Am''. 2002 Apr;286(4):72-9. PMID 11905111.&lt;/ref&gt;, many would disagree with this hypothesis.  In fact many of the popular mouthwashes contain sodium lauryl sulfate as an ingredient (eg., Listerine Total Care).

==Active ingredients==
[[Image:Chlorhexidine mouthrinse.png|right|thumb|100px|[[Over-the-counter drug|OTC]] mouthwash containing chlorhexidine from [[Mexico]].]]

[[Active ingredient]]s in commercial brands of mouthwash can include [[thymol]], [[eucalyptol]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoeken&quot;&gt;Stoeken JE, Paraskevas S, van der Weijden GA.

''J Can Dent Assoc''. 2003 May;69(5):286-91. PMID 12734021.&lt;/ref&gt; [[enzymes]], and [[calcium]]. Ingredients also include water, sweeteners such as [[sorbitol]], [[sucralose]], [[Saccharin|sodium saccharin]], and [[xylitol]] (which doubles as a bacterial inhibitor).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giertsen&quot;&gt;Giertsen E, Emberland H, Scheie AA. Effects of mouth rinses with xylitol and fluoride on dental plaque and saliva. Caries Res. 1999;33(1):23-31. PMID 9831777.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a significant amount of [[ethanol|alcohol]] (up to 27% vol) is added,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mildau&quot;&gt;Lachenmeier DW, Keck-Wilhelm A, Sauermann A, Mildau G. Safety
assessment of alcohol-containing mouthwashes and oral rinses. ''SOFW J''. 2008;134:70-78.

Oral rinses. ''Cosmet Toilet''. 1994;109:59-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the alcohol content, it is possible to fail a [[breathalyzer]] test after rinsing although breath alcohol levels return to normal after 10mins; in addition, alcohol is a drying agent and may worsen chronic bad breath. Furthermore, it is possible for alcoholics to abuse mouthwash. Recently, the possibility that the alcohol used in mouthrinses acts as a carcinogen was raised, but there is to date no scientific consensus on the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole&quot;&gt;Cole P, Rodu B, Mathisen A. Alcohol-containing mouthwash and [[oropharyngeal]] cancer: a review of the epidemiology. ''J Am Dent Assoc''. 2003 Aug;134(8):1079-87.

Safety evaluation of topical applications of ethanol on the skin and inside the oral cavity. ''J Occup Med Toxicol''. 2008 Nov;3(1):26. http://www.occup-med.com/content/3/1/26 (Open Access).&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial mouthwashes usually contain a preservative such as [[sodium benzoate]] to preserve freshness once the container has been opened. Many newer brands are alcohol-free and contain odor-elimination agents such as oxidizers, as well as odor-preventing agents such as [[zinc]] [[ion]] to keep future bad breath from developing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Alternative mouthwash ingredients===
A '''salt mouthwash''' is a home treatment for mouth infections and/or injuries, or post extraction, and is made by dissolving a teaspoon of [[Edible salt|salt]] in a cup of warm water. 

Recently, the use of herbal mouthwashes such as [[Salvadora persica|persica]] is increasing, due to the perceived discoloration effects and unpleasant taste of chlorhexidine.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.tums.ac.ir/upload_files/pdf/3015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also indicated that [[Oil_pulling#Scientific_assessment|sesame and sunflower oils]] as cheap alternatives compared to chlorhexidine.&lt;ref&gt;http://iadr.confex.com/iadr/2008Toronto/techprogram/abstract_105440.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johcd.org/pdf/Effect_of_Oil_Pulling_on_Plaque_and_Gingivitis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Other products like [[hydrogen peroxide]] have been tried out as stand-alone&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasturk&quot;&gt;Hasturk H, Nunn M, Warbington M, Van Dyke TE. Efficacy of a fluoridated hydrogen peroxide-based mouthrinse for the treatment of gingivitis: a randomized clinical trial. ''J Periodontol''. 2004 Jan;75(1):57-65. PMID 15025217.&lt;/ref&gt; and in combination&lt;ref&gt;http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/omim/abstract.00006410-200502000-00005.htm;jsessionid=KXLY0GnljNLCQ59rdL3nTMvjYQ5Qyt2xk9pbshDcF0c3KdHQ8CBc!1109661354!181195629!8091!-1&lt;/ref&gt; with chlorhexidine, due to some inconsistent results regarding its usefulness.

Another study has demonstrated that daily use of an [[alum]]-containing mouthrinse was safe and produced a significant effect on plaque that supplemented the benefits of daily toothbrushing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8710717&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many studies acknowledge that Chlorhexidine remains the most effective mouthwash when used on an already clean tooth surface or immediately after surgery. As chlorhexidine has difficulty in penetrating plaque biofilm, other mouthwashes may be more effective where pre-existing plaque is present. One side-effect as noted on the label is the staining of the teeth will occur for prolong usage.

===Compounding===
Custom mouthwashes, called &quot;[[magic mouthwash]]&quot; may be prescribed by dentists for post oral surgeries. Variations are common, and some are done with [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] products.

==Health risks==
A literature review by McCullough and Farah from 2008 published in the ''Dental Journal of Australia''&lt;ref&gt;McCullough MJ, Farah CS. The role of alcohol in oral carcinogenesis with particular reference to alcohol-containing mouthwashes. Aust Dent J 2008;53:302-5&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that there is &quot;''sufficient evidence''&quot; that &quot;''alcohol-containing mouthwashes contribute to the increased risk of development of [[oral cancer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Weaver | first = Clair | coauthors = | title = Mouthwash linked to cancer | work = Daily Telegraph | pages = | publisher = News Ltd | date = 11 January 2009 | url = http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24896583-5001021,00.html | accessdate = 11 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors also state that the risk of acquiring cancer rises almost five times for users of alcohol-containing mouthwash who neither smoke nor drink (with a higher rate of increase for those who do).&lt;ref&gt;Farah, C; McIntosh, L; McCullough, M (2009). &quot;Mouthwashes&quot;. ''Australian Prescriber'', 32:162-4. Available at http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/32/6/162/4/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the authors highlight side effects from several mainstream mouthwashes that included dental erosion and accidental poisoning of children.

However, the study has been disputed by Yinka Ebo of [[Cancer Research UK]], who concluded that &quot;''there is still not enough evidence to suggest that using mouthwash that contains alcohol will increase the risk of mouth cancer''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebo|first=Yinka|title=Does mouthwash cause cancer?|url=http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2009/01/14/does-mouthwash-cause-cancer/|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|accessdate=20 June 2009|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) and the United States [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) agree that the alcohol contained in antiseptic mouthwash is safe and not a factor in oral cancers. Studies conducted in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mashberg A, Barsa P, Grossman ML |title=A study of the relationship between mouthwash use and oral and pharyngeal cancer |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=731–4 |year=1985 |month=May |pmid=3859544 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elmore JG, Horwitz RI |title=Oral cancer and mouthwash use: evaluation of the epidemiologic evidence |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=253–61 |year=1995 |month= September|pmid=7675486 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0194599895001914 |doi=10.1016/S0194-5998(95)70114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cole P, Rodu B, Mathisen A |title=Alcohol-containing mouthwash and oropharyngeal cancer: a review of the epidemiology |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=134 |issue=8 |pages=1079–87 |date=1 August 2003|pmid=12956348 |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/134/8/1079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; summarize that alcohol-containing mouth rinses are not associated with oral cancer. However, a review of a study carried out in Cuba, Argentina, and Brazil was published December 2008 in the ''Australian Dental Journal'' and concluded that:&lt;blockquote&gt;{{cquote|There is now sufficient evidence to accept the proposition that developing oral cancer is increased or contributed to by the use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes. Whilst many of these products may have been shown to be effective in penetrating oral microbial biofilms in vitro and reducing oral bacterial load, it would be wise to restrict their use to short-term therapeutic situations if needed. Perhaps the use of mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol may be equally effective. Further, mouthrinses should be prescribed by dentists, like any other medication. There may well be a reason for the use of alcohol-containing mouthrinses, but only for a particular situation and for a limited and controlled period of time. As such, patients should be provided with written instructions for mouthwash use, and mouthwash use should be restricted to adults for short durations and specific, clearly defined reasons. It is the opinion of the authors that, in light of the evidence currently available of the association of alcohol-containing mouthwashes with the development of oral cancer, it would be inadvisable for oral healthcare professionals to recommend the long-term use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCullough |first=Michael |coauthors=C. S. Farah |year=2008 |month=December |title=The role of alcohol in oral carcinogenesis with particular reference to alcohol-containing mouthwashes |journal=Australian Dental Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=302–305 |id= |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/121540201/HTMLSTART |accessdate=2009-01-12 |quote= |doi=10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00070.x |pmid=19133944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Andrew Penman, chief executive of [[The Cancer Council New South Wales]], called for further research on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Clair |last=Weaver |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mouthwash linked to cancer |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24896583-5001021,00.html |work= |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouthwashes containing [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] are also associated with loss of taste sensation and brown discolouration of the teeth.

'''Alexander III of Macedon''' (20/21 July 356 – 10/11 June 323&amp;nbsp;BC), commonly known as '''Alexander the Great''' ({{lang-el|Μέγας Ἀλέξανδρος}}, ''Mégas Aléxandros''), was a king of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] ({{lang-el|''Βασιλεύς Μακεδόνων''}}), a state in the north eastern region of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and by the age of thirty was the creator of one of the largest empires in [[ancient history]], stretching from the [[Ionian sea]] to the [[Himalaya]]. He was undefeated in battle and is considered one of the most successful commanders of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne, W. 2010&quot;&gt;Yenne, W. ''Alexander the Great: Lessons from History's Undefeated General.'' Palmgrave McMillan, 2010. 244 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Pella]] in 356&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander was tutored by the famed philosopher [[Aristotle]]. In 336&amp;nbsp;BC he succeeded his father [[Philip II of Macedon]] to the throne after Philip was assassinated. Philip had brought most of the [[polis|city-states]] of mainland Greece under [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[hegemony]], using both military and diplomatic means.

Upon Philip's death, Alexander inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. He succeeded in being awarded the generalship of Greece and, with his authority firmly established, launched the military plans for expansion left by his father. In 334&amp;nbsp;BC he invaded Persian-ruled [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and began a [[Wars of Alexander the Great|series of campaigns]] lasting ten years. Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]]. Subsequently he overthrew the Persian king [[Darius III]] and conquered the entirety of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].{{cref|i}} The [[Macedonian Empire]] now stretched from the [[Adriatic sea]] to the [[Indus River]].

Following his desire to reach the &quot;ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea&quot;, he [[Alexander's Indian campaign|invaded India]] in 326&amp;nbsp;BC, but was eventually forced to turn back by the near-mutiny of his troops. Alexander died in [[Babylon]] in 323&amp;nbsp;BC, without realizing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. In the years following Alexander's death a series of civil wars tore his empire apart which resulted in the formation of a number of states ruled by the [[Diadochi]] - Alexander's surviving generals. Although he is mostly remembered for his vast conquests, Alexander's lasting legacy was not his reign, but the [[cultural diffusion]] his conquests engendered.

Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and culture in the east resulted in a new [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] until the mid-15th century. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of [[Achilles]], and features prominently in the history and myth of Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which generals, even to this day, compare themselves and [[military academy|military academies]] throughout the world still teach his tactical exploits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne, W. 2010&quot;/&gt; {{cref|ii}}

==Early life==
===Lineage and childhood===

Alexander was born on 20 (or 21) July 356&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=PA3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander was born on the 6 of the month [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]] {{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t32.html#7|title=The birth of Alexander at Livius.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pella]], the capital of the Ancient Greek [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedon]].  He was the son of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], the [[List of kings of Macedon|King of Macedon]].
His mother was Philip's fourth wife [[Olympias]], the daughter of [[Neoptolemus I of Epirus|Neoptolemus I]], the king of  [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]].&lt;ref name=PA2/&gt;&lt;ref name=N10-M/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Renault, p. 28&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durant, ''Life of Greece'', p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Philip had either seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for a time, likely as a result of giving birth to Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, &quot;Philip II&quot;, p. 171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the [[Argead dynasty]], Alexander claimed patrilineal descent from [[Heracles]] through [[Caranus (king)|Caranus of Macedon]].{{cref|iv}}  From his mother's side and the [[Aeacids]], he claimed descent from [[Neoptolemus]], son of [[Achilles]];{{cref|v}}  Alexander was a second cousin of the celebrated general [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], who was ranked by [[Hannibal]] as, depending on the source, either the best&lt;ref name=plu/&gt; or second-best (after Alexander)&lt;ref name=appian/&gt; commander the world had ever seen.

According to the ancient Greek biographer [[Plutarch]], Olympias, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt, causing a flame that spread &quot;far and wide&quot; before dying away.  Some time after the wedding, Philip was said to have seen himself, in a dream, sealing up his wife's womb with a seal upon which was engraved the image of a lion.&lt;ref name=PA2/&gt;  Plutarch offers a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympia was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus.  Ancient commentators were divided as to whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, some claiming she told Alexander, others that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.&lt;ref name=PA2/&gt;

On the day that Alexander was born, Philip was preparing himself for his siege on the city of [[Potidea]] on the peninsula of Chalcidike.  On the same day, Philip received news that his general [[Parmenion]] had defeated the combined [[Illyrian]] and [[Paeonian]] armies, and that his horses had won at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].  It was also said that on this day, the [[Temple of Artemis]] in [[Ephesus]]—one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]]—burnt down, leading [[Hegesias of Magnesia]] to say that it burnt down because [[Artemis]] was attending the birth of Alexander.&lt;ref name=PA3/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Renault, p. 28&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=P21-B/&gt;

[[File:AlexanderAndLion.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander fighting an [[Asiatic lion]] with his friend [[Craterus]] (detail). 3rd century BC [[mosaic]], Pella Museum.]]

In his early years, Alexander was raised by his nurse, [[Lanike]], the sister of Alexander's future friend and general [[Cleitus the Black]].  Later on in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict [[Leonidas of Epirus|Leonidas]], a relative of his mother, and by [[Lysimachus]].&lt;ref name=M33-34-R/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA5/&gt; Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 186&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alexander was ten years old, a horse trader from [[Thessaly]] brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen [[Attic talent|talents]].  The horse refused to be mounted by anyone, and Philip ordered it to be taken away.  Alexander, however, detected the horse's fear of his own shadow and asked for a turn to tame the horse, which he eventually managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 188&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Plutarch, Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed him tearfully, declaring: &quot;My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions.  Macedon is too small for you&quot;, and bought the horse for him.&lt;ref name=PA6/&gt;  Alexander would name the horse [[Bucephalas]], meaning &quot;ox-head&quot;.  Bucephalas would be Alexander's companion throughout his journeys as far as India.  When Bucephalas died (due to old age, according to Plutarch, for he was already thirty), Alexander named a city after him, [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]].&lt;ref name=R64-F/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durant, p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence and education===
[[File:Alexander and Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Aristotle tutoring Alexander]]
When Alexander was thirteen years old, Philip began to search for a [[tutor]]. Many people were passed over including [[Isocrates]] and [[Speusippus]], the latter of whom was [[Plato]]'s successor at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] and who offered to resign to take up the post. In the end, Philip offered the job to [[Aristotle]], who accepted, and Philip provided the Temple of the Nymphs at [[Mieza]] as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of [[Stageira]], which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.&lt;ref name=PA7/&gt;&lt;ref name=R65-F/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], [[Hephaistion]], and [[Cassander]]. Many of those studying by Alexander's side would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. At Mieza, Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], [[morals]], [[religion]], [[logic]], and [[art]]. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of [[Homer]], and in particular the ''[[Iliad]]''; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander was to take on his campaigns.&lt;ref name=R65-66-F/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, pp. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, ''Alexander the Great'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philip's heir==
===Regency and ascent of Macedon===
{{Main|Philip II of Macedon|Rise of Macedon}}
[[File:Filip II Macedonia.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust depicting [[Philip II of Macedon]], Alexander's father]]
When Alexander became sixteen years old, his tutorship under Aristotle came to an end.  Philip, the king, departed to wage war against [[Byzantium|Byzantion]], and Alexander was left in charge as [[regent]] and [[heir apparent]] of the kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 188&quot;/&gt;  During Philip's absence, the [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[Maedi]] revolted against Macedonian rule.  Alexander responded quickly; he crushed the Maedi insurgence, driving them from their territory, colonised it with Greeks, and founded a city named [[Alexandropolis Maedica|Alexandropolis]].&lt;ref name=PA9/&gt;&lt;ref name=R68-F/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bose, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Philip's return from Byzantium, he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue certain revolts in southern [[Thrace]].  During another campaign against the Greek city of [[Perinthus]], Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life.  Meanwhile, the city of [[Amphissa]] began to work lands that were sacred to [[Apollo]] near [[Delphi]], a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in the affairs of Greece.  Still occupied in Thrace, Philip ordered Alexander to begin mustering an army for a campaign in Greece.  Concerned with the possibility of other Greek states intervening, Alexander made it look as if he was preparing to attack Illyria instead.  During this turmoil, the Illyrians took the opportunity to invade Macedonia, but Alexander repelled the invaders.&lt;ref name=Renault47-49/&gt;

Philip joined Alexander with his army in 338&amp;nbsp;BC, and they marched south through [[Thermopylae]], which they took after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison.  They went on to occupy the city of [[Elatea]], a few days march from both Athens and Thebes.  Meanwhile, the Athenians, led by [[Demosthenes]], voted to seek an alliance with Thebes in the war against Macedonia.  Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to try to win Thebes' favour, with the Athenians eventually succeeding.&lt;ref name=M50-51-R/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bose, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Philip marched on Amphissa (theoretically acting on the request of the Amphicytonic League), captured the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes, and accepted the city's surrender.  Philip then returned to Elatea and sent a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, which was rejected.&lt;ref name=M51-R/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bose, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander1256.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Alexander in [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]]]]

As Philip marched south, he was blocked near [[Chaeronea]], [[Boeotia]] by the forces of Athens and Thebes.  During the ensuing [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], Philip commanded the right, and Alexander the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals.  According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for a long time.  Philip deliberately commanded the troops on his right wing to backstep, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line.  On the left, Alexander was the first to break into the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals.  Having achieved a breach in the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed his enemy.  With the rout of the Athenians, the Thebans were left to fight alone; surrounded by the victorious enemy, they were crushed.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiodXVI&quot;/&gt;

After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached [[Sparta]], they were refused, and they simply left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikyon.com/sparta/history_eg.html |title=History of Ancient Sparta |publisher=Sikyon.com |accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], Philip established a &quot;Hellenic Alliance&quot; (modeled on the old [[Second Persian invasion of Greece#Hellenic Alliance|anti-Persian alliance]] of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]), with the exception of Sparta.  Philip was then named ''[[Hegemon]]'' (often translated as 'Supreme Commander') of this league (known by modern historians as the League of Corinth).  He then announced his plans for a war of revenge against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], which he would command.&lt;ref name=M54-R/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile and return===
After returning to Pella, Philip fell in love with and married [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Cleopatra Eurydice]], the niece of one of his generals, [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, Philip II, p. 179&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, &quot;Philip II&quot;, p. 179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This marriage made Alexander's position as heir to the throne less secure, since if Cleopatra Eurydice bore Philip a son, there would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half Macedonian.&lt;ref name=McCarty27/&gt;  During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus made a speech praying to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir to the Macedonian throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, Philip II, p. 179&quot;/&gt;

{{Quotation|At the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece.  This so irritated Alexander, that throwing one of the cups at his head, &quot;You villain,&quot; said he, &quot;what, am I then a bastard?&quot;  Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor.  At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him: &quot;See there,&quot; said he, &quot;the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another.&quot;|Plutarch, describing the feud at Philip's wedding.&lt;ref name=PA9/&gt;}}

Alexander fled from Macedon taking his mother with him,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, Philip II, p. 180&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, &quot;Philip II&quot;, p. 180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whom he dropped off with her brother in [[Dodona]], capital of Epirus.  He carried on to Illyria,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, Philip II, p. 180&quot;/&gt; where he sought refuge with the Illyrian King and was treated as a guest by the Illyrians, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his militarily and politically trained son,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, Philip II, p. 180&quot;/&gt; and Alexander returned to Macedon after six months in exile due to the efforts of a family friend, [[Demaratus the Corinthian]], who mediated between the two parties.&lt;ref name=PA9/&gt;&lt;ref name=P75-B/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the Persian [[satrap]] (governor) of [[Caria]], [[Pixodarus of Caria|Pixodarus]], offered the hand of his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, [[Philip Arrhidaeus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, Philip II, p. 180&quot;/&gt;  Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested to Alexander that this move showed that Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, Philip II, p. 180&quot;/&gt;  Alexander reacted by sending an actor, [[Thessalus]] of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander.  When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining to him that he wanted a better bride for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Sabine Muller, Philip II, p. 180&quot;/&gt; Philip had four of Alexander's friends, [[Harpalus]], [[Nearchus]], Ptolemy and [[Erigyius]] exiled, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.&lt;ref name=McCarty27/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''The Search For Alexander'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==King of Macedon==
===Accession===
[[File:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en.svg|300px|thumb|The Kingdom of Macedon in 336 BC]]
In 336&amp;nbsp;BC, whilst at [[Aegae (Macedon)|Aegae]], attending the wedding of his daughter by Olympias, [[Cleopatra of Macedon|Cleopatra]], to Olympias's brother, [[Alexander I of Epirus]], Philip was assassinated by the captain of his [[Somatophylax|bodyguard]], [[Pausanias of Orestis|Pausanias]].{{cref|vi}}  As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, [[Perdiccas]] and [[Leonnatus]].  Alexander was proclaimed king by the [[Ancient Macedonian military|Macedonian army]] and by the Macedonian noblemen at the age of 20.&lt;ref name=N30-31-M/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''The Search For Alexander'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power consolidation===
Alexander began his reign by eliminating any potential rivals to the throne.  He had his cousin, the former [[Amyntas IV of Macedon|Amyntas IV]], executed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 190&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 190}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as having two Macedonian princes from the region of [[Lyncestis]] killed, while a third, [[Alexander Lyncestes]], was spared.  Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and her daughter by Philip, Europa, burned alive.  When Alexander found out about this, he was furious with his mother.  Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 190&quot;/&gt; who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor.  Attalus was at the time in correspondence with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens.  Regardless of whether Attalus actually intended to defect, he had already severely insulted Alexander, and having just had Attalus's daughter and grandchildren murdered, Alexander probably felt Attalus was too dangerous to leave alive.&lt;ref&gt;Green, ''Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age'', pp5–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander spared the life of Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.&lt;ref name=N30-31-M/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA77/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes to the north of Macedon.  When news of the revolts in Greece reached Alexander, he responded quickly.  Though his advisors advised him to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered the Macedonian cavalry of 3,000 men and rode south towards Thessaly, Macedon's neighbor to the south.  When he found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between [[Mount Olympus]] and [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Mount Ossa]], he had the men ride over Mount Ossa.  When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear, and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force, as he rode down towards the [[Peloponnesus]].&lt;ref name=N31-M/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Renault, p. 72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''The Search For Alexander'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bose, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the [[Amphictyonic League]] before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander received the envoy and pardoned anyone involved with the uprising.  At Corinth, where occurred the [[Diogenes and Alexander|famous encounter with Diogenes the Cynic]], who asked him to stand a little aside as he was blocking the sun,&lt;ref&gt;Stoneman, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was given the title ''Hegemon'', and like Philip, appointed commander of the forthcoming war against Persia.  While at Corinth, he heard the news of the Thracian rising to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renault, p. 72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=P96-Bose/&gt;

===Balkan campaign===
{{Main|Alexander's Balkan campaign}}
Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders; and, in the spring of 335&amp;nbsp;BC, he advanced to suppress several apparent revolts.  Starting from [[Amphipolis]], he first went east into the country of the &quot;Independent Thracians&quot;; and at [[Haemus Mons|Mount Haemus]], the Macedonian army attacked and defeated a Thracian army manning the heights.&lt;ref name=&quot;I, 1&quot;/&gt;  The Macedonians marched on into the country of the [[Triballi]], and proceeded to defeat the Triballian army near the Lyginus river &lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 2&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[List of tributaries of the Danube|tributary of the Danube]]).  Alexander then advanced for three days on to the [[Danube]], encountering the [[Getae]] tribe on the opposite shore.  Surprising the Getae by crossing the river at night, he forced the Getae army to retreat after the first cavalry [[skirmish]], leaving their town to the Macedonian army.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;  News then reached Alexander that [[Cleitus the Illyrian|Cleitus]], King of Illyria, and [[King Glaukias]] of the [[Taulanti]] were in open revolt against Macedonian authority.  Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing Cleitus and Glaukias to flee with their armies, leaving Alexander's northern frontier secure.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was triumphantly campaigning north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once more.  Alexander immediately cut short his campaign and headed south with his army,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 192&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but, while the other cities once again hesitated, Thebes decided to resist with the utmost vigor.  However, the resistance was ineffective, and the city was razed to the ground amid great bloodshed, and its territory was divided between the other Boeotian cities.  The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission, leaving all of Greece at least outwardly at peace with Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 192&quot;/&gt; Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving [[Antipater]] as regent of Macedon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 199&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L.

===Asia Minor===

[[File:MacedonEmpire.jpg|thumb|350px|Map of Alexander's empire and the paths he took]]

Alexander's army crossed the [[Hellespont]] in 334&amp;nbsp;BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 192&quot;/&gt; drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from [[Thrace]], [[Paionia]], and [[Illyria]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 11&lt;/ref&gt;  After an initial victory against Persian forces at the [[Battle of the Granicus]], Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of [[Sardis]] and proceeded down the [[Ionia]]n coast.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 13–19&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Halicarnassus]], Alexander successfully waged the first of many [[siege]]s, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain [[Memnon of Rhodes]] and the Persian [[satrap]] of [[Caria]], [[Orontobates]], to withdraw by sea.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 20–23&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander left the government of Caria to [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who adopted Alexander as her son.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous [[Lycia]] and the [[Pamphylia]]n plain, asserting control over all coastal cities in order to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onward, the coast held no major ports and so Alexander moved inland.  At [[Termessos]], Alexander humbled but did not storm the [[Pisidia]]n city.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;  At the ancient Phrygian capital of [[Gordium]], Alexander 'undid' the hitherto unsolvable [[Gordian Knot]], a feat said to await the future &quot;king of [[Asia Minor|Asia]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' II, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone, and hacked it apart with his sword.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending the winter campaigning in Asia Minor, Alexander's army crossed the [[Cilician Gates]] in 333&amp;nbsp;BC, and defeated the main Persian army under the command of Darius III at the [[Battle of Issus]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' II, 6–10&lt;/ref&gt;  Darius fled the battle, causing his army to break, and  left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother [[Sisygambis]], and a fabulous amount of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' II, 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;  He afterward offered a [[peace treaty]] to Alexander, the concession of the lands he had already conquered, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family.  Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' I, 3–4 II, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander proceeded to take possession of Syria, and most of the coast of the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrian [http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book1a.asp ''Anabasis Alexandri'' II, 23]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the following year, 332&amp;nbsp;BC, he was forced to attack [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], which he eventually captured after a famous [[Siege of Tyre|siege]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' II, 16–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunther, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the capture of Tyre, Alexander massacred all the men of military age, and sold the women and children into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin ''et al.'', p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===

{{See also|History of Ptolemaic Egypt}}
When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated, with the exception of Gaza.  The stronghold at [[Gaza]] was built on a hill and was heavily fortified.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' II, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of the [[Siege of Gaza]], Alexander utilized the engines he had employed against Tyre.  After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold was finally taken by force, but not before Alexander received a serious shoulder wound.  As in Tyre, the male population was put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' II, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerusalem, on the other hand, opened its gates in surrender, and according to Josephus, Alexander was shown the book of Daniel's prophecy, presumably chapter 8, where a mighty Greek king would subdue and conquer the Persian Empire.  Thereupon, Alexander spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, [[Antiquities of the Jews|Jewish Antiquities]], XI, 337 [viii, 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 1, 1988, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania International Bible Students Association, pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332&amp;nbsp;BC, where he was regarded as a liberator.&lt;ref&gt;Ring ''et al.'' pp. 49, 320.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was pronounced the new &quot;master of the Universe&quot; and son of the deity of [[Amun]] at the [[Oracle]] of [[Siwa Oasis]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert.&lt;ref name=grimal/&gt;  Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and subsequent currency depicted him adorned with ram horns as a symbol of his divinity.&lt;ref name=P27/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/15880/From-the-Persian-Wars-to-Alexander-the-Great-490-336-bc|title=Coin: from the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490–336 bc|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his stay in Egypt, he founded [[Alexandria|Alexandria-by-Egypt]], which would become the prosperous capital of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyria and Babylonia===
{{Main|Battle of Gaugamela}}
[[File:Battle of Gaugamela, 331 BC - Opening movements.gif|right|thumb|300px|Initial dispositions and opening movements in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], 331 BC.]]
Leaving Egypt in 331&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander marched eastward into [[Mesopotamia]] (now northern [[Iraq]]) and defeated Darius once more at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III 7–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again, Darius was forced to leave the field, and Alexander chased him as far as [[Arbil|Arbela]].  Gaugamela would prove to be the final and decisive encounter between Darius and Alxander. Darius fled over the mountains to [[Ecbatana]] (modern [[Hamedan]]), and Alexander marched to and captured [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name=AIII16/&gt;

===Persia===
{{Main|Battle of the Persian Gate}}

From Babylon, Alexander went to [[Susa]], one of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] capitals, and captured its legendary treasury.&lt;ref name=AIII16/&gt;  Sending the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of [[Persepolis]] via the [[Royal Road]], Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. Alexander had to storm the pass of the [[Persian Gates]] (in the modern [[Zagros Mountains]]) which had been blocked by a Persian army under [[Ariobarzanes (satrap of Persis)|Ariobarzanes]] and then made a dash for Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III, 18&lt;/ref&gt; On entering Persepolis Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city, before finally calling a halt to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the conqueror: the epic story of the warrior king, Volume 2003|author=Laura Foreman|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|pages=152|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rVEa4nzLkT4C&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=vandalism+in+Persepolis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fQNFTdneJMGclgewpfUR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=vandalism%20in%20Persepolis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Alexander's stay in the capital a fire broke out in the eastern palace of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] and spread to the rest of the city. Theories abound as to whether this was the result of a drunken accident, or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] during the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H83&quot;/&gt; [[Arrian]], in one of his infrequent criticisms of Alexander, states  &quot;I too do not think that Alexander showed good sense in this action nor that he could punish the Persians of a long past age.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the Great: the invisible enemy : a biography|author=John Maxwell O'Brien|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1994|pages=104|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QY9bF60I5pAC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=vandalism+in+Persepolis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qQhFTfiKGoOdlgfwz8FB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vandalism%20in%20Persepolis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of the Empire and the East===
Alexander then set off in pursuit of Darius again, first into Media, and then Parthia.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;  The Persian king was no longer in control of his destiny, having been taken prisoner by [[Bessus]], his [[Bactria]]n satrap and kinsman.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III, 21&lt;/ref&gt;  As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into [[Central Asia]] to launch a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III, 21, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Darius' remains were buried by Alexander next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a full regal funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne.&lt;ref name=BriefLife81/&gt;  The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with the death of Darius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander10.html|title=The end of Persia|publisher=www.livius.org|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlexanderCoin.jpg|thumb|left|Silver coin of Alexander, [[British Museum]]]]

Alexander, now considering himself the legitimate successor to Darius, viewed Bessus as a usurper to the Achaemenid throne, and set out to defeat him.  This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia, with Alexander founding a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern [[Kandahar]] in [[Afghanistan]], and [[Alexandria Eschate]] (&quot;The Furthest&quot;) in modern [[Tajikistan]].  The campaign took Alexander through [[Medes|Media]], [[Parthia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]] (West Afghanistan), [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]] (South and Central Afghanistan), [[Bactria]] (North and Central Afghanistan), and [[Scythia]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III, 23–25, 27–30; IV, 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Bessus was betrayed in 329&amp;nbsp;BC by [[Spitamenes]], who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana.  Spitamenes handed over Bessus to [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' III, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt.  Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the [[Battle of Jaxartes]] and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes and defeated him in the [[Battle of Gabai]]; after the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' IV, 5–6, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems and plots===
During this time, Alexander took the Persian title &quot;King of Kings&quot; (''Shahanshah'') and adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of ''[[proskynesis]]'', either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians paid to their social superiors.&lt;ref name=AVII11/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA45/&gt;  The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of [[deities]] and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it.  This cost him much in the sympathies of many of his countrymen,&lt;ref name=PA45/&gt; and he was eventually abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, [[Philotas]], was executed for failing to bring the plot to his attention.  The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus [[Parmenion]], who had been charged with guarding the treasury at [[Ecbatana]], was assassinated by command of Alexander, so he might not make attempts at vengeance.  Most infamously, Alexander personally slew the man who had saved his life at Granicus, [[Cleitus the Black]], during a drunken argument at [[Maracanda]].&lt;ref name=BriefLife99/&gt;  Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal [[page (servant)|pages]].  His official historian, [[Callisthenes]] of [[Olynthus]] (who had fallen out of favor with the king by leading the opposition to his attempt to introduce ''proskynesis''), was accused of being implicated in the plot; however, there has never been consensus among historians regarding his involvement in the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|coauthors= |title=Alexander the Great: A New History|editor=Waldemar Heckel, Lawrence A.

===Macedon in Alexander's absence===
When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general [[Antipater]], an experienced military and political leader and part of the &quot;Old Guard&quot; that had served under Philip II, in charge of Macedon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L.

Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 199&quot;/&gt; The one exception was a call to arms by the Spartan king Agis III in 331 BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in battle at Megalopolis the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L.

Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Alexander's mother Olympias, and both wrote to Alexander complaining about the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 203}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander also sent back vast sums from his conquest, which helped stimulate the economy and increased trade between the new areas of his empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migrations of numerous Macedonians to the various parts of his empire depleted Macedonian power, greatly weakening it in the years after his death, ultimately leading to its defeat and subjugation by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Edward Anson, &quot;Why study ancient Macedonia&quot;, p. 186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian campaign==
{{Main|Alexander's Indian campaign}}

===Invasion of the Indian subcontinent===
[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|Silver &quot;Victory coin&quot; of Alexander the Great, minted in [[Babylon]] c.322 BC, following his campaigns in [[India]].&lt;br&gt;'''Obv''': Alexander being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].&lt;br&gt;'''Rev''': Alexander attacking [[King Porus]] on his elephant. [[British Museum]].]]
After the death of [[Spitamenes]] and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]) to cement his relations with his new Central Asian satrapies, Alexander turned his attention to the [[Indian subcontinent]].  Alexander invited all the [[tribal chief|chieftains]] of the former satrapy of [[Gandhara]], in the north of what is now [[Pakistan]], to come to him and submit to his authority.  [[Omphis]], ruler of [[Taxila]], whose kingdom extended from the [[Indus]] to the [[Jhelum River|Hydaspes]], complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the [[Aspasioi]] and [[Assakenoi]] sections of the [[Kambojas]] (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.&lt;ref name=Ind118/&gt;

In the winter of 327/326&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of [[Kunar Valley|Kunar]] [[valley]]s, the Guraeans of the [[Panjkora|Guraeus]] valley, and the Assakenoi of the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Buner Valley|Buner]] valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Narain, pp. 155–165&lt;/ref&gt;  A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander himself was wounded in the shoulder by a dart but eventually the Aspasioi lost the fight.  Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought put up stubborn resistance to Alexander in the strongholds of [[Massaga (site)|Massaga]], [[Ora (site)|Ora]] and [[Aornos]].&lt;ref name=Ind118/&gt;  The fort of Massaga could only be reduced after several days of bloody fighting in which Alexander himself was wounded seriously in the ankle.  According to [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], &quot;Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubbles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Curtius in McCrindle, Op cit, p 192, J. W. McCrindle; History of Punjab, Vol I, 1997, p 229, Punajbi University, Patiala, (Editors): Fauja Singh, L. M. Joshi; Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 134, Kirpal Singh.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar slaughter then followed at Ora, another stronghold of the Assakenoi.  In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of [[Aornos]].  Alexander followed close behind their heels and captured the strategic hill-fort after the fourth day of a bloody fight.&lt;ref name=Ind118/&gt;

After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against a local [[Punjabi]] ruler [[King Porus|Porus]], who ruled a region in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] in 326&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Ind124/&gt;  Alexander was greatly impressed by Porus for his bravery in battle, and therefore made an alliance with him and appointed him as satrap of his own kingdom, even adding land he did not own before. Additional reasons were probably political since, to control lands so distant from Greece required local assistance and co-operation.&lt;ref name=Ind126/&gt;  Alexander named one of the two new cities that he founded on opposite sides of the [[Hydaspes]] river, [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]], in honor of the horse that had brought him to India, and had died during the battle&lt;ref name=BriefLife120/&gt; and the other [[Nicaea (Punjab)|Nicaea]] (Victory) at the site of modern day [[Mong, Punjab|Mong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=6_ctAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Nicaea+Mong&amp;dq=Nicaea+Mong&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7i3GPP9Jep&amp;sig=scIQIw3Y3hsAeGyryYKrrPHaEEg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7Q83TNudGYW0lQe21dXSBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ |title=The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 14 p. 398 |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=OiM51I7_A1gC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Alexander+Nicaea+Punjab&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6RM3TMPYMsH6lweKuODTBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Alexander%20Nicaea%20Punjab&amp;f=false Alexander the Great: a reader] Author Ian Worthington Editor Ian Worthington Edition illustrated, reprint Publisher Routledge, 2003ISBN 0415291860, ISBN 9780415291866 Length 332 pages p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolt of the army===
[[File:AlexanderConquestsInIndia.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander's invasion of the Indian subcontinent]]
East of Porus' kingdom, near the [[Ganges River]], was the powerful [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda Empire]] of [[Magadha]] and [[Gangaridai|Gangaridai Empire]] of [[Bengal]].  Fearing the prospects of facing other powerful Indian armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, his army mutinied at the [[Beas River|Hyphasis River]], refusing to march further east.  This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.&lt;ref name=PA62/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ind129/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India.  For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its depth a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and horsemen and elephants.  For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand [[war elephant]]s.&lt;ref name=PA62/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alexander spoke to his army and tried to persuade them to march further into India but [[Coenus (general)|Coenus]] pleaded with him to change his opinion and return, the men, he said, &quot;longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland&quot;.  Alexander, seeing the unwillingness of his men, eventually agreed and turned south, marching along the [[Indus river|Indus]].  Along the way his army conquered the [[Malli]] clans (in modern day [[Multan]]), and other Indian tribes.&lt;ref name=Ind137/&gt;

Alexander sent much of his army to [[Kerman province|Carmania]] (modern southern [[Iran]]) with his general [[Craterus]], and commissioned a fleet to explore the [[Persian Gulf]] shore under his admiral [[Nearchus]], while he led the rest of his forces back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the [[Gedrosia|Gedrosian Desert]] and [[Makran]] (now part of southern Iran and Pakistan).&lt;ref name=Ind141/&gt; Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC, but not before losing a large number of men to the harsh conditions of the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years in Persia==
Discovering that many of his [[satrap]]s and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed a number of them as examples, on his way to [[Susa]].&lt;ref name=AVI27/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII4/&gt;  As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send those over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon under Craterus. But, his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of [[Opis]], refusing to be sent away and bitterly criticizing his adoption of Persian customs and dress, and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, ''Alexander the Great'', pp. 307–308&lt;/ref&gt; After three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, he began to give select Persians command posts in the army and Macedonian military titles were conferred upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and that evening he held a great banquet which was attended by several thousands of his men at which they ate together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 194&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, he held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year.&lt;ref name=AVII4/&gt;  Meanwhile, upon his return, Alexander learned some men had desecrated the tomb of [[Cyrus the Great]], and swiftly executed them, because they were put in charge of guarding the tomb Alexander held in honor.&lt;ref name=AVI29/&gt;

After Alexander traveled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure, his closest friend and possible lover, [[Hephaestion]], died of an illness, or possibly of poisoning.&lt;ref name=AVII14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N7mj2NhCGNYC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=hephaestion+and+alexander+the+great+lover&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gckuTdDdL9SwhQfC8tTmCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=hephaestion%20and%20alexander%20the%20great%20lover&amp;f=false |title=Moses in the Hieroglyphs|author=Grant Berkley|page=101 |publisher=Trafford Publishing|year= 2006|ISBN=1412056004 |accessdate=2011-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Arrian finds great diversity and casts doubts on the accounts of Alexander's displays of grief, although he says that they all agree that Hephaestion's death devastated him, and that he ordered the preparation of an expensive [[funeral pyre]] in Babylon, as well as a decree for the observance of a public mourning.&lt;ref name=AVII14/&gt;

Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly after his return to Babylon.&lt;ref name=AVII19/&gt;

==Death and succession==
[[File:Death of Alexander.JPG|thumb|A [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomical]] diary (c. 323–322 BC) recording the death of Alexander ([[British Museum]], London)]]
On either 10 or 11 June 323&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander died in the palace of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], in [[Babylon]] at the age of 32.&lt;ref name=Depuydt/&gt;  Details of the death differ slightly -  [[Plutarch]]'s account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained his admiral [[Nearchus]], and spent the night and next day drinking with [[Medius of Larissa]].&lt;ref name=P75/&gt;  He developed a fever, which grew steadily worse, until he was unable to speak, and the common soldiers, anxious about his health, demanded and were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them.&lt;ref name=P75/&gt;&lt;ref name=P76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''Anabasis Alexandri'' VII, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, Alexander was dead.&lt;ref name=P75/&gt;&lt;ref name=P76/&gt;  Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck down with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of [[Hercules]], and died after some agony,&lt;ref name=DSXVII117/&gt; which is also mentioned as an alternative by Arrian, but [[Plutarch]] specifically denies this claim.&lt;ref name=P75/&gt;

Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination,&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; allegations of foul play have been made about the death of Alexander.  Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mention the theory that Alexander was poisoned.  Plutarch dismisses it as a fabrication,&lt;ref name=PA77/&gt; while both Diodorus and Arrian say that they only mention it for the sake of completeness.&lt;ref name=DSXVII117/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII27/&gt;  The accounts are nevertheless fairly consistent in designating [[Antipater]], recently removed from the position of Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot.  Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence in waiting,&lt;ref name=g23/&gt; and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas,&lt;ref name=DSXVII118/&gt; Antipater arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer.&lt;ref name=PA77/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII27/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVII118/&gt;  There is even a suggestion that Aristotle may have had a hand in the plot.&lt;ref name=PA77/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII27/&gt;  Conversely, the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the start of his illness and his death; in the ancient world, such long-acting poisons were probably not available.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Alexander the Great'', p.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, however, a theory was proposed that indicated that the circumstances of his death are compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx ([[Mavroneri]]) that contained [[calicheamicin]], a dangerous compound produced by bacteria present in its waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/7924855/Alexander-the-Great-poisoned-by-the-River-Styx.html|title=Alexander the Great poisoned by the River Styx.html|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate=August 4, 2010|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Nick|last=Squires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[natural causes]] (diseases) have been suggested as the cause of Alexander's death; [[malaria]] or [[typhoid fever]] are obvious candidates.  A 1998 article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by [[bowel perforation]] and ascending paralysis,&lt;ref name=AMD/&gt; whereas another recent analysis has suggested pyrogenic spondylitis or meningitis as the cause.&lt;ref name=ashrafian/&gt;  Other illnesses could have also been the culprit, including [[acute pancreatitis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sbarounis CN |title=Did Alexander the Great die of acute pancreatitis? |journal=J Clin Gastroenterol |volume=24 |pages=294–296 |year=2007 |doi=10.1097/00004836-199706000-00031 |pmid=9252868 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasise that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and his suffering severe wounds (including one in India that nearly claimed his life).  Furthermore, the anguish that Alexander felt after [[Hephaestion]]'s death may have contributed to his declining health.&lt;ref name=AMD/&gt;

Another possible cause of Alexander's death is an overdose of medication containing [[hellebore]], which is deadly in large doses.&lt;ref&gt;Cawthorne (2004), s. 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forensic-psych.com/articles/artDeadMenTalking.php |title=Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Medicine – Dead Men Talking |publisher=Forensic-psych.com |accessdate=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate after death===
[[File:Alexander Sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of Alexander on the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]]]]

Alexander's body was placed in a gold anthropoid [[sarcophagus]], which was in turn placed in a second gold casket.&lt;ref name=sarco1/&gt;  According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest &quot;would be happy and unvanquishable forever&quot;.&lt;ref name=Aelian/&gt;  Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy (it was a [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]] to bury the previous king).&lt;ref&gt;Green, ''Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  At any rate, Ptolemy stole the funeral cortege, and took it to Memphis.&lt;ref name=sarco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aelian/&gt;  His successor, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least [[Late Antiquity]].  [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], one of the last successors of Ptolemy I, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could melt the original down for issues of his coinage.&lt;ref name=sarco2/&gt;  [[Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Augustus]] all visited the tomb in Alexandria, the latter allegedly accidentally knocking the nose off the body.  [[Caligula]] was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use.  In c. AD 200, Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] closed Alexander's tomb to the public.  His son and successor, [[Caracalla]], was a great admirer of Alexander, and visited the tomb in his own reign.  After this, details on the fate of the tomb are sketchy.&lt;ref name=sarco2/&gt;

The so-called &quot;[[Alexander Sarcophagus]]&quot;, discovered near [[Sidon]] and now in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]], is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions hunting and in battle with the Persians.  It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of [[Abdalonymus]] (died 311&amp;nbsp;BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the [[battle of Issus]] in 331.&lt;ref&gt;Studniczka pp. 226ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beazley and Ashmole, p. 59, fig. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Bieber M |title=The Portraits of Alexander |journal=Greece &amp; Rome, Second Series |year=1965 |pages=183–188|volume = 12.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Alexander Sarcophagus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division of the empire===
{{Main|Diadochi}}
[[File:Seleuco I Nicatore.JPG|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Seleucus I Nicator]], who succeeded to Alexander's eastern conquests]]

Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 199&quot;/&gt; Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death.  This left the huge question as to who would rule the newly conquered, and barely pacified empire.&lt;ref name=g24/&gt;  According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him when he was on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was &quot;tôi kratistôi&quot;—&quot;to the strongest&quot;.&lt;ref name=DSXVII117/&gt;  Given that Arrian and Plutarch have Alexander speechless by this point, it is possible that this is an apocryphal story.&lt;ref&gt;Green, ''Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Diodorus, Curtius and Justin also have the more plausible story of Alexander passing his [[Seal (device)|signet ring]] to [[Perdiccas]], one of his bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby possibly nominating Perdiccas as his successor.&lt;ref name=DSXVII117/&gt;&lt;ref name=g24/&gt;

In any event, Perdiccas initially avoided explicitly claiming power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, [[Craterus]], Leonnatus and Antipater as guardians.  However, the infantry, under the command of [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]], rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion.  Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus.  Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings of the Empire—albeit in name only.&lt;ref name=g26/&gt;

It was not long, however, before dissension and rivalry began to afflict the Macedonians.  The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the [[Partition of Babylon]] became power bases each general could use to launch his own bid for power.  After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321&amp;nbsp;BC, all semblance of Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between &quot;The Successors&quot; (''Diadochi'') ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] of Egypt, the [[Seleucid Empire]] in the east, the Kingdom of [[Pergamon]] in Asia Minor, and Macedon.  In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.&lt;ref name=g29/&gt;

===Testament===
[[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] relates that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death.&lt;ref name=DSXVIII4/&gt;  Although Craterus had already started to carry out some of Alexander's commands, the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant.&lt;ref name=DSXVIII4/&gt; Nevertheless, Alexander's will was read out to his troops by Perdiccas upon Alexander's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 199&quot;/&gt; The testament called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations.  Its contents included:
* Construction of a monumental tomb for his father Philip, &quot;to match the greatest of the [[pyramid]]s of Egypt&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 199&quot;/&gt;
* Erection of great temples in [[Delos]], [[Delphi]], [[Dodona]], [[Dium]], [[Amphipolis]], [[Cyrnus]], and a monumental temple to [[Athena]] at [[Troy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 199&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Battle issus decisive.gif|thumb|right|210px|The [[Battle of Issus]], 333 BC]]
Alexander earned the epithet &quot;the Great&quot; due to his unparalleled success as a military commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 192&quot;/&gt; He is known to have never lost a battle, despite being constantly outnumbered in the many battles he fought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 192&quot;/&gt; This success was due to a successful use of terrain, mastery of [[phalanx]] and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and particularly the ability to inspire fierce loyalty among his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 193&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, &quot;Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia&quot;, p. 193}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 110&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonian phalanx, armed with the [[sarissa]], a spear six meters in length, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training,&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 110&quot;/&gt; and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against the larger but more disparate Persian forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 110&quot;/&gt; Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which had different language and weapons, and overcame it by being personally involved in the action,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the manner of a Macedonian king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 193&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 110&quot;/&gt; 

In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small portion of his strength, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line was the same length as that of the Persian cavalry line he faced, about {{convert|3|km|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} (by contrast the Persian infantry was stationed behind the cavalry). This ensured that he would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the scimitars and javelins of the Persians, and Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 122&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the phalanx at the center pushed through with the advantage of its long pikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 122&quot;/&gt; This enabled Alexander to personally lead the charge in the center against Darius, causing him to flee and his army to rout.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 193&quot;/&gt; 
At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius had equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 122&quot;/&gt;

When faced with opponents who used fighting techniques he was unfamiliar with, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander was quick to adapt his forces to his opponents fighting style. Thus, in [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]], Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 193&quot;/&gt;  In India, when confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians were victorious by opening their ranks to envelop the elephants and using their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 194&quot;/&gt;

===Physical appearance===
[[File:AlexandreLouvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman copy of a statue by [[Lysippos]], [[Louvre Museum]].  [[Plutarch]] felt sculptures by Lysippos were the most faithful.]]

Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] (ca. 45–120 AD) describes Alexander appearance as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Alexander had light skin, blond hair, and melting blue eyes.  A sweet natural fragrance came from his body, so strong that it perfumed his clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-classics.com/ALEXANDER.htm|title=&quot;The Great&quot; by Plutarch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another Greek historian [[Arrian]] (Lucius Flavius Arrianus 'Xenophon' ca. 86 - 160) described Alexander as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he strong, handsome commander with [[Heterochromia iridum|one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1stmuse.com/frames/|title=ALEXANDER THE GREAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many statues portray Alexander in a [[S Curve (art)|curved]] body posture, with the gaze looking upward and outward, so some historians consider these signs of physical deformities, but it is also a traditional art concept of [[Contrapposto]] that ancient and modern sculptors often use to signify grace, elegance and social dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/135385/contrapposto|title=Contrapposto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryinstone.in/lang/en/2010/06/04/contrapposto-and-the-s-curve-parallels-between-greek-sculpture-and-a-chola-bronze.html|title=Contrapposto and the S curve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;contra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcyart.com/ad-contrapposto.htm|title=Contrapposto - Arcy Art Original Oil Paintings Art Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emptyeasel.com/2007/12/18/what-is-contrapposto-in-art-heres-an-explanation-of-classical-contrapposto/|title=What is contrapposto?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested by these historians that Alexander's father, Philip II, and his brother, Philip Arrhidaeus, may have suffered from physical deformities, which had led to the conclusion that Alexander had a congenital scoliotic disorder (familial neck and spinal deformity). 

For example, modern British historian [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] (born 1924) provides a description of Alexander's appearance, based on his review of the statues and some ancient documents:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Physically, Alexander was not prepossessing.  Even by Macedonian standards he was very short, though stocky and tough.  His beard was scanty, and he stood out against his hirsute Macedonian barons by going clean-shaven.  His neck was in some way twisted, so that he appeared to be gazing upward at an angle.  His eyes ([[Heterochromia iridum|one blue, one brown]]) revealed a dewy, feminine quality.  He had a high complexion and a harsh voice.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Alexander_bronse_police.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bronze statue of emperor Alexander the Great by [[Lysippos]], Greece, 4th century BC. In 2010 Greek Police arrested two individuals trying to sell the statue in the port city of Thessaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allartnews.com/greek-police-arrest-two-men-with-valuable-antiquities/bronze-statue-of-emperor-alexander-the-great-flanked-by-two-bronze-heads-from-the-roman-period/|title=bronze statue of emperor Alexander the Great flanked by two bronze heads from the Roman period}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It has even been suggested by medical surgeon  Hutan Ashrafian that this scoliosis may have contributed to Alexander's death,&lt;ref name=ashrafian/&gt; however ancient Greek author [[Arrian]] of Nicomedia stated that the king died of fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t28.html|title=The death of Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ancient authors record that Alexander the Great was so pleased with portraits of himself created by [[Lysippos]] that he decreed no other sculptor would make his image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/arth/arth200/politics/images_authority_2_greek.html|title=Portraits of Alexander the Great}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysippos]] had often used the [[Contrapposto]] sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters like [[Apoxyomenos]], [[Hermes]] and [[Eros]].&lt;ref name=&quot;contra&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/museums/apoxyomenos.html|title=Apoxyomenos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ask.com/wiki/Lysippus|title=Lysippos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lysippos' sculpture, famous for its lifelike naturalism, as opposed to a stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Boswroth p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Some of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;  His mother had huge ambitions for Alexander, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;  Indeed, Olympias may have gone to the extent of poisoning Philip Arrhidaeus so as to disable him, and prevent him being a rival for Alexander.&lt;ref name=PA77/&gt;  Olympias's influence instilled huge ambition and a sense of destiny in Alexander,&lt;ref name=g4/&gt; and Plutarch tells us that his ambition &quot;kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years&quot;.&lt;ref name=PA4/&gt;  Alexander's relationship with his father generated the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to out-do his father, as his reckless nature in battle suggests.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;  While Alexander worried that his father would leave him, &quot;no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world&quot;,&lt;ref name=PA5/&gt; he still attempted to downplay his father's achievements to his companions.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;

[[File:Alex_from_pella.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Head of young Alexander the Great by Lysippos, from Pella, Greece, 3rd century BC]]Alexander's most evident personality traits were his violent temper and rash, impulsive nature,&lt;ref name=PA4/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII29/&gt; which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions during his life.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;  Plutarch thought that this particular personality trait caused his weakness for alcohol.&lt;ref name=PA4/&gt;  Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was easier to persuade by reasoned debate.&lt;ref name=PA7/&gt;  Indeed, set beside his fiery temperament, there was a calmer side to Alexander; perceptive, logical, and calculating.  He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader.&lt;ref name=PA8/&gt;  This was no doubt in part due to his tutelage by Aristotle; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn.&lt;ref name=PA7/&gt;&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;  The tale of his &quot;solving&quot; the [[Gordian knot]] neatly demonstrates this. The intelligent and rational side to Alexander is amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general.&lt;ref name=AVII29/&gt; He had great self-restraint in &quot;pleasures of the body&quot;, contrasting with his lack of [[self control]] with alcohol.&lt;ref name=PA4/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII28&gt;Arrian, ''Anabasis Alexandri'' VII, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was undoubtedly erudite, and was a patron to both the arts and sciences.&lt;ref name=PA8/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA4/&gt;  However, he had little interest in sports, or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the [[Homeric]] ideals of glory and fame.&lt;ref name=g4/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA4/&gt;  He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics, which made him a great leader.&lt;ref name=g24/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII29/&gt;  This is further emphasised by the inability of any of his generals to unite the Macedonians and retain the Empire after his death&amp;nbsp;– only Alexander had the personality to do so.&lt;ref name=g24/&gt;

===Megalomania===
During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia.&lt;ref name=g23/&gt;  His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect.&lt;ref name=g20/&gt;  His [[delusions of grandeur]] are readily visible in the [[#Testament|testament]] that he ordered Craterus to fulfil, and in his desire to conquer the known world.&lt;ref name=g23/&gt;

He seems to have come to believe himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself.&lt;ref name=g23/&gt;  Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus,&lt;ref name=PA3/&gt; a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]].&lt;ref name=P27/&gt;  He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon.&lt;ref name=P27/&gt;  Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of ''[[proskynesis]]'', a practice of which the Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform.&lt;ref name=AVII11/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA45/&gt;  Such behaviour cost him much in the sympathies of many of his countrymen.&lt;ref name=PA45/&gt;

===Personal relationships===
{{Main|Personal relationships of Alexander the Great}}
[[File:Mosaica.jpg|thumb|A mural in Pompeii, depicting the marriage of Alexander to Barsine (Stateira) in 324 BC. The couple are apparently dressed as Ares and Aphrodite.]]
The greatest emotional relationship of Alexander's life was with his friend, general, and bodyguard [[Hephaestion]], the son of a Macedonian noble.&lt;ref name=AVII14/&gt;&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVII114/&gt;  Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, sending him into a period of grieving.&lt;ref name=AVII14/&gt;&lt;ref name=P72/&gt;  This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health, and detached [[mental health|mental state]] during his final months.&lt;ref name=g23/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMD/&gt;  Alexander married twice: [[Roxana]], daughter of the [[Bactria]]n nobleman [[Oxyartes]], out of love;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+47.1 ''Alexander'', 47]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stateira II]], a Persian princess and daughter of [[Darius III]] of Persia, as a matter of political interest.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, On the Fortune and Virtue of Alexander, Or2.6&lt;/ref&gt;  He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, [[Heracles of Macedon]] from his mistress Barsine; and lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander01/alexander_iv.html|title=Alexander IV|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowhere in the ancient sources is it stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to [[Troy]] where &quot;Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of [[Patroclus]], the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles&quot;.&lt;ref name=AelXII7/&gt;  Noting that the word ''[[eromenos]]'' (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may indeed have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks ''et al'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green argues that there is little evidence in the ancient sources Alexander had much interest in women, particularly since he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;  However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, Alexander the Great – A new history p. 208. &quot;three attested pregnancies in eight years produces an attested impregnation rate of one every 2.7 years, which is actually superior to that of his father's.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions.  Alexander had accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings but he used it rather sparingly;&lt;ref name=DSXVII77/&gt; showing great self-control in &quot;pleasures of the body&quot;.&lt;ref name=AVII28/&gt;  It is possible that Alexander was simply not a highly sexed person.  Nevertheless, Plutarch describes how Alexander was infatuated by Roxanne while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Fortune and Virtue of Alexander'' I, 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Green suggests that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including [[Ada of Caria]], who adopted Alexander, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief when Alexander died.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;

==Legacy==
===Hellenistic kingdoms===
{{Main|Hellenistic period}}
[[File:Mappa di Eratostene.jpg|thumb|300px|The Hellenistic world view after Alexander: [[ancient world map]] of [[Eratosthenes]] (276–194 BC), incorporating information from the campaigns of Alexander and his successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ancient%20Web%20Pages/112.html |title=Source |publisher=Henry-davis.com |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Alexander's most obvious legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia.  Many of these areas would remain in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200–300 years.  The [[successor state]]s that emerged were, at least initially, dominant forces during this epoch, and these 300 years are often referred to as the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref name=gxii/&gt;

The eastern borders of Alexander's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime.&lt;ref name=g24/&gt;  However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history.  Taking advantage of the neglect shown to this region by the successors, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (referred to in European sources as Sandrokotto), of relatively humble origin, took control of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and then with that power base proceeded to conquer the [[Nanda Empire]] of northern India.&lt;ref name=keay82/&gt;  In 305&amp;nbsp;BC [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], one of the successors, marched to India to reclaim the territory; instead he ceded the area to Chandragupta in return for 500 war elephants.  These in turn played a pivotal role in the [[Battle of Ipsus]] the result of which did much to settle the division of the Empire.&lt;ref name=keay82/&gt;

===Hellenization===
{{Main|Hellenistic civilization}}

Hellenization is a term coined by the German historian [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest.&lt;ref name=gxii/&gt;  That this export took place is undoubted, and can be seen in the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, [[Alexandria]] (one of around twenty towns founded by Alexander&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_z2.html|title=Alexander the Great: his towns|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Antioch]]&lt;ref name=g56/&gt; and [[Seleucia]] (south of modern [[Baghdad]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Excavation/Seleucia.html Seleucia on the Tigris, Iraq]&quot;, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; However, exactly how widespread and deeply permeating this was, and to what extent it was a deliberate policy, is debatable.  Alexander certainly made deliberate efforts to insert Greek elements into [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and in some instances he attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture, culminating in his aspiration to homogenise the populations of Asia and Europe.  However, the successors explicitly rejected such policies after his death.  Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, and moreover, was accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the Successor states.&lt;ref name=g56/&gt;&lt;ref name=g21/&gt;

[[File:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of Alexander bearing an [[Aramaic language]] inscription]]

The core of Hellenistic culture was essentially [[Athenian]] by origin.&lt;ref name=g56/&gt;&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;  The Athenian [[koine]] dialect had been adopted long before Philip II for official use and was thus spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming the [[lingua franca]] through Alexander's conquests.  Furthermore, [[Urban planning|town planning]], education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving though into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic.&lt;ref name=g56/&gt;  Aspects of the Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire up until the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabriel |first=Richard A.|title=The Great Armies of Antiquity|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|page=277|chapter=The army of Byzantium|isbn=0275978095|url=http://books.google.com/?id=y1ngxn_xTOIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=romano-Hellenistic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baynes|first=Norman G.|title=Byzantium: An Introduction to East Roman Civilization|publisher=Baynes Press|year=2007|page=170|chapter=Byzantine art|isbn=978-1406756593|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HdHiVlZ3ErIC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=hellenistic+culture+in+byzantine+traditions&amp;cd=39#v=onepage&amp;q=hellenistic%20culture%20in%20byzantine%20traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|200px|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], in [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist style]], 1st-2nd century AD, [[Gandhara]] (Modern Pakistan). [[Tokyo National Museum]].]]
Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in India, in the region of the relatively late-arising [[Indo-Greeks|Indo-Greek kingdoms]].&lt;ref name=k101/&gt;  There, isolated from Europe, Greek culture apparently hybridised with Indian, and especially Buddhist, influences.  The first realistic portrayals of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] appeared at this time; they are modelled on Greek statues of [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name=k101/&gt;  Several [[Buddhist]] traditions may have been influenced by the [[ancient Greek religion]]: the concept of [[Boddhisatvas]] is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes,&lt;ref&gt;Luniya, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Mahayana]] [[Offering (Buddhism)|ceremonial practices]] (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks.  [[Zen Buddhism]] draws in part on the ideas of Greek [[stoics]], such as [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]].&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  One Greek king, [[Menander I]], probably became Buddhist, and is immortalized in [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]] as 'Milinda'.&lt;ref name=k101/&gt;

===Influence on Rome===
Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements.  [[Polybius]] started his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' by reminding Romans of his role, and thereafter subsequent Roman leaders saw him as their inspirational role model.  Julius Caesar reportedly wept in Spain at the sight of Alexander's statue, because he thought he had achieved so little by the same age that Alexander had conquered the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch, Caesar, 11&quot;/&gt;  [[Pompey the Great]] searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which he then wore as a sign of greatness.  In his zeal to honor Alexander, [[Augustus]] accidentally broke the nose off the Macedonian's mummified corpse while laying a wreath at the Alexander's tomb Alexandria.  The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person of [[Macrinus]] briefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewelry, or embroidered into their clothes.&lt;ref name=Holt3/&gt;

In the summer of 1995, a statue of Alexander was recovered in an excavation of a Roman house in Alexandria, which was richly decorated with mosaic and marble pavements and probably was constructed in the 1st century AD and occupied until the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptology.com/kmt/fall96/nile.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209231921/http://www.egyptology.com/kmt/fall96/nile.html|archivedate=2008-02-09 |title=Salima Ikram.  Nile Currents |publisher=Egyptology.com |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Demetrius I of Bactria.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] (reigned c. 200–180 BC), wearing an elephant scalp, took over Alexander's legacy in the east by again invading [[India]] in 180 BC, and establishing the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] (180 BC–10 AD).]]

===Legend===
{{Main|Alexander the Great in legend}}

There are many legendary accounts surrounding the life of Alexander the Great, with a relatively large number deriving from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself.  His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in [[Cilicia]] as drawing back from him in [[proskynesis]].  Writing shortly after Alexander's death, another participant, [[Onesicritus]], went so far as to invent a tryst between Alexander and [[Thalestris]], queen of the mythical [[Amazons]].  When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King [[Lysimachus]] reportedly quipped, &quot;I wonder where I was at the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=PA46/&gt;
[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|right|float|230px|The major Hellenistic realms; the ''[[Ptolemaic kingdom]]'' (dark blue) and the ''[[Seleucid empire]]'' (yellow).]]
In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text known as the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', later falsely ascribed to the historian Callisthenes and therefore known as ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''.  This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoneman|first=Richard|title=Alexander the Great: A Life in Legend|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-300-11203-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an Iranian or Persian account of Alexander the Great in &quot;[[Shahnameh]]&quot; or &quot;The Epic of the Kings&quot; by Ferdowsi. It is called Eskandarnameh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AT8HI3S0NwMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=k_JYEEoUpl&amp;dq=Sikander%20SIKANDER%20firdausi&amp;pg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Eskandarnameh |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It speaks of Alexander being the son of Nahid (Lydia) and being sent back to Philip of Macedon because she had bad breath. Later it is mentioned that the name Eskandar was given because the remedy it provided for his mother. Arab historians then referred to him as al-Iskandar.

===In ancient and modern culture===
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great}}

Alexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been preserved and depicted in many ways.  Alexander has figured in works of both high and popular culture from his own era to the modern day. In the [[Middle Ages]] he was created a member of the [[Nine Worthies]], a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of [[chivalry]].

In Punjab, the land of his final conquest, the name &quot;Secunder&quot; is commonly given to children even today.  This is both due to respect and admiration for Alexander and also as a memento to the fact that fighting the people of Punjab fatigued his army to the point that they revolted against him.

A common proverb in the Punjab reads ''jit jit key jung, secunder jay haar'', in translation, &quot;Alexander wins so many battles that he loses the war&quot;. It is used to address anyone who is good at winning but never takes advantage of those wins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Mataranyika&quot;&gt;[http://www.financialgazette.co.zw/comment/2787-moment-of-truth.html Moment of truth], by Philip Mataranyika, Thursday, 18 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historical Alexander the Great}}
Texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander are all lost apart from a few inscriptions and fragments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 loc=Chapter 9: Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington, Alexander the Great, Macedonia and Asia, p. 186&quot;/&gt;  Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life include Alexander's campaign historian [[Callisthenes]]; Alexander's generals [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Nearchus]]; [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman.  These works have been lost, but later works based on these [[primary source|original sources]] survive.  The five main surviving accounts are by [[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Plutarch]], [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]].&lt;ref name=grxxii/&gt;

'''Alfred Habdank Skarbek Korzybski''' ({{IPAc-pl|k|o|'|rz|y|p|s|k|i}}) (July 3, 1879 &amp;ndash; March 1, 1950) was a [[Polish-American]] [[philosopher]] and [[scientist]]. He is remembered most for developing the theory of [[general semantics]].

==Early life and career==
[[Image:Herb Abdank.svg|thumb|left|100px|Alfred Korzybski's family coat-of-arms (''[[Abdank coat of arms|Habdank]])''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}]]
Korzybski was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] which at that time was part of the  [[Russian Empire]].  He was part of an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Polish family whose members had worked as [[Mathematics|mathematicians]], [[Science|scientists]], and [[Engineering|engineers]] for generations.  He learned the [[Polish language]] at home and the [[Russian language]] in schools; and having a [[France|French]] [[governess]] and a [[Germany|German]] governess, he became fluent in these four languages as a child.  

Korzybski was educated at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] in [[engineering]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]] Korzybski served as an [[Military intelligence|intelligence officer]] in the [[Russia]]n Army. After being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries, he came to [[North America]] in 1916 (first to [[Canada]], then the [[United States]]) to coordinate the shipment of [[artillery]] to Russia. He also lectured to [[Polish-American]] audiences about the conflict, promoting the sale of [[war bonds]]. After the War, he decided to remain in the United States, becoming a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] in 1940. His first book, ''Manhood of Humanity'', was published in 1921. In the book, he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind: mankind as a &quot;[[time-binding]]&quot; class of life (humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which are accreted in cultures).

==General semantics==
Korzybski's work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named [[general semantics]] (GS). As Korzybski said, GS should not be confused with [[semantics]], a different subject. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are described in the publication &lt;cite&gt;''Science and Sanity''&lt;/cite&gt;, published in 1933. In 1938 Korzybski founded the [[Institute of General Semantics]] and directed it until his death in [[Lakeville (Salisbury, Connecticut)|Lakeville, Connecticut]], [[United States|USA]].

Korzybski's work maintained that human beings are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the [[structure]] of their languages. Human beings cannot experience the world directly, but only through their &quot;abstractions&quot; (nonverbal impressions or &quot;gleanings&quot; derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). Sometimes our perceptions and our languages actually mislead us as to the &quot;facts&quot; with which we must deal. Our understanding of what is happening sometimes lacks ''similarity of structure'' with what is actually happening. 
He stressed training in awareness of abstracting, using techniques that he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, &quot;consciousness of abstracting&quot;. 
His system included modifying the way we consider the world, e.g., with an attitude of &quot;I don't know; let's see,&quot; to better discover or reflect its realities as revealed by modern science. One of these techniques involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience that he termed, &quot;silence on the objective levels&quot;.

==&quot;To be&quot;==
Many devotees and critics of Korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb &quot;to be.&quot; His system, however, is based primarily on such terminology as the different &quot;orders of abstraction,&quot; and formulations such as &quot;consciousness of abstracting.&quot; It is often said that Korzybski ''opposed'' the use of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; which is an exaggeration (see &quot;Criticisms&quot; below). 

He thought that ''certain uses'' of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, called the &quot;is of identity&quot; and the &quot;is of [[E-prime#The different functions of .27to be.27|predication]]&quot;, were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as, &quot;Elizabeth is a fool&quot; (said of a person named &quot;Elizabeth&quot; who has done something that we regard as foolish). In Korzybski's system, one's assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself. Korzybski's remedy was to ''deny'' identity; in this example, to be aware continually that &quot;Elizabeth&quot; is ''not'' what we ''call'' her. We find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain (the two, he said, amount to different orders of abstraction). This was expressed by Korzybski's most famous premise, &quot;[[Map-territory relation|the map is not the territory]]&quot;. Note that this premise uses the phrase &quot;is not&quot;, a form of &quot;to be&quot;; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon &quot;to be&quot; as such. In fact, he  said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb 
&quot;to be&quot; when used as an [[E-prime#The different functions of .27to be.27|auxiliary verb]] or when used to state existence or location. 

It was even all right sometimes to use the faulty forms of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; as long as one was aware of their structural limitations. This was developed into the language &quot;[[E-Prime]]&quot; by one of his students 15 years after his death (E-Prime a form of the English language in which the verb &quot;to be&quot; does not appear in any of its forms; for example, the sentence &quot;the movie was good&quot; could translate into E-Prime as &quot;I liked the movie&quot;, thereby distinguishing opinion from fact).

==Anecdote==
One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. &quot;Nice biscuit, don't you think,&quot; said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words &quot;Dog Cookies.&quot; The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. &quot;You see,&quot; Korzybski remarked, 
&quot;I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. Diekstra, ''Haarlemmer Dagblad'', 1993, cited by L. Derks &amp; J. Hollander, ''Essenties van NLP'' (Utrecht: Servire, 1996), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{see also|General Semantics#Criticism}}

Korzybski's work influenced [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;http://time-binding.org/misc/akml/akmls/58-ellis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neuro-linguistic programming]]&lt;ref&gt;Bandler, Richard &amp; John Grinder (1975). The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy. Palo Alto, CA: Science &amp; Behavior Books.&lt;/ref&gt; (especially the [[Meta model (NLP)|Meta model]], Korzybski's critique of cause-effect thinking, and ideas behind human modeling for performance). As reported in the Third Edition of ''Science and Sanity'', The U.S. Army in World War II used his system to treat battle fatigue in Europe with the supervision of Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, who also became the psychiatrist in charge of the Nazi prisoners at Nuremberg.  Other individuals influenced by Korzybski include [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundoandino.com/Chile/Alejandro-Jodorowsky Unofficial biography of Alejandro Jodorowsky.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Burke]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Frank Herbert]], [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[John Grinder]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Douglas Engelbart]], [[Stuart Chase]], [[Alvin Toffler]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]] (Korzybski is mentioned in the 1940 short story &quot;[[Blowups Happen]]&quot; and the 1949 novella ''[[Gulf (Heinlein)|Gulf]]''), [[Dianetics|L.Ron Hubbard]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], [[Alan Watts]], entertainer [[Steve Allen (comedian)|Steve Allen]], and Tommy Hall (lyricist for the [[13th Floor Elevators]]); and scientists such as [[William Alanson White]] (psychiatry), physicist [[Percy Williams Bridgman|P. W. Bridgman]], and researcher W. Horsley Gantt (a former student and colleague of [[Ivan Petrovich Pavlov|Pavlov]]).  He also influenced the Belgian [[surrealist]] writer of comics [[Jan Bucquoy]] in the seventh part of the comics series ''Jaunes'': ''Labyrinthe'', with explicit reference in the plot to Korzybski's &quot;[[Map-territory relation|the map is not the territory]]&quot;. 

Some of the General Semantics tradition was continued by [[Samuel I. Hayakawa]], who did have a dispute with Korzybski. When asked because of what, Hayakawa is said to have replied: &quot;Words.&quot;

'''''Asteroids''''' is a video [[arcade game]] released in [[1979 in video gaming|1979]] by [[Atari Inc.]]  It was one of the most popular and influential games of the [[Golden age of video arcade games|Golden Age of Arcade Games]]. ''Asteroids'' uses a [[vector display]] and a two-dimensional view that wraps around in both screen axes (a [[toroid|toroidal topology]]). The player controls a spaceship in an [[asteroid]] field which is periodically traversed by [[flying saucer]]s. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire.

==Description==
The game was conceived by [[Myke Hawk]] and programmed and designed by [[Ed Logg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=15438 | work=allgame | publisher=Macrovision | title=Asteroids | author=Brett Alan Weiss | accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was implemented on hardware developed by Howard Delman. ''Asteroids'' was a hit in the [[United States]] and became Atari's best selling game of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;atarisite&quot;&gt;http://www.atari.com/games/atari_classics&lt;/ref&gt; Atari had been in the process of manufacturing another vector game, ''[[Lunar Lander (arcade game)|Lunar Lander]]'', but demand for ''Asteroids'' was so high &quot;that several hundred ''Asteroids'' games were shipped in ''Lunar Lander'' cabinets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asteroids'' was so popular that [[video arcade]] operators sometimes had to install larger boxes to hold the amount of coins that were spent by players.

''Asteroids'' is also the first game to use Atari's &quot;[[QuadraScan]]&quot; vector-refresh system;&lt;ref name=&quot;asteroidsflyer&quot;&gt;Asteroids Flyer, 1979, [[Atari, Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a full-color version known as &quot;Color-QuadraScan&quot; was later developed for games such as ''[[Space Duel]]'' and ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Asteroi1.png|thumb|left|Asteroids screenshot]]
The objective of ''Asteroids'' is to score as many points as possible by destroying asteroids and [[flying saucers]]. The player controls a [[triangle|triangular]]-shaped [[spacecraft|ship]] that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As the ship moves, [[momentum]] is not conserved — the ship eventually [[Newton's laws of motion|comes to a stop]] again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).

Each stage starts with a few asteroids drifting in random directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges — for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that frequently move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids also score higher points. Periodically, a [[flying saucer]] appears on one side of the screen and moves across to the other before disappearing again. The saucers are of two kinds: Large saucers fire in random directions, while small saucers aim at the player's ship.

The minimalist soundtrack features a memorable deep-toned electronic &quot;heartbeat&quot;, which quickens as the asteroid density is reduced by the player's fire.

Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears. The number of asteroids increases each round up to a maximum of 12. The game is over when the player has lost all of his/her lives.

Like many games of its time, ''Asteroids'' contains several [[Software bug|bugs]] that were mostly the result of the original programmers underestimating the game's popularity or the skill of its players. The maximum possible score in this game is 99,990 points, after which it &quot;[[integer overflow|rolls over]]&quot; back to zero. Other common terms for this bug were &quot;turn over&quot; and &quot;flip over&quot;.  Also, an oversight in the small saucer's programming gave rise to a popular strategy known as &quot;lurking&quot; — because the saucer could only shoot directly at the player's position on the screen, the player could &quot;hide&quot; at the opposite end of the screen and shoot across the screen boundary, while remaining relatively safe.  Another popular method of exploiting this bug was to simply use thrust to keep the ship in motion with 1 or 2 asteroids in the play field, allowing the player to pick off as many 1,000 point UFOs as possible. This led to experienced players being able to play indefinitely on a single credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.gamearchive.com/General/Articles/ClassicNews/1981/Esquire2-81-pg62.htm  | journal=FHM | volume=2 | issue=81 | page=62 | title=Invasion OF THE Asteroids | last=Owen | first=David | quote=players began to figure out that if they picked off all but one or two little asteroids, they could safely lurk around the edges of the screen and wait for the saucer to appear |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080801211047/http://www.gamearchive.com/General/Articles/ClassicNews/1981/Esquire2-81-pg62.htm |archivedate = 2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oversight was addressed in the game's sequel, ''[[Asteroids Deluxe]]'', and led to significant changes in the way game developers designed and tested their games in the future.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

On some early versions of the game, it was also possible to hide the ship in the score area indefinitely without being hit by asteroids.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Technical description==
The ''Asteroids'' arcade machine is a [[vector game]]. This means that the game graphics are composed entirely of lines which are drawn on a [[vector monitor]]. The hardware consists primarily of a standard [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] [[central processing unit|CPU]], which executes the game program, and the [[Atari Digital Vector Generator|Digital Vector Generator]] (DVG), vector processing [[Electronic circuit|circuitry]] developed by [[Atari]] themselves. As the 6502 by itself was too slow to control both the game play and the vector hardware at the same time, the latter task was delegated to the DVG.

The original design concepts of the DVG came out of Atari's off-campus research lab in Grass Valley, California, in 1978. The prototype was given to engineer Howard Delman, who refined it, productized it, and then added additional features for Atari's first vector game, ''[[Lunar Lander (arcade game)|Lunar Lander]]''. When it was decided that ''Asteroids'' would be a vector game as well, Delman modified a ''Lunar Lander'' circuit board for Ed Logg. More memory was added, as was the circuitry for the many sounds in the game. That original ''Asteroids'' prototype board still exists, and is currently in Delman's personal collection.

For each picture frame, the 6502 writes graphics commands for the DVG into a defined area of [[RAM]] (the vector RAM), and then asks the DVG to draw the corresponding vector image on the screen. The DVG reads the commands and generates appropriate signals for the vector monitor. There are DVG commands for positioning the cathode ray, for drawing a line to a specified destination, calling a subroutine with further commands, and so on.

''Asteroids'' also features various sound effects, each of which is implemented by its own circuitry. There are seven distinct audio circuits, designed by Howard Delman. The CPU activates these audio circuits (and other hardware components) by writing to special memory addresses (memory mapped ports). The inputs from the player's controls (buttons) are also mapped into the CPU [[address space]]

The main ''Asteroids'' game program uses only 6 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] code. Another 2 KB of vector ROM contains the descriptions of the main graphical elements (rocks, saucer, player's ship, explosion pictures, letters, and digits) in the form of DVG commands.

==Legacy==
Due to the game's success, a sequel followed in 1980 dubbed ''Asteroids Deluxe''. Similar to the original game, the onscreen objects were tinted blue and a shield that depleted with use replaced the hyperspace feature. In addition, the asteroids rotated, a new enemy dubbed a ''killer satellite'' was added to the game, and would break apart into two smaller ships that homed on the player's position if shot. Also included was a &quot;3-D&quot; monitor surround that glowed in the white-UV light.  The ship and asteroids appeared to &quot;float&quot; over this cardboard backdrop.  Two more sequels followed this, ''[[Space Duel]]'' in 1982 and ''[[Blasteroids]]'' in 1987.

The [[Killer List of Videogames]] (KLOV) credits this game as one of the &quot;Top 100 Videogames.&quot; Readers of the KLOV credit it as the seventh most popular game.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The gameplay in ''Asteroids'' was imitated by many games that followed. For example, one of the objects of ''[[Sinistar]]'' is to shoot asteroids to get them to release resources which the player needs to collect.

''Asteroids'' has been ported to multiple systems, including many of [[Atari]]'s systems ([[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 7800|7800]], [[Atari Lynx]]) and many others. The 2600 port was the first game to use a bank-switched cartridge, doubling available ROM space. A port was in development for the [[Atari 5200|5200]] and advertised as a launch title but never officially released, although an unofficial release was produced by [[AtariAge]]. The [[Atari 7800]] version was a launch title and featured co-operative play, it was the built in game on the European [[Atari 7800]] release. 1993 saw a release for PCs with Windows 3.1 as part of the original ''[[Microsoft Arcade]]'' package. Also, a new version of ''Asteroids'' was developed for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and the [[Game Boy Color]] in the late 1990s. A port was also included on Atari's [[Atari Cosmos|Cosmos]] system, but the system never saw release. Many of the recent [[TV Games]] series of old Atari games have included either the 2600 or arcade versions of ''Asteroids''. Atari also used the game for its other late '90s and 2000's anthology series.

'''''Asteroids Hyper 64''''' is an update to the 1979 [[arcade game|arcade]] shooter ''Asteroids'' released for the [[Nintendo 64]] on December 14, 1999. It includes fully [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environments, new weapons, over 50 levels, and a 2 player split-screen mode; including a Versus mode, a Co-op mode, and a Team mode.

In 2001, Infogrames released ''[[Atari Anniversary Edition]]'' for the Sega Dreamcast and PC compatibles which included emulated versions of Asteroids and other classics.

In 2004, ''Asteroids'' (Including both the [[Atari 2600]] port and the arcade original, along with ''Asteroids Deluxe'') were included as part of ''[[Atari Anthology]]'' for both [[Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]], using Digital Eclipse's emulation technology. (This package was released for the PC a year earlier under the title ''Atari: 80 Classic Games in One''.)

''Asteroids'' was released via [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the [[Xbox 360]] on November 28, 2007, with an option for special revamped HD graphics and a high-speed &quot;throttle monkey&quot; mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/11/26/554786.aspx | work=Gamerscore Blog | title=Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe on Xbox LIVE Arcade | author=Tom Eberspecher | date=2007-11-26 | accessdate=2009-06-07 | publisher=Microsoft Games Global Marketing team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''Asteroids'' and ''Asteroids Deluxe'' were also re-released to [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] ''[[Game Room]]'' download service for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows-based]] [[personal computer|PC]]s in 2010.  The [[Atari 2600]] version of ''Asteroids'' was also released in July 2010 for ''[[Game Room]].

[[Glu Mobile]] released a licensed cellular phone version of ''Asteroids'' that includes the original game as well as updated gameplay, skins, and modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.glu.com/noram/pages/product.aspx?pr=Asteroids | publisher=Glu Mobile | work=Glu Games | title=Asteroids | accessdate=2009-06-07}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a port for [[Rockbox]] was released, named &quot;Spacerocks&quot;.

===Clones and bootlegs===
There have been many unofficial ports of ''Asteroids'' produced. These include near-copies such as [[Acornsoft|Acornsoft's]] ''[[Meteors (game)|Meteors]]'' and [[Ambrosia Software]]'s [[Maelstrom (1992 video game)|Maelstrom]], as well as those with expanded gameplay and background, such as ''[[Asterax]]'', ''[[Astrogeddon]]'', ''[[Stardust (video game)|Stardust]]'', ''[[Spheres of Chaos]]'' and ''Astro Fire''. The [[Vectrex]] had a built-in similar game called &quot;Minestorm&quot;.

==Highest score==
On November 13, 1982, 15 year old [[Scott Safran]] of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, set a [[world record]] of 41,336,440 points on the arcade game ''Asteroids''. He beat the 40,101,910 point score set by Leo Daniels of Carolina Beach on February 6, 1982. To congratulate Safran on his accomplishment, the [[Twin Galaxies]] Intergalactic Scoreboard searched for him for four years until 2002, when it was discovered that he had died in an accident in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;twin&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/11/dayintech_1113 | title=Nov. 13, 1982: Teen Sets Asteroids Record in 3-Day Marathon | publisher=Conde Nast | work=Wired | date=2008-11-13 | accessdate=2009-06-07 | author=Chris Kohler}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ceremony in Philadelphia on April 27, 2002, Walter Day of Twin Galaxies presented an award to the surviving members of Safran's family, commemorating the Asteroid Champion's achievement.&lt;ref name=&quot;twin&quot; /&gt;

On April 6, 2010, John McAllister set a preliminary record score of 41,338,740 after 58 hours, streamed live over the Internet, breaking the record set by Scott Safran 27 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/04/asteroids-record/ | title=Asteroids Player Smashes 27-Year-Old High Score | publisher=Wired | date=April 5, 2010 | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asteroids in popular culture==
* In 1982, [[Buckner &amp; Garcia]] recorded a song titled &quot;Hyperspace&quot;, using sound effects from the game, and released it on the album ''[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]]''.
* In the ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'' episode &quot;Everyone Hates The Lottery&quot;, half the plot revolves around Chris trying to defend his title of the best Asteroids player of the neighborhood.
* In the [[Stargate Atlantis]] episode &quot;Adrift&quot;, when McKay pilots a jumper to defend the city against asteroids, he remarks it is similar to the arcade game. He also comments that he was especially bad at the game and even scored 0 once.

==Film==
In July 2009, it was revealed that [[Universal Studios]] had won the rights to adapt the game into a film. Matthew Lopez will write the script and [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] will be producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kit |first=Borys |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ic3a4730761c7eaf6aac2de4e28ef8e67 |title='Asteroids' lands at Universal |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asparagales''' is the name of an [[order (biology)|order]] of plants, used in modern classification systems such as the [[APG III system]] (which is used throughout this article).&lt;ref name=&quot;APG3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order takes its name from the family  [[Asparagaceae]] and is placed in the [[monocots]]. The order has only recently been recognized in classification systems. It was first put forward by Huber in 1977&lt;ref name=&quot;Huber_1977&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Huber|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later taken up in the [[Dahlgren system]] of 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahlgren_Clifford_Yeo_1985&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dahlgren|Clifford|Yeo|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, many of its families were assigned to the old order [[Liliales]]: a very large order containing almost all monocots with colourful [[tepal]]s and without [[starch]] in their [[endosperm]]. [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequence analysis]] indicated that Liliales should be divided into at least Liliales, Asparagales and [[Dioscoreales]]. The boundaries of the Asparagales and of its families have undergone a series of changes in recent years; future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability.

The order is clearly [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] on the basis of DNA sequence analysis, but is difficult to define morphologically, since its members are structurally diverse. Thus although most species in the order are [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], some no more than 15&amp;nbsp;cm high, there are a number of climbers (e.g. some species of ''[[Asparagus]]''), as well as several genera forming trees (e.g. ''[[Agave]]'', ''[[Cordyline]]'', ''[[Yucca]]'', ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]''), some of which can exceed 10 m in height. [[Succulent]] genera occur in several families (e.g. ''[[Aloe]]'').

One of the defining characteristics of the order is the presence of [[phytomelan]],&lt;ref&gt;'Phytomelan' appears as 'phytomelanin' in some sources.&lt;/ref&gt; a black pigment present in the seed coat, creating a dark crust. Phytomelan is found in most families of the Asparagales (although not in [[Orchidaceae]], thought to be a sister to the rest of the group).

Almost all species have a tight cluster of leaves (a rosette), either at the base of the plant or at the end of a more-or-less woody stem; the leaves are less often produced along the stem. The flowers are in the main not particularly distinctive, being of a general 'lily type', with six [[tepal]]s, either free or fused from the base.

The order is thought to have first diverged from other related monocots some 120-130 million years ago (early in the [[Cretaceous period]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Janssen_Bremer_2004&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Janssen|Bremer|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Magallon_Castillo_2009&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Magallón|Castillo|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved, estimates are likely to be uncertain.

From an economic point of view, the order Asparagales is second in importance within the monocots to the order [[Poales]] (which includes grasses and cereals). Species are used as food and flavourings (e.g. [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[leek]], [[asparagus]], [[vanilla]]), as cut flowers (e.g. [[freesia]], [[gladiolus]], [[iris (plant)|iris]], [[orchid]]s), and as garden ornamentals (e.g. [[Hemerocallis|day lilies]], [[Convallaria|lily of the valley]], ''[[Agapanthus]]'').

==Characteristics==
[[File:Hippeastrum-seeds.jpg| thumb | Seeds of ''[[Hippeastrum]]'' with dark [[phytomelan]]-containing coat]]
[[File:Nolina Menton.JPG| thumb | Tree-like habit created by secondary thickening in ''[[Nolina recurvata]]'']]

Most species of Asparagales are [[herbaceous perennial]]s, although some are climbers (e.g. species of ''[[Asparagus]]'', family Asparagaceae) and some are tree-like. The order also contains many [[geophyte]]s (bulbs, corms and various kinds of tuber). Almost all species have a tight cluster of leaves  (a rosette) at the base of the plant or, in the tree-forming species, at the end of a woody stem. Only in a few cases are leaves produced along the length of the stem. The flowers are often at the tip of the stem and are mainly of a rather generalized 'lily type', with six tepals and up to six stamens.

The orders which have been separated from the old Liliales are difficult to characterize. No single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order Asparagales.

* The flowers of Asparagales are of a general type among the [[lilioid monocot]]s. Compared to Liliales, they usually have plain [[tepal]]s without markings in the form of dots. If [[nectary|nectaries]] are present, they are in the [[septum|septa]] of the [[ovary (plant)|ovaries]] rather than at the base of the tepals or [[stamen]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

* Those species which have relatively large dry seeds have a dark, crust-like (crustose) outer layer containing the pigment [[phytomelan]]. However, some species with hairy seeds (e.g. ''[[Eriospermum]]'', family Asparagaceae ''s.l.''), berries (e.g. ''[[Maianthemum]]'', family Asparagaceae ''s.l.''), or highly reduced seeds (e.g. orchids) lack this dark pigment in their seed coats. Phytomelan is not unique to Asparagales (i.e. it is not a [[synapomorphy]]) but it is common within the order and rare outside it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_2004&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner portion of the seed coat is usually completely collapsed. In contrast, the morphologically similar seeds of Liliales have no phytomelan, and usually retain a cellular structure in the inner portion of the seed coat.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

* Most monocots are unable to thicken their stems once they have formed, since they lack the cylindrical [[meristem]] present in other angiosperm groups. Asparagales have a method of secondary thickening which is otherwise only found in''[[Dioscorea]]'' (in the order Disoscoreales). In a process called 'anomalous secondary growth', they are able to create new vascular bundles around which thickening growth occurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudall_1995&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudall|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Agave]]'', ''[[Yucca]]'', ''[[Aloe]]'', ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'', ''[[Nolina]]'' and ''[[Cordyline]]'' can become massive trees, albeit not of the height of the tallest dicots, and with less branching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_2004&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other genera in the order, such as ''[[Lomandra]]'' and ''[[Aphyllanthes]]'', have the same type of secondary growth but confined to their underground stems.

* [[Microsporogenesis]] (part of [[pollen]] formation) distinguishes some members of Asparagales from Liliales. Microsporogenesis involves a cell dividing twice ([[meiosis|meiotically]]) to form four daughter cells. There are two kinds of microsporogenesis: successive and simultaneous (although intermediates exist). In successive microsporogenesis, walls are laid down separating the daughter cells after each division. In simultaneous microsporogenesis, there is no wall formation until all four cell [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] are present. Liliales all have successive microsporogenesis, which is thought to be the primitive condition in monocots. It seems that when the Asparagales first diverged they developed simultaneous microsporogenesis, which the 'lower' Asparagale families retain. However, the 'core' Asparagales (see [[#Phylogeny]] section) have reverted to successive microsporogenesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furness_Rudall_1999&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Furness|Rudall|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Asparagales appear to be unified by a mutation affecting their [[telomere]]s (a region of repetitive [[DNA]] at the end of a [[chromosome]]). The typical '''Arabidopsis''-type' sequence of bases has been fully or partially replaced by other sequences, with the 'human-type' predominating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sykorova_Lim_Kunicka_Chase_2003&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sýkorová|Lim|Kunicka|Chase|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Other apomorphic characters of the order according to Stevens are: the presence of chelidonic acid, anthers longer than wide, tapetal cells bi- to tetra-nuclear, tegmen not persistent, endosperm helobial, and loss of mitochondrial gene ''sdh3''.&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot; /&gt;

==Diversity==

The taxonomic diversity of the monocotyledons is described in detail by Kubitzki.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kubitzki_1998&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kubitzki|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kubitzki_2006&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kubitzki|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up-to-date information on the Asparagales can be found on the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]].&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot; /&gt;

The families of the Asparagales, as set out in the [[APG III system]], are briefly surveyed below. For more information follow the links to the main articles.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Blc turambeat-flores.jpg|thumb|left|Flowers of ''x[[Brassolaeliocattleya]]'' 'Turanbeat', a hybrid between the genera ''[[Brassavola]]'', ''[[Laelia]]'' and ''[[Cattleya]]''.]]

===Orchidaceae===

{{main|Orchidaceae}}

The orchid family is one of the two largest families of [[angiosperm]]s (the other is [[Asteraceae]]). The shape of the flowers is very distinctive, making orchids easy to recognize. The flower is bilaterally symmetrical. The three [[sepal]]s are generally colourful and bright (which is why they are sometimes called outer [[tepal]]s), with one on each side (&quot;lateral sepals&quot;) and one usually at the top of the flower (&quot;dorsal sepal&quot;), sometimes forming a hood. The three [[petal]]s (or inner tepals), also showy, are located alternately between the sepals, two at the side and one usually at the bottom of the flower. The lower petal is referred to as the &quot;[[labellum]]&quot; or &quot;lip&quot;, and is usually distinctively different from the side petals. [[Thelymitra]] is an example of a genus where the lower petal is similar in appearance to the other petals. The pollination systems of orchids are among the most complex and interesting of all the angiosperms.

Orchids include many species of great ornamental value. [[Vanilla]] is obtained from the fruit of the orchid ''Vanilla planifolia''.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===Boryaceae===

{{main|Boryaceae}}

The genus ''[[Borya]]'' contains tree-like species which behave as &quot;resurrection plants&quot;. Growing on rocky slopes, the plants dry out during the dry season and become a rusty orange color, but quickly turn green and become active again once it starts to rain. Along with the other genus in the Boryaceae family, ''[[Alania (plant)|Alania]]'', these [[xerophyte|xerophytic]] plants are native to [[Australia]].
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Blandfordia grandiflora-Minchen.jpg|thumb|left|Flowers of ''[[Blandfordia grandiflora]]''.]]

=== Blandfordiaceae ===

{{main|Blandfordiaceae}}

''[[Blandfordia]]'' is the only genus in the family Blandfordiaceae, with four species distributed in eastern [[Australia]]. They are commonly called &quot;Christmas Bells&quot;, because of the shape of their flowers and their flowering time, which coincides with [[Christmas]] in Australia. They are upright perennial herbs (to about 1.50 m), with distinctive [[leaves]]. The [[inflorescence]] is a [[raceme]]. Individual flowers have jointed pedicels and tepals forming a tubular shape. The [[seed]]s have conspicuous hairs.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

=== Lanariaceae ===

{{main| Lanariaceae}}

''[[Lanaria lanata]]'' is the only species in the family Lanariaceae and is found in southern [[South Africa]]. A more or less typical [[monocotyledon]], the species can be recognized by its shortly branched [[inflorescence]] covered with branched hairs (giving rise to the common name of Lamb's-tail). The flowers are radially symmetrical.

=== Asteliaceae ===

{{main|Asteliaceae}}

The Asteliaceae is a family of two to four genera of plants found in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. They are more or less [[rhizome|rhizomatous]], with spiral leaves and an [[inflorescence]] that may form a [[raceme]] or a spike. There are large bracts at the base of the inflorescence. The individual flowers are small, with tepals joined at the base.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Hypoxis hemerocallidea BotGardBln1105InflorescenceHabitus.JPG| thumb | left | Habit of ''[[Hypoxis hemerocallidea]]'']]

===Hypoxidaceae===

{{main|Hypoxidaceae}}

The family includes some 150 species with a worldwide distribution, excluding Europe and northern Asia. Species can be recognized by their [[rosette (botany)|rosette]]s of more or less folded leaves with persistent bases and quite prominent nonglandular hairs. The tepals in the outer whorl tend to be green on the outside. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior with often a thin tubular portion at its apex formed by joined tepals or the tip of the ovary.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Ixiolirion montanum1PAXTON.jpg|thumb | left | Habit of ''Ixiolirion''.]]

=== Ixioliriaceae ===

{{main|Ixioliriaceae}}

The family includes a single genus, ''[[Ixiolirion]]'', with four species distributed from [[Egypt]] to central [[Asia]]. They are herbs with [[corm]]s and an [[inflorescence]] forming a cluster. The individual flowers are blue, shortly tubular, with an inferior [[ovary (plants)|ovary]].
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Tecophilaea violiflora Colla.jpg| thumb | left | Flowers of ''[[Tecophilaea violiflora]]''.]]

===Tecophilaeaceae===

{{main|Tecophilaeaceae}}

The nine genera are found in [[Chile]], the [[United States]] and [[Africa]]. They are herbs with [[corm]]s and leaves which are sometimes stalked (petiolate) with wide blades. The flowers have [[tepal]]s that open outwards. The [[stamen]]s are strongly dimorphic. The [[anther]]s open by pores.

The genus ''[[Cyanastrum]]'' is sometimes placed in its own family Cyanastraceae.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Doryanthes palmeri JPG1a.jpg| thumb | left | Habit of ''[[Doryanthes palmeri]]'']]

===Doryanthaceae===

{{main|Doryanthaceae}}

The two species of ''Doryanthes'', the only genus of the family, are huge rosette-forming herbs that are a conspicuous element of the flora in the vicinity of [[Sydney]], Australia, being hard not to notice when in flower. The leaves have entire margins but disintegrate into fibres at the apex. The sub-[[umbel]]late [[inflorescence]]s are borne at the end of long stems, having numerous bright red flowers, which are radially symmetric with inferior [[ovary (plants)|ovaries]].
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Iris sibirica 060603.jpg| thumb | left | Flower of ''[[Iris sibirica]]''.]]

===Iridaceae===

{{main|Iridaceae}}

The iris family contains about 70 [[genus|genera]] and over 1,600 [[species]] with a worldwide distribution.

Members of the family are usually perennial herbs with sword-shaped [[unifacial]] leaves; the [[inflorescence]] is a spike or panicle of solitary flowers, or forms a monochasial [[cyme (botany)|cyme]] or [[rhipidium]] (meaning that the successive stems of the flowers follow a zig-zag path in the same plane); and the flower has only three stamens, each opposite to an outer tepal.

[[Saffron]] is obtained from the dried styles of ''[[Crocus sativus]]'' L., a member of the iris family. The [[corms]] of some species of Iridaceae are used as food by some indigenous peoples.

Many species in the iris family have a great economic importance in ornamental horticulture and the cut flower industry, especially ''[[Gladiolus]]'', ''[[Freesia]]'', ''[[Sparaxis]]'', ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'', ''[[Tigridia]]'' (tiger lily), ''[[Ixia]]'' (corn lily), ''[[Romulea]]'', ''[[Neomarica]]'', ''[[Moraea]]'' (butterfly lily), ''[[Nemastylis]]'', ''[[Belamcanda]]'', ''[[Sisyrinchium]]'' (blue-eyed grass), ''[[Crocosmia]]'' and ''[[Trimezia]]''. Many other genera, both [[perennial plant|perennials]] and [[bulb]]s, are grown in gardens in tropical and temperate regions (e.g. ''[[Watsonia (plant)|Watsonia]]'', ''[[Crocus]]'', ''[[Dietes]]'', ''[[Tritonia (plant)|Tritonia]]'', ''[[Hesperantha]]'' and ''[[Neomarica]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldblatt_2002&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldblatt|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimitri_1987&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dimitri|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hessayon_1999&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hessayon|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Moraea]]'' and ''[[Homeria]]'' are two genera of poisonous plants which are a problem in sheep and cattle producing regions, notably in South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldblatt_2002&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Xeronema.jpg| thumb | left | Flowers of a ''[[Xeronema]]'' species]]

===Xeronemataceae===

{{main|Xeronemataceae}}

The family consists of a single genus ''[[Xeronema]]'' with two species, one found only on the [[Poor Knights]] islands in [[New Zealand]] and the other in [[New Caledonia]]. The [[inflorescence]] is crowded with quite large, radial symmetrical flowers, which face upwards. The [[stamen]]s are strongly exserted (i.e. extend out of the flower). The family is still poorly known.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu lato''===

====Hemerocallidoideae====

{{main|Hemerocallidoideae}}

The Hemerocallidoideae, or day lily, subfamily of the Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, the Hemerocallidaceae.

It includes perennial herbaceous plants which are glabrous and have short [[rhizome]]s with fibrous roots or are rhizomatous with root tubers. The leaves form a rosette at the base of the plant, and are alternate, distichous, flat, sessile, simple, linear or lanceolate, and parallel veined, with entire margins. The flower is typically somewhat zygomorphic (i.e. not radially symmetrical) and has nectaries. The flowers are arranged in various types of[[inflorescence]]. The group includes eight genera and about 85 species distributed in the temperate zones of Europe and Asia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar, Africa and the Pacific, from Australia and New Zealand to South America.

Two of the genera, ''[[Hemerocallis]]'' (day lily) and ''[[Phormium]]'' (New Zealand flax), are grown as ornamentals worldwide.

====Xanthorrhoeoideae====

{{main|Xanthorrhoeoideae}}

The Xanthorrhoeoideae, or grasstree, subfamily of the Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, the Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu stricto''.

It contains only one genus, ''[[Xanthorrhoea]]'', endemic to [[Australia]]. Many species have an erect woody stem which is covered with persistent dried leaves unless there have been fires, topped by a crown of long thin leaves. The spike-like [[inflorescence]] is erect and densely crowded with small flowers. The [[fruit]] is a capsule. Plants are adapted to bush fires, which can stimulate flowering.

====Asphodeloideae====

{{main|Asphodeloideae}}

The Asphodeloideae, or asphodel, subfamily of the Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, the Asphodelaceae.

Members of the family are natives of temperate to tropical regions of the [[Old World]], with 15 genera and 780 species. The greatest diversity occurs in [[South Africa]], usually in arid habitats. They differ from other related families by often being [[pachycaule|pachycauline]] (i.e. with a thickened trunk, usually wider at the base, which has a water storage function), by usually having succulent leaves, and by possessing a trimerous flower with a superior [[ovary (plant)|ovary]] and seeds with an [[aryl]].

The most conspicuous genus in the family is ''[[Aloe]]''. Many species of ''[[Aloe]]'' are used medicinally and in cosmetics. For example, &quot;aloin&quot; is derived from ''[[Aloe vera]]'' and ''[[Aloe ferox]]'' and has important medical uses (e.g. as a laxative and in the treatment of burns) as well as cosmetic uses (e.g. in skin and hair products). Other genera are used as ornamental plants, both succulents such as ''[[Aloe]]'', ''[[Haworthia]]'' and ''[[Gasteria]]'' and perennials such as ''[[Kniphofia]]'', ''[[Asphodelus]]'' and ''[[Bulbine]]''.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===Amaryllidaceae ''sensu lato''===
{{main|Amaryllidaceae}}
The amaryllis family has been recognized in many taxonomic systems, but the limits of the family have varied. In the narrowest definition, the Amaryllidaceae ''sensu stricto'' is characterized by an umbellate inflorescence with an inferior ovary. Two other groups have similar inflorescences but a superior ovary, and have at times been put into separate families: the Agapanthaceae and the Alliaceae. Based on [[phylogenetic]] research, the latest (2009) revision of the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG]] classification groups together these three families under the conserved name of Amaryllidaceae.&lt;ref name=&quot;APG3&quot;/&gt; (Earlier the APG had used the name Alliaceae for this group.&lt;ref name=&quot;APG2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A paper published at the same time as the 2009 classification proposed that the original three families should be retained as subfamilies within Amaryllidaceae ''sensu lato''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Reveal_Fay_2009&quot;/&gt; This division has been used here.

[[File:Purple Agapantha.JPG| thumb | left | Flowers of ''[[Agapanthus]]'']]

====Agapanthoideae====

{{main|Agapanthoideae}}

The agapanthus subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, the Agapanthaceae.

''[[Agapanthus]]'', native to [[South Africa]], is the sole genus of the subfamily. They are relatively robust herbaceous perennials with short [[rhizome]]s and leaves forming a rosette, individually linear-oblong, flat, rather fleshy. The flowers are quite large, blue or white, forming an [[umbel]] at the end of a stem (scape) which is longer than the leaves. The inflorescences are protected by [[bract]]s joined together along one side. The ovary is superior. Plants do not have the characteristic garlic odor of the allium subfamily (Allioideae). They are set apart from the amaryllis subfamily (Amaryllidoideae) by their superior ovary, the presence of [[saponin]]s and the absence of the [[alkaloid]]s typical of amaryllids.

''[[Agapanthus]]'' is widely grown as an ornamental in temperate gardens.

[[File:Allium ursinum0.jpg| thumb | left | Flowers of ''[[Allium ursinum]]'']]

====Allioideae====

{{main|Allioideae}}

The allium subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, the Alliaceae.

Members of the subfamily are found worldwide, in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions. They are herbaceous perennials, usually with [[bulb]]s, although in some cases they have short [[rhizome]]s. The subfamily can be easily recognized by its characteristic smell (the smell of garlic and onions, singular enough to be called &quot;garlic odour&quot;), by the very soft, fleshy leaves and the umbel-like inflorescence at the end of a stem (scape), which has small to medium flowers with a superior [[ovary (plant)|ovary]].

The subfamily is of considerable economic importance, being grown as vegetables and seasoning, medicinal plants and ornamentals. The genus ''[[Allium]]'' includes some of the most widely used edible plants, such as [[onion]] and [[shallot]] (varieties of ''Allium cepa''), [[garlic]] (''A. sativum'' and ''A. scordoprasum''), [[leek]] (''Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum''), and various flavourings such as [[chives]] (''Allium schoenoprasum'').

The organosulphur compounds responsible for the characteristic odour are believed to have [[antioxidant]], [[antibiotics|antibiotic]] and [[anticarcinogenic]] properties, to stimulate the  [[immune system]] and to be protective of liver functioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tapiero_Townsend_Tew_2004&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tapiero|Townsend|Tew|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family also has important ornamentals, mainly from the dominant genus [[Allium]], but also including genera such as [[Ipheion]].

====Amaryllidoideae====

{{main|Amaryllidoideae}}

The amaryllis subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, the Amaryllidaceae ''sensu stricto''.

The subfamily includes 59 genera and approximately 800 species from temperate and tropical regions worldwide. They are herbaceous perennials with [[bulbous plants|bulbs]], and can be identified by their rather fleshy leaves, usually large and attractive flowers, with six [[stamen]]s and an inferior [[ovary (plant)|ovary]]. The flowers are solitary or, more frequently, arranged in [[umbel]]late inflorescences at the end of a stem (scape).

Many species of Amaryllidoideae are popular as ornamentals in parks and gardens. A special mention should be made of ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'' (daffodils and narcissi), cultivated in various parts of the world as an ornamental in gardens and as a cut flower.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===Asparagaceae ''sensu lato''===

The members of this group have a complex taxonomic history, having been assigned to widely differing families in different classification systems. Proposed subgroups are difficult to recognise, having similar 'lily-like' flowers, with the result that some members of the group have been included in different subgroups at different times.&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevens|2001 onwards}}: [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/asparagalesweb.htm Asparagales]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[phylogenetic]] research, the latest (2009) revision of the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG]] classification supports the use of a single broadly defined family, Asparagaceae ''sensu lato''.&lt;ref name=&quot;APG3&quot;/&gt; A paper published at the same time as the 2009 classification proposed seven subfamilies for the families recognized in the very first APG classification of 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Reveal_Fay_2009&quot;/&gt; This division has been used here, although it is not clear whether the approach will be upheld by future research as some of the clades are weakly supported.

The broadly defined family is large, with some 153 genera and 2480 species, and occurs worldwide.&lt;!-- The seven subfamilies appear to form two groups: Aphyllanthoideae + Brodiaeoideae + Scilloideae + Agavoideae, with few common morphological features differentiating them from the family as a whole; and Lomandroideae + Asparagoideae + Nolinoideae, with some common morphological features.&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevens|2001 onwards}}: [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/asparagalesweb.htm Asparagales]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fay_2000&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fay|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

====Aphyllanthoideae====

{{main|Aphyllanthoideae}}

The Aphyllanthoideae subfamily of the Asparagaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, the Aphyllanthaceae.

It comprises a single species, ''Aphyllanthes monspeliensis'', found in arid areas of the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The [[inflorescence]] is made up of small clusters of blue flowers at the end of a long stem (scape). An unusual feature of the species is that the stem (scape) is actually the main photosynthetic organ, since the paper-like leaves at the base lack chlorophyll.

====Brodiaeoideae====

{{main|Brodiaeoideae}}

The Brodiaeoideae subfamily of the Asparagaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, under the name Themidaceae.

It comprises about a dozen genera which are native to western [[North America]]. Plants are superficially similar to those of the allium subfamily, being perennial herbs with an umbellate [[inflorescence]] made up of quite small flowers. The [[tepal]]s are more or less joined at the base, sometimes with a corona (a structure like the trumpet of a daffodil). The [[ovary (plant)|ovary]] is superior. Plants lack the &quot;garlic odor&quot; typical of the allium subfamily, and have a fibrous [[corm]] rather than a bulb. The inflorescence bracts also differ from those of alliums.

A number of genera, including ''[[Brodiaea]]'' and ''[[Triteleia]]'', are grown as ornamental plants.

====Scilloideae====

{{main|Scilloideae}}

The Scilloideae, or scilla, subfamily of the Asparagaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, under the name Hyacinthaceae.

The group includes from 770 to 1,000 species, distributed predominantly in Mediterranean climates, especially [[South Africa]], the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to [[Central Asia]] and [[Burma]], and [[South America]]. Characteristics of the subfamily include: flowers with six tepals and six stamens, typically arranged in a [[raceme]]; a superior [[ovary (plant)|ovary]]; growing from bulbs; rather fleshy mucilaginous leaves in a basal rosette. Plants contain poisonous compounds, so that they are not edible.

Many spring- and summer-flowering bulbs grown in gardens in temperate climates belong to this subfamily, including genera such as ''[[Scilla]]'' (squill), ''[[Muscari]]'' (grape hyacinth), ''[[Hyacinthus (plant)|Hyacinthus]]'' (hyacinths),''[[Chionodoxa]]'' (glory of the snow) and ''[[Galtonia]]'' (summer hyacinth). Some are used as cut flowers.

====Agavoideae====

{{main|Agavoideae}}

The Agavoideae, or agave, subfamily of the Asparagaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, under a variety of names, including Agavaceae. It includes species formerly placed in several other families (e.g. Anthericaceae and Hesperocallidaceae). Many species currently assigned to this group have been placed in other groups at different times. Stevens notes &quot;The broad concept of Agavoideae adopted here may not seem very satisfactory, but I fear that none of the alternative solutions is much better ...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot;/&gt;

Given this broad definition, there are about 23 genera in over 600 species, distributed more or less around the world outside cold areas. South west [[North America]], including [[Mexico]], is an area of particular diversity. Some members of the subfamily form trees (such as the [[Joshua Tree]], a species of ''[[Yucca]]''). They often have large, succulent leaves in rosettes, either at the base or at the end of the branches. Others are herbaceous (e.g. ''[[Hosta]]'', ''[[Anthericum]]''). The flowers have six tepals and six stamens with either a superior or inferior ovary. 

''[[Agave]]'' has important economic uses (for example, it is used to make [[tequila]] and [[mezcal]]). Some genera are used as ornamental garden plants in temperate regions (e.g. ''[[Hosta]]'') and as house plants (e.g. ''[[Sansevieria]]'', ''[[Chlorophytum]]'').

The Lomandroideae subfamily of the Asparagaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family, Laxmanniaceae.

The group consists of some 15 genera and about 180 species from [[Australasia]], south east [[Asia]], and [[South America]]. The best known genus is ''[[Cordyline]]''. The tepals of the flower persist in the fruit.

Species of Cordyline are grown as house plants and as garden plants in temperate to tropical regions.

==== Asparagoideae====

{{main|Asparagoideae}}

The asparagus subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae ''sensu lato'' is treated in some systems as a separate family, the Asparagaceae ''sensu stricto''.

The subfamily contains only two genera, one, ''[[Asparagus (genus)|Asparagus]]'', with around 150-300 species distributed throughout the [[Old World]] and a small area of [[Australia]], the other, ''[[Hemiphylacus]]'', with only five species, found in [[Mexico]]. The photosynthetic organs of Asparagus have been the subject of some controversy; however, most authors consider them to be flattened stems rather than leaves ([[phylloclade]]s). The leaves are reduced to non-photosynthetic scales, with the phylloclades in their axils. The flowers are small, bell-shaped, greenish-white to yellowish, with six tepals partially joined together at the base, either single or in small clusters, springing from the junctions of the phylloclades. Asparagus species are usually [[dioecious]], with male and female flowers on separate plants. The fruit is a small red berry, which is poisonous to humans.

''[[Asparagus|Asparagus officinalis]]'' is used as a vegetable, the young shoots being cut before they become woody. Other species are used as house plants and as greenery in the cut flower trade.

====Nolinoideae====

{{main|Nolinoideae}}

The Nolinoideae subfamily of the Asparagaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family, under a variety of names, including Ruscaceae ''sensu lato''. As with the subfamily Agavoideae, the Nolinoideae contains genera previously classified in a number of different families (including Ruscaceae ''sensu stricto'', Nolinaceae ''sensu stricto'', Convallariaceae ''sensu stricto'' and Eriospermaceae  ''sensu stricto'').

When broadly defined, the group contains some 26 genera and almost 500 species, distributed mainly in the temperate to tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere. There are few morphological features separating the subfamily from other groups within the Asparagaceae ''sensu lato''. The small flowers are radially symmetrical, with six tepals, usually joined at the base, six stamens and a superior ovary. The fruit is usually a berry with few seeds. Species vary from herbaceous perennials to tree-like forms (e.g. ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'').

There are several examples of convergent evolution between species in this subfamily and those in other subfamilies of the Asparagaceae ''sensu lato''. ''[[Ruscus]]'' (butcher's broom) has photosynthetic branches (phylloclades), similar to those of ''[[Asparagus (genus)|Asparagus]]'' (Asparagoideae); ''[[Dracaena draco]]'' has a tree-like habit resembling ''[[Yucca]]'' (Agavoideae) and ''[[Cordyline]]'' (Lomandroideae).

Some genera are used in horticulture: ''[[Sanseviera]]'' and ''[[Aspidistra]]'' are used as house plants in temperate areas and as garden plants in warmer regions; ''[[Polygonatum]]'' and ''[[Ophiopogon]]'' are used as garden plants in temperate areas.

==Taxonomy==

The order Asparagales has only recently been recognized in classification systems, with the advent of [[phylogenetics]]. Older systems based on morphology placed many of the species now included in Asparagales into the lily family (Liliaceae); where other families were recognized, these were generally placed into the old order Liliales: a very large order which was used for almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm (the [[lilioid monocot]]s). The Liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups. Thus the [[Wettstein system]], last revised in 1935, did not recognise the Asparagales, and placed many of the plants involved in an order called 'Liliiflorae'. The widely used [[Cronquist system]] of 1968-1988&lt;ref name=&quot;Cronquist_1968&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronquist|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{Citation |last=Cronquist |first=Arthur |author-link=Arthur Cronquist |year=1968 |title=The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants |publication-place=London |publisher=Nelson |isbn=978-0-17-176445-1 }} --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cronquist_1981&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronquist|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{Citation |last=Cronquist |first=Arthur |author-link=Arthur Cronquist |year=1981 |title=An integrated system of classification of flowering plants |publication-place=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-03880-5 }} --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cronquist_1988&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronquist|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- * {{Citation |last=Cronquist |first=Arthur |author-link=Arthur Cronquist |year=1988 |title=The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants |edition=2nd |publication-place=New York |publisher=The New York Botanical Garden |isbn=978-0-89327-332-3 }} --&gt; also did not recognise Asparagales, using instead the very broadly defined order Liliales.

===APG system===

The 2009 revision of the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] system, [[APG III system|APG III]], places the order in the clade [[Monocotyledon|monocots]] with the [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] given below.&lt;ref name=&quot;APG3&quot;/&gt; The APG III system is very recent, {{as of|2010|December|lc=yes}}, so it is not yet employed in many text books; however it is likely to become more influential since its family circumscriptions are being used as the basis of the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.&lt;ref name=&quot;KWChklist&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/ |accessdate=2010-12-18 }}: [http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/incfamilies.do Families included in the checklist]&lt;/ref&gt; With this circumscription, the order consists of 14 families with approximately 1120 genera and 26000 species.&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot; /&gt;

The earlier 2003 version, [[APG II system|APG II]], allowed 'bracketed' families, i.e. families which could either be segregated from more comprehensive families or could be included in them. These are the families given under &quot;including&quot; in the list above. APG III does not allow bracketed families, requiring the use of the more comprehensive family; otherwise the circumscription of the Asparagales is unchanged. A separate paper accompanying the publication of the 2009 APG III system provided subfamilies to accommodate the families which were discontinued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Reveal_Fay_2009&quot;/&gt; 

The first APG system of [[APG system|1998]] contained some extra families, included in square brackets in the list above.

===Other systems===

Two other systems which use the order Asparagales are the [[Dahlgren system]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahlgren_Clifford_Yeo_1985&quot;/&gt; and the [[Kubitzki system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kubitzki_1998&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kubitzki|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families included in the circumscriptions of the order in these two systems are shown in the first and second columns of the table below. The equivalent family in the APG III system is shown in the third column. Note that although these systems may use the same name for a family, the genera which it includes may be different, so the equivalence between systems is only approximate in some cases.

==Phylogeny==

From the [[Dahlgren system]] of 1985 onwards, studies based mainly on morphology had identified the Asparagales as a distinct group, but had also included groups now located in Liliales, Pandanales and Zingiberales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahlgren_Clifford_Yeo_1985&quot;/&gt; Research in the 21st century has supported the [[monophyly]] of Asparagales, based on morphology, 18S rDNA, and other DNA sequences,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudall_2002a&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudall|2002a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis_Stevenson_Petersen_Seberg_2004&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Davis|Stevenson|Petersen|Seberg|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Fay_Devey_Maurin_2006&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|Fay|Devey|Maurin|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham_Zgurski_McPherson_Cherniawsky_2006&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Graham|Zgurski|McPherson|Cherniawsky|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pires_Maureira_Givnish_Sytsma_2006&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pires|Maureira|Givnish|Sytsma|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although some phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data have suggested that Asparagales may be paraphyletic, with Orchidaceae separated from the rest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilu_Borsch_Muller_Soltis_2003&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hilu|Borsch|Muller|Soltis|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the monocots, Asparagales is the sister of the [[commelinid]] clade.&lt;ref name=&quot;APG2&quot; /&gt;

The tree shown above can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group, the 'lower Asparagales', from Orchidaceae to Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu lato'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudall_Furness_Chase_Fay_1997&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudall|Furness|Chase|Fay|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a well-supported monophyletic group of 'core Asparagales', comprising Amaryllidaceae ''sensu lato'' and Asparagaceae ''sensu lato''.&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot; /&gt;

Two differences between these two groups (although with exceptions) are: the mode of [[microsporogenesis]] and the position of the ovary. The 'lower Asparagales' typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis (i.e. cell walls develop only after both [[meiosis|meiotic]] divisions), which appears to be an [[apomorphy]] within the monocots, whereas the 'core Asparagales' have reverted to successive microsporogenesis (i.e. cell walls develop after each division).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudall_2002a&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudall|2002a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'lower Asparagales' typically have an [[inferior ovary]], whereas the 'core Asparagales' have reverted to a [[superior ovary]]. A 2002 morphological study by Rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a [[synapomorphy]] of the Asparagales, stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the 'core Asparagales' could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudall_2002b&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudall|2002b}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the 'lower Asparagales' in such a way that it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies. The position of the ovary seems a much more flexible character (here and in other [[angiosperm]]s) than previously thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevens|2001 onwards}},[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/asparagalesweb.htmAsparagales]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orchid clade===

[[Orchidaceae]] is the largest family of all [[angiosperm]]s and hence by far the largest in the order. The [[Dahlgren system]] recognized three families of orchids, but DNA sequence analysis later showed that these families are [[polyphyletic]] and so should be combined. Several studies suggest (with high bootstrap support) that Orchidaceae is the sister of the rest of the Asparagales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Fay_Devey_Maurin_2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham_Zgurski_McPherson_Cherniawsky_2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pires_Maureira_Givnish_Sytsma_2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Givnish_Pires_Graham_McPherson_2006&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Givnish|Pires|Graham|McPherson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree, generally among the [[Boryaceae]]-[[Hypoxidaceae]] clade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janssen_Bremer_2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudall_2002a&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudall|2002a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Duvall_Hills_Conran_1995&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|Duvall|Hills|Conran|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McPherson_Graham_2001&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|McPherson|Graham|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Li_Zhou_2007&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Zhou|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis,&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot;/&gt; but cannot be taken as confirmed.

Orchids have simultaneous microsporogenesis and inferior ovaries, two characters that are typical of the 'lower Asparagales'. However, their nectaries are rarely in the septa of the ovaries, and most orchids have dust-like seeds, atypical of the rest of the order. (Some members of  [[Vanilloideae]] and [[Cypripedioideae]]have crustose seeds, probably associated with dispersal by birds and mammals that are attracted by fermenting fleshy fruit releasing fragrant compounds, e.g. [[vanilla]].)

In terms of the number of species, Orchidaceae diversification is remarkable. However, although the other Asparagales may be less rich in species, they are more variable morphologically, including tree-like forms.

===Boryaceae to Hypoxidaceae===

The four families excluding [[Boryaceae]] form a well-supported clade in studies based on DNA sequence analysis. All four contain relatively few species, and it has been suggested that they be combined into one family under the name Hypoxidaceae ''sensu lato''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soltis_Soltis_Endress_Chase_2005&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Soltis|Soltis|Endress|Chase|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Boryaceae (which includes only two genera, ''[[Borya]]'' and ''[[Alania (plant)|Alania]]''), and other Asparagales has remained unclear for a long time. The Boryaceae are [[mycorrhiza]]l, but not in the same way as orchids. Morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between Boryaceae and Blandfordiaceae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudall_2002a&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudall|2002a}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is relatively low support for the position of Boryaceae in the tree shown above.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Fay_Devey_Maurin_2006&quot;/&gt;

===Ixioliriaceae to Xeronemataceae===

The relationship shown between [[Ixioliriaceae]] and [[Tecophilaeaceae]] is still unclear. Some studies have supported a clade of these two families,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Fay_Devey_Maurin_2006&quot;/&gt; others have not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janssen_Bremer_2004&quot;/&gt; The position of [[Doryanthaceae]] has also varied, with support for the position shown above,&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham_Zgurski_McPherson_Cherniawsky_2006&quot;/&gt; but also support for other positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_Fay_Devey_Maurin_2006&quot;/&gt;

The clade from [[Iridaceae]] upwards appears to have stronger support. All have some genetic characteristics in common, having lost ''[[Arabidopsis]]''-type [[telomere]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fay_2000&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fay|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iridaceae is distinctive among the Asparagales in the unique structure of the [[inflorescence]] (a ripidium), the combination of an inferior ovary and three stamens, and the common occurrence of [[unifacial leaf|unifacial leaves]] whereas bifacial leaves are the norm in other Asparagales.

Members of the clade from [[Iridaceae]] upwards have infra-locular septal nectaries, which Rudall interpreted as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudall_2002b&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudall|2002b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu lato'' + 'core Asparagales'===

The next node in the tree (Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu lato'' + the 'core Asparagales') has strong support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chase_De Bruijn_Cox_Reeves_2000&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chase|De Bruijn|Cox|Reeves|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Anomalous' secondary thickening occurs among this clade, e.g. in ''[[Xanthorrhoea]]'' (family Xanthorrhoeaceae ''sensu lato'') and ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' (family Asparagaceae ''sensu lato''), with species reaching tree-like proportions.

The 'core Asparagales', comprising Amaryllidaceae ''sensu lato'' and Asparagaceae ''sensu lato'', are a strongly supported clade,&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham_Zgurski_McPherson_Cherniawsky_2006&quot;/&gt; as are clades for each of the families. Relationships within these broadly defined families appear less clear, particularly within the Asparagaceae ''sensu lato''. Stevens notes that most of its subfamilies are difficult to recognize, and that significantly different divisions have been used in the past, so that the use of a broadly defined family to refer to the entire clade is justified.&lt;ref name=&quot;APW_Asparagales&quot; /&gt; Thus the relationships among subfamilies shown above, based on [[APWeb]] {{as of|2010|December|lc=yes}}, is somewhat uncertain.

==Evolution==

Several studies have attempted to date the evolution of the Asparagales, based on phylogenetic evidence. Earlier studies&lt;ref name=&quot;Eguiarte_1995&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Eguiarte|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikstrom_Savolainen_Chase_2001&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wikström|Savolainen|Chase|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally give younger dates than more recent studies,&lt;ref name=&quot;Janssen_Bremer_2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Magallon_Castillo_2009&quot;/&gt; which have been preferred in the table below.

|}

A 2009 study suggests that the Asparagales have the highest diversification rate in the monocots, about the same as the order [[Poales]], although in both orders the rate is little over half that of the [[eudicot]] order [[Lamiales]], the clade with the highest rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magallon_Castillo_2009&quot;/&gt;

'''Alismatales''' is an order of [[flowering plant]]s.

==Description==
Alismatales comprise flowering plants of aquatic and marshy habitats, and the only monocots known to have green embryos other than the Aarillidaceae. They also include the only marine angiosperms.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/welcome.html -Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Both marine and freshwater forms include those with staminate flowers that detach from the parent plant and float to the surface where they become pollinated. In others,  pollination occurs underwater where pollen may form elongated strands, increasing chance of success. Most species have a totally submerged juvenile phase. Flowers are either floating or emergent. Vegetation may be totally submersed, have floating leaves, or protrude from the water. Collectively they are commonly known as &quot;water plantain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/people/les/Manuscript_Files/Encyclopedia_Life_Sciences.pdf  -Alismatales (Water Plantains)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The Alismales were assigned in [[APG system|APG]] 1998 and [[APG II system|APG II]] 2003 to the [[monocots|Monocotyledonae]] (class Liliopsida Tahktajan), which may be thought of as an unranked clade, with the following families included. The [[APG III system]] (2009) differs only in that the [[Limnocharitaceae]] are combined with the [[Alismataceae]]; it was also suggested that the genus ''[[Maundia]]'' (of the [[Juncaginaceae]]) could be separated into a monogeneric family, [[Maundiaceae]], but the authors noted that more study was necessary before Maundiaceae could be recognized.

* order Alismatales  APG, APG-II
*: family [[Alismataceae]]
*: family [[Aponogetonaceae]]
*: family [[Araceae]]
*: family [[Butomus|Butomaceae]] &lt;!-- monogenetic family --&gt;
*: family [[Cymodoceaceae]]
*: family [[Hydrocharitaceae]]
*: family [[Juncaginaceae]]
*: family [[Limnocharitaceae]]
*: family [[Posidoniaceae]]
*: family [[Potamogetonaceae]]
*: family [[Ruppiaceae]]
*: family [[Scheuchzeriaceae]]
*: family [[Tofieldiaceae]]
*: family [[Zosteraceae]]

As understood, the order contains about 165 genera in 14 families, with a [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. Most of the families are composed of [[herbaceous]] plants, commonly found in aquatic environments. The [[flower]]s are usually arranged in [[inflorescence]]s, and the mature seeds lack [[endosperm]].

The biggest departure from earlier [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|systems]] (see below) is the inclusion of family [[Araceae]]. By its inclusion the order has grown enormously in number of species. The family Araceae alone accounts for about a hundred genera, totaling over two thousand species. The rest of the families together contain only about five hundred species.

[[Cronquist system|Cronquist]](1981) placed the Alismatales in subclass [[Alismatidae]], class [[Liliopsida]] [= monocotyledons] and included only three families as shown:
 
* [[Alismataceae]]
* [[Butomaceae]]
* [[Limnocharitaceae]]
Cronquist's subclass [[Alismatidae]] conformed fairly closely to the order Alismatales as defined by APG, minus the Araceae.

The [[Dahlgren system]] placed the Alismatales in the superorder [[Alismatanae]] in the subclass [[Liliidae]] [= monocotyledons] in the class [[Magnoliopsida]] [= angiosperms] with the following families included:
*  [[Alismataceae]]
*  [[Aponogetonaceae]]
*  [[Butomaceae]]
*  [[Hydrocharitaceae]]
*  [[Limnocharitaceae]]

In Tahktajan's classification (1997), the Order Alismatales contains only the Alismataceae and Limnochariaceae making it equivalent to the Alismataceae as revised in APG-III. Other families included in the Alismatates as currently defined are here distributed among ten additional orders, all of which are assigned, with the following exception, to the Subclass Alismatidae. Araceae in Tahktajan 1997 is assigned to the [[Arales]] and placed in the Subclass Aridae; Tofieldiaceae to the Melanthiales and placed in the [[Liliidae]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/newgate/cronang.htm -Flowering Plant Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is typical of the newer [[Biological classification| classifications]], though there is some slight variation, and in particular the Torriceliaceae may be divided. &lt;ref name=&quot;plunkett2004&quot;&gt; Gregory M. Plunkett, Gregory T. Chandler, Porter P. Lowry, Steven M. Pinney, and Taylor S. Sprenkle. 2004. &quot;Recent advances in understanding Apiales and a revised classification&quot;. ''South African Journal of Botany'' '''70'''(3):371-381. &lt;/ref&gt;

Under this definition well-known members include [[carrot]]s, [[celery]], [[parsley]], and [[ivy]].

The order Apiales is placed within the [[asterid]] group of [[eudicots]] as circumscribed by the APG III system. Within the asterids, Apiales belongs to an [[Taxonomic rank| unranked]] group called the [[campanulids]],&lt;ref name=&quot;winkworth2008&quot;&gt; Richard C. Winkworth, Johannes Lundberg, and Michael J. Donoghue. 2008. &quot;Toward a resolution of Campanulid phylogeny, with special reference to the placement of Dipsacales&quot;. ''Taxon'' '''57'''(1):53-65. &lt;/ref&gt; and within the campanulids, it belongs to a [[clade]] that is known in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] as [[Apiidae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cantino2007&quot;&gt;{{citation | author = Philip D.

The [[Circumscription (taxonomy)| circumscriptions]] of some of the families have changed. In 2009, it was shown that one of the subfamilies of Araliaceae was [[polyphyletic]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;nicolas2009&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ympev.2009.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The present understanding of the Apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of [[DNA sequences]] by [[phylogenetic]] methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;gregory2004&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1095-8339.2003.00247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Cronquist system]], only the Apiaceae and Araliaceae were included here, and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids. The Pittosporaceae were placed within the [[Rosales]], and many of the other forms within the family [[Cornaceae]]. [[Pennantia]] was in the family [[Icacinaceae]].

'''Asterales''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[dicotyledon]]ous [[flowering plant]]s that includes the composite family ([[Asteraceae]]) and its related families.

The order is a [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolite]], and includes mostly [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] species, although  a small number of trees (such as some members of the genus ''[[Lobelia]]'') and shrubs are also present. 

The Asterales can be characterized on the morphological and molecular level. [[Synapomorphies]] include the [[oligosaccharide]] [[inulin]], a nutrient storage molecule, and unique [[stamen]] morphology. The stamens are usually found around the [[Gynoecium|style]], either aggregated densely or fused into a tube, probably an [[adaptation]] in association with the plunger (or secondary) [[pollination]] that is common among the families of the order.

== Families ==
The order '''Asterales''' includes about eleven families, the largest of which are the [[Asteraceae]], with about 25,000 species, and the [[Campanulaceae]], with about 2,000 species. The remaining families count together for less than 500 species. The two large families are cosmopolitan, with many of their species found in the northern hemisphere, and the smaller families are usually confined to Australia and the adjacent areas, or sometimes South America.

Under the [[Cronquist system]], [[Asteraceae]] was the only family in the group, but newer systems (e. g. [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG]] II) have expanded it.

==Evolution and biogeography==
The Asterales order probably originated in the [[Cretaceous]] on the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], in the area that is now Australia and Asia. &lt;!-- Asia was mostly Laurasia, not Gondwana, so what is meant here? --&gt; Although most extant species are herbaceous, the examination of the basal families in the order suggests that the common ancestor of the order was an arborescent plant.

Fossil evidence of the Asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epochs, so the precise estimation of the order's age is quite difficult. An [[Oligocene]] [[pollen]] is known for Asteraceae and [[Goodeniaceae]], and seeds from Oligocene and [[Miocene]] are known for [[Menyanthaceae]] and [[Campanulaceae]] respectively.

(Bremer and Gustafsson, 1997)

==Economical importance==
The Asteraceae include some species grown for food, including [[sunflower]] (''Helianthus annuus''),  [[lettuce]] (''Lactuca sativa'') and [[chicory]] (''Cichorium''). Many spices and medicinal herbs are also present.

Of horticultural importance are the Asteraceae (e. g. [[chrysanthemum]]) and Campanulaceae.

'''Asteroids''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{polytonic|[[wikt:ἀστήρ|ἀστήρ]]}} 'star' and {{polytonic|[[wikt:εἶδος|εἶδος]]}} 'like, in form') are a class of [[small Solar System bodies]] in orbit around the [[Sun]].  They have also been called '''planetoids''', especially the larger ones. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disk of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active [[comet]], but as small objects in the [[Solar System#Outer Solar System|outer Solar System]] were discovered, their [[volatiles|volatile]]-based surfaces were found to more closely resemble comets, and so were often distinguished from traditional asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?asteroids| title=Asteroids | publisher=NASA - Jet Propulsion Laboratory | accessdate=13 September2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the term ''asteroid'' has come increasingly to refer specifically to the small rocky–icy and metallic bodies of the [[Solar System#Inner Solar System|inner Solar System]] out to the orbit of [[Jupiter]]. These are grouped with those outer bodies—[[Centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]], [[Neptune trojan]]s, and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s—as '''[[minor planet]]s''', which is the term preferred in astronomical circles.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac, and Dole, Stephen H. ''Planets for Man'' (New York:  Random House, 1964), p.43&lt;/ref&gt; This article will restrict the word 'asteroid' to the minor planets of the inner Solar System. 

There are millions of asteroids, and like most other small Solar System bodies, asteroids are thought to be the often shattered remnants of
[[planetesimal]]s, bodies within the young Sun’s [[solar nebula]] that never grew large enough to become [[planet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What Are Asteroids And Comets? | url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast | work=Near Earth Object Program FAQ |publisher=[[NASA]] | accessdate=2010-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large majority of known asteroids orbit in the [[main asteroid belt]] between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter or co-orbital with Jupiter (the [[Jupiter Trojan]]s), however other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the [[near-Earth asteroids]]. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic [[Emission spectrum|spectra]], with the majority falling into three main groups: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]], [[S-type asteroid|S-type]], and [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. These were named after and are generally identified with [[carbonaceous|carbon-rich]], [[Silicate|stony]], and [[metal]]lic compositions respectively.

== Discovery ==
[[Image:243 ida.jpg|thumb|right|[[243 Ida]] and its moon Dactyl. Dactyl is the first satellite of an asteroid to be discovered.]]
The first named minor planet, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], was discovered in 1801 by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], and was originally considered to be a new planet.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Ceres is the largest main belt object and is now classified as a [[dwarf planet]]. All other asteroids are now classified as [[Small Solar System body|small solar system bodies]] along with comets, centaurs, and the smaller trans-Neptunian objects.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies, which with the equipment of the time appeared to be points of light, like stars, showing little or no planetary disc (though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions). This prompted the astronomer [[William Herschel|Sir William Herschel]] to propose the term &quot;asteroid&quot;, from Greek ''αστεροειδής'', ''asteroeidēs'' = star-like, star-shaped, from ancient Greek ''Aστήρ'', ''astēr'' = star. In the early second half of the nineteenth century, the terms &quot;asteroid&quot; and &quot;planet&quot; (not always qualified as &quot;minor&quot;) were still used interchangeably; for example, the [http://books.google.ca/books?id=NAMAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=%22planets%22+asteroids ''Annual of Scientific Discovery for 1871''], page 316, reads &quot;Professor J. Watson has been awarded by the Paris Academy of Sciences, the astronomical prize, Lalande foundation, for the discovery of eight new asteroids in one year. The planet Lydia (No. 110), discovered by M. Borelly at the Marseilles Observatory [...] M. Borelly had previously discovered two planets bearing the numbers 91 and 99 in the system of asteroids revolving between Mars and Jupiter&quot;.

=== Symbols ===
{{main|Astronomical symbols}}

The first few asteroids discovered were assigned symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate Earth, the Moon, the Sun and planets. The symbols quickly became ungainly, hard to draw and recognize. By the end of 1851 there were 15 known asteroids, each (except one) with its own symbol(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gould| first=B.

[[Johann Franz Encke]] made a major change in the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (BAJ, Berlin Astronomical Yearbook) for 1854. He introduced encircled numbers instead of symbols, although his numbering began with [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], the first four asteroids continuing to be denoted by their traditional symbols. This symbolic innovation was adopted very quickly by the astronomical community. The following year (1855), Astraea's number was bumped up to 5, but Ceres through Vesta would be listed by their numbers only in the 1867 edition. A few more asteroids ([[28 Bellona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Encke| first= J.

The circle would become a pair of parentheses, and the parentheses sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilton&quot;/&gt;

=== Naming ===
{{Main|Minor planet#Naming}}
A newly discovered asteroid is given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] (such as {{mpl|2002 AT|4}}) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. [[433 Eros]]). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text.

=== Historical methods ===
Asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries.

In the last years of the 18th century, Baron [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] organized a group of 24 astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about 2.8 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun by the [[Titius-Bode law]], partly because of the discovery, by Sir [[William Herschel]] in 1781, of the planet [[Uranus]] at the distance predicted by the law. This task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the [[zodiac]]al band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness. On subsequent nights, the sky would be charted again and any moving object would, hopefully, be spotted. The expected motion of the missing planet was about 30 seconds of arc per hour, readily discernible by observers.

The first object, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], was not discovered by a member of the group, but rather by accident in 1801 by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], director of the observatory of [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]]. He discovered a new star-like object in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. His colleague, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], used these observations to find the exact distance from this unknown object to the Earth. Gauss' calculations placed the object between the planets [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Piazzi named it after [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture.

Three other asteroids ([[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]], and [[4 Vesta]]) were discovered over the next few years, with Vesta found in 1807. After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.

However, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were [[John Russell Hind|J. R. Hind]], [[Annibale de Gasparis]], [[Karl Theodor Robert Luther|Robert Luther]], [[Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt|H. M. S. Goldschmidt]], [[Jean Chacornac]], [[James Ferguson (astronomer)|James Ferguson]], [[Norman Robert Pogson]], [[Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel|E. W. Tempel]], [[James Craig Watson|J. C. Watson]], [[Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters|C. H. F. Peters]], [[Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly|A. Borrelly]], [[Johann Palisa|J. Palisa]], the [[Paul Henry and Prosper Henry|Henry brothers]] and [[Auguste Charlois]].

In 1891, however, [[Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf|Max Wolf]] pioneered the use of [[astrophotography]] to detect asteroids, which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates. This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with [[323 Brucia]], whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point. It was known that there were many more, but most astronomers did not bother with them{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, calling them &quot;vermin of the skies&quot;, a phrase due to [[Edmund Weiss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last=Seares | first=Frederick H.

 | doi= 10.1086/123986+(Dead+links)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a century later, only a few thousand asteroids were identified, numbered and named.

=== Manual methods of the 1900s and modern reporting ===
Until 1998, asteroids were discovered by a four-step process. First, a region of the sky was [[photograph]]ed by a wide-field [[telescope]], or [[Astrograph]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two [[film]]s of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Chapman | first=Mary G. | date=May 17, 1992 | url=http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker | title=Carolyn Shoemaker, Planetary Astronomer and Most Successful 'Comet Hunter' To Date | publisher=USGS | accessdate=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: {{mp|1998 FJ|74}}).

The last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]], where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]].

=== Computerized methods ===
[[Image:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif|framed|right|
[[2004 FH]] is the center dot being followed by the sequence; the object that flashes by during the clip is an [[satellite|artificial satellite]].]]
There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth]]'s, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth (see [[Earth-crosser asteroid]]s). The three most important groups of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s are the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]], [[Amor asteroid|Amors]], and [[Aten asteroid|Atens]]. Various [[asteroid deflection strategies]] have been proposed, as early as the 1960s&lt;!--- ''Project Icarus'' ---&gt;.

The [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] asteroid [[433 Eros]] had been discovered as long ago as 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: [[1221 Amor]], [[1862 Apollo]], [[2101 Adonis]], and finally [[69230 Hermes]], which approached within 0.005 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] of the [[Earth]] in 1937. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.

Two events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of [[Walter Alvarez]]' hypothesis that an [[impact event]] resulted in the [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event|Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction]], and the 1994 observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter]]. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its military satellites, built to detect nuclear explosions, had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to 10 metres across.

All these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient automated systems that consist of Charge-Coupled Device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. Since 1998, a large majority of the asteroids have been discovered by such automated systems. A list of teams using such automated systems includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Terminology{{anchor|Terminology}} == &lt;!-- Linked from &quot;Comet&quot; --&gt;

Traditionally, small bodies orbiting the Sun were classified as asteroids, [[comet]]s or [[meteoroid]]s, with anything smaller than ten metres across being called a meteoroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Beech, M. |authorlink=Martin Beech | year=1995 | month=September | title=On the Definition of the Term Meteoroid | journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=281–284 |bibcode=1995QJRAS..36..281B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;asteroid&quot; is ill-defined. It never had a formal definition, with the broader term [[minor planet]] being preferred by the [[International Astronomical Union]] from 1853 on. In 2006, the term &quot;[[small Solar System body]]&quot; was introduced to cover both most minor planets and comets.&lt;ref&gt;The definition of &quot;Small Solar System bodies&quot; says that they &quot;include most of the Solar System asteroids, most trans-Neptunian objects, comets, and other small bodies&quot;. [http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0602/index.html ''The Final IAU Resolution on the definition of &quot;planet&quot; ready for voting''] (IAU)&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages prefer &quot;planetoid&quot; (Greek for &quot;planet-like&quot;), and this term is occasionally used in English for the larger asteroids. The word &quot;[[planetesimal]]&quot; has a similar meaning, but refers specifically to the small building blocks of the planets that existed when the Solar System was forming. The term &quot;planetule&quot; was coined by the  geologist [[William Daniel Conybeare]] to describe minor planets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dict-e/p-44.html | title=English Dictionary&amp;nbsp;— Browsing Page P-44 | publisher=HyperDictionary.com | accessdate=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not in common use. The three largest objects in the main belt, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta]], grew to the stage of [[protoplanet]]s. Ceres has been designated as a [[dwarf planet]], the only one in the inner Solar System. 

When found, asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets, and there was no unified term for the two until &quot;small Solar System body&quot; was coined in 2006. The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to [[Outgassing|sublimation]] of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface [[volatiles|volatile ices]] and become asteroids. A further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most &quot;asteroids&quot; with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets.&lt;ref&gt;Weissman, Paul R., William F. Bottke, Jr., and Harold F. Levinson. &quot;Evolution of Comets into Asteroids.&quot; ''Southwest Research Institute, Planetary Science Directorate.'' 2002. Web [http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/asteroids3.pdf Retrieved 3 Aug. 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost two centuries, from the discovery of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] in 1801 until the discovery of the first [[centaur (minor planet)|centaur]], [[2060 Chiron]], in 1977, all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of Jupiter, though a few such as [[944 Hidalgo]] ventured far beyond Jupiter for part of their orbit. When astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than Jupiter, now called [[centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]], they numbered them among the traditional asteroids, though there was debate over whether they should be classified as asteroids or as a new type of object. Then, when the first [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[1992 QB1]], was discovered in 1992, and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up, new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper belt object]], [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[scattered-disc object]], and so on. These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.

The innermost of these are the [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper belt objects]]&lt;!-- capitalization changed, however one has to wonder if &quot;b&quot; should be &quot;B&quot;, and the KBO article will eventually be renamed/moved.  But for now this is consistent.  --&gt;, called &quot;objects&quot; partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 &quot;Are Kuiper belt objects asteroids?&quot;], &quot;Ask an astronomer&quot;, Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; They are believed to be predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_22.html &quot;Asteroids and Comets&quot;], NASA website&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets, and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional [[Comet nucleus|comet nuclei]]. (The much more distant [[Oort cloud]] is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets.) Other recent observations, such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] probe, are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=ADD0878B-D6C3-3B70-7B5BC373545BB82D &quot;Comet Dust Seems More Asteroidy&quot;] ''Scientific American'', January 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting &quot;a continuum between asteroids and comets&quot; rather than a sharp dividing line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/dn13224-comet-samples-are-surprisingly-asteroidlike.html &quot;Comet samples are surprisingly asteroid-like&quot;], ''New Scientist'', 24 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The minor planets beyond Jupiter's orbit are sometimes also called &quot;asteroids&quot;, especially in popular presentations.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a joint [[NASA]]-[[JPL]] public-outreach website states:
{{quote|&quot;We include Trojans (bodies captured in Jupiter's 4th and 5th Lagrange points), Centaurs (bodies in orbit between Jupiter and Neptune), and trans-Neptunian objects (orbiting beyond Neptune) in our definition of &quot;asteroid&quot; as used on this site, even though they may more correctly be called &quot;minor planets&quot; instead of asteroids.&quot;}} (See http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?asteroids)&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is becoming increasingly common for the term &quot;asteroid&quot; to be restricted to minor planets of the inner Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 ''Are Kuiper Belt Objects asteroids?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids: objects of the [[main asteroid belt]], [[Jupiter trojan]]s, and [[near-Earth object]]s.

When the IAU introduced the class [[small solar system body|small solar system bodies]] in 2006 to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets, they created the class of [[dwarf planet]]s for the largest minor planets—those that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity. According to the IAU, &quot;the term 'minor planet' may still be used, but generally the term 'small solar system body' will be preferred.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0603/questions_answers/ Questions and Answers on Planets], IAU&lt;/ref&gt; Currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], at about {{convert|950|km|0|abbr=on}} across, has been placed in the dwarf planet category, although there are several large asteroids ([[4 Vesta|Vesta]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[10 Hygiea|Hygiea]]) that may be classified as dwarf planets when their shapes are better known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9761&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20F53 &quot;Three new planets may join solar system&quot;], ''New Scientist'', 16 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
It is believed that [[planetesimal]]s in the main asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the [[solar nebula]] until Jupiter neared its current mass, at which point excitation from [[orbital resonance]]s with Jupiter ejected over 99% of planetesimals in the belt. Simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}} in diameter accreted during that early era, whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the Jovian disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bottke | first1 = Durda | last2 = Nesvorny | first2 = Jedicke | last3 = Morbidelli | first3 = Vokrouhlicky | last4 = Levison | first4 =  | year = 2005 | title =  The fossilized size distribution of the main asteroid belt | url = http://astro.mff.cuni.cz/davok/papers/fossil05.pdf| journal = Icarus | volume = 175 | issue = | page = 111 |bibcode = 2005Icar..175..111B |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2004.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceres and Vesta grew large enough to melt and [[Planetary differentiation|differentiate]], with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core, leaving rocky minerals in the crust.&lt;ref name=ACM&gt;{{cite book|title=Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors|author=Kerrod, Robin|year=2000|publisher=Lerner Publications Co.|isbn=0585317631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Nice model]], many [[Kuiper Belt object]]s are captured in the outer Main Belt, at distances greater than 2.6 AU. Most were later ejected by Jupiter, but those that remained may be the [[D-type asteroid]]s, and possibly include Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;William B.

Various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner Solar System. Their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the solar system and by the [[Yarkovsky effect]]. Significant populations include;

=== Main asteroid belt ===
{{main|Asteroid belt}}

The majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], generally in relatively low-[[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] (i.e., not very elongated) orbits. This belt is now estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and millions of smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/asteroid_worldbook.html World Book at NASA]
&lt;/ref&gt; These asteroids may be remnants of the [[protoplanetary disk]], and in this region the [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of [[planetesimal]]s into planets during the formative period of the solar system was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by [[Jupiter]].

=== Trojans ===
{{main|Trojan (astronomy)|l1=Trojan asteroids}}

Trojan asteroids are a population that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon, but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two [[Lagrangian point]]s of stability, [[Lagrangian point#L4 and L5|L4 and L5]], which lie 60° ahead of and behind the larger body.

The most significant population of Trojan asteroids are the [[Jupiter Trojan]]s.  Although fewer Jupiter Trojans have been discovered as of 2010, it is thought that there are as many as there are asteroids in the main belt.

A couple [[trojan (astronomy)|trojans]] have also been found orbiting with [[Mars]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Neptune also has a few known trojans, and these are thought to actually be much more numerous than the Jovian trojans. However, they are often included in the [[trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian]] population rather than counted with the asteroids.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Near-Earth asteroids ===
{{main|Near-Earth object#Near-Earth asteroids|l1=Near-Earth asteroids}}

Near-Earth asteroids, or NEA's, are asteroids that have orbits that pass close    to that of Earth.  Asteroids that actually cross the Earth's orbital path are known as ''Earth-crossers''. As of May 2010, 7,075 near-Earth asteroids are known and the number over one kilometre in diameter is estimated to be 500 - 1,000.

Objects in the main asteroid belt vary greatly in size, from almost 1000 kilometres for the largest down to rocks just tens of metres across.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Below 10 metres, these rocks are by convention considered to be [[meteoroid]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; The three largest are very much like miniature planets: they are roughly spherical, have at least partly differentiated interiors,&lt;ref name=Schmidt2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=B. |coauthors=Russell, C.

The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either surviving [[planetesimal]]s or fragments of larger bodies.

The [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is the largest object in the asteroid belt, with a diameter of {{convert|975|km|-1|abbr=on}}. The next largest are the asteroids [[2 Pallas]] and [[4 Vesta]], both with diameters of just over {{convert|500|km|abbr=on|-2}}. Normally Vesta is the only main belt asteroid that can, on occasion, become visible to the naked eye. However, on some rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see [[99942 Apophis]].

The mass of all the objects of the [[Asteroid Belt|Main asteroid belt]], lying between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], is estimated to be about 3.0-3.6{{e|21}}&amp;nbsp;kg, or about 4 percent of the mass of the Moon. Of this, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] comprises 0.95{{e|21}}&amp;nbsp;kg, some 32 percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=Georgij A. Krasinsky | first=G.

The number of asteroids then increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.

The number of asteroids decreases markedly with size. Although this generally follows a [[power law]], there are 'bumps' at 5&amp;nbsp;km and 100&amp;nbsp;km, where more asteroids than expected from a [[logarithmic distribution]] are found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/Astr598/lecture4.pdf Davis 2002, &quot;Asteroids III&quot;, cited by Željko Ivezić]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition ===

The physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood. Ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle, where Vesta is thought to have a nickel-iron core, [[olivine]] mantle, and basaltic crust.&lt;ref&gt;http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1995/20/image/&lt;/ref&gt; [[10 Hygiea]], however, which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of [[carbonaceous]] [[chondrite]], is thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid. Many, perhaps most, of the smaller asteroids are piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity. Some have [[Asteroid moon|moons]] or are co-orbiting [[binary asteroid]]s. The rubble piles, moons, binaries, and scattered [[asteroid families]] are believed to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid.

Asteroids contain traces of amino-acids and other organic compounds, and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early Earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life, or may have even brought life itself to Earth. (See also [[panspermia]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/meteor_sugar_011219.html Life is Sweet: Sugar-Packing Asteroids May Have Seeded Life on Earth], Space.com, 19 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one asteroid, 4 Vesta, which has a reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be naked-eye visible for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050204_2004_mn4.html Closest Flyby of Large Asteroid to be Naked-Eye Visible], Space.com, 4 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Composition is calculated from three primary sources: albedo, surface spectrum, and density. The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, and include [[121 Hermione]] (268×186×183&amp;nbsp;km), and [[87 Sylvia]] (384×262×232&amp;nbsp;km). Only half a dozen asteroids are [[List_of_notable_asteroids#Largest_by_diameter_.28cis-Neptunian.29|larger than 87 Sylvia]], though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not be rubble pile. The fact that such large asteroids can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar system: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Marchis, Descamps, et al. ''Icarus'', Feb. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Asteroids are commonly classified according to two criteria: the characteristics of their orbits, and features of their reflectance [[visible spectrum|spectrum]].

=== Orbital classification ===
{{Main|Asteroid group|Asteroid family}}

Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | bibcode=1995Icar..116..291Z
 | doi=10.1006/icar.1995.1127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Families have only been recognized within the [[main belt|main asteroid belt]]. They were first recognised by [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] in 1918 and are often called [[Hirayama families]] in his honor.

About 30% to 35% of the bodies in the main belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids.  A family has also been associated with the plutoid [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}.

==== Quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects ====

Some asteroids have unusual [[horseshoe orbit]]s that are co-orbital with the [[Earth]] or some other planet. Examples are [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}. The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]].

Sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become [[quasi-satellite]]s for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and [[Venus]] are known to have quasi-satellites.

Such objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], are a special class of [[Aten asteroid]]s.  However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well.

=== Spectral classification ===
[[Image:433eros.jpg|thumb|right|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as {{convert|35|m|0|abbr=on}} across can be seen.]]
{{Main|Asteroid spectral types}}

In 1975, an asteroid [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] system based on [[colour]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman]], [[David Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=C. R. | last=Chapman | title=Surface properties of asteroids: A synthesis of polarimetry, radiometry, and spectrophotometry | journal=Icarus | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=104–130 | bibcode=1975Icar...25..104C | year=1975 | doi=10.1016/0019-1035(75)90191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. The original classification system had three categories: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]]s for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), [[S-type asteroid|S-type]]s for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.

The two most widely used taxonomies now used are the [[Asteroid spectral types#Tholen classification|Tholen classification]] and [[Asteroid spectral types#SMASS classification|SMASS classification]]. The former was proposed in 1984 by [[David J. Tholen]], and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Tholen | first=D. J. | title=Asteroid taxonomic classifications | booktitle=Asteroids II; Proceedings of the Conference | pages=1139–1150 | publisher=University of Arizona Press | date=March 8–11, 1988 | location=Tucson, AZ | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989aste.conf.1139T | accessdate=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. There are also several smaller classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bus | first=S. J. | title=Phase II of the Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopy Survey: A feature-based taxonomy | journal=Icarus | year=2002 | volume=158 | issue=1 | pages=146 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6856 | bibcode=2002Icar..158..146B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.

==== Problems ====
Originally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Harry Y. | last=McSween Jr. | year=1999 | title=Meteorites and their Parent Planets | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0521587514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications is in use. This has led to significant confusion. While asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.

At present, the spectral classification based on several coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys in the 1990s is still the standard. Scientists cannot agree on a better taxonomic system,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids (e.g. finer resolution spectra, or non-spectral data such as densities would be very useful).

[[Image:Vesta-HST-Color.jpg|thumb|right|Vesta, imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope]]
[[Image:951 Gaspra.jpg|thumb|right|[[951 Gaspra]] is the first asteroid to be imaged in close-up.]]
Until the age of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their [[light curve]]s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). [[Radar]] imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of delta v and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/project/neo/pdf/NEO_feasibility.pdf A Piloted Orion Flight to a Near-Earth Object: A Feasibility Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first close-up photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in 1971 when the [[Mariner 9]] probe imaged [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], the two small moons of [[Mars]], which are probably captured asteroids. These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.

The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed in 1993 by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo probe]] en route to [[Jupiter]].

The first dedicated asteroid probe was [[NEAR Shoemaker]], which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in 1997, before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in 2001.

Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by [[Deep Space 1]] in 1999), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] in 2002).

In September 2005, the Japanese [[Hayabusa]] probe started studying [[25143 Itokawa]] in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but returned samples of its surface to earth on June 13, 2010.

The European [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta probe]] (launched in 2004) flew by [[2867 Šteins]] in 2008 and [[21 Lutetia]], the largest asteroid visited to date, in 2010.

In September 2007, [[NASA]] launched the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn Mission]], which will orbit the [[protoplanet]] [[4 Vesta]] in 2011 and the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] in 2015.

It has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on earth ([[asteroid mining]]), or materials for constructing [[space habitats]] (see [[Colonization of the asteroids]]). Materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for [[space manufacturing]] and construction.

== Fiction ==
{{Main|Asteroids in fiction}}

Asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories. Asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction: as places human beings might colonize, resources for extracting minerals, hazards encountered by spaceships traveling between two other points, and as a threat to life on Earth by potential impact.

Generally, '''to allocute''' in law means &quot;to speak out formally.&quot;  In the field of [[apologetics]], allocution is generally done in defense of a belief.  In politics, one may allocute before a [[legislature|legislative body]] in an effort to influence their position on an issue.  In law, it is generally meant to state specifically and in detail what one did and for what reason, often in relation to commission of a crime.

Allocution is sometimes required of a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime in a [[plea bargain]] in exchange for a reduced sentence.  In this instance, allocution can serve to provide [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] for victims or their families.  In principle, it removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant's guilt in the matter.

The term &quot;allocution&quot; is generally only in use in jurisdictions in the United States, though there are vaguely similar processes in other common law countries. In many other jurisdictions it is for the defense lawyer to mitigate on his client's behalf, and the defendant himself will rarely have the opportunity to speak. The right of victims to speak at sentencing is also sometimes referred to as allocution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=26|publisher=St. Mary's L.J.|pages=1103|date=1994-1995|title=Would You Like More Salt with That Wound - Post-Sentence Victim Allocution in Texas|author=Nicholson, Keith D.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/stmlj26&amp;section=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific jurisdictions==
===United States===
In most United States jurisdictions a defendant is allowed the opportunity to allocute&amp;mdash;that is, explain himself&amp;mdash;before sentence is passed.  Some jurisdictions hold this as an absolute right, and in its absence, a sentence may potentially be overturned, with the result that a new sentencing hearing must be held. In the federal system, [[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure]] 32(i)(4) provides that the court must &quot;address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule32.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Public Defender]] recommends that defendants speak in terms of how a lenient sentence will be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the statutory directives set forth in {{uscsub|18|3553|a}}.&lt;ref&gt;www.fd.org/pdf_lib/allocution%20pleading.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In Australia the term &quot;allocutus&quot; will be used.  It will be used by the Clerk of Arraigns or another formal associate of the Court.  It will generally be phrased as &quot;Prisoner at the Bar, you have been found Guilty by a jury of your peers of the offense of XYZ. Do you have anything to say as to why the sentence of this Court should not now be passed upon you?&quot;. The defense counsel will then make a &quot;plea in mitigation&quot; (also called &quot;submissions on penalty&quot;) wherein he or she will attempt to mitigate the relative seriousness of the offense and heavily refer to and rely upon the defendant's previous good character and good works (if any). In Australia, the right to make a plea in mitigation is absolute. If a judge or magistrate were to refuse to hear such a plea, or obviously fail to properly consider it, then the sentence would, without doubt, be overturned on appeal.

==In media==

Allocution refers to the one way dissemination of information through a media channel. It assumes that one party has an unlimited amount of information (usually through some kind of expertise) and can act as the ‘information services provider’ (pg 268) while the other party acts as the ‘information services consumer’ (Bordewijk and Kaam, 1986:268)

The term allocution differs from distribution as distribution implies that the original party loses some kind of control over the information. One party can tell many others a piece of information without losing it themselves, the original information store never becomes empty. (Bordewijk and Kaam, 1986:268)

The original party holds all control over the information. They decide when, how and how much information to give to the information services consumer. The consumer has no control over it in this model.

Examples of this type of communication include radio and traditional television programs such as the news.

Bordewijk, Jan L. and van Kaam, Ben (2002) [1986] “Towards a New Classification of Tele-Information Services,” in Denis McQuail (ed.) McQuail’s Reader in Mass Communication Theory, Sage, London, pp.&amp;nbsp;113&amp;ndash;24

==Roman Catholic Magisterium==
According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], an Allocution is a solemn form of address or speech from the throne employed by the Pope on certain occasions. It is delivered only in a secret [[consistory]] at which the cardinals alone are present. The term allocutio was used by the ancient Romans for the speech made by a commander to his troops, either before a battle or during it, to animate and encourage them. The term when adopted into ecclesiastical usage retained much of its original significance. An allocution of the Pope often takes the place of a manifesto when a struggle between the Holy See and the secular powers has reached an acute stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01325c.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Law unref|date=July 2007}}An '''affidavit''' is a formal [[Oath|sworn statement of fact]], signed by the author, who is called the '''affiant''' or '''deponent''', and witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiant's [[signature]] by a taker of oaths, such as a [[notary public]] or commissioner of oaths. The name is [[Medieval Latin]] for  ''he has declared upon oath''. An affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing, or in other words, it contains a verification, meaning it is under oath or penalty of perjury, and this serves as evidence to its veracity and is required for court proceedings. Not all affidavits require a notary public for execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;28 U.S.C. § 1746&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=28 U.S.C. § 1746|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001746----000-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Uses of affidavits include:
*To allow evidence to be gathered from witnesses or participants who may not be available to testify in person before the court, or who may otherwise fear for their safety if their true identities are revealed in court.
*To obtain a declaration on a legal document, such as an application for [[voter registration]], that the information provided by the applicant is truthful to the best of the applicant's knowledge. If, after signing such a declaration, the information is found to be deliberately untrue with the intent to deceive, the applicant may face [[perjury]] charges.

Affidavits may be written in the first or third person, depending on who drafted the document. If in the first person, the document's component parts are:
* a '''commencement''' which identifies the affiant;
* the individual '''averments''', almost always numbered as mandated by law, each one making a separate claim;
* a '''statement of truth'''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Legal Glossary&quot;, ''KJP Law'', s.v. &quot;Statement of truth&quot;, retrieved on 25 June 2009: [http://www.kjplaw.co.uk/content/Services/Glossary.aspx].&lt;/ref&gt; generally stating that everything is true, under penalty of perjury, fine, or imprisonment;
* an '''attestation''' clause, usually a [[jurat]], at the end certifying the affiant made oath and the date; and
* signatures of the author and witness.

If an affidavit is notarized or authenticated, it will also include a caption with a venue and title in reference to judicial proceedings.  In some cases, an introductory clause, called a '''preamble''', is added attesting that the affiant personally appeared before the authenticating authority.

==United States==
In American [[jurisprudence]], under the rules for [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]], admission of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual (especially if the affiant is not available for [[cross-examination]]) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar. Affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear may be accepted by the court, but usually only in the presence of [[corroborating evidence]]. An affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witness's recollection. Materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence. If the affiant is a party in the case, the affiant's opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence, as statements by a party-opponent are not considered hearsay.

Some types of motions will not be accepted by the court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence, in support of the need for the motion.  In such a case, a court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion, as certain assumptions are made, to wit: The affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes [[judicial economy]]. The lawyer is an [[officer of the court]] and knows that a false swearing by him, if found out, could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including [[disbarment]]. The lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit.

The acceptance of an affidavit by one society does not confirm its acceptance as a legal document in other jurisdictions. Equally, the acceptance that a lawyer is an officer of the court (for swearing the affidavit) is not a given. This matter is addressed by the use of the [[Apostille]], a means of certifying the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the 1961 Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents. Documents which have been notarized by a notary public, and certain other documents, and then certified with a conformant apostille are accepted for legal use in all the nations that have signed the Hague Convention. Thus most Affidavits now require to be Apostilled if used for cross border issues.

==Ireland==
Affidavits are made in a similar way as to England and Wales, although &quot;make oath&quot; is sometimes omitted. A declaration may be substituted for an affidavit in most cases for those opposed to swearing oaths. The person making the affidavit is known as the deponent but does not sign the affidavit. The affidavit concludes in the standard format &quot;sworn (declared) before me, [name of commissioner for oaths/solicitor], a commissioner for oaths (solicitor), on the [date] at [location] in the county/city of [county/city], and I know the deponent (declarant)&quot;, and it is signed and stamped by the commissioner for oaths.

'''Aries''' ({{IPA-en|ˈeə.riːz}}) is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]], located between [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] to the west and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] to the east. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[sheep|ram]], and its symbol is [[Image:Aries.svg|20px]] ({{Unicode|Unicode ♈}}), representing a ram's horns. Aries was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations today.

Ancient Greek astronomers visualized Aries as a ram lying down with its head turned to the right. The stars [[Alpha Arietis|α]], [[Beta Arietis|β]] and [[Gamma Arietis|γ Arietis]] mark the ram’s head and horns, according to Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]''.

==History==
In the description of the [[Babylonian zodiac]] given in the clay tablets known as the [[MUL.APIN]], the constellation now known as Aries was the final station along the [[ecliptic]]. It was known as {{lang|sux-Latn|&lt;sup&gt;MUL&lt;/sup&gt;LÚ.ḪUN.GÁ}}, &quot;The Agrarian Worker&quot;. The MUL.APIN is held to have been compiled in the 12th or 11th century BCE, but it reflects a tradition which takes the  [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]] as marking [[vernal equinox]], which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the [[Middle Bronze Age]] (early 3rd millennium BCE).&lt;ref&gt;John H. Rogers, &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA.108..9R Origins of the ancient contellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions]&quot;, ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'' '''108''' (1998) 9–28&lt;/ref&gt;

In later Babylonian tradition, the name of the constellation changes to {{lang|sux-Latn|&lt;sup&gt;MUL&lt;/sup&gt;UDU.NITÁ}} &quot;ram&quot;. The motive for the name change is unknown. John H. Rogers suggests that the &quot;Agrarian Worker&quot;  became the &quot;Ram&quot; via association with the legendary figure of [[Dumuzi the Shepherd]]. 
Gavin White suggests that the [[sumerogram]]  {{lang|sux-Latn|LÚ}} &quot;man&quot; may have come to be understood as Akkadian ''lu'' &quot;sheep&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, page 128&lt;/ref&gt;  

Aries only rose to its prominent position as the leading sign of the zodiac in the [[Neo-Babylonian]] (7th century BCE) revision of the [[Babylonian zodiac]], as [[Hamal]] (α Ari) came to be located close to the point of [[vernal equinox]].

In [[Hellenistic astrology]], the constellation of Aries is associated with the golden ram of [[Greek mythology]] that rescued [[Phrixos]], taking him to the land of [[Colchis]]. Phrixos sacrificed the ram to the gods and hung its skin in a temple, where it was known as the [[Golden Fleece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#20 &quot;Astronomica&quot;, chapter 20, Hyginus, translation by Mary Grant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astrology==
{{Main|Aries (astrology)}}

{{As of|2009}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Aries from April 19 to May 13. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] from March 21 to April 19, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from April 15 to May 15.

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Aries are located within the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger of the West]] (西方白虎, ''Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ'').

==Namesakes==
Three [[United States]] navy ships have been named after the constellation Aries: [[USS Aries (1863)]], [[USS Aries (AK-51)]] and [[USS Aries (PHM-5)]].

'''Aquarius''' is a [[constellation]] of the [[zodiac]],  situated between [[Capricornus]] and [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;'''[[water]]-bearer'''&quot; or &quot;'''cup-bearer'''&quot;, and its symbol is [[Image:Aquarius.svg|20px]] ({{Unicode|Unicode ♒}}), a representation of water.

Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the [[zodiac]] (the [[sun]]'s apparent path).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is found in a region often called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as [[Cetus]] the [[whale]], [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] the [[fish]] and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] the [[river]].

===Planetary systems===
* [[Gliese 876]] was the first [[red dwarf]] star to be found to possess a [[planetary system]]. It is orbited by four planets, including one [[terrestrial planet]] 6.6 times the mass of Earth.
* The [[orange giant]] star [[91 Aquarii]] is orbited by a planet, [[91 Aquarii b]]. The planet's mass is 2.9 times [[Jupiter]] and the semimajor axis of its orbit is 0.3 AU.
* [[Gliese 849]] is orbited by the first known long-period Jupiter-like planet, [[Gliese 849 b]]. The planet's mass is 0.82 times that of Jupiter and the semimajor axis of its orbit is 2.35 AU.

===Deep sky objects===
Aquarius contains three [[deep sky object]]s that are in the [[Messier object|Messier catalog]]: the globular clusters [[Messier 2]], [[Messier 72]], and the open cluster [[Messier 73]]. Two well-known [[planetary nebula]]e are located in Aquarius: the [[Saturn Nebula]] (NGC 7009), to the southwest of [[Eta Aquarii|η Aquarii]]; and the famous [[Helix Nebula]] (NGC 7293), southwest of [[δ Aquarii]].

==Illustrations==
[[Image:Aquariusurania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Aquarius pours water from a jar into the mouth of the southern fish, as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]
In illustrations, the brightest stars of Aquarius are represented as the figure of a man, while the fainter [[naked eye]] stars are represented as a vessel from which is pouring a stream of water. The water flows southwards into the mouth of the southern fish, [[Piscis Austrinus]].

==Mythology==
Aquarius is identified as {{lang|sux-Latn|GU.LA}} &quot;The Great One&quot; in the [[Babylonian star catalogues]] and represents the god  [[Ea (god)|Ea]] himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium. There is also an alternative tradition of a female 'Great One' who is attributed the overflowing vase and is occasionally depicted with a goatfish below her throne.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 121-123&lt;/ref&gt; It contained the [[winter solstice]] in the Early Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=rNpHjqxQQ9oC&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Old Babylonian astronomy]], Ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun's path, the &quot;Way of Ea&quot;, corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice.
In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to [[Piscis Austrinus]]. The name in the [[Hindu zodiac]] is likewise ''kumbha'' &quot;water-pitcher&quot;, showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Rogers, &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R Origins of the ancient contellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions]&quot;, ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'' '''108''' (1998) 9–28
&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquarius is sometimes identified with [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a beautiful youth in [[Greek mythology]] with whom [[Zeus]] fell in love and, in the disguise of an eagle (represented by the constellation [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]]) carried off to [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]] to be cup-bearer to the gods.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s animation became an alternative format of storytelling to the [[live-action]] industry in Japan. But it suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators, such as [[Noburō Ōfuji]] and [[Yasuji Murata]] still worked in cheaper [[cutout animation|cutout]] not [[cel animation]], although with masterful results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/pioneers-of-anime.shtml|title=Pioneers of Japanese Animation (Part 1)|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|date=September 23, 2004|publisher=Midnight Eye|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other creators, such as [[Kenzō Masaoka]] and [[Mitsuyo Seo]], nonetheless made great strides in animation technique, especially with increasing help from a government using animation in education and [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamaguchi|first=Katsunori|coauthors=Yasushi Watanabe|title=Nihon animēshon eigashi|publisher=Yūbunsha|year=1977|pages=26–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[talkie]] anime was ''[[Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka]]'', produced by Masaoka in 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;animeguide&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Anime: A Guide to Japanese Animation (1958-1988) |last=Baricordi |first=Andrea |coauthors=de Giovanni, Massimiliano; Pietroni, Andrea; Rossi, Barbara; Tunesi, Sabrina |date = December 2000|publisher=[[Protoculture Inc.]] |location=[[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada |isbn=2-9805759-0-9 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kodanasha1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia |year=1993 |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |location=Tokyo, Japan |isbn=9784062064897}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first feature length animated film was ''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]'' directed by Seo in 1945 with sponsorship by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Official booklet, ''The Roots of Japanese Anime'', DVD, Zakka Films, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s 1937 feature film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' influenced Japanese animators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corneredangel.com/amwess/papers/history.html |title=A Brief History of Anime |year=1999 |accessdate=2007-09-11 |work=Michael O'Connell, Otakon 1999 Program Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, manga artist and animator [[Osamu Tezuka]] adapted and simplified many Disney animation-techniques to reduce costs and to limit the number of frames in productions. He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced animation-staff.

The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of [[manga]] – many of them later animated. The work of [[Osamu Tezuka]] drew particular attention: he has been called a &quot;legend&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605110157.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060520053910/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605110157.html |archivedate=2006-05-20 |title=5 missing manga pieces by Osamu Tezuka found in U.S.|accessdate=2006-08-29 |last=Ohara |first=Atsushi |publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=2006-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;god of manga&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcb.com/ency/t/tezuka_osamu.htm |title=Dr. Osamu Tezuka |accessdate=2006-08-29 |date=2000-03-14 |work=The Anime Encyclopedia |publisher=The Anime Café}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/006_tezuka/006_tezuka.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071231013227/http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/006_tezuka/006_tezuka.htm |archivedate=2007-12-31 |title=Osamu Tezuka: The God of Manga |accessdate=2006-08-29 |last=Gravett |first=Paul |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His work – and that of other pioneers in the field – inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant [[robot]] genre (known as &quot;[[Mecha]]&quot; outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the [[Super Robot]] genre under [[Go Nagai]] and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] who developed the [[Real Robot]] genre. Robot anime like the ''[[Gundam]]'' and ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' series became instant classics in the 1980s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today. In the 1980s, anime became more accepted in the [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] in Japan (although less than [[manga]]), and experienced a boom in production. Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s, anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century.

== Terminology ==
Japanese write the English term &quot;animation&quot; in ''[[katakana]]'' as アニメーション (''animēshon'', pronounced {{IPA-ja|animeːɕoɴ|}}), and the term アニメ (''anime'', pronounced {{IPA-ja|anime||Anime.ogg}} in Japanese) emerged in the 1970s as an abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anime |title=Etymology Dictionary Reference: Anime accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=Etymonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the word derives from the French phrase ''dessin animé''.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga!&quot;/&gt; Japanese-speakers use both the original and abbreviated forms interchangeably, but the shorter form occurs more commonly.

The pronunciation of ''anime'' in Japanese, {{IPA|[anime]}}, differs significantly from the [[Standard English]] {{IPA-en|ˈænɪmeɪ|}}, which has different vowels and [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. (In Japanese each [[mora (linguistics)|mora]] carries equal stress.) As with a few other Japanese words such as ''[[saké]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'', and ''[[Kobo Abé]],'' English-language texts sometimes spell ''anime'' as ''animé'' (as in French), with an [[acute accent]] over the final ''e'', to cue the reader to pronounce the letter, not to leave it silent as English orthography might suggest.

=== Word usage ===
In Japan, the term ''anime'' does not specify an animation's nation of origin or style; instead, it serves as a [[blanket term]] to refer to all forms of animation from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art4260.asp |title=What is Anime? |publisher=Bellaonline |accessdate=2007-10-28 |work=Lesley Aeschliman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tezuka: The Marvel of Manga - Education Kit |year=2007 |publisher=Art Gallery New South Wales |accessdate=2007-10-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830033821/http://artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; English-language dictionaries define ''anime'' as &quot;a Japanese style of motion-picture animation&quot; or as &quot;a style of animation developed in Japan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anime |title=Anime Dictionary Definition |accessdate=2006-10-09 |work=[[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime|title=Merriam-Webster:anime|accessdate=2010-11-18|work=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Japanese works that borrow stylization from anime are commonly referred to as &quot;[[anime-influenced animation]]&quot; but it is not unusual for a viewer who does not know the country of origin of such material to refer to it as simply &quot;anime&quot;. Some works result from co-productions with non-Japanese companies, such as most of the traditionally animated [[Rankin/Bass]] works, the [[Cartoon Network (US)|Cartoon Network]] and [[Production I.G]] series ''[[IGPX]]'' or ''[[Ōban Star-Racers]]''; different viewers may or may not consider these anime.

In the UK, many video shops will classify all adult-oriented animated videos in the &quot;Anime&quot;  section for convenience, regardless of whether they show any stylistic similarities to Japanese animation. No evidence suggests that this has led to any change in the use of the word.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In English, ''anime'', when used as a common [[noun]], normally functions as a [[mass noun]] (for example: &quot;Do you watch anime?&quot;, &quot;How much anime have you collected?&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]], 4th ed.; Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in casual usage the word also appears as a [[count noun]]. ''Anime'' can also be used as a [[suppletive]] [[adjective]] or classifier noun (&quot;The anime ''[[Guyver: The Bioboosted Armor|Guyver]]'' is different from the movie ''[[The Guyver|Guyver]]''&quot;).

=== Synonyms ===
English-speakers occasionally refer to anime as &quot;Japanimation&quot;, but this term has fallen into disuse. &quot;Japanimation&quot; saw the most usage during the 1970s and 1980s, but the term &quot;anime&quot; supplanted it in the mid-1990s as the material became more widely known in English-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Patten |first=Fred |title=Watching Anime, Reading Manga: 25 Years of Essays and Reviews |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=2004 |isbn=1880656922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, the term now only appears in nostalgic contexts.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref2&quot; /&gt;  Since &quot;anime&quot; does not identify the country of origin in Japanese usage, &quot;Japanimation&quot; is used to distinguish Japanese work from that of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref2&quot; /&gt;

In Japan, &quot;[[manga]]&quot; can refer to both animation and comics.  Among English speakers, &quot;manga&quot; has the stricter meaning of &quot;Japanese comics&quot;, in parallel to the usage of &quot;anime&quot; in and outside of Japan.  The term &quot;[[ani-manga]]&quot; is used to describe comics produced from animation cels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animecornerstore.com/inuyaanno.html |title=Inu Yasha Ani-MangaGraphic Novels |publisher=Animecornerstore.com |date=1999-11-01 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visual characteristics ==
[[File:Modernanime.jpg|thumb|Anime artists use many distinct visual styles.]]

Many commentators refer to anime as an [[art form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2006/04/07/ask-john-do-japanese-viewers-treat-anime-shows-as-fads/ |title=Ask John: Do Japanese Viewers Treat Anime Shows as Fads? |date=2006-04-07 |publisher=AnimeNation |accessdate=2008-01-23 |work=Ask John}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a visual medium, it can emphasize visual styles. The styles can vary from artist to artist or from studio to studio. Some titles make extensive use of common stylization: ''[[FLCL]]'', for example, has a reputation for wild, exaggerated stylization. Other titles use different methods: ''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film)|Only Yesterday]]'' or ''[[Jin-Roh]]'' take much more realistic approaches, featuring few stylistic exaggerations; ''[[Pokémon]]'' uses drawings which specifically do not distinguish the nationality of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|page=88|isbn=0-822-33287-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

While different titles and different artists have their own artistic styles, many stylistic elements have become so common that people{{Who|date=August 2009}} describe them as definitive of anime in general. However, this does not mean that all modern anime share one strict, common art-style. Many anime have a very different art style from what would commonly be called &quot;anime style&quot;, yet fans still use the word &quot;anime&quot; to refer to these titles. Generally, the most common form of anime drawings include &quot;exaggerated physical features such as large eyes, big hair and elongated limbs... and dramatically shaped speech bubbles, [[speed line]]s and onomatopoeic, exclamatory typography.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/print/fl20060528x1.html |title=Japan Times |accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- These elements have been given names of their own. (names such as?) --&gt; &lt;!-- Previous Text used under &quot;Animation Process&quot; See:Discussion. This passage can be reincorporated somewhere --&gt;
&lt;!-- Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation precepts to reduce the budget costs and the number of frames in a production. This was intended to be a temporary measure to allow him to produce one episode every week with an inexperienced animation staff. Some animators in Japan overcome production budgets by utilizing different techniques than the Disney or the old Tezuka/Otsuka methods of animating anime. Due to reduced frame rate, several still shots and scrolling backgrounds, more time can be spent on detail in each drawing. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Will need to work these parts in here somehow, otherwise, omit most of it --&gt;
The influences of [[Japanese calligraphy]] and [[Japanese painting]] also characterize linear qualities of the anime style. The round [[ink brush]] traditionally used for writing [[kanji]] and for painting, produces a stroke of widely varying thickness.

Anime also tends to borrow many elements from [[manga]], including text in the background and panel layouts. For example, an opening may employ manga panels to tell the story, or to dramatize a point for humorous effect. See for example the anime ''[[Kare Kano]]''.

=== Character design ===
==== Proportions ====
Body proportions emulated in anime come from proportions of the human body. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary as long as the remainder of the body remains proportional. Most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall, and extreme heights are set around nine heads tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;headheight&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animeworld.com/howtodraw/bodies1.html |title=Body Proportion |accessdate=2007-08-16 |work=Akemi's Anime World}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations to proportion can be modded by the artist. [[Super deformed|Super-deformed]] characters feature a non-proportionally small body compared to the head. Sometimes specific body parts, like legs, are shortened or elongated for added emphasis. Most super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like ''[[Crayon Shin-chan]]'' completely disregard these proportions, such that they resemble Western cartoons. For exaggeration, certain body features are increased in proportion.&lt;ref name=&quot;headheight&quot;/&gt;

==== Eye styles ====
Many anime and [[manga]] characters feature large [[Human eye|eye]]s. [[Osamu Tezuka]], who is believed to have been the first to use this technique, was inspired by the exaggerated features of American cartoon characters such as [[Betty Boop]], [[Mickey Mouse]], and Disney's ''[[Bambi]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga!&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreamland&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schodt |first=Frederik L. | title=Dreamland Japan: Writings on Modern Manga |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1996 |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-8806562-3-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka found that large eyes style allowed his characters to show emotions distinctly. When Tezuka began drawing ''[[Princess Knight|Ribbon no Kishi]]'', the first manga specifically targeted at young girls, Tezuka further exaggerated the size of the characters' eyes. Indeed, through ''Ribbon no Kishi'', Tezuka set a stylistic template that later ''shōjo'' artists tended to follow.

Coloring is added to give eyes, particularly to the cornea, some depth. The depth is accomplished by applying variable color shading. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biorust.com/tutorials/detail/141/en/ |title=Basic Anime Eye Tutorial |accessdate=2007-08-22 |work=Centi, Biorust.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyJ9yfYl_Fc |title=How to color anime eye |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Carlus |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropologist [[Matt Thorn]] argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga characters look white&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Do Manga Characters Look &quot;White&quot;? |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060517194357sh_re_/www.matt-thorn.com/mangagaku/faceoftheother.html &lt;!-- ([[Internet Archive]] backup) --&gt; |accessdate=2005-12-11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all anime have large eyes. For example, some of the work of [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and [[Toshiro Kawamoto]] are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;companion&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Poitras |first=Gilles |title=Anime Companion |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1998 |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-32-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition many other productions also have been known to use smaller eyes. This design tends to have more resemblance to traditional Japanese art.{{Or|date=February 2009}} Some characters have even smaller eyes, where simple black dots are used. However, many western audiences associate anime with large detailed eyes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==== Facial expressions ====
{{See also|Manga iconography}}
Anime characters may employ a variety of predetermined facial expressions to denote moods and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mangatutorials.com/tut/expressions.php |title=Manga Tutorials: Emotional Expressions |accessdate=2008-08-22 |work=Rio}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in western animation, and they include a fixed iconography that's used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody&quot; /&gt;

There are a number of other stylistic elements that are common to conventional anime as well but more often used in comedies. Characters that are shocked or surprised will perform a &quot;[[face fault]]&quot;, in which they display an extremely exaggerated expression. Angry characters may exhibit a &quot;vein&quot; or &quot;stress mark&quot; effect, where lines representing bulging veins will appear on their forehead. Angry women will sometimes summon a [[mallet]] from nowhere and strike another character with it, mainly for the sake of [[slapstick]] comedy. Male characters will develop a [[bloody nose]] around their female love interests (typically to indicate arousal, which is a play on an [[old wives' tale]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~anime/info_emotions.html |title=Emotional Iconography in Animae |author=University of Michigan Animae Project |date=Current |accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embarrassed or stressed characters either produce a massive [[Manga iconography|sweat-drop]] (which has become one of the most widely recognized motifs of conventional anime) or produce a visibly red blush or set of parallel (sometimes squiggly) lines beneath the eyes, especially as a manifestation of repressed romantic feelings. Characters who want to childishly taunt someone may pull an [[akanbe]] face (by pulling an eyelid down with a finger to expose the red underside). Characters may also have large &quot;X&quot; eyes to show a knockout, or in some cases, even illness. This is typically used for comedic purposes.  Vacant, non-reflecting eyes can be used to indicate a state of semi-consciousness.

=== Animation technique ===
{{Main|Animation}}
Like all [[animation]], the production processes of [[storyboard]]ing, [[voice acting]], character design, cel production and so on still apply. With improvements in computer technology, [[computer animation]] increased the efficiency of the whole production process.

Anime is often considered a form of [[limited animation]]. That means that stylistically, even in bigger productions the conventions of limited animation are used to fool the eye into thinking there is more movement than there is.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga!&quot;/&gt; Many of the techniques used are comprised with cost-cutting measures while working under a set budget.

Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views. Backgrounds depict the scenes' atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga!&quot;/&gt; For example, anime often puts emphasis on changing seasons, as can be seen in numerous anime, such as ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]''. Sometimes actual settings have been duplicated into an anime. The backgrounds for the ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' are based on various locations within the suburb of [[Nishinomiya, Hyogo]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rinku.zaq.ne.jp/p_v/haruhi.html |title=Reference pictures to actual places |accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camera angles, camera movement, and lighting play an important role in scenes. Directors often have the discretion of determining viewing angles for scenes, particularly regarding backgrounds. In addition, camera angles show [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name=&quot;production&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huitula.com/productionIG2_page2.htm|title=Anime production process - feature film|year=2000|accessdate=2007-08-27|work=PRODUCTION I.G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directors can also choose camera effects within [[cinematography]], such as panning, zooming, facial closeup, and panoramic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.understandinganime.com/cinematography.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080613154025/http://www.understandinganime.com/cinematography.php |archivedate=2008-06-13 |title=Cinematography: Looping and Animetion Techniques |year=1999 |accessdate=2007-08-29 |work=Understanding Anime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large majority of anime uses [[traditional animation]], which better allows for [[division of labor]], [[12 basic principles of animation#Straight ahead action and pose to pose|pose to pose]] approach and checking of drawings before they are shot – practices favored by the anime industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jouvanceau2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouvanceau |first=Pierre |coauthors=Clare Kitson (translator) |title=The Silhouette Film |publisher=[[Le Mani]] |year=2004 |location=Genoa |page=103 |url=http://www.heeza.fr/description.php?lang=2&amp;path=64&amp;sort=Article&amp;page=0&amp;id=296 |isbn=88-8012-299-1 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mediums are mostly limited to independently made [[Short subject|short films]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Beyond Anime: A Brief Guide to Experimental Japanese Animation|work=Midnight Eye|year=2003|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/beyond_anime.shtml|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of which are the [[Silhouette animation|silhouette]] and other [[cutout animation]] of [[Noburō Ōfuji]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Jouvanceau2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cinémathèque2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Tribute to Noburō Ōfuji |work=To the Source of Anime: Japanese Animation |publisher=Cinémathèque québécoise |year=2008 |url=http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/animation_japonaise.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[stop motion]] puppet animation of [[Tadahito Mochinaga]], [[Kihachirō Kawamoto]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Interview with Kihachirō Kawamoto|work=Midnight Eye|year=2004|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/kihachiro_kawamoto.shtml|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tomoyasu Murata]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munroe Hotes|first=Catherine|title=Tomoyasu Murata and Company|work=Midnight Eye|year=2008|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/tomoyasu-murata-and-company.shtml|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[computer animation]] of [[Satoshi Tomioka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walters|first=Helen|title=Animation Unlimited: Innovative Short Films Since 1940|publisher=Laurence King|year=2004 |location=London|url=http://lib.leeds.ac.uk/record=b2662684|isbn=18-5669-346-5|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (most famously ''[[Usavich]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Works |work=KANABAN-Web |publisher=Kanaban Graphics |year=2008 |url=http://www.mtvjapan.com/usavich/about.html |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
{{See also|Anime licensing}}
While anime had entered markets beyond Japan in the 1960s, it grew as a major cultural export during its market expansion during the 1980s and 1990s. The anime market for the United States alone is &quot;worth approximately $4.35 billion, according to the [[Japan External Trade Organization]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118851157811713921.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Manga Mania |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |work=Bianca Bosker (Wall Street Journal)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anime has also had commercial success in Asia, Europe and Latin America, where anime has become more mainstream than in the United States. For example, the ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' video game was released in Europe due to the popularity of the show even years after the series has been off-air.

Anime distribution companies handled the [[Anime industry|licensing and distribution]] of anime outside Japan. Licensed anime is modified by distributors through [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] into the language of the country and adding language subtitles to the Japanese language track. Using a similar [[Regional lockout|global distribution pattern]] as [[Hollywood]], the world is divided into [[Anime industry|five regions]].

Some [[Re-edited film|editing]] of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.salemstate.edu/~poehlkers/Emerson/Pokemon.html |title=Pokemon Case Study |publisher=W3.salemstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain companies may remove any objectionable content, complying with domestic law. This editing process was far more prevalent in the past (e.g. ''[[Voltron]]''), but its use has declined because of the demand for anime in its original form. This &quot;light touch&quot; approach to localization has favored viewers formerly unfamiliar with anime. The use of such methods is evident by the success of ''[[Naruto]]'' and [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] [[Adult Swim]] programming block, both of which employ minor edits.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} ''[[Robotech]]'' and ''[[Star Blazers]]'' were the earliest attempts to present anime (albeit still modified) to North American television audiences without harsh censoring for violence and mature themes.

With the advent of [[DVD]], it became possible to include multiple language tracks into a simple product. This was not the case with [[VHS|VHS cassette]], in which separate VHS media were used and with each VHS cassette priced the same as a single DVD. The &quot;light touch&quot; approach also applies to DVD releases as they often include both the dubbed audio and the original Japanese audio with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], typically unedited. Anime edited for television is usually released on DVD &quot;uncut&quot;, with all scenes intact.

Some fans add subtitles to anime on their own and distribute the episodes.  These are known as [[fansub]]s.  Often, people will collect these fansubs and upload them to websites which they also put advertisements on so as to earn money, which violates [[copyright]] laws in many countries.   The ethical implications of distributing or watching fansubs are topics of much controversy even when fansub groups do not profit from their activities. Once the series has been licensed outside of Japan, fansub groups often cease distribution of their work. In one case, [[Media Factory|Media Factory Incorporated]] requested that no fansubs of their material be made, which was respected by the fansub community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anxious times in the cartoon underground |work=CNet |url=http://news.cnet.com/Anxious-times-in-the-cartoon-underground/2100-1026_3-5557177.html |accessdate=2007-09-06 |date=2005-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, Bandai specifically thanked fansubbers for their role in helping to make ''The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya'' popular in the English speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adventures of the ASOS Brigade Episode 00: Made by Fans for Fans |url=http://asosbrigade.com/ |accessdate=2006-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internet]] has played a significant role in the exposure of anime beyond Japan. Prior to the 1990s, anime had limited exposure beyond Japan's borders. Coincidentally, as the popularity of the Internet grew, so did interest in anime. Much of the fandom of anime grew through the Internet. The combination of internet communities and increasing amounts of anime material, from video to images, helped spur the growth of fandom.&lt;ref name=&quot;anime-internet&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comipress.com/article/2006/07/20/489 |title=100 Questions About Anime &amp; Manga Overseas |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2007-08-23 |work=Comipress}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Internet gained more widespread use, Internet advertising revenues grew from 1.6 billion yen to over 180 billion yen between 1995 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.j-cast.com/2005/12/21000171.html |title=Free Anime: Providers Bear Losses to Build Business |date=2005-12-21 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |work=J-Cast Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Broadcasting ===

{{see also|Television in Japan|Late night anime|UHF anime}}

TV networks regularly broadcast anime programming. In Japan, major national TV networks, such as [[TV Tokyo]] broadcast anime regularly. Smaller regional stations broadcast anime under the [[UHF anime|UHF]]. In the United States, cable TV channels such as [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Syfy]], and others dedicate some of their timeslots to anime. Some, such as the [[Anime Network]] and the [[FUNimation Channel]], specifically show anime. [[Sony]]-based [[Animax]] and Disney's [[Jetix]] channel broadcast anime within many countries in the world. [[AnimeCentral]] solely broadcasts anime in the UK.

Anime has become commercially profitable in western countries, as early commercially successful western adaptations of anime, such as ''[[Astro Boy]]'', have revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;commercially successful&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Progress Against the Law: Fan Distribution, Copyright, and the Explosive Growth of Japanese Animation |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall03-papers/Progress_Against_the_Law.html |accessdate=2006-05-01}}&lt;!-- This appears to be a student paper that was not peer reviewed or published in a journal or conference proceeding. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenal success of [[Nintendo]]'s multi-billion [[United States dollar|dollar]] ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pokemon Franchise Approaches 150 Million Games Sold |url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-04-2005/0004159206&amp;EDATE= |agency=PR Newswire |publisher=Nintendo |date=4 October 2005 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was helped greatly by the [[Pokémon (anime)|spin-off anime series]] that, first broadcast in the late 1990s, is still running worldwide to this day. In doing so, anime has made significant impacts upon Western culture. Since the 19th century, many Westerners have expressed a [[Japanophile|particular interest towards Japan]]. Anime dramatically exposed more Westerners to the culture of Japan. Aside from anime, other facets of Japanese culture increased in popularity&lt;!-- need better word --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Faiola |first=Anthony |title=Japan's Empire of Cool |work=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A1 |publisher=[[Washington Post Company]] |date=2003-12-27 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A33261-2003Dec26?language=printer |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, the number of people studying Japanese increased.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some American animated television-series have singled out anime styling with satirical intent, for example ''[[South Park]]'' (with &quot;[[Chinpokomon]]&quot; and with &quot;[[Good Times with Weapons]]&quot;). ''South Park'' has a notable drawing style, itself parodied in &quot;[[List of FLCL episodes|Brittle Bullet]]&quot;, the fifth episode of the anime ''[[FLCL]]'', released several months after &quot;Chinpokomon&quot; aired. This intent on satirizing anime is the springboard for the basic premise of ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'', a Nicktoons Network original cartoon. Even clichés normally found in anime are parodied in some series, such as ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]''. [[Anime convention]]s began to appear in the early 1990s, during the Anime boom, starting with [[Anime Expo]], [[Animethon]], [[Otakon]], and [[JACON]]. Currently anime conventions are held annually [[List of anime conventions|in various cities]] across the Americas, Asia, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animecons.com/events/ |title=Convention Schedule |accessdate=2007-09-06 |work=AnimeCons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many attendees participate in [[cosplay]], where they dress up as anime characters. Also, guests from Japan ranging from artists, directors, and music groups are invited. In addition to anime conventions, [[anime club]]s have become prevalent in colleges, high schools, and community centers as a way to publicly exhibit anime as well as broadening [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]] cultural understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2002/5/21/animeAchievesGrowingPopularityAmongStanfordStudents |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071021222201/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2002/5/21/animeAchievesGrowingPopularityAmongStanfordStudents |archivedate=2007-10-21 |title=Anime achieves growing popularity among Stanford students}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewers may also pick up on Japanese terms either within or related to anime, though at times those words may take on different connotations.  For instance, the Japanese term ''otaku'' is used as a term for anime fans beyond Japan, more particularly the obsessive ones. The negative connotations associated with the word in Japan have lessened in foreign context, where it instead connotes the pride of the fans.

'''Ankara''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈan.ka.ɾa}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[Turkey]] and the country's [[List of largest cities and second largest cities by country|second largest]] [[List of cities in Turkey|city]] after [[Istanbul]]. The city has a mean elevation of {{convert|938|m|ft}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TU/68/Ankara.html Ankara, Turkey: Latitude, Longitude and Altitude]&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2008 the city had a population of 4,500,000. Ankara also serves as the capital of [[Ankara Province]].

As with many ancient cities, Ankara has gone by several names over the ages. It has been identified with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] cult center '''Ankuwaš''',&lt;!--or Ankuwa, but not Ankuwash--&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;qgmpff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialscience.tjc.edu/mkho/fulbright/1998/turkey/turman3.htm |title=Judy Turman: Early Christianity in Turkey |publisher=Socialscience.tjc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;xtxpyw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/seyahat/4407373_p.asp |title=Saffet Emre Tonguç: Ankara (Hürriyet Seyahat) |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this remains a matter of debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorny&quot;&gt;Gorny, Ronald L. &quot;Zippalanda and Ankuwa: The Geography of Central Anatolia in the Second Millennium B.C.&quot; ''The Journal of the American Oriental Society''. Vol. 117 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In classical antiquity and during the medieval period, the city was known as '''Ánkyra''' ({{Polytonic|'''Ἄγκυρα'''}}, &quot;[[anchor]]&quot;) in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and '''Ancyra''' in [[Latin]]; the [[Galatian language|Galatian Celtic]] name was probably a similar variant. Following its annexation by the [[Seljuq Turks]] in 1073, the city became known in many European languages as '''Angora''', a usage which continued until its official renaming to &quot;Ankara&quot; under the Turkish Postal Service Law of 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/ankara.htm |title=Ankara |publisher=I-cias.com |date=2004-09-03 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposed theory show that the original name of the city might be taken over from the [[Angara River|Ankara River]] of Asia by the invading [[Seljuk Turks]]. 

Centrally located in [[Anatolia]], Ankara is an important commercial and industrial city. It is the center of the [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish Government]], and houses all foreign embassies. It is an important crossroads of trade, strategically located at the centre of Turkey's highway and railway networks, and serves as the marketing centre for the surrounding agricultural area. The city was famous for its long-haired [[Angora goat]] and its prized wool ([[mohair]]), a unique breed of cat ([[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]]), [[Angora rabbit|white rabbits]] and their prized wool ([[Angora wool]]), [[pear]]s, [[honey]], and the region's [[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] [[grape]]s.

The historical center of Ankara is situated upon a rocky hill, which rises {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the plain on the left bank of the ''Ankara Çayı'', a tributary of the [[Sakarya River|Sakarya]] (Sangarius) river. The city is located at 39°52'30&quot; North, 32°52' East ({{Coord|39.875|N|32.8333|E|type:city_region:TR|display=inline,title}}), about {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast of Istanbul, the country's largest city. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, which is 72&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ankara.bel.tr/AbbSayfalari/hizmet_birimleri/Cevre/kisi_basina_dusen_yesil_alan.aspx |title=Municipality of Ankara: Green areas per head |publisher=Ankara.bel.tr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ankara is a very old city with various [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Phrygia]]n, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[archaeological site]]s. The hill which overlooks the city is crowned by the ruins of the old castle, which adds to the picturesqueness of the view, but only a few historic structures surrounding the old citadel have survived to the present day. There are, however, many finely preserved remains of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], the most remarkable being the Temple of [[Augustus]] and Rome (20 BC) which is also known as the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]''.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/home.html |title=LacusCurtius • Monumentum Ancyranum |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Ankara}}
[[File:MuseumOfAnatolianCivilizationsHittiteArtifacts.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hittites|Hittite]] artifacts on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara.]]

The region's history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hittite empire|Hatti]] civilization, which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygia]]ns, and later by the [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Galatia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] (the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of Rûm]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]].)

===Ancient history===
The oldest settlements in and around the city centre of Ankara belong to the [[Hittite empire|Hatti]] civilization which existed during the [[Bronze Age]].  The city grew significantly in size and importance under the [[Phrygia]]ns starting around 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from [[Gordium|Gordion]], (the capital of [[Phrygia]]), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King [[Midas]] was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archaeological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece, 1.4.1., &quot;Ancyra was actually older even than that.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrygian rule was succeeded first by [[Lydia]]n and later by [[Iran|Persia]]n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered the city in 333 BC. Alexander came from [[Gordium|Gordion]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at [[Babylon]] in 323 BC and the subsequent division of his empire amongst his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]].

Another important expansion took place under the Greeks of [[Pontus|Pontos]] who came there around 300 BC and developed the city as a trading centre for the commerce of goods between the [[Black Sea]] ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name ''Áγκυρα'' (''Ànkyra'', meaning ''[[Anchor]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) which in slightly modified form provides the modern name of ''Ankara''.

===Celtic history===
[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Dying Gaul]]'' was a famous statue commissioned in some time between 230&amp;nbsp;BC and 220&amp;nbsp;BC by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the Celtic [[Galatia]]ns in Anatolia. Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] work of the late third century BCE. [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]].]]

In 278 BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by the [[Celts|Celt]]ic race of [[Galatia]]ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centres, the headquarters of the [[Volcae|Tectosages]] tribe. Other centres were [[Pessinus|Pessinos]], today's ''Balhisar'', for the [[Trocmi]] tribe, and [[Tavium]], to the east of Ankara, for the ''Tolstibogii'' tribe. The city was then known as ''Ancyra''. The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian-speaking peasants. However, the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, St. [[Jerome]], a native of Galatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near [[Trier]].

===Roman history===
The city was subsequently conquered by [[Augustus]] in 25 BC and passed under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. Now the capital city of the Roman province of Galatia, Ancyra continued to be a center of great commercial importance. Ankara is also famous for the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (''Temple of Augustus and Rome'') which contains the official record of the ''Acts of Augustus'', known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple. The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable [[relief|bas-relief]]s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments.

Augustus decided to make Ancyra one of three main administrative centres in central Anatolia. The town was then populated by Phrygians and Celts—the ''Galatians'' who spoke a language somewhat closely related to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]. Ancyra was the center of a tribe known as the ''Tectosages'', and Augustus upgraded it into a major provincial capital for his empire. Two other Galatian tribal centres, [[Tavium]] near [[Yozgat]], and [[Pessinus]] (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis.

[[File:Galatia Map.png|thumb|left|250px|Ancyra was the capital of the [[Celts|Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Galatia]], and later of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province with the same name, after its conquest by [[Augustus]] in 25&amp;nbsp;BC.]]

An estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. A small river, the [[Ankara River|Ankara Çayı]], ran through the centre of the Roman town. It has now been covered over and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. Çankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one [[Roman villa]] or large house were still standing not far from where the Çankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gençlik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by [[Hacettepe University]]. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of [[Gaul]] or [[Britannia]].

Ancyra's importance rested on the fact was that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north-south and east-west intersected. The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the [[Goths]] coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of [[Cappadocia]], taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the [[Arab people|Arab]]s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of the most brilliant queens of the ancient world, the Arab empress [[Zenobia]] from [[Palmyra]] in the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian desert]], who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own.

[[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|The [[Res Gestae]] is the self-laudatory autobiography completed in 13 AD, just before his death, by the first Roman emperor [[Augustus]]. Most of the text is preserved in the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]].]]

The town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under the Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272. The [[tetrarchy]], a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by [[Diocletian]] (284-305), seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and [[Dorylaeum]] (now [[Eskişehir]]).

In its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarised in response to the invasions and instability of the town. In this period, like other cities of central Anatolia, Ankara was also undergoing Christianisation.

Early martyrs, about whom little is known, included Proklos and Hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown village of Kallippi, near Ancyra, and suffered repression under the emperor [[Trajan]] (98-117). In the 280s AD we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius.

As in other Roman towns, the reign of [[Diocletian]] marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-Emperors Diocletian and his deputy [[Galerius]] launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of [[Clement of Ohrid|St. Clement]] can be found today in a building just off Işıklar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. [[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|Theodotus of Ancyra]] is also venerated as a saint.

[[File:Column of Julian the Apostate in Ankara.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Column of Julianus'', now in the Ulus district, was erected in honor of the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra in 362.]]

However, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of an important council of the [[Early Christianity|early church]]; which considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the [[Christian Church|Christian church]] after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of 'lapsi'—Christians who had given in and conformed to [[paganism]] during these persecutions.

Three councils were held in the former capital of Galatia in Asia Minor, during the 4th century. The first, an orthodox plenary synod, was held in 314, and its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the [[Confession|Sacrament of Penance]]. Nine of them deal with conditions for the reconciliation of the lapsi; the others, with marriage, alienations of church property, etc.

Though paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and [[monotheism]] had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of [[Arianism]] seems to have originated there.

The synod of 358 was a Semi-Arian [[conciliabulum]], presided over by [[Basil of Ancyra]]. It condemned the grosser Arian blasphemies, but set forth an equally heretical doctrine in the proposition that the Son was in all things similar to the Father, but not identical in substance.
In 362-363, the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men. The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as ''&quot;Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations&quot;'', can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]]. The modern Ankara, also known in some Western texts as ''Angora'', remains a Roman Catholic [[titular see]] in the former [[Roman province]] of [[Galatia]] in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], [[suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of [[Laodicean Church|Laodicea]]. Its episcopal list is given in Gams, &quot;Series episc. Eccl. cath.&quot;; also that of another Ancyra in [[Phrygia|Phrygia Pacatiana]].

In the late 4th century AD, Ancyra became something of an imperial [[resort|holiday resort]]. After [[Constantinople]] became the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. [[Theodosius II]] (408-450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there. The city's military as well as logistical significance lasted well into the long [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]]. Although Ancyra temporarily fell into the hands of several Arab Muslim armies numerous times after the 7th century, it remained an important crossroads polis within the Byzantine Empire until the late 11th century. It was also the capital of the powerful [[Opsikion|Opsician Theme]], and after ca. 750 of the [[Bucellarian Theme]].

===Turkish history===
[[File:II. TBMM Binası.JPG|thumb|right|thumb|The second Turkish Parliament Building (1923), which is now the Republic Museum.]]
[[File:Kizilay Square Ankara Turkey.jpg|thumb|Kızılay Square is the heart of Ankara.]] 

In 1071, the Turkish [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] conquered much of eastern and central Anatolia after his victory at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. He then annexed Ankara, an important location for military transportation and [[natural resource]]s, to his territory in 1073. After the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243 in which the [[Mongols]] defeated the Seljuqs, most of Anatolia became part of the dominion of the Mongols. Taking advantage of Seljuq decline, a semi religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ''Ahiler'' chose Ankara as their independent city state in 1290. [[Orhan I]], the second [[Bey]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], captured the city in 1356. [[Timur]] defeated the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402 and took the city, but in 1403 Ankara was again under Ottoman control.

[[File:Turkish Parliament Building.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]].]]

Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] defeat at [[World War I]], the Ottoman capital [[Istanbul]] and much of [[Anatolia]] were occupied by the Allies, who planned to share these lands between [[Armenia]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]], leaving for the Turks the core piece of land in central Anatolia. In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], established the headquarters of his [[Turkish National Movement|resistance movement]] in Ankara in 1920 (see the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] and the [[Turkish War of Independence]].) After the War of Independence was won and the Treaty of Sèvres was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923. A few days earlier, Ankara had officially replaced Istanbul (formerly [[Constantinople]]) as the new Turkish capital city, on 13 October 1923.

After Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called ''Ulus'', and a new section, called ''Yenişehir''. Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered on ''Kızılay'', has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section. Ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made Turkey's capital. It was &quot;a small town of no importance&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Lippincott Gazeteer&lt;/ref&gt; when it was made the capital of Turkey. In 1924, the year after the government had moved there, Ankara had about 35,000 residents. By 1927 there were 44,553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286,781.

==Economy==
[[File:Kavaklıdere wines trio.jpg|thumb|upright|Ankara is famous for its local varieties of grapes and wine, such as [[Kalecik Karası]] and [[Kavaklıdere (winery)|Kavaklıdere]].]]

Historically, the production of [[Mohair]] from the [[Angora goat]]; and [[Angora wool]] from the [[Angora rabbit]]; have been an important part of the city's economy. These fabrics have been exported from Ankara to Europe and other parts of the globe for centuries.

The [[Central Anatolia Region]] is one of the primary locations of [[grape]] and [[Turkish wine|wine production in Turkey]], and Ankara is particularly famous for its [[Kalecik Karası]] and [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat grapes]]; and its [[Kavaklıdere (winery)|Kavaklıdere wine]], which is produced in the [[Kavaklıdere, Ankara|Kavaklıdere]] neighbourhood within the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] district of the city. Ankara is also famous for its [[pear]]s. Another renowned natural product of Ankara is its indigenous type of [[honey]] (''Ankara Balı'') which is known for its light colour and is mostly produced by the [[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] in the Gazi district, and by other facilities in the Elmadağ, Çubuk and Beypazarı districts.

A number of the global [[automotive industry|automotive companies]] have production facilities in Ankara, such as the German bus and truck manufacturer [[MAN AG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.man.com.tr/ MAN Türkiye]&lt;/ref&gt; Ankara is also the center of the state-owned and private Turkish [[Arms industry|defence]] and [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]] companies, where the industrial plants and headquarters of the [[Turkish Aerospace Industries|TAI]], [[Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (Turkey)|MKE]], [[ASELSAN|Aselsan]], [[Havelsan]], [[Roketsan]], FNSS,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnss.com.tr/ FNSS]&lt;/ref&gt; Nurol,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nurolmakina.com.tr/ Nurol]&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other firms are located. Exports to foreign countries from these defence firms have steadily increased in the past decades. The [[International Defence Industry Fair|IDEF]] in Ankara is one of the largest international expositions of the global [[arms industry]].

A large percentage of the employment in Ankara is provided by the state institutions; such as the [[ministry (government department)|ministries]], undersecretariats, and other administrative bodies of the Turkish [[government]]. There are also many foreign citizens working as [[diplomat]]s or clerks in the [[embassy|embassies]] of their respective countries.

==Climate==
Ankara has a [[continental climate]], with cold, snowy winters due to its elevation and inland location, and hot, dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn. Under [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's climate classification]], Ankara features a [[semi-arid climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Demographics==
[[File:KC Göksu AVM.jpg|thumb|The planned [[residential apartment]] [[tower block]]s are a typical feature of Ankara and of all Turkish cities and towns in general.]] 
[[File:Dikmen Valley Ankara Turkey.jpg|thumb|Dikmen Valley in central Ankara.]]

Central Ankara has a population of 3,763,591 (2007) of which 1,870,831 are men and 1,892,760 are women. The metropolitan municipality, containing the central part of the city and the surrounding 8 districts under its jurisdiction, had a total population of 3,901,201 the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey pop 2007&quot; /&gt;

When Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because [[unemployment]] and [[poverty]] forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called [[gecekondu]] were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.

Nevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of [[tower block]]s such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[Güzelkent, Etimesgut|Güzelkent]]; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find.

====Ankara Citadel====
[[File:Ankara Castle walls.JPG|right|thumb|Ankara Citadel walls.]]
[[File:MonumentumAncyranum28Nov2004.jpg|thumb|In the ''Temple of Augustus and Rome'' (commonly known as [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]) in Ulus, the primary intact copy of [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]] written by the first Roman Emperor [[Augustus]] survives.]]

The foundations of the citadel or castle were laid by the Galatians on a prominent [[lava]] outcrop ({{Coord|39.941|N|32.864|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}), and the rest was completed by the Romans. The Byzantines and Seljuqs further made restorations and additions. The area around and inside the citadel, being the oldest part of Ankara, contains many fine examples of traditional architecture. There are also recreational areas to relax. Many restored traditional Turkish houses inside the citadel area have found new life as restaurants, serving local cuisine.

The citadel was depicted in various Turkish banknotes during 1927–1952 and 1983–1989.&lt;ref&gt;The citadel was depicted in the following Turkish banknotes:
* On the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the 1 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927–1939 (1. Emission Group - One Turkish Lira - [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/6.htm I. Series]).
* On the obverse of the 5 lira banknote of 1927–1937 (1. Emission Group - Five Turkish Lira - [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/10.htm I. Series]).
* On the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the 10 lira banknote of 1927–1938 (1. Emission Group - Ten Turkish Lira - [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/14.htm I. Series]).
* On the reverse of the 10 lira banknote of 1938–1952 (2. Emission Group - Ten Turkish Lira - [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E2/52.htm I. Series]).
* On the reverse of the 100 lira banknotes of 1983–1989 (7. Emission Group - One Hundred Turkish Lira - [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E7/256.htm I. Series] &amp; [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E7/258.htm II. Series]).

====Roman Theatre====
The remains, the stage, and the backstage can be seen outside the castle. Roman statues that were found here are exhibited in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] (see above). The seating area is still under excavation.

====Temple of Augustus and Rome====
The temple, also known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], was built between 25&amp;nbsp;BC - 20&amp;nbsp;BC following the conquest of Central Anatolia by the [[Roman Empire]] and the formation of the Roman province of [[Galatia]], with Ancyra (modern Ankara) as its administrative capital. After the death of Augustus in 14 AD, a copy of the text of [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]] was inscribed on the interior of the ''pronaos'' in Latin, whereas a Greek translation is also present on an exterior wall of the ''cella''. The temple, on the ancient Acropolis of Ancyra, was enlarged by the Romans in the 2nd century. In the 5th century it was converted into a church by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. It is located in the Ulus quarter of the city.

====Roman Bath====
This bath has all the typical features of a classical [[Thermae|Roman bath]]: a ''frigidarium'' (cold room), ''tepidarium'' (warm room) and ''caldarium'' (hot room). The bath was built during the reign of Emperor [[Caracalla]] in the 3rd century AD to honour [[Asclepius|Asclepios]], the God of Medicine. Today, only the basement and first floors remain. It is situated in the Ulus quarter.

====Column of Julian====
The Column of Julian or Julianus, now in the Ulus district, was erected in honor of the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra in 362.

===Mosques===
[[File:KocatepeMosque.jpg|thumb|upright|Kocatepe Mosque (1989).]]
* The Alaaddin Mosque. It has a carved walnut mimber, the inscription on which records that the mosque was built in the 12th century by the Seljuq ruler, Mesut.
* Ahi Elvan Mosque, founded in the Ulus quarter near the Ankara Citadel and was constructed during the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The finely carved walnut mimber (pulpit) is of particular interest.
* Hacı Bayram Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SonTech Yazılım |url=http://www.HaciBayramiVeli.com |title=: Hacı Bayram-ı Veli :. hacıbayramveli, hacı bayramveli, haci bayrami veli, hacıbayram, nasihatleri, hacı bayram cami, hayatı, hacıbayram-ı veli |publisher=Hacibayramiveli.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mosque, in the Ulus quarter next to the [[Monumentum Ancyranum|Temple of Augustus]], was built in the early 15th century in [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] style by an unknown architect. It was subsequently restored by architect [[Mimar Sinan]] in the 16th century, with [[Kütahya]] tiles being added in the 18th century. The mosque was built in honor of Hacı Bayram Veli, whose tomb is next to the mosque, two years before his death (1427–28). The usable space inside this mosque is {{convert|437|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} on the first floor and {{convert|263|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} on the second floor.
*Yeni (Cenab Ahmet) Mosque. It is the largest Ottoman mosque in Ankara and was built by the famous architect Sinan in the 16th century. The mimber (pulpit) and mihrap (prayer niche) are of white marble, and the mosque itself is of Ankara stone (red porphyry), an example of very fine workmanship. Yeni Cami is on Ulucanlar Avenue.
* [[Kocatepe Mosque]], the largest  mosque in the city. Located in the Kocatepe quarter, it was constructed between 1967 and 1987 in classical Ottoman style with four minarets. Its size and prominent location have made it a landmark for the city.

===Parks===
[[File:Goksu Park Ankara.jpg|thumb|left|Göksu Park in Eryaman.]]
[[File:Ankara Park Gençlik.jpg|thumb|Gençlik Park (Youth Park) in central Ankara.]]

[[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] (''Atatürk Orman Çiftliği'') is an expansive recreational farming area which houses a [[zoo]], several small agricultural farms, [[greenhouse]]s, restaurants, a [[dairy farming|dairy farm]] and a [[brewery]]. It is a pleasant place to spend a day with family, be it for having picnics, hiking, biking or simply enjoying good food and nature. There is also an exact replica of the house where Atatürk was born in 1881, in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]]. Visitors to the &quot;Çiftlik&quot; (farm) as it is affectionately called by Ankarans, can sample such famous products of the farm such as old-fashioned beer and [[ice cream]], fresh [[dairy product]]s and meat rolls/kebaps made on charcoal, at a traditional restaurant (''Merkez Lokantası'', Central Restaurant), cafés and other establishments scattered around the farm.

===Shopping===
[[File:Karum Inside.HB.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior view of Karum Shopping &amp; Business Center (1990).]]
[[File:Armada Mall Ankara Turkey.jpg|thumb|left|Armada Shopping Center in Ankara was selected as &quot;Europe's Best Shopping Mall&quot; by the [[International Council of Shopping Centers|ICSC]] in 2003, becoming the second mall in Turkey after [[Akmerkez]] in [[Istanbul]] (Europe's Best 1995, World's Best 1996) to win this prestigious award.]]

Foreign visitors to Ankara usually like to visit the old shops in ''Çıkrıkçılar Yokuşu'' (Weavers' Road) near Ulus, where myriad things ranging from traditional fabrics, hand-woven carpets and leather products can be found at bargain prices. ''Bakırcılar Çarşısı'' (Bazaar of Coppersmiths) is particularly popular, and many interesting items, not just of copper, can be found here like jewelry, carpets, costumes, antiques and embroidery. Up the hill to the castle gate, there are many shops selling a huge and fresh collection of spices, [[dried fruit]]s, nuts, and other produce.

Modern shopping areas are mostly found in Kızılay, or on Tunalı Hilmi Avenue, including the modern mall of Karum (named after the [[Kültepe|ancient Assyrian merchant colonies (Karum)]] that were established in central Anatolia at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC) which is located towards the end of the Avenue; and in the [[Atakule Tower]] at Çankaya, the quarter with the highest elevation in the city, which commands a magnificent view over the whole city and also has a [[revolving restaurant]] at the top where the complete panorama can be enjoyed in a more leisurely fashion. The symbol of the Armada Shopping Mall is an [[anchor]], and there's a large anchor monument at its entrance, as a reference to the ancient Greek name of the city, Ἄγκυρα (Ánkyra), which means anchor. Likewise, the anchor is also related with the Spanish name of the mall, [[Wiktionary|Armada]], which means [[naval fleet]].

As Ankara started expanding westward in the 1970s, several modern, suburbia-style developments and mini-cities began to rise along the western highway, also known as the [[Eskişehir]] Road. The ''Armada'' and ''CEPA'' malls on the highway, the ''Galleria'' in Ümitköy, and a huge mall, ''Real'' in Bilkent Center, offer North American and European style shopping opportunities (these places can be reached through the Eskişehir Highway.) There is also the newly expanded ''Ankamall'' at the outskirts, on the Istanbul Highway, which houses most of the well-known international brands. This mall is the largest throughout the Ankara region.

==Fauna==
===Angora cat===
{{Main|Turkish Angora}}
[[File:Tua-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Angora cat]]

Ankara is home to a world famous cat breed — the [[Turkish Angora]], called ''Ankara kedisi'' (Ankara cat) in Turkish. It is a [[cat breed|breed]] of domestic [[cat]]. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally-occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

They mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and [[Persian (cat)|Persians]], and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the [[Turkish Van]]. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in [[tabby cat|tabby]] and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.)

Eyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The W gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and [[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.

Ears are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back.

===Angora rabbit===
{{Main|Angora rabbit}}

[[File:Joey Giant Angora Buck.jpg|thumb|upright|Angora rabbit]]

The [[Angora rabbit]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara tavşanı}}) is a variety of domestic [[rabbit]] bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]] and [[Angora goat]]. The rabbits were popular pets with [[France|French]] royalty in the mid 18th century, and spread to other parts of [[Europe]] by the end of the century. They first appeared in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long [[Angora wool]], which may be removed by [[sheep shearing|shear]]ing, combing, or [[plucking (hair removal)|pluck]]ing (gently pulling loose wool.)

Angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft. They have a humorous appearance, as they oddly resemble a fur ball. Most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition called &quot;wool block&quot; is common in Angora rabbits and should be treated quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |title=Angora Rabbit Breeds - How to Care for Your Angora Rabbit|accessdate=2009-01-29 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat.

===Angora goat===
{{Main|Angora goat}}

[[File:Quebec angora goat.jpg|thumb|upright|Angora goat]]

The [[Angora goat]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara keçisi}}) is a breed of [[goat|domestic goat]] that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

This breed was first mentioned in the time of [[Moses]], roughly in 1500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |title=Angora Goats history |publisher=Daisyshillfarm.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton.

The [[Pile (textile)|fleece]] taken from an Angora goat is called [[mohair]]. A single goat produces between five and eight [[kilogram]]s of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], which are shorn only once. Angoras have high [[nutrition]]al requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The [[United States]], [[Turkey]], and [[South Africa]] are the top producers of mohair.

For a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber.

Angora goats were depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1938–1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey].

'''Arabic''' ({{lang|ar|العربية}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-ʿarabiyyah}}'', {{IPA-ar|æl ʕɑrɑˈbijjɐ|IPA}}, or {{lang|ar|عربي}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿarabī}}'', {{IPA-ar|ˈʕɑrɑbiː|}}) is a name applied to a group of [[languages]] and/or [[dialects]] of [[Central Semitic languages|Central Semitic]], thus related to and classified alongside other [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and the [[Neo-Aramaic languages]]. [[Varieties of Arabic|Spoken Arabic varieties]] have more speakers than any other group in the Semitic language family. They are spoken by more than 230 million&lt;ref name=Proch /&gt; people as a [[first language]], most of whom live in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. [[Literary Arabic]] is the official language of 26 states, and the liturgical language of Islam since it is the language of the [[Qur'an]], the [[Islam]]ic Holy Book. Arabic has many different, geographically distributed [[spoken language|spoken]] varieties, some of which are [[mutual intelligibility|mutually unintelligible]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arabic language.&quot; ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''. 2009. Encyclopaedia Britannica Online. Retrieved on 29 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Standard Arabic (also called ''Literary Arabic'') is widely taught in schools, universities, and used in workplaces, government and the media.

Modern Standard Arabic derives from [[Classical Arabic]], the only surviving member of the [[Old North Arabian]] dialect group, attested in [[Pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] dating back to the 4th century.&lt;ref name=keesp33&gt;Versteegh, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Arabic has also been a [[literary language]] and the [[liturgical language]] of [[Islam]] since its inception in the 7th century.

Arabic has lent many words to other languages of the [[Islamic]] world, like [[Malay language|Malay/Indonesian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Urdu]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], literary Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy. As a result, many European languages have also borrowed many words from it. Arabic influence is seen in [[Mediterranean]] languages, particularly [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language|Spanish]], [[List of Portuguese words of Arabic origin|Portuguese]], and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], owing to both the proximity of European and Arab civilizations and 700 years of Arab rule in some parts of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (see [[Al-Andalus]]).

Arabic has also borrowed words from many languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Syriac]] in early centuries, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in medieval times and contemporary European languages in modern times. Arabic is written with the [[Arabic alphabet]], which is an [[abjad]] script, and is written from [[right-to-left]].

== Classical, Modern Standard, and spoken Arabic ==
''Arabic'' usually designates one of three main variants: [[Classical Arabic]]; [[Modern Standard Arabic]]; [[Varieties of Arabic|''colloquial'' or ''dialectal'' Arabic]].

[[Classical Arabic]] (فصحى ''fuṣḥā'') is the language found in the [[Qur'an]] and used from the period of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] to that of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Classical Arabic is considered normative; modern authors attempt to follow the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as [[Sibawayh]]), and use the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the Lisān al-Arab).

Based on Classical Arabic, [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (فصحى ''fuṣḥā'') is the [[literary language]] used in most current, printed Arabic publications, spoken by the Arabic media across [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], and understood by most educated Arabic speakers. &quot;Literary Arabic&quot; and &quot;Standard Arabic&quot; are less strictly defined terms that may refer to Modern Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic.

According to Islamic scholars, Modern Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic adopted several new Arabic style, words and linguistic tools from the Quran which uses Arabic as the medium of prophetic language.

[[Varieties of Arabic|''Colloquial'' or ''dialectal'' Arabic]] refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language. Colloquial Arabic has many different regional variants; these sometimes differ enough to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually unintelligible]] and some linguists consider them distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arabic Language.&quot; Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009. Retrieved on 29 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The varieties are typically unwritten. They are often used in informal spoken media, such as [[soap opera]]s and [[talk show]]s,&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{Citation |url= http://strategyleader.org/articles/arabicpercent.html |title= Population Analysis of the Arabic Languages |author= Orville Boyd Jenkins |date= 18 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media, such as poetry and printed advertising. The only variety of modern Arabic to have acquired official language status is [[Maltese language|Maltese]], spoken in (predominately [[Roman Catholic]]) [[Malta]] and written with the [[Latin alphabet]]. It is descended from [[Classical Arabic]] through [[Siculo-Arabic]] and is not mutually intelligible with other varieties of Arabic. Most linguists list it as a separate language rather than as a dialect of Arabic. Historically, [[Algerian Arabic]] was taught in [[French Algeria]] under the name ''[[darija]]''.
[[File:Flag of the Arab League.svg|thumb|left|upright|Flag of the [[Arab league]], used in some cases for the Arabic Language.]]
[[Image:Arabic-Language-Flag.svg|thumb|left|upright|Flag used in some cases for the Arabic Language]]

Like other languages, Modern Standard Arabic continues to evolve.&lt;ref name=Kaye&gt;Kaye, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern terms have entered into common usage, in some cases taken from other languages (for example, فيلم ''film'') or coined from existing lexical resources (for example, هاتف ''hātif'' &quot;telephone&quot; &lt; &quot;caller&quot;). Structural influence from foreign languages or from the colloquial varieties has also affected Modern Standard Arabic. For example, texts in Modern Standard Arabic sometimes use the format &quot;A, B, C, and D&quot; when listing things, whereas Classical Arabic prefers &quot;A and B and C and D&quot;,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} and subject-initial sentences may be more common in Modern Standard Arabic than in Classical Arabic.&lt;ref name=Kaye/&gt; For these reasons, Modern Standard Arabic is generally treated separately in non-Arab sources.

==Language vs. dialect==
The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]], which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language, usually in different social situations. In the case of Arabic, educated Arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their local dialect and their school-taught Standard Arabic. When educated Arabs of different dialects engage in conversation (for example, a Moroccan speaking with a Lebanese), many speakers [[Code-switching|code-switch]] back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. Arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or film.

The issue of whether Arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged, similar to the issue with [[Chinese languages|Chinese]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]] vs. [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] vs. [[Croatian language|Croatian]], etc.  The issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor: A single written form, significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively, unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms.  For political reasons, Arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language, despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions.

From a linguistic standpoint, it is often said that the various spoken varieties of Arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the [[Romance languages]].  This is an apt comparison in a number of ways.  The period of divergence from a single spoken form is similar—perhaps 1500 years for Arabic, 2000 years for the Romance languages.  Also, a linguistically innovative variety such as [[Moroccan Arabic]] is essentially incomprehensible to all non-Moroccans other than Algerians and Tunisians, much as [[French language|French]] is incomprehensible to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Italian language|Italian]] speakers.  However, there is some mutual comprehensibility between conservative varieties of Arabic even across significant geographical distances.  This suggests that the spoken varieties, at least, should linguistically be considered separate languages.

On the other hand, a significant difference between Arabic and the Romance languages is that the latter also correspond to a number of different standard written varieties, each of which separately informs the related spoken varieties, while all spoken Arabic varieties share a single written language.  Indeed, a similar situation exists with the Romance languages in the case of [[Italian language|Italian]].  As spoken varieties, [[Milanese language|Milanese]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] (among others) are different enough to be largely mutually incomprehensible, yet since they share a single written form (Standard Italian), they are often said by Italians to be dialects of the same language.  As in many similar cases, the extent to which the Italian varieties are locally considered dialects or separate languages depends to a large extent on political factors, which can change over time.  Linguists are divided over whether and to what extent to incorporate such considerations when judging issues of language and dialect.

== Influence of Arabic on other languages ==
{{Main|Influence of Arabic on other languages}}

The influence of Arabic has been most important in Islamic countries. Arabic is an important source of vocabulary for languages such as [[Baluchi language|Baluchi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Urdu]] as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken. For example, the Arabic word for ''book'' ({{lang|ar|كتاب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kitāb}}'') has been borrowed in all the languages listed, with the exception of Spanish, Italian, Catalan and Portuguese which use the Latin-derived words &quot;libro&quot;, &quot;llibre&quot; and &quot;livro&quot;, respectively, Tagalog which uses &quot;aklat&quot;, Hebrew which uses &quot;sefer&quot;, Gujarati which uses &quot;chopdi&quot; and Bengali which uses &quot;boi&quot;.

In addition, [[English language|English]] has many Arabic loan words, some directly but most through the medium of other Mediterranean languages. Examples of such words include admiral, adobe, alchemy, alcohol, algebra, algorithm, alkaline, almanac, amber, arsenal, assassin, banana, candy, carat, cipher, coffee, cotton, hazard, jar, jasmine, lemon, loofah, magazine, mattress, sherbet, sofa, sugar, sumac, tariff and many other words. Other languages such as [[Maltese language|Maltese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050379/Maltese-language |title=Maltese language – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kinubi]] derive from Arabic, rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammar rules.

The terms borrowed range from religious terminology (like Berber {{Unicode|''taẓallit''}} &quot;prayer&quot; &lt; [[salat]]) ({{lang|ar|صلاة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣalāt}}''), academic terms (like [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] ''mentiq'' &quot;logic&quot;), economic items (like English ''sugar'') to [[placeholder]]s (like Spanish ''fulano'' &quot;so-and-so&quot;) and everyday conjunctions (like Hindustani ''lekin'' &quot;but&quot;, or Spanish ''hasta'' &quot;until&quot;). Most Berber varieties (such as [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]), along with Swahili, borrow some numbers from Arabic. Most Islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from Arabic, such as ''salat'' 'prayer' and ''imam'' 'prayer leader.' In languages not directly in contact with the Arab world, Arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from Arabic.

For example, most Arabic loanwords in Hindustani entered through Persian, and many older Arabic loanwords in [[Hausa language|Hausa]] were borrowed from [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]].
Some words in [[English language|English]] and other European languages are derived from Arabic, often through other European languages, especially [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Among them are commonly used words like &quot;[[sugar]]&quot; (''sukkar''), &quot;[[cotton]]&quot; (''{{unicode|quṭn}}'') and &quot;magazine&quot; (''[[makhzen|{{transl|ar|DIN|maḫāzin}}]]''). English words more recognizably of Arabic origin include &quot;[[algebra]]&quot;, &quot;[[alcohol]]&quot;, &quot;[[alchemy]]&quot;, &quot;[[alkali]]&quot;, &quot;[[zenith]]&quot; and &quot;[[nadir]]&quot;. Some words in common use, such as &quot;intention&quot; and &quot;information&quot;, were originally [[calque]]s of Arabic philosophical terms.
{{See also|list of Arabic loanwords in English}}

Arabic words also made their way into several West African languages as Islam spread across the Sahara. Variants of Arabic words such as ''kitaab'' (book) have spread to the languages of African groups who had no direct contact with Arab traders.&lt;ref name=Gregp237&gt;Gregersen, 1977, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic was influenced by other languages as well. The most important sources of borrowings into (pre-Islamic) Arabic are [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], which used to be the principal, international language of communication throughout the ancient Near and Middle East, [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], and to a lesser degree Hebrew (mainly religious concepts).

As Arabic occupied a position similar to Latin (in Europe) throughout the Islamic world many of the Arabic concepts in the field of science, philosophy, commerce etc., were often coined by non-native Arabic speakers, notably by Aramaic and Persian translators. This process of using Arabic roots, notably in Turkish and Persian, to translate foreign concepts continued right until the 18th and 19th century, when large swaths of Arab-inhabited lands were under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.

== Arabic and Islam ==
[[Classical Arabic]] is the language of the [[Qur'an]]. Arabic is closely associated with the religion of [[Islam]] because the Quran is written in the language, which is nevertheless also spoken by [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Arab Christians]], [[Mizrahi Jews]] and Iraqi [[Mandaean]]s. Most of the world's [[Muslims]] do not speak Arabic as their native language but many can read the Quranic script and recite the Qur'an. Among Non-Arab Muslims, translations of the Qur'an are most often accompanied by the original text.

Some Muslims present a [[Proto-Human language|monogenesis]] of languages and claim that the Arabic language was the language revealed by God for the benefit of mankind and the original language as a prototype symbolic system of communication (based primarily upon its system of [[Semitic root|triconsonantal roots]] ) spoken by man from which all other languages were derived, having first been corrupted.&lt;ref name=&quot;meforum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/276|title=Does the Arabic Language Encourage Radical Islam?|accessdate=5 December 2008|author=James Coffman|publisher=Middle East Quarterly|date=December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/arabic/ |title=Arabic - the mother of all languages - Al Islam Online |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements spread in later centuries regarding the Arabic language being the language of Paradise are not considered authentic according to the scholars of [[Hadith]] and are widely discredited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam Q&amp;A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamqa.com/ar/ref/83262|title=Is the Arabic Language the Language of Paradise (هل اللغة العربية هي لغة أهل الجنة)|date= |accessdate=2 August 2010|author=Muhammad Saleh al-Munajjid|publisher=islamqa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Semitic languages.svg|thumb|300px|Arabic languages (''brown'') within Semitic languages.]]
The earliest surviving texts in [[proto-language|Proto]]-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], are the [[Al-Hasa|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, from the 8th century BC, written not in the modern Arabic alphabet, nor in its [[Nabataean]] ancestor, but in variants of the [[epigraphic]] South Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]''. These are followed by 6th-century BC [[Lihyanite]] texts from southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout Arabia and the [[Sinai]], and not actually connected with [[Thamud]]. Later come the [[Safaitic]] inscriptions beginning in the 1st century BC, and the many Arabic personal names attested in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions (which are, however, written in Aramaic). From about the 2nd century BC, a few inscriptions from [[Ancient Towns in Saudi Arabia#Qaryat al-Fāw:(قرية الفاو )|Qaryat al-Fāw]] (near [[Sulayyil]]) reveal a dialect which is no longer considered &quot;Proto-Arabic&quot;, but Pre-Classical Arabic.
By the fourth century AD, the Arab kingdoms of the [[Lakhmids]] in southern [[Iraq]], the [[Ghassanids]] in southern [[Syria]] the [[Kindite]] Kingdom emerged in Central Arabia. Their courts were responsible for some notable examples of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, and for some of the few surviving [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] in the Arabic alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/arabic.html |title=A History of the Arabic Language |publisher=Linguistics.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects and descendants ==
{{Main|Varieties of Arabic}}
''Colloquial Arabic'' is a collective term for the spoken varieties of Arabic used throughout the [[Arab world]], which differ radically from the [[literary language]]. The main dialectal division is between the [[Maghrebi Arabic|North African dialects]] and those of the Middle East, followed by that between [[Varieties of Arabic#Sedentary vs. Bedouin|sedentary]] dialects and the much more conservative [[Bedouin]] dialects. Speakers of some of these dialects are unable to converse with speakers of another dialect of Arabic. In particular, while Middle Easterners can generally understand one another, they often have trouble understanding North Africans (although the converse is not true, in part due to the popularity of Middle Eastern—especially Egyptian—films and other media).

One factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas, which have typically provided a significant number of new words, and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order; however, a much more significant factor for most dialects is, as among [[Romance languages]], retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi ''aku'', Levantine ''fīh'', and North African ''kayən'' all mean &quot;there is&quot;, and all come from Classical Arabic forms (''yakūn'', ''fīhi'', ''kā'in'' respectively), but now sound very different.

[[File:Arab World-Large.PNG|thumb|300px|Different Dialects of Arabic in the Arab World]]

The major dialect groups are:

=== Egyptian Arabic ===
* [[Egyptian Arabic]], spoken by around 80 million in [[Egypt]]. It is one of the most understood varieties of Arabic, due in large part to the widespread distribution of Egyptian films and television shows throughout the Arabic speaking world. Closely related varieties are also spoken in [[Sudan]].

=== Maghrebi Arabic ===
* [[Maghrebi Arabic]] includes [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Algerian Arabic]], [[Saharan Arabic]], [[Tunisian Arabic]], and [[Libyan Arabic]], and is spoken by around 75 million North Africans in [[Morocco]], ''[[Western Sahara]]'', [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Niger]], and western [[Egypt]]; it is often difficult for speakers of Middle Eastern Arabic varieties to understand. The Berber influence in these dialects varies in degree.&lt;ref name=multiple&gt;Kaplan and Baldauf, 2007, p. 48. See also Bateson, 2003, pp. 96–103 and [http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0195/9501031b.htm Berber: Linguistic &quot;Substratum&quot; of North African Arabic] by Ernest N. McCarus.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mesopotamian Arabic ===
* [[Iraqi Arabic]], spoken by about 29 million people in [[Iraq]], eastern [[Syria]] and western [[Iran]].
* [[North Mesopotamian Arabic]], spoken by around 7 million people in northern Iraq, northern Syria, northern Iran and southern Turkey.

=== Levantine Arabic ===
* [[Levantine Arabic]] includes [[North Levantine Arabic]], [[South Levantine Arabic]], and [[Cypriot Arabic]]. It is spoken by almost 35 million people in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], The [[Palestinian territories]], [[Israel]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Turkey]].

=== Gulf Arabic===
* [[Gulf Arabic]] (Khaliji Arabic), spoken by around 4 million people&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=afb Speaker numbers for Gulf Arabic]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Sultanate of Oman]], [[Yemen]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=afb Countries where spoken]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
Other varieties include:
* [[Yemeni Arabic]], spoken in [[Yemen]], southern Saudi Arabia, [[Djibouti]], and [[Somalia]].
* [[Sudanese Arabic]] (19 million speakers), spoken in [[Sudan]]
* [[Najdi Arabic]] (9.9 million speakers), spoken in Nejd, central Saudi Arabia
* [[Hejazi Arabic]] (6 million speakers), spoken in Hejaz, western Saudi Arabia and Eritrea
* [[Hassaniya Arabic]] (2,8 million speakers), spoken in [[Mauritania]], some parts of [[Mali]] and ''[[Western Sahara]]''
* [[Bahrani Arabic]] (310,000 speakers), spoken by [[Bahrani people|Bahrani Shia]] in [[Bahrain]], where it exhibits some differences from [[Bahraini Arabic]].  It is also spoken to a lesser extent in [[Oman]].
* [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] dialects
* [[Central Asian Arabic]], spoken in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], is highly endangered
* [[Maltese language|Maltese]], spoken on the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]], is the only one to have established itself as a fully separate language, with independent literary norms. In the course of its history the language has adopted numerous loanwords, phonetic and phonological features, and even some grammatical patterns, from [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], and [[English language|English]]. It is also the only Semitic tongue written in the [[Latin alphabet]].
* [[Andalusi Arabic]], spoken in [[Spain]] until 15th century, now extinct.
* [[Siculo Arabic]], spoken on [[Sicily]], South [[Italy]] until 14th century, developed into Maltese language.
* The Muslim [[Hui people]] in China had knowledge of archaic forms of Arabic. The Hui of Yunnan (Burmaese called them Panthays) were reported to be fluent in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K28oAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=arabic#v=snippet&amp;q=many%20of%20them%20are%20able%20to%20converse%20arabic&amp;f=false|title=Burma past and present|author=Albert Fytche|year=1878|publisher=C.

== Sounds ==
{{Main|Arabic phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}
The [[phonemes]] below reflect the pronunciation of Modern Standard Arabic. There are minor variations from country to country.  Additionally, these dialects can vary from region to region within a country.

=== Vowels ===
Modern Standard Arabic has three vowels, with long and short forms of {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. There are also two [[diphthongs]]: {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}}.

; ''The rest of the sub-section focuses more on Northwest African pronunciation.''
These phonemes have some varieties: {{IPA|/a/}} can be presented as {{IPA|[ɑ, ä, a, æ, ɐ, ɛ, e]}} - the last two are named ''[[Imāla|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾimālah}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|إمالة}}); ''{{transl|ar|DIN|tarqīq}}'' ({{lang|ar|ترقيق}}); {{IPA|/u/}} can be read as {{IPAblink|u}} and {{IPAblink|o}} - ''{{transl|ar|DIN|tafḫīm}}'' ({{lang|ar|تفخيم}}); {{IPA|/i/}} can be presented as {{IPAblink|i}} and {{IPAblink|ɨ}} - ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾišmām}}'' ({{lang|ar|إشمام}}). {{IPAblink|e}} or {{IPAblink|ɛ}} mainly occur after non-emphatic consonants, {{IPAblink|o}} and {{IPAblink|ɨ}} are likely to be read after emphatic consonants, as well as after ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥ}}'' ({{lang|ar|ح}}) &lt;big&gt;''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}&lt;/big&gt;'' ({{lang|ar|ع}}) ''{{transl|ar|DIN|q}}'' ({{lang|ar|ق}}) ''{{transl|ar|DIN|w}}'' ({{lang|ar|و}}) and sometimes after ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḫ}}'' ({{lang|ar|خ}}) and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ġ}}'' ({{lang|ar|غ}}), especially if vowels are short.

Note: 1. The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾišmām}}'' varies from {{IPAblink|ɪ}} to {{IPAblink|ɨ}} depending on the length of vowel and dialect;
2. The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḍammah}}'' can be optionally pronounced as ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾšmām}}'' in situation when the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kasrah}}'' after the next letter is omitted. E.g.: &lt;big&gt;{{lang|ar|رُدِدَ}}&lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|[rudida]}} → &lt;big&gt; {{lang|ar| رِدَّ }} &lt;/big&gt; {{IPA|[rɪdda]}} - ''he was turned back''.

There are also two [[diphthongs]]: {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}}. Some linguists think that the combination {{IPA|/wa/}} can also be considered as a diphthong.

Note: 1.{{IPA|/aj/}} can be pronounced as {{IPA|[ej]}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} - like {{IPA|[ow]}} or {{IPA|[aw]}};
2. The first element of diphthongs ({{IPA|/a/}}) can be semi-long.

See [[Arabic alphabet]] for explanations on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phonetic symbols found in this chart.

# {{IPA|/dʒ/}} ({{lang|ar|ج}}), of the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Arabian Peninsula]], is pronounced {{IPAblink|ɡ}} by some speakers. This is especially characteristic of the Egyptian, Omani and some Yemeni standard pronunciations&lt;!--not only local dialects, but also literary standarad--&gt;. In many parts of North Africa and in the [[Levant]], it is pronounced {{IPAblink|ʒ}}.
# {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[lˤ]}} only in {{IPA|/ʔallaːh/}}, the name of God, q.e. [[Allah]], when the word follows ''a'', ''ā'', ''u'' or ''ū'' (after ''i'' or ''ī'' it is unvelarized: ''bismi l–lāh'' {{IPA|/bismillaːh/}}). But in some dialects (especially in bedouin Arabic) {{IPA|/l/}} is also pronounced as velarized before as named emphatic consonants. E.g.: {{lang|ar|سلطان}} {{IPA|/sulˤtˤaːn/}}.
# {{IPA|/θ/}} ({{lang|ar|ث}}) can be pronounced as {{IPAblink|t}} or even {{IPAblink|s}}. In some places of [[Maghreb]] it can be also pronounced as {{IPAblink|t͡s}}.
# In many varieties, {{IPA|/ħ, ʕ/}} ({{lang|ar|ح,&amp;lrm; ع}}) are actually [[epiglottal consonant|epiglottal]] {{IPA|[ʜ, ʢ]}} (despite what is reported in many earlier works).
# {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} ({{lang|ar|خ,&amp;lrm; غ}}) are often post-velar though velar and uvular pronunciations are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic has consonants traditionally termed &quot;emphatic&quot; {{IPA|/tˤ, dˤ, sˤ, ðˤ/}} ({{lang|ar|ط,&amp;lrm; ض,&amp;lrm; ص,&amp;lrm; ظ}}), which exhibit simultaneous [[pharyngealization]] {{IPA|[tˤ, dˤ, sˤ, ðˤ]}} as well as varying degrees of [[velarization]] {{IPA|[tˠ, dˠ, sˠ, ðˠ]}}, so they may be written with the &quot;Velarized or pharyngealized&quot; diacritic (&lt;big&gt;{{IPA|&amp;nbsp;̴&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/big&gt;) as: {{IPA|/t̴, d̴, s̴, ð̴/}}. This simultaneous articulation is described as &quot;Retracted Tongue Root&quot; by phonologists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Thelwall|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some transcription systems, emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter, for example, {{IPA|/dˤ/}} is written ‹D›; in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it, for example, ‹{{transl|ar|DIN|ḍ}}›.

Vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long. Long ([[gemination|geminate]]) consonants are normally written doubled in Latin transcription (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflecting the presence of the [[Arabic diacritics|Arabic diacritic]] mark ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šaddah}}'', which indicates doubled consonants. In actual pronunciation, doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants. This consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive: ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qabala}}'' &quot;he accepted&quot; vs. ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qabbala}}'' &quot;he kissed.&quot;

=== Syllable structure ===
Arabic has two kinds of syllables: open syllables (CV) and (CVV)—and closed syllables (CVC), (CVVC), and (CVCC), the latter two occurring only at the end of the sentence. Every syllable begins with a consonant. Syllables cannot begin with a vowel. Arabic phonology recognizes the glottal stop as an independent consonant, so in cases where a word begins with a vowel sound, as the definite article &quot;al&quot;, for example, the word is recognized in Arabic as beginning with the consonant {{IPA|[ʔ]}} (glottal stop).  When a word ends in a vowel and the following word begins with a glottal stop, then the glottal stop and the initial vowel of the word are in some cases elided, and the following consonant closes the final syllable of the preceding word, for example, ''baytu al-mudi:r'' &quot;house (of) the director,&quot; which becomes {{IPA|[bajtulmudiːr]}}.

=== Stress ===
Word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic. It bears a strong relationship to vowel length&lt;!--, though phonemic, and syllable shape, and correct word stress aids intelligibility --&gt;. The basic rules are:
* Only one of the last three syllables may be stressed.
* Given this restriction, the last &quot;superheavy&quot; syllable (containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant) is stressed.
* If there is no such syllable, the penultimate syllable is stressed if it is 'heavy.' Otherwise, the first allowable syllable is stressed.
* In Standard Arabic, a final long vowel may not be stressed. (This restriction does not apply to the spoken dialects, where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen.)

For example: ''ki-TAA-bun'' &quot;book&quot;, ''KAA-ti-bun'' &quot;writer&quot;, ''MAK-ta-bun'' &quot;desk&quot;, ''ma-KAA-ti-bu'' &quot;desks&quot;, ''mak-TA-ba-tun'' &quot;library&quot;, ''KA-ta-buu'' (Modern Standard Arabic) &quot;they wrote&quot; = ''KA-ta-bu'' (dialect), ''ka-ta-BUU-hu'' (Modern Standard Arabic) &quot;they wrote it&quot; = ''ka-ta-BUU'' (dialect), ''ka-TA-ba-taa'' (Modern Standard Arabic) &quot;they (dual, fem) wrote&quot;, ''ka-TAB-tu'' (Modern Standard Arabic) &quot;I wrote&quot; = ''ka-TABT'' (dialect).  Doubled consonants count as two consonants: ''ma-JAL-la'' &quot;magazine&quot;, ''ma-HALL'' &quot;place&quot;.

Some dialects have different stress rules. In the Cairo ([[Egyptian Arabic]]) dialect a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, hence ''mad-RA-sa'' &quot;school&quot;, ''qaa-HI-ra'' &quot;Cairo&quot;. This also affects the way that Modern Standard Arabic is pronounced in Egypt.  In the Arabic of [[Sana]], stress is often retracted: ''BAY-tayn'' &quot;two houses&quot;, ''MAA-sat-hum'' &quot;their table&quot;, ''ma-KAA-tiib'' &quot;desks&quot;, ''ZAA-rat-hiin'' &quot;sometimes&quot;, ''mad-RA-sat-hum'' &quot;their school&quot;. (In this dialect, only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy; in a two-syllable word, the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light; and in longer words, the final syllable cannot be stressed.)

=== Dialectal variations ===
: ''The section below only speaks about pronunciation''
{{See|Varieties of Arabic}}
In some dialects, there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above. For example, non-Arabic {{IPA|[v]}} is used in the Maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names. Semitic {{IPA|[p]}} became {{IPA|[f]}} extremely early on in Arabic before it was written down; a few modern Arabic dialects, such as Iraqi (influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish Language|Turkish]]) distinguish between {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}}. The Iraqi Arabic uses also sounds {{IPA|[g]}}, {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and uses Persian adding letters, e.g.: {{lang|fa|گوجة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|gawǧah}}'' - ''a plum''; {{lang|fa|چمة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|čimah}} - ''a truffle'' and so on.

Interdental fricatives ({{IPA|[θ]}} and {{IPA|[ð]}}) are rendered as stops {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} in some dialects (such as Egyptian, Levantine, and much of the Maghreb); some of these dialects render them as {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language. Early in the expansion of Arabic, the separate emphatic phonemes {{IPA|[dˤ]}} and {{IPA|[ðˤ]}} coallesced into a single phoneme, becoming one or the other. ''Predictably, dialects without interdental fricatives use {{IPA|[dˤ]}} exclusively, while dialects with such fricatives use {{IPA|[ðˤ]}}.'' Again, in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language, {{IPA|[ðˤ]}} is rendered as {{IPA|[zˤ]}} (in Egypt &amp; the Levant) or {{IPA|[dˤ]}} (in North Africa) in dialects without interdental fricatives.

Another key distinguishing mark of Arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular stops {{IPA|/q/}}, {{IPA|/dʒ/}} ([[Proto-Semitic]] {{IPA|/ɡ/}}), and {{IPA|/k/}}:
* {{lang|ar|ق}} {{IPA|/q/}} retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as Yemen, Morocco, and urban areas of the [[Maghreb]]. It is pronounced as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in several '''prestige dialects''', such as those spoken in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus. But it is rendered as a voiced velar stop {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in Gulf Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, Upper Egypt, much of the Maghreb, and less urban parts of the Levant (e.g. Jordan).  Some traditionally Christian villages in rural areas of the Levant render the sound as {{IPA|[k]}}, as do Shia Bahrainis.  In some Gulf dialects, it is palatalized to {{IPA|[dʒ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}. It is pronounced as a voiced uvular constrictive {{IPA|[ʁ]}} in Sudanese Arabic.  Many dialects with a modified pronunciation for {{IPA|/q/}} maintain the {{IPA|[q]}} pronunciation in certain words (often with religious or educational overtones) borrowed from the Classical language.
* {{lang|ar|ج}} {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} is pronounced as an affricate in Iraq and much of the Arabian Peninsula, but is pronounced {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in most of North Egypt and parts of Yemen and Oman, {{IPAblink|ʒ}} in Morocco, Tunisia and the Levant, and {{IPA|[j], [i̠]}} in most words in much of Gulf Arabic.
* {{lang|ar|ك}} {{IPA|/k/}} usually retains its original pronunciation, but is palatalized to {{IPA|[tʃ]}} in many words in [[Israel]] &amp; the [[Palestinian Territories]], Iraq and much of the Arabian Peninsula.  Often a distinction is made between the suffixes {{IPA|/-ak/}} (you, masc.) and {{IPA|/-ik/}} (you, fem.), which become {{IPA|[-ak]}} and {{IPA|[-itʃ]}}, respectively.  In Sana'a, Omani, and Bahrani {{IPA|/-ik/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[-iʃ]}}.

Compared with other [[Semitic]] language systems, Classical Arabic is distinguished by, &quot;its almost (too perfect) algebraic-looking grammar, i.e. root pattern and morphology.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hetzronp229&gt;Hetzron, 1997, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=RWhvl4hD7S4C&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=arabic+semitic+evolution&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=arabic%20semitic%20evolution&amp;f=false p. 229].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/khaledshaalan/publications/journal-papers/spe820.pdf?attredirects=0 Morphological Analysis of Arabic]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Peacock term|date=February 2011}} Nouns in Literary Arabic have three grammatical [[noun case|cases]] ([[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], and [[genitive case|genitive]] [also used when the noun is governed by a preposition]); three [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, dual and plural); two [[gender (grammar)|genders]] (masculine and feminine); and three &quot;states&quot; (indefinite, definite, and [[Status constructus|construct]]). The cases of singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) are indicated by [[suffix]]ed short vowels (/-u/ for nominative, /-a/ for accusative, /-i/ for genitive).

The feminine singular is often marked by /-at/, which is reduced to /-ah/ or /-a/ before a pause. Plural is indicated either through endings (the [[sound plural]]) or internal modification (the [[broken plural]]). Definite nouns include all proper nouns, all nouns in &quot;construct state&quot; and all nouns which are [[prefix]]ed by the definite article /al-/. Indefinite singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) add a final /-n/ to the case-marking vowels, giving /-un/, /-an/ or /-in/ (which is also referred to as [[nunation]] or [[tanwīn]]).

Verbs in Literary Arabic are marked for person (first, second, or third), gender, and number. They are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] in two major paradigms (termed [[perfective]] and [[imperfective]], or [[past]] and [[non-past]]); two [[grammatical voice|voices]] (active and passive); and five [[grammatical mood|moods]] in the imperfective ([[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive]], [[Irrealis mood#Jussive|jussive]] and [[energetic mood|energetic]]).  There are also two [[participle]]s (active and passive) and a [[verbal noun]], but no [[infinitive]]. As indicated by the differing terms for the two tense systems, there is some disagreement over whether the distinction between the two systems should be most accurately characterized as [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] or a combination of the two.

The [[perfective aspect]] is constructed using fused suffixes that combine person, number and gender in a single morpheme, while the [[imperfective]] aspect is constructed using a combination of [[prefix]]es (primarily encoding person) and [[suffix]]es (primarily encoding gender and number). The moods other than imperative are primarily marked by suffixes (/u/ for indicative, /a/ for subjunctive, no ending for jussive, /an/ for energetic). The imperative has the endings of the jussive but lacks any prefixes. The passive is marked through internal vowel changes. Plural forms for the verb are only used when the subject is not mentioned, or  precedes it, and the feminine singular is used for all non-human plurals.

[[Adjective]]s in Literary Arabic are marked for case, number, gender and state, as for nouns. However, the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective, which takes the /-ah/ or /-at/ suffix.

[[Pronoun]]s in Literary Arabic are marked for person, number and gender.  There are two varieties, independent pronouns and [[enclitic]]s.  Enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb, noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns.  The first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs (/-ni/) and for nouns or prepositions (/-ī/ after consonants, /-ya/ after vowels).

Nouns, verbs, pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects. However, non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular. Furthermore, a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun. Numerals between three and ten show &quot;chiasmic&quot; agreement, in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa.

The spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual (it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances). They have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative, but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes (most often /bi-/ for indicative vs. unmarked subjunctive). They have also mostly lost the indefinite &quot;nunation&quot; and the internal passive. Modern Standard Arabic maintains the grammatical distinctions of Literary Arabic except that the energetic mood is almost never used; in addition, Modern Standard Arabic sometimes drop the final short vowels that indicate case and mood.

As in many other Semitic languages, Arabic verb formation is based on a (usually) [[Triliteral|triconsonantal]] [[root (linguistics)|root]], which is not a word in itself but contains the semantic core. The consonants '''{{transl|ar|DIN|k-t-b}}''', for example, indicate ''write'', '''{{transl|ar|DIN|q-r-ʾ}}''' indicate ''read'', '''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾ-k-l}}''' indicate ''eat'', etc. Words are formed by supplying the root with a vowel structure and with affixes. (Traditionally, Arabic grammarians have used the root '''{{transl|ar|DIN|f-ʿ-l}}''', ''do'', as a template to discuss word formation.) With research scientists realized that the triconsonantal root consists of: 1) two beginning sounds - a rootcell and 2) the third sound which is a precision element. I.e.: the rootcell '''{{transl|ar|f-r}}''' has the meaning of ''scattering in space''. Then, '''{{transl|ar|f-r-g}}''' means ''cleaving'', '''{{transl|ar|f-r-d}}''' - ''making separate'', '''{{transl|ar|f-r-s}}''' - ''tearing to pieces''; the rootcell '''{{transl|ar|f-q}}''' means the main idea of ''absence'', so: '''{{transl|ar|f-q-d}}''' means ''loosing'', '''{{transl|ar|f-q-r}}''' means ''poverty'' and so on. Additionally, there are roots having four and even five consonants, which were developed from triconsonantal form and also roots with two consonants, which are likely to be broaden to triconsonantal standard using an additional letter in some situations: {{lang|ar|أب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾab}}'' - ''a father'' (root: '''{{transl|ar|ʾ-b}}'''); {{lang|ar|أبوان}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾabawān}}'' - ''parents'', literally - ''two fathers'' (root: '''{{transl|ar|ʾ-b-w}}''' with additional '''w''').

From any particular root, up to fifteen different verbs can be formed, each with its own template; these are referred to by Western scholars as &quot;form I&quot;, &quot;form II&quot;, and so on through &quot;form XV&quot;. These forms, and their associated participles and verbal nouns, are the primary means of forming vocabulary in Arabic. Forms XI to XV are incidental.

{{Main|Arabic alphabet}}
[[File:Learning Arabic calligraphy.jpg|thumb|An example of a text written in [[Arabic calligraphy]].]]
The Arabic alphabet derives from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] script through [[Nabatean alphabet|Nabatean]], to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] or [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]] to [[Greek alphabet|Greek script]]. Traditionally, there were several differences between the Western (North African) and Middle Eastern version of the alphabet—in particular, the ''fa'' had a dot underneath and ''qaf'' a single dot above in the [[Maghreb]], and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals).

However, the old Maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the Maghreb itself, and remains in use mainly in the Quranic schools ([[zaouia]]s) of West Africa. Arabic, like all other [[Semitic languages]] (except for the [[Latin alphabet|Latin-written]] [[Maltese language|Maltese]], and the languages with the [[Ge'ez script]]), is written from right to left.  There are several styles of script, notably [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] which is used in print and by computers, and [[Ruq'ah]] which is commonly used in [[handwriting]].&lt;ref name=Hanna&gt;Hanna, 1972, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calligraphy ===
{{Main|Arabic calligraphy}}

After [[Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi]] finally fixed the Arabic script around 786, many styles were developed, both for the writing down of the Qur'an and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.

Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the Western world, and is still considered by [[Arabs]] as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem. Being cursive by nature, unlike the [[Latin alphabet]], Arabic script is used to write down a [[ayah|verse]] of the Qur'an, a [[Hadith]], or simply a [[proverb]], in a spectacular composition. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. One of the current masters of the genre is [[Hassan Massoudy]].

=== Transliteration ===
{{Main|Arabic transliteration}}

There are a number of different standards of [[Arabic transliteration]]: methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the [[Latin alphabet]]. There are multiple conflicting motivations for transliteration. Scholarly systems are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of Arabic, generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the Arabic alphabet. These systems are heavily reliant on [[diacritic]]al marks such as &quot;š&quot; for the sound equivalently written ''sh'' in English.

In some cases, the ''sh'' or ''kh'' sounds can be represented by italicizing or underlining them&amp;nbsp;– that way, they can be distinguished from separate ''s'' and ''h'' sounds or ''k'' and ''h'' sounds, respectively. (Compare ''gashouse'' to ''gash''.) At first sight, this may be difficult to recognize. Less scientific systems often use [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (like ''sh'' and ''kh''), which are usually more simple to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems. Such systems may be intended to help readers who are neither Arabic speakers nor linguists to intuitively pronounce Arabic names and phrases. An example of such a system is the [[Bahá'í orthography]].

A third type of transliteration seeks to represent an equivalent of the Arabic spelling with Latin letters, for use by Arabic speakers when Arabic writing is not available (for example, when using an ASCII communication device).
An example is the system used by the US military, [[Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System]] or SATTS, which represents each Arabic letter with a unique symbol in the ASCII range to provide a one-to-one mapping from Arabic to ASCII and back. This system, while facilitating typing on English keyboards, presents its own ambiguities and disadvantages.

During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the [[Arab world]], such as [[personal computers]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[Bulletin board system]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[instant messaging]] and [[mobile phone text messaging]]. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the [[Latin alphabet]] only, and some of them still do not have the Arabic alphabet as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script, sometimes known as [[IM Arabic]].

To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral &quot;3&quot; may be used to represent the Arabic letter &quot;ع&quot;, ''ayn''. There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]]. Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the &quot;emphatic&quot; counterparts of certain consonants. For instance, using capitalization, the letter &quot;د&quot;, or ''daal'', may be represented by '''d'''. Its emphatic counterpart, &quot;ض&quot;, may be written as '''D'''.

=== Numerals ===
{{See also|Arabic numerals}}
In most of present-day North Africa, the [[Western Arabic numerals]] (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are used. However in [[Egypt]] and Arabic-speaking countries to the east of it, the [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] ({{lang|ar|٠.١.٢.٣.٤.٥.٦.٧.٨.٩}}) are in use. When representing a number in Arabic, the lowest-valued [[positional notation|position]] is placed on the right, so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts. Sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right, but numbers are spoken in the traditional Arabic fashion, with units and tens reversed from the modern English usage. For example, 24 is said &quot;four and twenty&quot; just like in the [[German language]] (''vierundzwanzig''), and 1975 is said &quot;one thousand and nine hundred and five and seventy.&quot;

== Language-standards regulators ==
[[Academy of the Arabic Language]] is the name of a number of language-regulation bodies formed in [[Arab League]]. The most active are in [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Damascus|Damascus]] and [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo|Cairo]]. They review language development, monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries. They also publish old and historical Arabic manuscripts.

== Studying Arabic ==
Because the [[Quran]] is written in Arabic and all [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terms]] are in Arabic, millions of Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) study the language. Arabic has been taught worldwide in many [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school|secondary]] schools, especially Muslim schools. Universities around the world have classes that teach Arabic as part of their [[Foreign Languages|foreign languages]], [[Middle Eastern studies]], and [[religious studies]] courses. [[Arabic language school]]s exist to assist students in learning Arabic outside of the academic world. Many Arabic [[language school]]s are located in the [[Arab world]] and other [[Muslim world|Muslim]] countries. Software and books with tapes are also important part of Arabic learning, as many of Arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or [[Arabic language school]] classes available. Radio series of Arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stations. A number of websites on the [[Internet]] provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education.

'''Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980)&lt;ref name=&quot;senses&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last= Mogg |first= Ken |title= Alfred Hitchcock |url= http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/05/hitchcock.html  |work= ''Senses of Cinema'' |publisher= Sensesofcinema.com |accessdate= 18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British&lt;!--as per [[MOS:BIO]] --&gt; director and producer. He pioneered many techniques in the [[suspense]] and [[psychological thriller]] genres. After a successful career in his native United Kingdom in both [[silent film]]s and early [[sound film|talkies]], Hitchcock moved to [[Hollywood]]. In 1956 he became an American citizen while remaining a [[British subject]].
 
Over a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognizable directorial style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage02-28-07&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last= Lehman |first= David|url= http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml |title= Alfred Hitchcock's America |work= ''American Heritage'' |date= April/May 2007 |accessdate= 21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of [[voyeurism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;techniques&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last= Bays |first= Jeff |title= Film Techniques of Alfred Hitchcock |url= http://www.borgus.com/think/hitch.htm |work= Borgus.com |publisher= Borgus Productions |date= December 2007 |accessdate= 13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative [[film editing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;techniques&quot; /&gt; His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside &quot;icy blonde&quot; female characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Whitington |first= Paul |title= &quot;NOTORIOUS!

Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from [[psychoanalysis]] and feature strong sexual undertones. Through [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|his cameo appearances]] in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', he became a [[cultural icon]].

Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's ''Daily Telegraph'', which said: &quot;Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Avedon |first= Richard |title = The top 21 British directors of all time |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3664474/The-top-21-British-directors-of-all-time.html |publisher= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate= 8 July 2009 |quote= Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him.

==Hitchcock's life==
[[File:Hitchcock Leytonstone London.jpg|thumb|upright|Hitchcock mosaic at [[Leytonstone|Leytonstone Station]].]]

Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in [[Leytonstone]], London, the second son and youngest of three children of William Hitchcock (1862–1914), a [[greengrocer]] and poulterer, and Emma Jane Hitchcock (''née'' Whelan; 1863–1942). He was named after his father's brother, Alfred. Hitchcock was raised [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and was sent to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Classic school [[St Ignatius' College]] in [[Stamford Hill]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Death and the Master |url= http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/death-and-the-master-199904 |publisher= [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date= April, 1999 |accessdate= 2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Welcome to St. Ignatius College |url= http://www.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk| accessdate= 5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother and paternal grandmother were of Irish extraction.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref09&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Spoto |first= Donald |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock |publisher= Da Capo Press |year= 1999 |location= |page= 15 |month= |url= |isbn= 978-0-306-80932-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often described his childhood as being very lonely and sheltered, a situation compounded by his obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs.18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock said  he was sent by his father to the local police station with a note asking the officer to lock him away for ten minutes as punishment for behaving badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hollywood in the Hills |url= http://67.15.208.115/printstory.php?sid=28247&amp;storySection=Style |publisher= Sentinel Staff Report |date= 24 July 2005 |accessdate= 5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of being harshly treated or wrongfully accused is frequently reflected in Hitchcock's films.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs.7–8&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitchcock's mother would often make him address her while standing at the foot of her bed, especially if he behaved badly, forcing him to stand there for hours. These experiences would later be used for the portrayal of the character of [[Norman Bates]] in his movie ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pg.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's father died when he was 14. In the same year, Hitchcock left St. Ignatius to study at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in [[Poplar, London]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGillang, pg 25.  The school is now part of [[Tower Hamlets College]].&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he became a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and advertising designer with a cable company called Henley's.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs.24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while working at Henley's that he first started to dabble creatively. Upon the formation of the company's in-house publication ''The Henley Telegraph'' in 1919, Hitchcock started to submit short articles, eventually becoming one of its most prolific contributors. His first piece was ''Gas'' (1919), published in the very first issue, in which a young woman imagines that she is being assaulted one night in Paris - only for the twist to reveal that it was all just a hallucination in the dentist's chair, induced by the anesthetic. His second piece was ''The Woman's Part'' (1919), which involves the conflicted emotions a husband feels as he watches his wife, an actress, perform onstage. ''Sordid'' (1920) surrounds an attempt to buy a sword from an antiques dealer, with another twist ending. The short story ''And There Was No Rainbow'' (1920) was Hitchcock's first brush with possibly censurable material. A young man goes out looking for a brothel, only to stumble into the house of his best friend's girl. ''What's Who?'' (1920), while being very funny, was also a precursor to the famous Abbott and Costello &quot;Who's on First?&quot; routine. ''The History of Pea Eating'' (1920) was a satirical disquisition on the various attempts mankind has made over the centuries to eat peas successfully. His final piece, ''Fedora'' (1921), was his shortest and most enigmatic contribution. It also gave a strikingly accurate description of his future wife, Alma (whom he had not met yet). &lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs. 30-45&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Hitchcock became intrigued by photography and started working in film production in London, working as a title-card designer for the London branch of what would become [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SantaCruzInspiration&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Local Inspiration for Movie Classics: Hitchcock had Link to Santa Cruz |publisher= Santa Cruz Public Libraries, Ca. |url= http://www.santacruzpl.org/history/films/hitch.shtml |accessdate= 4 March 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070905101712/http://www.santacruzpl.org/history/films/hitch.shtml  |archivedate = 5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he received a full-time position at [[Hoxton|Islington Studios]] with its American owner, [[Famous Players-Lasky]] and their British successor, [[Gainsborough Pictures]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gainsborough&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Gainsborough Pictures (1924-51)|publisher=British Film Institute ScreenOnline| url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/448996| accessdate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; designing the titles for silent movies.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt; His rise from title designer to film director took five years.

==Pre-war British career==
Hitchcock's last collaboration with [[Graham Cutts]] led him to Germany in 1924. The film ''[[Die Prinzessin und der Geiger]]'' (UK title ''The Blackguard'', 1925), directed by Cutts and co-written by Hitchcock, was produced in the [[Babelsberg Studios]] in Potsdam near Berlin. Hitchcock also observed part of the making of [[F. W. Murnau]]'s film ''[[Der letzte Mann]]'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Gottleib (ed), ''Alfred Hitchcock: Interviews By Alfred Hitchcock''. Illustrated Edition. (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2003). pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; He was very impressed with Murnau's work and later used many techniques for the set design in his own productions. In his book-length interview with [[François Truffaut]], ''Hitchcock/Truffaut'' ([[Simon and Schuster]], 1967), Hitchcock also said he was influenced by [[Fritz Lang]]'s film ''[[Destiny (1921 film)|Destiny]]'' (1921).

Hitchcock's first few films faced a string of bad luck. His first directing project came in 1922 with the aptly titled ''[[Number 13 (film)|Number 13]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;Donald Spoto. ''The Art of Alfred Hitchcock''. New York: Anchor Books, 1976–1992. p. 3 ISBN 978-0-385-41813-3&lt;/ref&gt; However, the production was cancelled due to financial problems&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt; and the few scenes that were finished at that point were apparently lost. In 1925, [[Michael Balcon]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Balcon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Balcon, Michael (1896–1977) Executive Producer |publisher= British Film Institute ScreenOnline |url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/447085/index.html |accessdate= 6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Gainsborough Pictures gave Hitchcock another opportunity for a directing credit with ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' made at [[Universum Film AG|UFA Studios]]&lt;ref name=&quot;UFA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Studio Babelsberg makes Comeback |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/awards_festivals/berlin/features/e3i1e0e186c138b9329812cc14639122aac |publisher= The Hollywood Reporter |date= 8 February 2008 |accessdate= 6 March 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080519203756/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/awards_festivals/berlin/features/e3i1e0e186c138b9329812cc14639122aac  |archivedate= 19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany; unfortunately, the film was a commercial flop.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs. 68-71&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Hitchcock directed a drama called ''[[The Mountain Eagle]]'' (possibly released under the title ''Fear o' God'' in the United States). This film was also eventually lost.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Spoto. ''The Art of Alfred Hitchcock''. New York: Anchor Books, 1976–1992. p. 5 ISBN 978-0-385-41813-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926,  Hitchcock's luck changed with his first thriller, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]''. The film, released in January 1927, was a major commercial and critical success in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert E. Kapsis, ''Hitchcock: The Making of a Reputation.'' Illustrated Edition. (University of Chicago Press, 1992). p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; As with many of his earlier works, this film was influenced by [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] techniques Hitchcock had witnessed first-hand in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jones (2005) ''The rough guide to horror movies'' p.20. Rough Guides, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators regard this piece as the first truly &quot;Hitchcockian&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Hitchcockian Stuff| publisher=Alfredsplace.com|url=http://www.alfredsplace.com/hitchcockian_stuff.htm| accessdate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Gleiberman |first= Owen |title= Ask the Critic - The Hitch Is Back-What, exactly, makes a film ''Hitchcockian''. |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1146038,00.html |publisher= Entertainment Weekly (EW.COM) |date= 07 Jan 2006 |accessdate= 26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; film, incorporating such themes as the &quot;wrong man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pg.85&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''The Lodger'', Hitchcock hired a publicist to help enhance his growing reputation. On 2 December 1926, Hitchcock married his assistant director, [[Alma Reville]] at the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Brompton Oratory]] in [[South Kensington]]. Their only child, daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock|Patricia]], was born on July 7 1928. Alma was to become Hitchcock's closest collaborator. Alma's contribution to his films (some of which were credited on screen) had always been privately acknowledged by Hitchcock, as she was keen to avoid public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Chandler |first= Charlotte |title= It's only a movie: Alfred Hitchcock : a personal biography |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=glp97Y_eVSIC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=alma+hitchcock&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MT56TKH2EYvNjAeZqqSZBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=alma%20hitchcock&amp;f=false |publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Hitchcock began work on his tenth film ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]''. While the film was still in production, the studio, [[British International Pictures]] (BIP), decided to convert it to sound. As an early '[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]', the film is frequently cited by film historians as a landmark film,&lt;ref&gt;Rob White, Edward Buscombe ''British Film Institute film classics, Volume 1'' p.94. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and is often considered to be the first [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[talkie|sound]] [[feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Allen, S.

In the [[PBS]] series ''The Men Who Made The Movies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= American Masters-Alfred Hitchcock |url= http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/hitchcock_a.html |publisher= Public Broadcasting System |accessdate= 5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock explained how he used early sound recording as a special element of the film, emphasising the word &quot;knife&quot; in a conversation with the woman suspected of murder.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs.120-123&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Hitchcock directed segments for a BIP [[musical film]] [[revue]] ''[[Elstree Calling]]'' (1930) and directed a [[short film]] featuring two ''Film Weekly'' scholarship winners, ''[[An Elastic Affair]]'' (1930). Another BIP musical revue, ''Harmony Heaven'' (1929), reportedly had minor input from Hitchcock, but his name does not appear in the credits.

In 1933, Hitchcock was once again working for Michael Balcon&lt;ref name=&quot;Balcon&quot; /&gt; at [[Gaumont British|Gaumont-British Picture Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Gaumont-British Picture Corporation |url= http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/organisation/8529 |publisher= British Film Institute |accessdate= 6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first film for the company, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), was a success and his second, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), is often considered one of the best films from his early period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The British Film Institute 100 |url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/bfi100/1-10.html#4 |accessdate= 26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film was also one of the first to introduce the concept of the &quot;[[MacGuffin]]&quot;, a plot device around which a whole story seems to revolve, but ultimately has nothing to do with the true meaning or ending of the story. In ''The 39 Steps'', the Macguffin is a stolen set of design plans. Hitchcock told French director [[François Truffaut]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two men sitting in a train going to Scotland and one man says to the other, &quot;Excuse me, sir, but what is that strange parcel you have on the luggage rack above you?&quot;, &quot;Oh&quot;, says the other, &quot;that's a Macguffin.&quot;, &quot;Well&quot;, says the first man, &quot;what's a Macguffin?&quot;, The other answers, &quot;It's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.&quot;, &quot;But&quot;, says the first man, &quot;there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands.&quot;, &quot;Well&quot;, says the other, &quot;then that's no Macguffin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pg.158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hitchcock's next major success was his 1938 film ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', a fast-paced film about the search for a kindly old Englishwoman Miss Froy ([[Dame May Whitty]]), who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of Bandrika.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bandrika&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Lions of British Cinema-Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) | publisher=AvantGardeNow.com | url=http://www.avantgardenow.com/hitchcock.html| accessdate=6 March 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009021633/http://www.avantgardenow.com/hitchcock.html  |archivedate = 9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1938, Hitchcock had become known for his alleged observation, &quot;Actors are cattle&quot;. He once said that he first made this remark as early as the late 1920s, in connection to stage actors who were snobbish about motion pictures. However, [[Michael Redgrave]] said that Hitchcock had made the statement during the filming of ''The Lady Vanishes''. The phrase would haunt Hitchcock for years to come and would result in an incident during the filming of his 1941 production of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'', where [[Carole Lombard]] brought some heifers onto the set with name tags of Lombard, [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and [[Gene Raymond]], the stars of the film, to surprise the director. Hitchcock said he was misquoted: &quot;I said 'Actors should be ''treated'' like cattle'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs. 210-211, 277; American Movie Classics&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1930s, [[David O. Selznick]] signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939, when the Hitchcocks moved to the United States.

==Hollywood==

The suspense and the [[gallows humor|gallows humour]] that had become Hitchcock's trademark in film continued to appear in his productions. The working arrangements with Selznick were less than optimal. Selznick suffered from perennial money problems, and Hitchcock was often displeased with Selznick's creative control over his films. In a later interview, Hitchcock summarised the working relationship thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Selznick] was the Big Producer. [...] Producer was king, The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me — and it shows you the amount of control — he said I was the &quot;only director&quot; he'd &quot;trust with a film&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Gottlieb, Alfred Hitchcock: Interviews By Alfred Hitchcock. Illustrated Edition. (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2003). pp. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Selznick loaned Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself. In addition, Selznick, as well as fellow independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]], made only a few films each year, so Selznick did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. Hitchcock was quickly impressed with the superior resources of the American studios compared to the financial restrictions he had frequently encountered in England.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Hitchcock's fondness for his homeland resulted in numerous American films set in, or filmed in, the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_37.shtml George Perry] &quot;Hitchcock on Location,&quot; ''American Heritage'', April/May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; including his penultimate film, ''[[Frenzy]]''.

With the prestigious Selznick picture ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' in 1940, Hitchcock made his first American movie, set in England and based on a novel by English author [[Daphne du Maurier]]. The film starred [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Joan Fontaine]]. This [[Gothic novel|Gothic]] [[melodrama]] explores the fears of a naive young bride who enters a great English country home and must adapt to the extreme formality and coldness she finds there. The film won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] of 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebecca&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Awards for ''Rebecca'' (1940) | publisher=Internet Movie Database| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032976/awards| accessdate=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statuette was given to Selznick, as the film's producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebecca&quot;/&gt; The film did not win the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] award for Hitchcock.

There were additional problems between Selznick and Hitchcock. Selznick was known to impose very restrictive rules upon Hitchcock, forcing him to shoot the film as Selznick wanted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} At the same time, Selznick complained about Hitchcock's &quot;goddamn jigsaw cutting&quot;, which meant that the producer did not have nearly the leeway to create his own film as he liked, but had to follow Hitchcock's vision of the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pp. 251-252&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rebecca'' was the fourth longest of Hitchcock's films, at 130&amp;nbsp;minutes, exceeded only by ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (132&amp;nbsp;minutes), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (136&amp;nbsp;minutes), and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (142&amp;nbsp;minutes).&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pg.253&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's second American film, the European-set thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), based on [[Vincent Sheean]]'s ''Personal History'' and produced by [[Walter Wanger]], was  nominated for Best Picture that year. The movie was filmed in the first year of World War II and was apparently inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} as fictionally covered by an American newspaper reporter portrayed by [[Joel McCrea]]. The film mixed actual footage of European scenes and scenes filmed on a Hollywood back lot. In compliance with Hollywood's Production Code censorship, the film avoided direct references to Germany and Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pg.244&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s films===
[[File:Ingrid Bergman in Notorious Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946)]]
Hitchcock's films during the 1940s were diverse, ranging from the romantic comedy ''Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith'' (1941) to the courtroom drama ''The Paradine Case'' (1947), to the dark and disturbing [[film noir]] ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943).

In September 1940, the Hitchcocks purchased the {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} Cornwall Ranch, located near [[Scotts Valley]] in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. The ranch became the primary residence of the Hitchcocks for the rest of their lives, although they kept their Bel Air home. ''[[Suspicion (film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer as well as director. Hitchcock used the north coast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]] for the English coastline sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;SantaCruzInspiration&quot; /&gt; This film was to be actor [[Cary Grant]]'s first time working with Hitchcock, and it was one of the few times that Grant would be cast in a sinister role.&lt;ref name=&quot;SantaCruzInspiration&quot; /&gt; Joan Fontaine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Joan Fontaine |publisher= Hollywood.com |url= http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Joan_Fontaine/197679 |accessdate= 5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; won Best Actress [[Academy Award|Oscar]]&lt;ref name=&quot;SantaCruzInspiration&quot; /&gt; and the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New York Film Critics Circle Winners In the 40s | publisher=Geocities | url=http://www.geocities.com/ps971100/NYFCC40.htm | accessdate=5 March 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmWxZj10|archivedate=25 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her &quot;outstanding performance in ''Suspicion''&quot;. &quot;Grant plays an irresponsible husband whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his wife (Fontaine)&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In what critics regard as a classic scene{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, Hitchcock uses a light bulb to illuminate what might be a fatal glass of milk that Grant is bringing to his wife. In the book the movie is based on (''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]]), the Grant character is a killer, but Hitchcock and the studio felt Grant's image would be tarnished by that ending. Though a homicide would have suited him better, as he stated to François Truffaut, Hitchcock settled for an ambiguous finale.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Leitch, ''The Encyclopedia of Alfred Hitchcock'', Facts on File, New York, pp. 324–5, ISBN 978-0-8160-4386-6&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) was the first of two films that Hitchcock made for [[Universal Studios|Universal]], a studio where he would continue his career during his later years. Hitchcock was forced{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to use Universal contract players [[Robert Cummings]] and [[Priscilla Lane]], both known for their work in comedies and light dramas. Breaking with Hollywood conventions of the time, Hitchcock did extensive location filming, especially in New York City, and  depicted a confrontation between a suspected saboteur (Cummings) and a real saboteur ([[Norman Lloyd]]) atop the [[Statue of Liberty]].

''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), Hitchcock's personal favourite of all his films and the second of the early Universal films,&lt;ref&gt;In an interview on the Dick Cavett show aired on 8 June 1972, when asked if he had a personal favourite, Hitchcock responded that it was ''Shadow of a Doubt''.&lt;/ref&gt; was about young Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]), who suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of being a serial murderer. Critics have said that in its use of overlapping characters, dialogue, and closeups it has provided a generation of film theorists with psychoanalytic potential{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, including [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Hitchcock again filmed extensively on location, this time in the Northern California city of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[California]], during the summer of 1942. The director showcased his own personal fascination with crime and criminals when he had two of his characters discuss various ways of killing people, to the obvious annoyance of Charlotte.

Working at [[20th Century Fox]], Hitchcock adapted a script of [[John Steinbeck]]'s that chronicled the experiences of the survivors of a German U-boat attack in the film ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). The action sequences were shot on the small boat. The locale also posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for &quot;Reduco-Obesity Slayer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; While at Fox, Hitchcock seriously considered directing the film version of [[A.J. Cronin]]'s novel about a Catholic priest in China{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, ''[[The Keys of the Kingdom (film)|The Keys of the Kingdom]]'', but the plans for this fell through. [[John M. Stahl]] ended up directing the 1944 film, which was produced by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] and starred [[Gregory Peck]], among other luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pg. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to England for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944, Hitchcock made two short films for the Ministry of Information, ''[[Bon Voyage (1944 film)|Bon Voyage]]'' and ''[[Aventure Malgache]]''. Made for the [[Free French]], these were the only films Hitchcock made in the French language, and &quot;feature typical Hitchcockian touches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs.346-348&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the two films were shown by [[Turner Classic Movies]] and released on home video.

In 1945, Hitchcock served as &quot;treatment advisor&quot; (in effect, a [[film editor]]) for a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] documentary produced by the British Army. The film, which recorded the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]], remained unreleased until 1985, when it was completed by [[PBS Frontline]] and distributed under the title ''Memory of the Camps''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs. 372-374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Memory of the Camps |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp |work= FRONTLINE |publisher= Public Broadcasting System (PBS) |accessdate=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock worked for Selznick again when he directed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), which explored [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Boyd |first= David |title= The Parted Eye: ''Spellbound'' and Psychoanalysis |url= http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |date= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured a dream sequence designed by [[Salvador Dalí]]. [[Gregory Peck]] plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; The dream sequence as it actually appears in the film is considerably shorter than was originally envisioned, which was to be several minutes long{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, because it proved to be too disturbing for the audience. Some of the original musical score by [[Miklós Rózsa]] (which makes use of the [[theremin]]) was later adapted by the composer into a concert piano concerto.

''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946) followed ''Spellbound''. According to Hitchcock, in his book-length interview with François Truffaut, Selznick sold the director, the two stars (Grant and Bergman) and the screenplay (by Ben Hecht) to RKO Radio Pictures as a &quot;package&quot; for $500,000 due to cost overruns on Selznick's ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946). ''Notorious'' starred Hitchcock regulars Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant, and features a plot about Nazis, [[uranium]], and South America. It was a huge box office success and has remained one of Hitchcock's most acclaimed films{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. His use of uranium as a plot device led to Hitchcock's being briefly under FBI surveillance. McGilligan writes that Hitchcock consulted Dr. [[Robert Millikan]] of [[Caltech]] about the development of an atomic bomb. Selznick complained that the notion was &quot;science fiction&quot;, only to be confronted by the news stories of the detonation of two atomic bombs on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in Japan in August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs.366-381&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his final film for Selznick, ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (a courtroom drama that critics found lost momentum because it apparently ran too long and exhausted its resource of ideas), Hitchcock filmed his first colour film, ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', which appeared in 1948. Here Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1943). He also experimented with exceptionally long takes — up to ten minutes long. Featuring [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, ''Rope'' was the first of four films Stewart would make for Hitchcock. It was based on the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s. Somehow Hitchcock's cameraman managed to move the bulky, heavy [[Technicolor]] camera quickly around the set as it followed the continuous action of the long takes.

''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), set in nineteenth-century Australia, also used the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. He again used Technicolor in this production, then returned to black and white films for several years. For ''Rope'' and ''Under Capricorn'', Hitchcock formed a production company with [[Sidney Bernstein]] called [[Transatlantic Pictures]], which became inactive after these two unsuccessful pictures.  Hitchcock continued to produce his own films for the rest of his life.

===1950s: Peak years===
[[File:Rearwindow trailer 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Stewart]] and [[Grace Kelly]] in ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954)]]

In 1950, Hitchcock filmed ''[[Stage Fright (film)|Stage Fright]]'' on location in the UK. For the first time, Hitchcock matched one of [[Warner Bros.]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Warner Brothers Studios | url=http://www2.warnerbros.com/main/homepage/homepage.html | accessdate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; biggest stars, [[Jane Wyman]], with the sultry German actress [[Marlene Dietrich]]. Hitchcock used a number of prominent British actors, including [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]], [[Richard Todd]], and [[Alastair Sim]]. This was Hitchcock's first production for Warner Bros., which had distributed ''Rope'' and ''Under Capricorn'', because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs. 429, 774-775&lt;/ref&gt;

With the film ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), based on the novel by [[Patricia Highsmith]], Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films. Hitchcock approached [[Dashiell Hammett]] to write the dialogue but [[Raymond Chandler]] took over, then left over disagreements with the director.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Two men casually meet and speculate on removing people who are causing them difficulty. One of the men takes this banter entirely seriously. With [[Farley Granger]] reprising some elements of his role from ''Rope'', ''Strangers'' continued the director's interest in the narrative possibilities of blackmail and murder{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. [[Robert Walker (actor)|Robert Walker]], previously known for &quot;boy-next-door&quot; roles, plays the villain.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] head [[Lew Wasserman]], whose client list included [[James Stewart]], [[Janet Leigh]] and other actors who would appear in Hitchcock's films, had a significant impact in packaging and marketing Hitchcock's films beginning in the 1950s.

Three very popular films starring [[Grace Kelly]] followed. ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954) was adapted from the popular stage play by [[Frederick Knott]]. [[Ray Milland]] plays the scheming villain, an ex-tennis pro who tries to murder his unfaithful wife [[Grace Kelly]] for her money. When she kills the hired assassin in self-defense, Milland manipulates the evidence to pin the death on his wife. Her lover, Mark Halliday ([[Robert Cummings]]), and Police Inspector Hubbard ([[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]), work urgently to save her from execution.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock experimented with [[3-D film|3D]] cinematography, although the film was not released in this format at first. However, it was shown in 3D in the early 1980s. The film marked a return to Technicolor productions for Hitchcock.

Hitchcock then moved to [[Paramount Pictures]] and filmed ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), starring James Stewart and Kelly again, as well as [[Thelma Ritter]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Stewart's character, a photographer based on [[Robert Capa]], must temporarily use a wheelchair; out of boredom he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, and becomes convinced one of them ([[Raymond Burr]]) has murdered his wife. Stewart tries to sway both his glamorous model-girlfriend (Kelly), which screenwriter [[John Michael Hayes]] based on his own wife, and his policeman buddy ([[Wendell Corey]]) to his theory, and eventually succeeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch1&quot;&gt;Leitch, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Lifeboat'' and ''Rope'', the movie was photographed almost entirely within the confines of a small space: Stewart's tiny studio apartment overlooking the massive courtyard set. Hitchcock used closeups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions to all he sees, &quot;from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbors to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch1&quot;/&gt;

The third Kelly film, ''[[To Catch a Thief (film)|To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), set in the French Riviera, paired Kelly with Cary Grant again. Grant plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera.  An American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity, attempts to seduce him. &quot;Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double-entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hitchcock's last film with Kelly. She married [[Prince Rainier]] of [[Monaco]] in 1956, and the residents of her new land were against her making any more films.

Hitchcock successfully remade his own 1934 film ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' in 1956, this time starring Stewart and [[Doris Day]], who sang the theme song,  &quot;[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)]]&quot; (which won the Oscar for &quot;Best Original Song&quot; and became a big hit for Day). They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination.

[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer embrace 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Stewart]] and [[Kim Novak]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958)]]

''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1957), Hitchcock's final film for Warner Brothers, was a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of mistaken identity reported in Life Magazine in 1953. This was the only film of Hitchcock's to star [[Henry Fonda]]. Fonda plays a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife (newcomer [[Vera Miles]]) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) again starred Stewart, this time with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. Stewart plays &quot;Scottie&quot;, a former police investigator suffering from [[acrophobia]], who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing (Novak). Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. Though the film is widely considered a classic today, ''Vertigo'' met with negative reviews and poor box office receipts upon its release, and marked the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, pp. 376–7&lt;/ref&gt; The film is ranked second (behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'') in the 2002 ''[[Sight and Sound|Sight &amp; Sound]]'' decade poll. It was premiered in the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Donostia Zinemaldia Festival de San Sebastian International Film Festival |url= http://www.sansebastianfestival.com/2007/es3/portada.php |accessdate= 6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Hitchcock won a Silver Seashell.

===Late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s===
[[File:Hitch-at-work;1975-FamilyPlot;SF-On-Location.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hitchcock at work on location in San Francisco for ''[[Family Plot]]'']]

By this time, Hitchcock had filmed in many areas of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hitchcock's America Lifelong Learning Institute-Fall 2001 |subtitle= Hitchcock Filming Sites and Points of Interest in the US |publisher= Sonoma State University |url= http://yorty.sonoma.edu/filmfrog/archive/hitchmap.html |accessdate= 5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed ''Vertigo'' with three more successful films. All are also recognised as among his very best films: ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).

In ''North by Northwest'', Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; He is hotly pursued by enemy agents across America, apparently one of them being Eve Kendall ([[Eva Marie Saint]]).

''Psycho'' is almost certainly Hitchcock's most well known film.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Produced on a highly constrained budget of $800,000, it was shot in black-and-white on a spare set.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 3261&lt;/ref&gt; The unprecedented violence of the shower scene, the early demise of the heroine, the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer were all hallmarks of Hitchcock, copied in many subsequent horror films.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; After completing ''Psycho'', Hitchcock moved to Universal, where he made the remainder of his films.

''The Birds'', inspired by a [[Daphne Du Maurier]] short story and by an actual news story about a mysterious infestation of birds in California, was Hitchcock's 49th film.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He signed up [[Tippi Hedren]] as his latest blonde heroine opposite [[Rod Taylor]]. (On April 13, 2011, at the Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington, NY, Hedren stated in an interview with Turner Classic Movies' Ben Mankiewicz, prior to a screening of ''The Birds'', that because she refused Hitchcock’s sexual advances, Hitchcock effectively stunted her career.) The scenes of the birds attacking included hundreds of shots mixing actual and animated sequences. The cause of the birds' attack is left unanswered, &quot;perhaps highlighting the mystery of forces unknown&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter two films were particularly notable for their unconventional soundtracks, both orchestrated by [[Bernard Herrmann]]: the screeching strings played in the murder scene in ''Psycho'' exceeded the limits of the time, and ''The Birds'' dispensed completely with conventional instruments, instead using an electronically produced soundtrack and an unaccompanied song by school children (just prior to the infamous attack at the historic Bodega Bay School). These films are considered his last great films, after which his output deteriorated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} (although some critics, such as [[Robin Wood (film critic)|Robin Wood]] and [[Donald Spoto]], contend that ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', from 1964, is first-class Hitchcock, and some have argued that ''Frenzy'' is unfairly overlooked).

Failing health took its toll on Hitchcock, reducing his output during the last two decades of his career. Hitchcock filmed two spy thrillers. The first, ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966), with [[Paul Newman]] and [[Julie Andrews]], was a [[Cold War]] thriller. ''Torn Curtain'' displays the bitter end of the twelve-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrmann. Herrmann was fired when Hitchcock was unsatisfied with his score. In 1969,  ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', another Cold War-themed film (based on a [[Leon Uris]] novel), was released. Both received mixed reviews from critics but are nonetheless recognized as espionage thrillers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In 1972, Hitchcock returned to London to film ''Frenzy'', his last major triumph. After two only moderately successful [[espionage]] films, the plot marks a return to the murder thriller genre that he made so many films out of earlier in his career.  The basic story recycles his early film ''The Lodger''. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barkeeper with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect for the &quot;Necktie Murders,&quot; which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch2&quot;&gt;Leitch, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain twins, rather than opposites, as in ''Strangers on a Train''. Only one of them, however, has crossed the line to murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch2&quot;/&gt; For the first time, Hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language, which had before been taboo, in one of his films. He also shows rare sympathy for the chief inspector and his comic domestic life.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool [[Joseph Breen]], the longtime head of Hollywood's [[Production Code]]. Many times Hitchcock slipped in subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet Patrick McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such things and were actually amused as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's &quot;inescapable inferences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pg.249&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with ''Torn Curtain'', Hitchcock was finally able to blatantly include plot elements previously forbidden in American films and this continued for the remainder of his film career.

''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It related the escapades of &quot;Madam&quot; Blanche Tyler played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi driver lover [[Bruce Dern]] making a living from her phony powers. [[William Devane]], [[Karen Black]] and [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] co-starred. It was the only Hitchcock film scored by [[John Williams]].

===Last film work and death===
Near the end of his life, Hitchcock had worked on the script for a projected spy thriller, ''[[The Short Night]]'', collaborating with screenwriters [[James Costigan]] and [[Ernest Lehman]]. Despite some preliminary work, the story was never filmed. This was due primarily to Hitchcock's own failing health and his concerns over the health of his wife, Alma, who had suffered a stroke. The script was eventually published posthumously, in a book on Hitchcock's last years.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, pgs.731-734&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Freeman |first= David |title= The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock |year= 1999 |publisher= Overlook |id= ISBN 978-0-87951-728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock died on 29 April 1980, 9:17AM. He died peacefully in his sleep due to [[renal failure]] in his [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air, Los Angeles]], [[California]] home at the age of 80, survived by his wife and their daughter. His funeral service was held at Good Shepherd Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Good Shepherd Catholic Church Beverly Hills, CA 90210 |url= http://shepherd.catholicweb.com |accessdate= 4 March 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080321050225/http%3A//shepherd.catholicweb.com |archivedate= March 21, 2008 |deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Beverly Hills.

==Themes, plot devices and motifs==
{{Main|Themes and plot devices in the films of Alfred Hitchcock}}
Hitchcock returned several times to cinematic devices such as [[suspense]], the audience as [[voyeur]], and his well-known &quot;[[MacGuffin]],&quot; an apparently minor detail serving as a pivot upon which the narrative turns.

==Technical innovations==
Hitchcock seemed to delight in the technical challenges of film making. In the film ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'', Hitchcock stages the entire action of the movie in a small boat, yet manages to keep the cinematography from monotonous repetition (his trademark cameo appearance was a dilemma, given the limitations of the setting; so Hitchcock appears in a fictitious magazine for a weight loss product). Similarly, the entire action in ''[[Rear Window]]'' either takes place in or is seen from a single apartment. In ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', two unprecedented point-of-view shots were achieved by constructing a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white print of the film.

''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) was another technical challenge: a film that appears to have been shot entirely in a single take. The film was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from four and a half to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes each; a 10&amp;nbsp;minute length of film being the maximum a camera's film magazine could hold. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place.

Hitchcock's 1958 film ''Vertigo'' contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts that has been imitated and re-used many times by filmmakers, wherein the image appears to &quot;stretch&quot;. This is achieved by moving the camera in the opposite direction of the camera's zoom. It has become known by many nicknames, including [[Dolly zoom]], &quot;Zolly,&quot; &quot;Hitchcock Zoom,&quot; and &quot;Vertigo Effect.&quot;

==Signature appearances in his films==
{{Main|List of Hitchcock cameo appearances}}
Hitchcock appeared briefly in many of his own films, usually playing upon his portly figure in an incongruous manner, for example, seen struggling to get a [[double bass]] onto a train, or walking dogs in the background.

==Psychology of characters==
Hitchcock's films sometimes feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers. In ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]'s character) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963), the [[Rod Taylor (actor)|Rod Taylor]] character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself of a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' has a clearly conflictual relationship with his mother, who is (correctly) suspicious of his new bride Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]). Norman Bates has troubles with his mother in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.

Hitchcock heroines tend to be lovely, cool blondes who seem proper at first but, when aroused by passion or danger, respond in a more sensual, animal, or even criminal way. The famous victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', Hitchcock's glamorous blonde star, [[Madeleine Carroll]], is put in handcuffs. In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character (played by [[Tippi Hedren]]) is a [[thief]]. In ''[[To Catch a Thief (film)|To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie ([[Grace Kelly]]) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Rear Window]]'', Lisa (Grace Kelly again) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. The best known example is in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' where [[Janet Leigh]]'s unfortunate character steals $40,000 and is murdered by a reclusive psychopath. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was — years after [[Dany Robin]] and her &quot;daughter&quot; [[Claude Jade]] in ''[[Topaz (1969 movie)|Topaz]]'' — [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in his final film, 1976's ''[[Family Plot]]''. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] could also fit that role, as she wears a long blonde wig in various scenes and becomes increasingly uncomfortable about her line of work.

Some critics and Hitchcock scholars, including Donald Spoto and [[Roger Ebert]], agree that ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' represents the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Hitchcock often said that his favourite film (of his own work) was ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[Dick Cavett Show interview, June 8, 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of working==
===Writing===
Hitchcock once commented, &quot;The writer and I plan out the entire script down to the smallest detail, and when we're finished all that's left to do is to shoot the film. Actually, it's only when one enters the studio that one enters the area of compromise. Really, the novelist has the best casting since he doesn't have to cope with the actors and all the rest.&quot; In an interview with Roger Ebert in 1969, Hitchcock elaborated further:
{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all... I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score... When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 percent of your original conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19691214/PEOPLE/912140301/1023 |title=Hitchcock: &quot;Never mess about with a dead body - you may be one...&quot; |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=14 December 1969 |accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', a book-length study of Hitchcock's working method with his writers, author Steven DeRosa noted that &quot;Although he rarely did any actual 'writing', especially on his Hollywood productions, Hitchcock supervised and guided his writers through every draft, insisting on a strict attention to detail and a preference for telling the story through visual rather than verbal means. While this exasperated some writers, others admitted the director inspired them to do their very best work. Hitchcock often emphasised that he took no screen credit for the writing of his films. However, over time the work of many of his writers has been attributed solely to Hitchcock’s creative genius, a misconception he rarely went out of his way to correct. Notwithstanding his technical brilliance as a director, Hitchcock relied on his writers a great deal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steven DeRosa, ''Writing with Hitchcock'', New York: Faber and Faber, 2001, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storyboards and production===
Hitchcock's films were strongly believed to have been extensively storyboarded to the finest detail by the majority of commentators over the years. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to do so, though in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider.

However, this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book ''Hitchcock At Work'', written by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]''. Krohn, after investigating several script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards, and other production material, has observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his movies was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. A great example would be the celebrated crop spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' which was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.

Even on when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from it significantly. Krohn's extensive analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his movies, he was fully cognizant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.

Krohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he/she chooses (often under the producer's aegis). Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency of giving himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.

His fastidiousness and attention to detail also found its way into each [[film poster]] for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as [[Bill Gold]] and [[Saul Bass]]—and kept them busy with countless rounds of revision until he felt that the single image of the poster accurately represented his entire film.

===Approach to actors===
{{Quote box

}}
Similarly, much of Hitchcock's supposed dislike of actors has been exaggerated. Hitchcock simply did not tolerate the [[Method acting|method]] approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre because he has a free space to move about. But when it comes to cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, there must be some discipline'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Hitchcock| publisher=BFI (Because Films Inspire)| url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html#actors | accessdate=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the making of ''Lifeboat'', [[Walter Slezak]], who played the German character, stated that Hitchcock knew the mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew. Several critics have observed that despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, several actors who worked with him gave fine, often brilliant performances and these performances contribute to the film's success.

For Hitchcock, the actors, like the props, were part of the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my opinion, the chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilized and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.&lt;ref&gt;Truffaut, Francois. &quot;Hitchcock by Truffaut: The Definitive Study&quot;. Grafton Books, 1984. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding Hitchcock's sometimes less than pleasant relationship with actors, there was a persistent rumour that he had said that actors were cattle. Hitchcock addressed this story in his interview with Francois Truffaut:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm not quite sure in what context I might have made such a statement. It may have been made...when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays. When they had a matinee, and I suspected they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch. And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theater, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage. I had no use for that kind of actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truffaut, Francois 1984. p. 140&quot;&gt;Truffaut, Francois. &quot;Hitchcock&quot;. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1984. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

[[Carole Lombard]], tweaking Hitchcock and drumming up a little publicity, brought some cows along with her when she reported to the set of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truffaut, Francois 1984. p. 140&quot;/&gt; 

In the late 1950s, [[French New Wave]] critics, especially [[Éric Rohmer]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[François Truffaut]], were among the first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their [[auteur theory]], which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film-making process.

Hitchcock's innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, [[Film producer|producers]], and actors. His influence helped start a trend for [[film director]]s to control artistic aspects of their movies without answering to the movie's producer.

''Rebecca'', which Hitchcock directed, won the 1940 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] for its production company [[Selznick International Pictures]]. In addition to ''Rebecca'' and ''Suspicion'', two other films Hitchcock directed, ''Foreign Correspondent'' and ''Spellbound'', were nominated for Best Picture. Hitchcock is considered the Best Film Director of all time by The Screen Directory website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thescreendirectory.com/cat4/top_tens.php?c=40 | title=The Screen Directory | publisher=Thescreendirectory.com | accessdate=6 October 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080110062445/http%3A//www.thescreendirectory.com/cat4/top_tens.php%3Fc%3D40 |archivedate = January 10, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen films directed by Hitchcock earned Oscar nominations, though only six of those films earned Hitchcock himself a nomination. The total number of Oscar nominations (including winners) earned by films he directed is fifty. Four of those films earned Best Picture nominations. ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Music Score]]. Actor [[Joan Fontaine]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance in ''[[Suspicion (film)|Suspicion]]'', the only Academy Award–winning performance under Hitchcock's direction.

Six of Hitchcock's films are in the [[National Film Registry]]: ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', ''[[Rear Window]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'', ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'', ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''; all but ''Shadow of a Doubt'' and ''Notorious'' were also in 1998's [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|AFI's 100 best American films]] and the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|AFI's 2007 update]]. In 2008, four of Hitchcock's films were named among the ten best mystery films of all time in the [[AFI's 10 Top 10]]. Those films are ''Vertigo'' (at No. 1); ''Rear Window'' (No. 3); ''North by Northwest'' (No. 7); and ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (No. 9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres | work = ComingSoon.net | date = 17 June 2008 | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 | accessdate=18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Hitchcock received the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = American Film Institute| title = 1979: Alfred Hitchcock, 7th AFI Life Achievement Award | work = TV &amp; Events | url = http://www.afi.com/tvevents/laa/laa79.aspx | accessdate = 23 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in the 1980 [[New Year's Honours]]. Although he had adopted American citizenship in 1956, he was entitled to use the title &quot;Sir&quot; because he had remained a British subject. Hitchcock died just four months later, on 29 April, before he could be formally invested.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Fame==
[[Image:Hitchcock, Alfred 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Sir Alfred Hitchcock]]
Hitchcock became famous for his expert and largely unrivaled control of pace and suspense, and his films draw heavily on both [[fear]] and [[fantasy]]. The films are known for their droll humour and witticisms, and these cinematic works often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their  control or understanding.

Hitchcock began his directing career in the United Kingdom in 1922. From 1939 onward, he worked primarily in the United States. In September 1940, Hitchcock had purchased a {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} mountaintop estate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Women of the Rancho| author =Marion Dale Pokriots| publisher =Scotts Valley Chamber of Commerce| url =http://www.svchamber.org/svhistory/history/women.htm | accessdate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the sum of $40,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;SantaCruzInspiration&quot; /&gt; Known as the 1870 Cornwall Ranch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Alfred Hitchcock Appreciation Society|publisher =virb.com|url =http://www.virb.com/groups/65516499|accessdate =5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'Heart o' the Mountain', the property was perched high above [[Scotts Valley]], [[California]], at the end of Canham Road. The Hitchcocks resided there from 1940 to 1972. The Hitchcocks became close friends with the parents of [[Joan Fontaine]], after she starred in his film, ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SantaCruzInspiration&quot; /&gt; Years later, after a break-in at his estate, Hitchcock replaced all of the accumulated paintings with studio-made copies. The family sold the estate in 1974, six years before Hitchcock's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;SantaCruzInspiration&quot; /&gt;

Hitchcock and family also purchased a second home in late 1942 at 10957 Bellagio Road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10957 Bellagio Road Alfred Hitchcock's home| publisher=On this very spotDOTcom| url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/find/spot.php?spot_web_name=10957_Bellagio_Road| accessdate=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles, just across from the Bel Air Country Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Bel Air Country Club| url=http://www.bel-aircc.org/belair | accessdate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' was the only Hitchcock film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebecca&quot;/&gt; (though the award did not go to Hitchcock but to producer David O. Selznick); four other films were nominated. In 1967, he was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award| publisher =Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|url =http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/awards/thalberg.html| accessdate=5 March 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080109124840/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/awards/thalberg.html  |archivedate = 9 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for lifetime achievement. He never won an Academy Award for direction of a film.

==Television and books==
Along with [[Walt Disney]], Hitchcock was among the first prominent motion picture producers to fully envisage just how popular the medium of television would become. From 1955 to 1965, Hitchcock was the host and producer of a television series entitled ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents| publisher=TV.COM| url=http://www.tv.com/alfred-hitchcock-presents/show/238/summary.html | accessdate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his films had made Hitchcock's name strongly associated with suspense, the TV series made Hitchcock a celebrity himself. His [[irony]]-tinged voice and signature droll delivery, [[gallows humor]], iconic image and mannerisms became instantly recognisable and were often the subject of parody.

The title-theme of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of Hitchcock's profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes), which his real silhouette then filled. His introductions before the stories in his program always included some sort of wry humor, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one electric chair, while two are now shown with a sign &quot;Two chairs--no waiting!&quot; He directed a few episodes of the TV series himself, and he upset a number of movie production companies when he insisted on using his TV production crew to produce his motion picture ''Psycho''. In the late 1980s, a new version of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a [[Film colorization|colorised]] form.

''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was parodied by [[Friz Freleng]]'s 1961 [[cartoon]] ''[[The Last Hungry Cat]]'', which contains a plot similar to ''Blackmail''.

&quot;Hitch&quot; used a curious little tune&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Alfred Hitchcock (suspense anthology)| publisher =Media Management Group|url =http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/alfredHitchcock.html| accessdate=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the French composer [[Charles Gounod]] (1818–1893),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Filmography by year for Charles Gounod| publisher =Internet Movie Database| url =http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006111/filmoyear| accessdate =4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the composer of the 1859 opera ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', as the theme &quot;song&quot; for his television programs, after it was suggested to him by composer Bernard Herrmann. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] included the piece, ''Funeral March of a Marionette'', in one of their extended play 45 rpm discs for [[RCA Victor]] during the 1950s.

Hitchcock appears as a character in the popular juvenile detective book series, ''[[Three Investigators|Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators]]''. The long-running detective series was created by [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]], who wrote the first several books, although other authors took over after he left the series. The Three Investigators—Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw—were amateur detectives, slightly younger than the [[Hardy Boys]]. In the introduction to each book, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&quot; introduces the mystery, and he sometimes refers a case to the boys to solve. At the end of each book, the boys report to Hitchcock, and sometimes give him a memento of their case.

When the real Hitchcock died, the fictional Hitchcock in the Three Investigators books was replaced by a retired detective named Hector Sebastian. At this time, the series title was changed from ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators'' to ''The Three Investigators''.

At the height of Hitchcock's success, he was also asked to introduce a set of books with his name attached. The series was a collection of short stories by popular short-story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers. These titles included ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology]]'', ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories to be Read with the Door Locked'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery'', ''Alfred Hitchcock's A Hangman's Dozen'' and ''Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful.'' Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories; in fact, even his introductions were ghost-written. The entire extent of his involvement with the project was to lend his name and collect a check.

Some notable writers whose works were used in the collection include [[Shirley Jackson]] (''Strangers in Town'', ''[[The Lottery]]''), [[T.H. White]] (''[[The Once and Future King]]''), [[Robert Bloch]], [[H. G. Wells]] (''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]''), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Mark Twain]] and the creator of ''[[The Three Investigators]]'', [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]].

Hitchcock also wrote a mystery story for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine in 1943, &quot;The Murder of [[Monty Woolley]]&quot;. This was a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to inspect the pictures for clues to the murderer's identity; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves; such as Woolley, Doris Merrick and [[make up]] man Guy Pearce, whom Hitchcock identified, in the last photo, as the murderer. The article was reprinted in ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' Magazine in November/December 1980.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Green-anaconda.jpg|thumb|right|240px|&quot;Anaconda&quot; is often used to refer only to the common anaconda, ''[[Eunectes murinus]]''.]]

{{Otheruses4|snakes}}

An '''anaconda''' is a large, non-venomous [[snake]] found in tropical [[South America]]. Although the name actually applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species in particular, the common or green anaconda, ''[[Eunectes murinus]]'', which is one of the largest snakes in the world.

'''Anaconda''' may refer to:

* Any member of the genus ''[[Eunectes]]'', a group of large, aquatic snakes found in South America.
* ''[[Eunectes murinus]]'', a.k.a. the common anaconda, the largest species, found east of the Andes in Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and on the island of Trinidad.
* ''[[Eunectes notaeus]]'', a.k.a. the yellow anaconda, a smaller species found in eastern Bolivia, southern Brazil, Paraguay and northeastern Argentina.
* ''[[Eunectes deschauenseei]]'', a.k.a. the dark-spotted anaconda, a rare species found in northeastern Brazil and coastal French Guiana.
* ''[[Eunectes beniensis|E. beniensis]]'', a.k.a. the Bolivian anaconda, the most recently defined species found in the Departments of Beni and Pando in [[Bolivia]].
* The [[giant anaconda]], a mythical snake of enormous proportions found in South America.
* Any large snake that &quot;crushes&quot; its prey (see [[Constriction]]). Applied loosely.&lt;ref name=&quot;COED&quot;&gt;Oxford. 1991. The Compact Oxford English Dictionary. Second Edition. Clarendon Press, Oxford. ISBN 0-19-861258-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name was first used in the English language in 1768 by R. Edwin in a colorful description of a large snake found in Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), most likely a reticulated python, ''[[Python reticulatus]]''. The account, which explains how the snake crushes and devours tigers, is full of popular misconceptions, but was much read at the time and so gave rise to the myth of the Anaconda of Ceylon.&lt;ref name=&quot;TiO&quot;&gt;Boyle R. 2008. [http://sundaytimes.lk/080727/Plus/sundaytimesplus_07.html “The Anaconda of Ceylon”: Derivations and the myths] at [http://www.sundaytimes.lk/ Times Online]. Accessed 13 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various theories exist regarding the origin of the name itself. One suggests that it was derived from the [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] ''henakandaya''. However, this name is used to refer to the brown vine snake, ''[[Ahaetulla pulverulenta]]'', a slender arboreal species that grows to five feet  (152 cm) at most and feeds only on small vertebrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;TiO&quot;/&gt; Another theory by Yule and Burnell (1886) is based on an entry in the Catalogue of Indian Serpents from the Leyden Museum (Ray, 1693) that reads: ''Anacondaia Zeylonensibus, id est Bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens'', meaning &quot;the anacondaia of the Ceylonese, i.e. he that crushes the limbs of buffaloes and yoke beasts.&quot; Without a clear Sinhala connection, they suggest one from the [[Tamil language]] instead: ''anai-kondra'' (''anaik-konda''), meaning &quot;which killed an elephant.”&lt;ref name=&quot;TiO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COED&quot;/&gt;

'''Altaic''' is a proposed [[language family]] that is held by its proponents to include the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]], and possibly the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] language families and the [[Korean language|Korean]] language [[Language isolate|isolate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=A7D36A55C4A29AEB34AA39715F46F706.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=17033 Georg ''et al.'' 1999: ] 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; These languages are spoken in a wide arc stretching from northeast [[Asia]] through [[Central Asia]] to [[Anatolia]] and eastern [[Europe]] ([[Turks]], [[Kalmyks]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/maps/maps23.php?lan=en Interactive Maps The Altaic Family from The Tower of Babel]&lt;/ref&gt; The group is named after the [[Altai Mountains]], a mountain range in Central Asia.

These language families share numerous characteristics. The debate is over the origin of their similarities. One camp, often called the &quot;Altaicists&quot;, views these similarities as arising from [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|common descent]] from a Proto-Altaic language spoken several thousand years ago. The other camp, often called the &quot;anti-Altaicists&quot;, views these similarities as arising from [[language contact|areal interaction]] between the language groups concerned. Some linguists believe the case for either interpretation is about equally strong; they have been called the &quot;sceptics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Georg ''et al''. 1999:&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view accepts Altaic as a valid family but includes in it only Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic. This view was widespread prior to the 1960s, but has almost no supporters among specialists today.&lt;ref&gt;Georg ''et al''. 1999:&amp;nbsp;73-74&lt;/ref&gt; The expanded grouping, including Korean and  [[Japanese language|Japanese]], came to be known as &quot;Macro-Altaic&quot;, leading to the designation by [[retronym]] of the smaller grouping as &quot;Micro-Altaic&quot;. Most proponents of Altaic continue to support the inclusion of Korean and Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;China 2008&quot;/&gt; Some other authors also claim that Altaic is a valid family, but only including [[Japonic languages|Japonic]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]].&lt;ref&gt;Unger 1990:__&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-Altaic would include about 66 living languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=7-16 Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; to which Macro-Altaic would add Korean, Japanese, and the [[Ryukyuan languages]] for a total of about 74. (These are estimates, depending on what is considered a language and what is considered a [[dialect#&quot;Dialect&quot; or &quot;language&quot;|dialect]]. They do not include earlier states of language, such as [[Old Japanese]] or [[Ottoman Turkish language]].) Micro-Altaic would have a total of about 348 million speakers today, Macro-Altaic about 558 million.

==History==
[[Image:2006-07 altaj belucha.jpg|300px|thumb|The [[Altai Mountains]] give their name to the proposed language family.]]

The idea that the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], and [[Tungusic languages]] are each others' closest relatives was allegedly first published in 1730 by [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]], a Swedish officer who traveled in the eastern [[Russian Empire]] while a prisoner of war after the [[Great Northern War]]. However, as has been pointed out by [[Alexis Manaster Ramer]] and [[Paul Sidwell]] (1997), Strahlenberg actually opposed the idea of a closer relationship between the languages which later became known as &quot;Altaic&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. von Strahlenberg's classification was the first attempt at classification of a large number of languages some of which are Altaic.&lt;ref&gt;Poppe 1965:&amp;nbsp;125&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Altaic&quot;, as the name for a language family, was introduced in 1844 by [[Matthias Castrén]], a pioneering Finnish [[philology|philologist]] who made major contributions to the study of the [[Uralic languages]]. As originally formulated by Castrén, Altaic included not only Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus (=Tungusic) but also [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] and [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyed]].&lt;ref&gt;Poppe 1965:&amp;nbsp;126&lt;/ref&gt; Finno-Ugric and Samoyed are not included in later formulations of Altaic. They came{{When|date=February 2011}} to be grouped in a separate family, known as Uralic (though doubts long persisted about its validity). Castrén's Altaic is thus equivalent to what later{{When|date=February 2011}} came to be known as [[Ural-Altaic languages|Ural-Altaic]].&lt;ref&gt;Poppe 1965:&amp;nbsp;127&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, Ural-Altaic came to subgroup Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic as &quot;Uralic&quot; and Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic as &quot;Altaic&quot;, with [[Korean language|Korean]] sometimes added to Altaic, and less often [[Classification of the Japanese language|Japanese]].

For much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many linguists who studied Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic regarded them as members of a common Ural-Altaic family, together with Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic, based on such shared features as [[vowel harmony]] and [[Agglutinative language|agglutination]]. While the Ural-Altaic hypothesis can still be found in encyclopedias, atlases, and similar general reference works, it has not had any adherents in the linguistics community for decades. It has been characterized by [[Sergei Starostin]] as &quot;an idea now completely discarded&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Starostin ''et al''. 2003:&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1857, the Austrian scholar [[Anton Boller]] suggested adding [[Japanese language|Japanese]] to Altaic or more precisely to Ural-Altaic.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986:&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gustaf John Ramstedt|G.J. Ramstedt]] and [[Yevgeny Polivanov|E.D. Polivanov]] in the 1920s advocated the inclusion of Korean. Ramstedt's two-volume ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''Einführung in die altaische Sprachwissenschaft'' ('Introduction to Altaic Linguistics') was published in 1952–1957. He rejected the Ural-Altaic hypothesis, included Korean in Altaic, an inclusion followed by most leading Altaicists to date. The first volume, ''Lautlehre'' ('Phonology'), contained the first comprehensive attempt to identify regular correspondences between the sound systems of the Altaic language families. In 1960, Nicholas Poppe presented what was in effect a heavily revised version of Ramstedt’s volume on phonology&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1991:&amp;nbsp;298&lt;/ref&gt; that has since set the standard in Altaic studies. 

Poppe considered the issue of the relationship of Korean to Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic not settled.&lt;ref&gt;Poppe 1965:&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, there were three possibilities: (1) Korean did not belong with the other three genealogically, but had been influenced by an Altaic substratum; (2) Korean was related to the other three at the same level they were related to each other; (3) Korean had split off from the other three before they underwent a series of characteristic changes. 

[[Roy Andrew Miller]]'s 1971 book ''Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages'' convinced most Altaicists that Japanese also belonged to Altaic.&lt;ref&gt;Poppe 1976:&amp;nbsp;470&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the standard set of languages included in Altaic has comprised Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japanese. 

An alternative classification, though one with much less currency among Altaicists, was proposed by John C. Street (1962), according to which Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic forms one grouping and Korean-Japanese-Ainu another, the two being linked in a common family that Street designated as &quot;North Asiatic&quot;. The same schema was adopted by [[James Patrie]] (1982) in the context of an attempt to classify the [[Ainu languages|Ainu]] language. The Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic and Korean-Japanese-Ainu groupings were also posited by [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) who, however, treated them as independent members of a larger family, which he termed [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]].

--&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Controversy&quot; /&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;The controversy over Altaic&quot; /&gt;

Anti-Altaicists [[Gerard Clauson]] (1956), [[Gerhard Doerfer]] (1963), and [[Alexander Shcherbak]] argued that the words and features shared by Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic were for the most part borrowings and that the rest could be attributed to chance resemblances. They noted that there was little vocabulary shared by Turkic and Tungusic but not Mongolic. They reasoned that if all three families had a common ancestor, we should expect losses to happen at random, not only at the geographical margins of the family, and that the observed pattern is consistent with borrowing. Furthermore, they argued that many of the [[linguistic typology|typological]] features of the supposed Altaic languages, such as [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[Subject Object Verb|SOV]] word order, usually co-occur in languages. In sum, the idea was that Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic form a [[Sprachbund]] – the result of [[language convergence|convergence]] through intensive borrowing and long contact among speakers of languages that are not necessarily closely related. 

Doubt was also raised about the affinities of Korean and Japanese; in particular, some authors tried to connect Japanese to the [[Austronesian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Starostin ''et al''. 2003:&amp;nbsp;8–9&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starostin (1991) defends Macro-Altaic. Unger (1990) advocacates a family consisting of Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic but not Turkic or Mongolic, and Doerfer (1988) rejects all the genetic claims over these major groups. In 2003, Claus Schönig published a critical overview of the history of the Altaic hypothesis up to that time. He concluded:

:Generally, the more carefully the areal factor has been investigated, the smaller the size of the residue open to the genetic explanation has tended to become. According to many scholars it only comprises a small number of monosyllabic lexical roots, including the personal pronouns and a few other deictic and auxiliary items. For these, other possible explanations have also been proposed. Most importantly, the 'Altaic' languages do not seem to share a common basic vocabulary of the type normally present in cases of genetic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Schönig 2003:&amp;nbsp;403&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages'' was published by Starostin, Dybo, and Mudrak. It contains 2800 proposed [[cognate]] sets, a complete set of regular sound correspondences based on those proposed sets, and a number of grammatical correspondences, as well as a few important changes to the reconstruction of Proto-Altaic. For example, while most of today's Altaic languages have [[vowel harmony]], Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by Starostin et al. lacked it—instead various vowel assimilations between the first and second syllables of words occurred in Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic. It tries hard to distinguish loans between Turkic and Mongolic and between Mongolic and Tungusic from cognates, and it suggests words that occur in Turkic and Tungusic but not Mongolic; all other combinations between the five branches also occur in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Starostin ''et al''. 2003:&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; It lists 144 items of shared basic vocabulary (most of them already present in Starostin 1991), including words for such items as 'eye', 'ear', 'neck', 'bone', 'blood', 'water', 'stone', 'sun', and 'two'.&lt;ref&gt;Starostin ''et al''. 2003:&amp;nbsp;230-234&lt;/ref&gt; This work has not changed the mind of any of the principal authors in the field, however. The debate continues unabated — e.g. S. Georg 2004, A. Vovin 2005, S. Georg 2005 (anti-Altaic); S. Starostin 2005, V. Blažek 2006, M. Robbeets 2007, A. Dybo and G. Starostin 2008 (pro-Altaic). E.g. next to criticizing a bulk of erroneous and misinterpreted data, Vovin states that the authors of EDAL even willfully ignored literature they were aware of.

==Postulated Urheimat==
The earliest known texts in any of the purported Altaic languages are the [[Old Turkic script|Orkhon Turkic inscriptions]], dating from the 7th century AD. They were deciphered in 1893 by the Danish linguist [[Vilhelm Thomsen]] in a scholarly race with his rival, the Germano-Russian linguist [[Vasily Radlov|Wilhelm Radloff]]. However, Radloff was the first to publish the inscriptions. 

The prehistory of the peoples speaking these languages is largely unknown. Whereas for certain other linguistic groups, such as the speakers of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]], [[Proto-Uralic language|Uralic]], and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], we are able to frame substantial hypotheses, in the case of the proposed Altaic family everything remains to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1991:&amp;nbsp;319–320&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of written records, there are several ways to study the (pre)history of a people:

*Identification of [[archaeological culture]]s: the material remains found at dwelling sites, burial grounds, and other places where people left traces of their activity.
*[[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropology]], which studies the physical characteristics of peoples, ancient and modern.
*[[Genetics]], in particular the study of ancient DNA.
*[[Philology]], which studies the evidence in language families for their primitive locations and the nature of their cultures. (For an example, see [[Proto-Uralic language#Vocabulary|Proto-Uralic language]].) Mythology and legend often contain important clues to the earlier history of peoples.
*[[Glottochronology]], which attempts to estimate the time depth of a language family based on an assumed rate of change in languages. Related to this is [[lexicostatistics]], which attempts to determine the degree of relation between a set of languages by comparing the percentage of basic vocabulary (words like &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;heart&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;and&quot;) they share in common.
*Developing a family tree of languages and noting the relative distance of the splits that occur in it.
*Observing evidence for [[language contact|contact between languages]], which may indicate approximately when and where they were adjacent to each other.

All of these methods remain to be applied to the languages attributed to Altaic with the same degree of focus and intensity they have been applied to the Indo-European family (e.g. Mallory 1989, Anthony 2007).

It is not clear whether {{IPA|/æ/}}, {{IPA|/ø/}}, {{IPA|/y/}} were [[monophthong]]s as shown here (presumably {{IPA|[æ œ~ø ʏ~y]}}) or [[diphthong]]s ({{IPA|[i̯a~i̯ɑ i̯ɔ~i̯o i̯ʊ~i̯u]}}); the evidence is equivocal. In any case, however, they only occurred in the first (and sometimes only) syllable of any word.

Every vowel occurred in long and short versions which were different [[phoneme]]s in the first syllable. Starostin et al. (2003) treat length together with pitch as a prosodic feature.

====Prosody====
As reconstructed by Starostin et al. (2003), Proto-Altaic was a [[pitch accent]] or [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] language; at least the first, and probably every, syllable could have high or low pitch.

===Sound correspondences===
If a Proto(-Macro)-Altaic language really existed, it should be possible to reconstruct regular sound correspondences between that [[protolanguage]] and its descendants; such correspondences would make it possible to distinguish [[cognate]]s from [[loanword]]s (in many cases). Such attempts have repeatedly been made. The latest version is reproduced here, taken from Blažek's (2006) summary of the newest Altaic etymological dictionary (Starostin et al. 2003) and transcribed into the [[help:IPA|IPA]].

When a Proto-Altaic phoneme developed differently depending on its position in a word (beginning, interior, or end), the special case (or all cases) is marked with a hyphen; for example, Proto-Altaic {{IPA|/pʰ/}} disappears (marked &quot;0&quot;) or becomes {{IPA|/j/}} at the beginning of a Turkic word and becomes {{IPA|/p/}} elsewhere in a Turkic word.

====Consonants====
Only single consonants are considered here. In the middle of words, clusters of two consonants were allowed in Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by Starostin et al. (2003); the correspondence table of these clusters spans almost 7 pages in their book (83–89), and most clusters are only found in one or a few of the reconstructed roots.

¹ The [[Khalaj language]] has {{IPA|/h/}} instead. (It also retains a number of other archaisms.) However, it has also added {{IPA|/h/}} in front of words for which no initial consonant (except in some cases {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, as expected) can be reconstructed for Proto-Altaic; therefore, and because it would make them dependent on whether Khalaj happens to have preserved any given root, Starostin et al. (2003:26–28) have not used Khalaj to decide whether to reconstruct an initial {{IPA|/pʰ/}} in any given word and have not reconstructed a {{IPA|/h/}} for Proto-Turkic even though it was probably there.&lt;br /&gt;
² The [[Monguor language]] has {{IPA|/f/}} here instead (Kaiser &amp; Shevoroshkin 1988); it is therefore possible that Proto-Mongolian also had {{IPA|/f/}} which then became {{IPA|/h/}} (and then usually disappeared) in all descendants except Monguor. Tabgač and [[Khitan language|Kitan]], two extinct Mongolic languages not considered by Starostin et al. (2003), even preserve {{IPA|/p/}} in these places (Blažek 2006).&lt;br /&gt;
³ This happened when the next consonant in the word was {{IPA|/lʲ/}}, {{IPA|/rʲ/}}, or {{IPA|/r/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Before {{IPA|/i/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; When the next consonant in the word was {{IPA|/h/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; This happened &quot;in syllables with original high pitch&quot; (Starostin et al. 2003:135).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Before {{IPA|/æ/}}, {{IPA|/ø/}} or {{IPA|/y/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; When the next consonant in the word was {{IPA|/r/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; When the preceding consonant was {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/rʲ/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, or {{IPA|/lʲ/}}, or when the next consonant was {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Before {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ə/}}, or any vowel followed by {{IPA|/j/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Before {{IPA|/j/}}, or {{IPA|/i/}} and then another vowel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; When preceded by a vowel preceded by {{IPA|/i/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Before {{IPA|/a/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Starostin et al. (2003) follow a minority opinion (Vovin 1993) in interpreting the sound of the Middle Korean letter {{unicode|ᅀ}} as {{IPA|[nʲ]}} or {{IPA|[ɲ]}} rather than {{IPA|[z]}}. (Dybo &amp; Starostin 2008:footnote 50)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Before {{IPA|/u/}}.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Before {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA| /o/}}, or {{IPA|/e/}}.

====Vowels====
[[Vowel harmony]] is pervasive in the languages attributed to Altaic: most Turkic and Mongolic as well as some Tungusic languages have it, Korean is arguably in the process of losing its traces, and it is (controversially) hypothesized for Old Japanese. (Vowel harmony is also typical of the neighboring [[Uralic languages]] and was often counted among the arguments for the [[Ural-Altaic languages|Ural-Altaic hypotheses]].) Nevertheless, Starostin et al. (2003) reconstruct Proto-Altaic as lacking vowel harmony. Instead, according to them, vowel harmony originated in each daughter branch as assimilation of the vowel in the first syllable to the vowel in the second syllable (which was usually modified or lost later). &quot;The situation therefore is very close, e.g., to [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [see [[Germanic umlaut]]] or to the [[Nakh languages]] in the Eastern Caucasus, where the quality of non-initial vowels can now only be recovered on the basis of umlaut processes in the first syllable.&quot; (Starostin et al. 2003:91) The table below is taken from Starostin et al.

¹ &quot;Proto-Mongolian has lost all traces of the original prosody except for voicing *p &gt; *b in syllables with original high pitch&quot; (Starostin et al. 2003:135).&lt;br /&gt;
² &quot;[…] several secondary metatonic processes happened […] in Korean, basically in the verb subsystem: all verbs have a strong tendency towards low pitch on the first syllable.&quot; (Starostin et al. 2003:135)

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Contains the Proto-Altaic dual suffix {{IPA|-/rʲV/}}: &quot;both breasts&quot; – &quot;chest&quot; – &quot;heart&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Contains the Proto-Altaic singulative suffix -/nV/: &quot;one breast&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Compare [[Baekje]] */turak/ &quot;stone&quot; (Blažek 2006).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; This is in the Jurchen language. In modern Manchu it is ''usiha''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; This is disputed by Georg (2004),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/dia/2004/00000021/00000002/art00010?token=0058191b9d3ccda7f7e41225f406a5e2c6b4173483f3c255050576b34272c5f7b3d6d3f4e4b34a6eb76ca7f7 Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; who states: &quot;The traditional Tungusological reconstruction ''*yāsa'' [ = {{IPA|/jaːsa/}}] cannot be replaced by the nasal-initial one espoused here, needed for the comparison.&quot; However, Starostin (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/dia/2005/00000022/00000002/art00008?token=00541ba51aae7dd8d6c573d257025255c232b465340514d3874747c4e7547543c7e386f642f466fad2e3 Response to Stefan Georg's review of the Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages]&lt;/ref&gt; mentions evidence from several Tungusic languages cited by Starostin et al.

====Numerals and related words====
In the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]], the [[Number names|numerals]] are remarkably stable. This is a rather exceptional case; especially words for higher numbers are often borrowed wholesale. (Perhaps the most famous cases are Japanese and Korean, which have two complete sets of numerals each – one native, one Chinese.) Indeed, the Altaic numerals are less stable than the Indo-European ones, but nevertheless Starostin et al. (2003) reconstruct them as follows:

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; The Mongolian forms &quot;may suggest an original proto-form&quot; {{IPA|/lʲadi/}} or {{IPA|/ladi/}} &quot;with [[dissimilation]] or [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] in&quot; Proto-Mongolic (Starostin et al. 2003:224). – Kitan has {{IPA|/dol/}} '''&quot;7&quot;'''.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Austrian German''' (''German: Österreichisches Deutsch''), or ''Austrian Standard German'', is the national standard variety of the [[German language]] spoken in [[Austria]] and in the autonomous Province of [[South Tyrol]] ([[Italy]]). The standardized form of Austrian German for official texts and schools is defined by the [[Austrian dictionary]] (''Österreichisches Wörterbuch''), published under the authority of the ministry of [[education]], [[art]] and [[culture]].

== German ==
As [[German language|German]] is a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian German is merely one among several [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Standard German. Much like the relationship between [[American English|American]] and [[British English]], the Austrian and German varieties differ in minor issues (e.g., spelling, word usage and grammar) but are recognizably equivalent and largely mutually intelligible. The [[Österreichisches Wörterbuch|official Austrian dictionary]], &quot;Das Österreichische Wörterbuch&quot; gives grammar and spelling rules defining the official language. In addition to this standard variety, in everyday life most Austrians speak one of a number of [[High German languages|High German]] [[dialect]]s.

== Standard German in Austria ==
[[Image:Fußgeher-Schild.JPG|thumb|A street sign in Vienna, &quot;Fußgeher&quot; is normally replaced with &quot;Fußgänger&quot; (in English &quot;Pedestrian&quot;) in Germany.]]
With German being a [[pluricentric language]], Austrian dialects should not be confused with the variety of [[Standard German]] spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of [[Germany]] or [[Switzerland]]. Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in [[culinary]] terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and [[Administration (government)|administrative]] and [[law|legal]] language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German [[nation-state]] in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in: ''Markhardt, Heidemarie: Wörterbuch der österreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie'' (Peter Lang, 2006).

==Former Standard (spoken)==
The &quot;Former Standard,&quot; used for about 300 years or more in speech in refined language, was the &quot;Schönbrunner Deutsch,&quot; a Sociolect spoken by the imperial Habsburg Family and the nobility of [[Austria-Hungary]].  It differs from other dialects in vocabulary and pronunciation: it appears to be spoken through the nose a little, and could be compared to the [[Queen's English]]. This was not a standard in a modern sense - it was the standard &quot;upper class&quot; way of speaking. 
Here are some examples:  
*&quot;Crown Prince&quot; Otto von Habsburg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilb7VvGx1Is (English)
*Emperor Charles I. of Austria (1916-1918)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMU9FFzez1A 
*Emperor Franz Joseph (1848-1916) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jecUwMPk8pE&amp;feature=related

==Special forms in written language==
For many years, Austria had a special form of the language for official government documents.  This form is known as: &quot;Österreichische Kanzleisprache&quot; or &quot;Austrian chancellery language&quot; in English.  It is a very traditional form of the language, probably derived from Middle Ages Deeds documents, and has a very complicated structure and vocabulary which is generally reserved only for such documents.  For most speakers (even native speakers), this form of the language is generally difficult to understand, as it contains many special terms, some of which are specific in terms of use as there are diplomatic, intern, official, military etc. There are no regional variations, because this special form of written document mainly was used by government that for centuries now is based in Vienna. Currently, &quot;Österreichische Kanzleisprache&quot; is being used less and less, mostly because of various reforms in government and administration, which, in turn, led to the fewer classic civil servants, the [[Beamter]]. As a result, Standard German is replacing it in government and administrative texts.

=== European Union ===
When Austria became a member of the [[European Union]], the Austrian variety of the German language — limited to 23 agricultural terms — was “protected” in Protocol No 10, regarding the use of specific Austrian terms of the German language in the framework of the European Union, which forms part of the Austrian EU accession treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11994N/htm/11994N.html#0370010045 | title = DOCUMENTS concerning the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Norway to the European Union | accessdate = 2011-01-27 | date = 1994-08-29 | work = European Commission | quote = The specific Austrian terms of the German language contained in the Austrian legal order and listed in the Annex to this Protocol shall have the same status and may be used with the same legal effect as the corresponding terms used in Germany listed in that Annex.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian German is the only variety of a [[pluricentric language]] recognized under international law / EU primary law. All facts concerning “Protocol no. 10” are documented in Markhardt, Heidemarie: “Das österreichische Deutsch im Rahmen der EU,” Peter Lang, 2005.

== Grammar ==
===Verbs===
In [[Austria]], as in the [[German language|German]]-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]] and in southern [[Germany]], verbs that express a state tend to use ''sein'' as the [[auxiliary verb]] in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], as well as verbs of movement. [[Verbs]] which fall into this category include ''sitzen'' (to sit), ''liegen'' (to lie) and, in parts of Carinthia, ''schlafen'' (to sleep). Therefore the perfect of these verbs would be ''ich bin gesessen'', ''ich bin gelegen'' and ''ich bin geschlafen'' respectively (note: ''ich bin geschlafen'' is a very rare form, usually you will hear ''ich habe geschlafen''; but ''ich bin eingeschlafen'' [I fell asleep] is quite normal).  
In the variant of German that is spoken in Germany, the words ''stehen'' (to stand) and ''gestehen'' (to confess) are identical in the present perfect: ''habe gestanden''.  The Austrian variant avoids this potential ambiguity (''bin gestanden''  from ''stehen'', ''habe gestanden'' from ''gestehen''). 

Also, the [[preterite]] ([[simple past]]) is very rarely used in Austria, especially in the [[spoken language]], except for some modal verbs (''ich sollte'', ''ich wollte'').

== Vocabulary ==
There are many official terms that differ in Austrian German from their usage in most parts of [[Germany]].

Austrians, in particular, will say &quot;[[Grüß Gott]]&quot; (literally &quot;greet God!&quot;, meaning &quot;May God bless you&quot;) when greeting someone, rather than the &quot;Guten Tag&quot; (&quot;[Have a] good day!&quot;) used by many Germans (Bavarians excluded). Beside the official Austrian German, Austrian dialects from various regions are occasionally seen in written form, containing a large number of contractions and abbreviations compared to standard German, which can be hard to understand for non-native speakers (although the same applies to German dialects in Germany and Switzerland).

One thing which also deserves attention is one of the ways Austrians say &quot;goodbye&quot;: ''Baba'' (which is relatively informal); the Viennese use ''Servus'' which is also used as a greeting among friends.

The German dictionary publisher [[Langenscheidt]] has released an &quot;Austrian-English dictionary&quot; with 1,440 pages. It offers 130,000 terms; 2000 of which are Austriacisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langenscheidt.de/katalog/titel_langenscheidt_oesterreichisches_englisch-woerterbuch_4994_15.html Österreichisches Englisch-Wörterbuch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects and standard language: overview==
* Dialects of the [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian group]], which also comprises the dialects of German [[Bavaria]]
** [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] (along the main rivers [[Isar]] and [[Danube]], spoken in  the northern parts of the [[Salzburg (state)|State of Salzburg]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]] (''see [[Viennese German]]'') and the Northern [[Burgenland]])
** [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] (in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria (state)|Styria]], and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland).
* [[Vorarlbergerisch]], spoken in [[Vorarlberg]], is a [[High Alemannic]] dialect.
* [[Standard German]], called ''&quot;High German&quot;'' (German: ''Standardsprache'' by philologists, but generally referred to as ''Hochdeutsch'') in Austria.

== Dialects: Intercomprehensibility and regional accents ==
While strong forms of the various dialects are not normally fully comprehensible to Northern [[German people|Germans]], there is virtually no communication barrier to speakers from [[Bavaria]]. The [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] dialects are more intelligible to speakers of [[Standard German]] than the [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] dialects of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. [[Viennese language|Viennese]], the Austro-Bavarian dialect of [[Vienna]], is most frequently used in [[Germany]] for impersonations of the typical inhabitant of Austria. The people of [[Graz]], the capital of [[Styria (state)|Styria]], speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western [[Styria (state)|Styria]].

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and, after listening to a few spoken words it may be possible for an Austrian to realise which [[dialect]] is being spoken. However, in regard to the dialects of the deeper valleys of the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], other Tyroleans are often unable to understand them. Speakers from the different [[states of Austria]] can easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), those of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria (state)|Styria]], [[Vienna]], [[Upper Austria]], and the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking [[Standard German]], can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener. 

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where in the past many speakers were bilingual with [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period, particularly from what is today the [[Czech Republic]]. The German dialects of [[South Tyrol]] have been influenced by local [[Romance languages]], in particular with many [[loan words]] from [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Ladin]].

Interestingly, the geographic borderlines between the different accents ([[isogloss]]es) coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border with [[Bavaria]], with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the similarities in the language.
