Literature, visual arts, music, and scholarship have complex relationships with ideological forces.  

==The 19th Century==
In the 19th century [[nationalism]] was an especially potent influence on all of these fields.  To summarize, every established national group used cultural productions to assert and strengthen a sense of national unity and destiny; less politically consolidated groups, especially those pursuing the goal of nationhood, used them in the same ways, though often with a note of determination that makes them easier to see from our contemporary point of reference.

Natural admiration for excellence and justifiable pride in a predecessor's achievements is sometimes difficult to sort out from other intentions.  [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] was a great poet, the Societa Dantesca Italiana did great work in editing and publishing a usable and affordable text, but the ''Divine Comedy'' was certainly used by the newly unified Italian government (see [[History of Italy]]) to encourage a more homogeneous, Tuscan-influenced dialect for the whole peninsula (see [[Italian language]]).

===Visual Arts===

:[[Gothic revival]]
:art history and nationalism

===Music===

===The Academy===
This relationship between ideology and serious work is particularly ambiguous in the academic fields of historical importance.  Much as 19th century science is often treated as the inventor of conceptions of evolution and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] which had serious negative political and social consequences, many 19th century historians pursued what they intended as reasonably objective research projects in the history of their own and other regions either to end by themselves using the results to support nationalistic goals or to see their work used that way by others. 

More politically consolidated nations sponsored historical research projects which produced results of permanent value - such as the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' (&quot;Monuments of German History&quot;) project.  The ''MGH'' is a vast series (it runs to hundreds of volumes and is still publishing) of edited primary source material essential for scholarly work on late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.  However, the term &quot;German&quot; in the title was interpreted in the broadest possible sense, and its initial royal patronage made the connection clear between a perceived '''unity''' of Germanness in history and 19th century Germanness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''CRESU experiment''' ({{lang-fr|Cinétique de Réaction en Ecoulement Supersonique Uniforme}}, meaning &quot;Reaction Kinetics in Uniform Supersonic Flow&quot;) is an [[experiment]] investigating chemical reactions taking place at very low [[temperature]]s.

The technique involves the expansion of a gas or mixture of gases through a [[de Laval nozzle]] from a high pressure reservoir into a vacuum chamber. As it expands, the nozzle collimates the gas into a uniform [[supersonic]] beam that is essentially collision free and has a temperature that, in the centre of mass frame, can be significantly below that of the reservoir gas. Each nozzle produces a characteristic temperature. This way, any temperature between room temperature and about 10K can be achieved. There are relatively few CRESU apparatuses in existence for the simple reason that the gas throughput and pumping requirements are huge, which makes them expensive to run. Two of the leading centres have been the [[University of Rennes]] (France) and the [[University of Birmingham]] (UK). A more recent development has been a pulsed version of the CRESU, which requires far less gas and therefore smaller pumps. One might well ask why we should use such a complex method for producing low temperature gases when they could be produced much more easily using liquid helium. The answer is simple: most species have a negligible vapour pressure at such low temperatures and this means that they quickly condense on the sides of the apparatus. Essentially, the CRESU technique provides a &quot;wall-less flow tube,&quot; which allows the kinetics of gas phase reactions to be investigated at much lower temperatures than otherwise possible.

[[Chemical kinetics]] experiments can then be carried out in a &quot;pump-probe&quot; fashion using a laser to initiate the reaction (for example by preparing one of the reagents by [[photolysis]] of a precursor), followed by observation of that same species (for example by [[laser-induced fluorescence]]) after a known time delay. The fluorescence signal is captured by a [[photomultiplier]] a known distance downstream of the de Laval nozzle. The time delay can be varied up to the maximum corresponding to the flow time over that known distance. By studying how quickly the reagent species disappears in the presence of differing concentrations of a (usually stable) co-reagent species the [[reaction rate constant]] at the low temperature of the CRESU flow can be determined.

Reactions studied by the CRESU technique typically have no significant activation energy barrier. In the case of neutral-neutral reactions (i.e., not involving any charged species, [[ions]]), these type of barrier-free reactions usually involve free radical species such as [[molecular oxygen]] (O2), the cyanide radical (CN) or the hydroxyl radical (OH). The energetic driving force for these reactions is typically an attractive long range intermolecular potential.

CRESU experiments have been used to show deviations from [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius kinetics]] at low temperatures: as the temperature is reduced, the [[rate constant]] actually increases. They can explain why chemistry is so prevalent in the [[interstellar medium]], where many different polyatomic species have been detected (by [[radio astronomy]]), but where temperatures are so low that conventional wisdom might suggest that chemical reactions do not occur.

Cygwin provides native integration of Windows-based applications, data, and other system resources with applications, software tools, and data of the Unix-like environment. Thus it is possible to launch Windows applications from the Cygwin environment, as well as to use Cygwin tools and applications within the Windows operating context.

Cygwin consists of two parts: a [[dynamic-link library]] (DLL) as an API compatibility layer providing a substantial part of the [[POSIX]] API functionality, and an extensive collection of [[Programming tool|software tools]] and applications that provide a Unix-like [[look and feel]].

Cygwin was originally developed by [[Cygnus Solutions]], which was later acquired by [[Red Hat]]. It is [[free and open source software]], released under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2. Today it is maintained by employees of Red Hat, [[NetApp]] and many other volunteers.

==Description==
Cygwin consists of a library that implements the [[POSIX]] system call [[application programming interface|API]] in terms of [[Win32]] system calls, a [[GNU]] development toolchain (such as [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[GNU Debugger|GDB]]) to allow software development, and a large number of application programs equivalent to those on [[Unix]] systems. Many Unix programs have been ported to Cygwin, including the [[X Window System]], [[KDE]], [[GNOME]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cygwinports.dotsrc.org/ Cygwin Ports]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], and [[TeX]].  Cygwin permits installing [[inetd]], [[syslogd]], [[Secure Shell|sshd]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], and other daemons as standard Windows services, allowing Microsoft Windows systems to emulate [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] servers.

Cygwin programs are installed by running Cygwin's &quot;setup&quot; program, which downloads the necessary program and feature package files from repositories on the Internet.  Setup can install, update, and remove programs and their source code packages. A full installation may take up to 4 GB of hard disk space.

Efforts to reconcile concepts that differ between Unix and Windows systems include:
*A Cygwin-specific version of the Unix [[Mount (computing)|mount]] command allows Windows paths to be mounted as &quot;filesystems&quot; in the Unix file space. Initial mount points can be configured in &lt;code&gt;[[fstab|/etc/fstab]]&lt;/code&gt;, which has a very similar format as on Unix systems, except that Windows paths appear in place of devices. Filesystems can be mounted in binary mode (by default), or in text mode, which enables automatic conversion between [[Newline|LF and CRLF endings]] (which only affects programs that open files without explicitly specifying text or binary mode).
*Cygwin 1.7 introduced comprehensive support for POSIX [[Locale|locales]] and many [[Character encoding|character encodings]], whereby the [[UTF-8]] [[Unicode]] encoding became the default. Windows file names and other identifiers, which are encoded as [[UTF-16]], are automatically converted to and from the selected character encoding.
*Windows [[Drive letter|drive letters]] are mapped to a special directory, so for example &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt; appears as &lt;code&gt;/cygdrive/c&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;/cygdrive&lt;/code&gt; prefix can be changed. Windows network paths of the form &lt;code&gt;\\HOST\SHARE\FILE&lt;/code&gt; are mapped to &lt;code&gt;//HOST/SHARE/FILE&lt;/code&gt;. Windows paths can also be used directly from Cygwin programs, but many programs do not support them correctly, hence this is discouraged.
*Full-featured &lt;code&gt;[[/dev]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[/proc]]&lt;/code&gt; file systems are provided.  &lt;code&gt;/proc/registry&lt;/code&gt; provides direct filesystem access to the registry.
*POSIX [[Symbolic link|symbolic links]] are supported. They are represented as plain text files with the system [[attrib|attribute]] set. Cygwin 1.5 represented them as [[Windows Explorer]] [[File shortcut|shortcuts]], but this has been changed for reasons of performance and POSIX correctness. Cygwin also recognises NTFS [[NTFS junction point|junctions points]] and [[NTFS symbolic link|symbolic links]] and treats them as POSIX symbolic links, but it does not create them as their semantics are not fully POSIX-compliant.
*The [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]] API for handling [[access control list]]s (ACLs) is supported and maps to the Windows NT ACL system.
*Special formats of &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; are provided that include pointers to the Windows equivalent [[Security Identifier|SID]]s (in the [[Gecos field|GECOS field]]), allowing for mapping between Unix and Windows users and groups.
*The [[Fork (computing)|fork]] system call for duplicating a process is fully implemented, but it does not map well to the Windows API. For example, the [[copy-on-write]] optimization strategy could not be used. As a result, Cygwin's fork is rather slow compared with Linux and others. (That overhead can often be avoided by replacing uses of the [[fork-exec|fork/exec]] technique with calls to the [[spawn (computing)|spawn]] functions declared in the Windows-specific [[process.h]] header).
*The Cygwin DLL contains a console driver that emulates a Unix-style [[Terminal emulator|terminal]] within the [[Win32 console|Windows console]]. Cygwin's default user interface is the [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] shell running in the Cygwin console.
*The DLL also implements [[pseudo terminal]] (pty) devices. Cygwin ships with a number of [[terminal emulator|terminal emulators]] that are based on them, including [[mintty]], [[rxvt]]([[rxvt-unicode|-unicode]]), and [[xterm]]. These are more compliant with Unix terminal standards and user interface conventions than the Cygwin console, but are less suited for running Windows console programs.
*Various utilities are provided for converting between Windows and Unix paths and file formats, for handling line ending (CRLF/LF) issues, for displaying the [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]]s that an executable is linked with, etc.
*Apart from always being linked against the Cygwin DLL, Cygwin executables are normal Windows executables. This means that Cygwin programs have full access to the [[Windows API]] and other Windows libraries, which allows gradual porting of programs from one platform to the other. Programmers do need to be careful though about mixing conflicting POSIX and Windows functions.

The version of [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] that comes with Cygwin has various extensions for creating Windows DLLs, specifying whether a program is a windowing or console mode program, adding resources, etc.  Support for compiling programs that do not require the POSIX compatibility layer provided by the Cygwin DLL used to be included in the default gcc, but is now provided by cross compilers contributed by the [[MinGW]]-w64 project.

Cygwin is used heavily for porting many popular pieces of software to the Windows platform. It is used to compile [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[OpenOffice.org]], and even server software, like [[lighttpd]].

Red Hat normally licenses the Cygwin library under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2 with an exception to allow linking to any [[free and open source software]] whose license conforms to the [[Open Source Definition]]. Red Hat also sells commercial licenses to those who wish to redistribute programs that use the Cygwin library under [[proprietary software|proprietary]] terms.

==History==
Cygwin began in 1995 as a project of [[Steve Chamberlain]], a [[Cygnus Solutions|Cygnus]] engineer who observed that Windows NT and 95 used [[COFF]] as their [[object file format]], and that GNU already included support for [[x86]] and COFF, and the C library [[newlib]]. He thought it would be possible to retarget [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and produce a [[cross compiler]] generating executables that could run on Windows.  This proved indeed practical and a prototype was quickly developed.

The next step was to attempt to [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrap]] the compiler on a Windows system, requiring sufficient emulation of Unix to let the [[Autoconf|GNU configure]] [[shell script]] run. A [[Bourne shell]]-compatible command interpreter, such as [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], was needed and in turn a [[Fork (computing)|fork]] system call emulation and [[Standard streams|standard input/output]].  Windows includes similar functionality, so the Cygwin library just needed to provide a [[POSIX]]-compatible [[application programming interface]] (API) and properly translate calls and manage private versions of data, such as [[file descriptor]]s.

Initially, Cygwin was called gnuwin32 (not to be confused with the current [[GnuWin32]] project).  The name was changed to Cygwin32 to emphasize Cygnus' role in creating it.  When [[Microsoft]] registered the trademark [[Win32]], the 32 was dropped to simply become Cygwin.

By 1996, other engineers had joined in, because it was clear that Cygwin would be a useful way to provide Cygnus' embedded tools hosted on Windows systems (the previous strategy had been to use [[DJGPP]]).  It was especially attractive because it was possible to do a three-way cross-compile, for instance to use a hefty [[Sun workstation]] to build, say, a Windows-x-[[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] cross-compiler, which was faster than using the PC at the time.  In 1999, Cygnus offered Cygwin 1.0 as a commercial product of interest in its own right although subsequent versions have not been released, instead relying on continued open source releases.

Geoffrey Noer was the project lead from 1996-1998. Christopher Faylor has been the project lead since 1998.  Corinna Vinschen became co-lead since early 2004 when Faylor left Red Hat.

==Features==

Cygwin's default package selection is fairly minimal, containing little more than the [[bash]] shell and the core file manipulation utilities expected of a Unix command line. A wide range of additional packages are available as optional installs in Cygwin's package manager (&quot;setup.exe&quot;). These include (among much else):

* Shells (i.e. command line interpreters): [[bash]], [[Debian Almquist shell|dash]], [[Korn shell|pdksh]], [[tcsh]], [[zsh]]
* File and system utilities: [[coreutils]], [[findutils]], [[util-linux]]
* Text utilities: [[grep]], [[sed]], [[diff]], [[patch (Unix)|patch]], [[awk]]
* Terminals: [[mintty]], [[rxvt]], [[GNU Screen|screen]]
* Editors: [[emacs]], [[Joe's Own Editor|joe]], [[mined]], [[nano (text editor)|nano]], [[vim]]
* Remote login: [[OpenSSH|ssh]], [[Remote Shell|rsh]], [[telnet]]
* Remote file transfer/synchronization: [[ftp]], [[Secure copy|scp]], [[rsync]], [[Unison (file synchronizer)|unison]], [[rtorrent]]
* Compression/archiving: [[tar (file format)|tar]], [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[lzma]], [[ZIP (file format)|zip]]
* Text processing: [[TeX]], [[groff (software)|groff]], [[Ghostscript]]
* Programming languages: [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Objective-C]], [[Fortran]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Tcl]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[CLISP]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Objective Caml]], [[Prolog]]
* Development tools: [[make (software)|make]], [[autotools]], [[flex lexical analyser|flex]], [[GNU bison|bison]], [[doxygen]]
* Version control systems: [[cvs]], [[subversion]], [[git]], [[mercurial]]
* Servers: [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[BIND]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Pure-FTPd]], [[OpenSSH]], [[telnetd]], [[exim]], [[UW IMAP]]
* Clients: [[Mutt (e-mail client)|Mutt]] (email), [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] (web), [[Irssi]] (IRC), [[tin (newsreader)|tin]] (newsgroups)

The [[Cygwin/X]] project contributes an implementation of the [[X Window System]] that allows graphical Unix programs to display their user interfaces on the Windows desktop. This can be used both with local and remote programs. Cygwin ships with a fairly small number of X applications, for example:

* Terminals: [[rxvt-unicode]], [[xterm]]
* Editors: emacs-X11, gvim
* Text processors/viewers: [[LyX]], [[xpdf]], [[Device independent file format|xdvi]]

In addition to the low-level [[Xlib]] library for developing X applications, Cygwin also ships with various higher-level and cross-platform [[GUI]] frameworks, including [[Gtk+]] and [[Qt (framework)|Qt]].

The [[Cygwin Ports]] project provides many additional packages that are not available in the Cygwin distribution itself. Examples include the [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] desktop environments as well as the [[MySQL]] database and the [[PHP]] scripting language.

==Alternatives==
Several open-source and proprietary alternatives are available for simultaneous access to both Windows and UNIX environments on the same hardware.

Toolsets like [[Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX| Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX (SFU)]], [[UWIN]], [[MKS Toolkit]] for Enterprise Developers and [[Hamilton C shell]] also aim to provide a Unix-like user and development environment. They implement at least a shell and a set of the most popular utilities.  Most include the familiar GNU and/or Unix development tools, including [[make (software)|make]], [[yacc]], [[lex (software)|lex]] and a [[cc (software)|cc]] command which acts a wrapper around a supported [[C (programming language)|C]] compiler.  SFU also includes the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] compiler.

[[MinGW]] is a native [[porting|software port]] of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) to Microsoft Windows, along with a set of freely distributable import libraries and [[header files]] for the [[Windows API]]. MinGW allows developers to create native Microsoft Windows applications. In addition, a component of MinGW known as '''MSYS''' (''Minimal SYStem''), which was derived from Cygwin version 1.3.3, provides a minimal Unix-like [[shell (computer science)|shell]] environment including [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] and a selection of [[POSIX]] tools sufficient to enable [[autoconf]] scripts to run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mingw.org/wiki/MSYS MSYS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are numerous virtualization solutions that provide [[x86]] [[platform virtualization]] to run Windows and Unix-like operating systems simultaneously on the same hardware, but without the integration of the environments that Cygwin provides. Some, like [[VirtualBox]] and [[VMware Player]] run on Windows and Linux hosts and can run many other operating systems. [[Cooperative Linux]] (in short coLinux) runs a full, but modified Linux kernel like a driver under Windows, effectively making Windows and Linux two [[coroutines]], using [[cooperative multitasking]] to switch between them.

[[Wine (software)|Winelib]], a part of the Wine project, is the inverse of Cygwin - it is a [[free and open source software|free and open source]] [[compatibility layer]] for [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s on the [[x86 architecture|x86]] or [[x86-64]] architecture that can allow programs written for [[Microsoft Windows]] to run on Unix-like operating systems. Unlike Cygwin which requires &quot;You rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on Windows&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cygwin homepage section &quot;What Isn't Cygwin?&quot;|url=http://www.cygwin.com/|publisher=Cygwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; the full Wine product supports executing unmodified Windows binaries.

'''Corinth''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Κόρινθος, ''Kórinthos'') ({{IPA-el|ˈkorinθos||Ell-Korinthos.ogg}}) is a city and former municipality in [[Corinthia]], [[Peloponnese Periphery|Peloponnese]], [[Greece]]. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality [[Corinth (municipality)|Corinth]], of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the capital of Corinthia. 

It was founded, as '''Nea''' or '''New Corinth''' in 1858, after an earthquake destroyed the existing settlement of Corinth, which had developed in and around the site of [[ancient Corinth]]. 

==Location==
Located about {{convert|78|km|mi|0}} southwest of [[Athens]], Corinth is surrounded by the coastal townlets of (clockwise) [[Lechaio]], [[Isthmia (village)|Isthmia]], [[Kechries]], and the inland townlets of [[Examilia]] and the archaeological site and village of ancient Corinth. Geophysically the city is likewise surrounded by the narrow coastal plain of [[Vocha (plain of)|Vocha]], Corinthian Gulf, [[Corinth Canal]], the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], Saronic Gulf, [[Oneia Mountains]], and the monolithic rock of [[Acrocorinth]], where the medieval [[acropolis]] was built.

==History==
{{Main|Ancient Corinth}}
Corinth derives its name from [[Ancient Corinth]], a [[city-state]] of antiquity. In 1858, the old city of Corinth (now known as Archaia Korinthos (Αρχαία Κόρινθος), located {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} SW of the modern city), was totally destroyed by an earthquake. This led to the establishment of '''Nea''' or '''New Corinth''', on the coast of the Gulf of Corinth. New Corinth was rebuilt after a further earthquake in 1928 and again after a great fire in 1933. 

==Population==
Corinth is the second largest city in the [[Peripheries of Greece|periphery]] of the Peloponnese after [[Kalamata]] (53,659 inhabitants in 2001). In the 1991 census, the city had a population of 28,071, while the latest data (2001) showed an increase of 2,363 inhabitants (+8,4%), to 30,434. Between the census of 1981 and 1991, the city had one of the fastest-increasing populations in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The Municipality of Corinth, or ''Dimos Korinthion'', had a population of 36,991 in 2001. The municipality includes the town of Archaia Korinthos (1,770 inhabitants), the town of Examilia (1,547 inhabitants), and the smaller settlements of [[Xylokeriza]] (777 inhabitants) and [[Solomos,Corinthia|Solomos]] (686 inhabitants).

==Port==
The port of Corinth, located north of the city centre and close to the northwest entrance of the [[Corinth Canal]], at 37 56.0’ N / 22 56.0’ E , serves the local needs of industry and agriculture. It is mainly a cargo exporting facility. 

It is an artificial harbour (depth approximately {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=off|lk=off}}, protected by a concrete [[mole (architecture)|mole]] (length approximately 930 metres, width 100 metres, mole surface 93,000 m2). A new pier finished in the late 1980s doubled the capacity of the port. The reinforced mole protects anchored vessels from strong northern winds. 

Within the port operates a [[customs]] office facility and a [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] post. Sea traffic is limited to trade in the export of local produce, mainly citrus fruits, grapes, marbles, aggregates and some domestic imports. The port operates as a contingency facility for general cargo ships, [[bulk carrier]]s and [[RORO]]s, in case of [[strike action|strike]]s at [[Piraeus]] port. There is a [[ferry]] line (RORO) connecting Corinth to [[Italy]].

==Industry==
Corinth is a major industrial hub at a national level. Copper cables, petroleum products, medical equipment, marble, gypsum, ceramic tiles, salt, mineral water and beverages, meat products, and gums are produced nearby. As of 2005, a period of de-industrialization has commenced as a large pipework complex, a textile factory and a meat packing facility disrupted their operations.

==Transport==
Corinth is a major road hub, being the entry point to the Peloponnesian peninsula, the southernmost area of continental Greece.

The city has been connected to the [[Proastiakos]], the Athens suburban rail network, since 2005, when the new [[Corinth railway station]] was completed. 

==Sport==
The city's [[association football]] team is [[Korinthos F.C.]] (''Π.Α.E. Κόρινθος''), established in 1999 after the merger of Pankorinthian Football Club (''Παγκορινθιακός'') and Corinth Football Club (''Κόρινθος''). During the 2006-2007 season, the team played in the Greek Fourth Division's Regional Group 7. The team went undefeated that season and it earned the top spot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paskorinthos.gr/2006-2007.html&lt;/ref&gt; This granted the team a promotion to the [[Gamma Ethniki|Gamma Ethnikí (Third Division)]] for the 2007-2008 season. For the 2008-2009 season, Korinthos F.C. competed in the Gamma Ethniki (Third Division) southern grouping.

[[Image:Mikharkhangel3.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Miracle of [[St. Michael]] at Chonae'', a 15th-century [[Russian icon]].]]

'''Colossae''' or '''Colosse''' (also known as '''Chonae''' or ''' Kona'''; [[Greek language|Greek]]:  [[wikt: Κολοσσαί|Κολοσσαί]], Χωναί/Χῶναι), was an ancient city of [[Phrygia]], on the [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]], which is a tributary of the [[Maeander River]]. It was situated about 12 miles above [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]], and near the great road from [[Ephesus]] to the [[Euphrates]]. The site, located near the modern town of [[Honaz]] in [[Turkey]], has never been excavated.

==Ancient history==
In [[396]] B.C., during the [[Persian Wars]], the satrap [[Tissaphernes]] was lured to Colossae and slain by an agent of the party of [[Cyrus the Younger]]. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] tells that the wool of Colossae gave its name (''colossinus'') to the colour of the [[cyclamen]] flower. During the [[Hellenistic]] period, the town was of some mercantile importance, although by the first century it had dwindled greatly in size and significance.

It does not appear that [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] had visited this city when he wrote his [[Epistle to the Colossians]] there ({{bibleverse||Col.|1:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Col.|2:1|ESV}}), since he tells [[Philemon of Colossae|Philemon]] of his hope to visit it upon being freed from prison (see [[Philemon 1:22]]). It seems that [[Epaphras]] was the founder of the [[Colossian church]] (see {{bibleverse||Col.|1:7|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Col.|4:12|KJV}}).

This town fell into decay (possibly due to an earthquake) and the Byzantine town of Chonæ occupied a site near its ruins. A look at the classical, Byzantine, and otherwise medieval literature mentioning the site reveals a name change for part or all of Colossae to Cona or Chonae. The town was the birthplace of the Byzantine Greek writers [[Nicetas Choniates|Nicetas]] and [[Michael Choniates]].

==Miracle of the Archangel Michael==&lt;!-- [[Miracle of the Archangel Michael at Chonae]] redirects here --&gt;
In Byzantine and Russian art, the theme of the ''Miracle of the Archangel Michael at Chonae'' (''Τὸ ἐν Χωναῖς/Χῶναις Θαῦμα τοῦ Ἀρχαγγέλου Μιχαήλ'') is intimately linked with the site.  [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Sacred Tradition|tradition]] tells that the [[paganism|pagans]] directed the stream of a river against the sanctuary of St. Michael there to destroy it, but [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] appeared and split the rock by lightning to give a new bed to the stream, diverting the flow away from the church and sanctifying forever the waters which came from the gorge. The Orthodox celebrate a feast in commemoration of this event on 6 September. The [[Chudov Monastery|Monastery of the Miracle]] (Chudov Monastery) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where the Russian [[Tsar]]s were [[baptism|baptized]], was dedicated to the Feast of the Miracle at Kona.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Charge of the Goddess''' is a traditional inspirational text sometimes used in the [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. Several versions exist, though they all have the same basic premise, that of a set of instructions given by a Great Goddess to her worshippers. The most well known version is that written by [[Gerald Gardner]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Orpheus&quot;&gt;﻿{{Cite news

| issue = 30
| pages = 14–18
| last = Orpheus

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rewritten by his High Priestess [[Doreen Valiente]] in the mid 1950s, which is contained within the traditional [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] [[Book of Shadows]].

Several different versions of a Wiccan ''[[Charge of the God]]'' have since been created to mirror and accompany the ''Charge of the Goddess''.

== Themes ==
[[File:Isis Musei Capitolini MC744.jpg|thumb|The goddess [[Isis]], holding a [[sistrum]] and [[oinochoe]].]]
The opening paragraph names a collection of goddesses, some derived from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology]], others from [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] or [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian]] [[legend]]s, affirming a belief that these various figures represent a single [[Mother goddess|Great Mother]]:
:''Listen to the words of the Great Mother; she who of old was also called among men [[Artemis]], [[`Ashtart|Astarte]], [[Athene]], [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]], [[Melusine]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Cerridwen]], [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Dana]], [[Arianrhod]], [[Isis]], [[Brigid|Bride]], and by many other names.''

This theme echoes the ancient Roman belief that the [[Goddess]] [[Isis]] was known by ten thousand names.

The second paragraph is largely derived and paraphrased from the words that Aradia, the messianic daughter of [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], speaks to her followers in [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s 1899 book ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]''. The third paragraph is largely written by [[Doreen Valiente]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} with some phrases adapted from ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' and ''[[The Gnostic Mass]]'' by [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orpheus&quot; /&gt;

The charge affirms that ''all'' acts of love and pleasure are sacred to the Goddess.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let my worship be within the heart that rejoices,
for behold, all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals.
Therefore, let there be beauty and strength,
power and compassion, honor and humility,
mirth and reverence within you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
=== Ancient Precedents ===
In book eleven, chapter 47 of [[Apuleius]]'s ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', [[Isis]] delivers what Ceisiwr Serith calls &quot;essentially a charge of a goddess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Serith

  | accessdate = 2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is rather different to the modern version known in Wicca, though they have the same premise, that of the rules given by a great Mother Goddess to her faithful.

=== Wiccan Charge ===
The earliest known Wiccan version is found in a document dating from the late 1940s, and draws extensively from [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'' and other modern sources,&lt;ref name=&quot;serith1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm|first=Ceisiwr|last= Serith|title=The Sources of the Charge of the Goddess|accessdate =23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly from the works of [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orpheus&quot; /&gt; The oldest identifiable source is the 17th century ''Centrum Naturae Concentratum'' of [[Ali Puli|Alipili]] (or Ali Puli).&lt;ref name=&quot;serith1&quot; /&gt;

It is believed to have been compiled by [[Gerald Gardner]]&lt;ref name=&quot;serith1&quot;/&gt; or possibly another member of the [[New Forest coven]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HeseltonCauldron&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |pages=300–1 |location=Milverton, Somerset |publisher=Capall Bann}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doreen Valiente]], a student of Gardner, took his version from his ''[[Book of Shadows]]'' and adapted it into [[poetry|verse]], and later into another [[prose]] version.

The initial verse version by [[Doreen Valiente]] consisted of eight verses, the second of which was :

:''Bow before My spirit bright''
:''Aphrodite, Arianrhod''
:''Lover of the Hornéd God''
:''Queen of witchery and night''&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Valiente was unhappy with this version, saying that &quot;people seemed to have some difficulty with this, because of the various goddess-names which they found hard to pronounce&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; and so she rewrote it as a prose version, much of which differs from her initial version, and is more akin to Gardner's version. This prose version has since been modified and reproduced widely by other authors.

'''Denton True &quot;Cy&quot; Young''' (March 29, 1867 – November 4, 1955) was an American [[Major League Baseball]]  [[pitcher]]. During his 22-year baseball career, he pitched from 1890-1911 for five different teams. Young was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1937. One year after Young's death, the [[Cy Young Award]] was created to honor the previous season's best pitcher. 

Young established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for a century. Young compiled 511 [[Win (baseball)|wins]], 94 ahead of [[Walter Johnson]], who is second on the [[List of Major League Baseball leaders in career wins|list of most wins in Major League history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/pitching/piwins2.shtml |title=Career Leaders for Wins |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to wins, Young still holds the Major League records for most career [[innings pitched]] (7,355), most career games started (815), and most [[complete game]]s (749).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_ip.shtml |title=Innings Pitched Records |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_gams.shtml |title=Games Started Records |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_gamcg.shtml |title=Complete Games Records |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also retired with 316 [[Loss (baseball)|losses]], the most in MLB history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/loss-records.shtml |title=Games Lost Records |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young's 76 career shutouts are fourth all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/historical/leaders.jsp?c_id=mlb&amp;baseballScope=mlb&amp;statType=2&amp;sortByStat=SHO&amp;timeFrame=3&amp;timeSubFrame2=0|title=Pitching Leaders, Career All Time|publisher=mlb.com|accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won at least 30 games in a season five times, with ten other seasons of 20 or more wins.&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/youngcy01.shtml |title=Cy Young Statistics |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work= |publisher=''baseball-reference.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Young pitched three [[no-hitter]]s, including the third [[perfect game]] in baseball history, first in baseball's &quot;modern era&quot;.{{ref_label|A|a|none}} In 1999, 88 years after his final Major League appearance and 44 years after his death, [[literary editor|editors]] at ''[[The Sporting News]]'' ranked Cy Young 14th on their list of &quot;Baseball's 100 Greatest Players&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml |title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players |accessdate=2008-07-16 |work= |publisher=''[[The Sporting News]]'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, baseball fans named him to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].

Young's career started in 1890 with the [[Cleveland Spiders]]. After eight years with the Spiders, Young was moved to [[1899 St. Louis Perfectos season|St. Louis]] in 1899. After two years there, Young jumped to the newly-created [[American League]], joining the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston]] franchise. He was traded back to [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]] in 1909, before spending the final two months of his career with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Rustlers]]. After his retirement, Young went back to his farm in [[Ohio]], where he stayed until his death at age 88 in 1955.

==Early life==
Cy Young was the oldest child born to McKinzie Young Jr. and Nancy Miller. The couple had four more children: Carl, Lon, Ella, and Otto. When the couple married, McKinzie's father gave him the {{convert|54|acre|m2}} of farm land he owned.&lt;ref name=browning&gt;{{cite book |last= Browning |first= Reed |coauthors= |title= Cy Young: A Baseball Life |publisher= Univ of Massachusetts Press |year= 2003 |month= |isbn= 1558493980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was born in Gilmore, a tiny farming community located in [[Washington Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio]]. He was christened Denton True Young. Some sources later, and even today, list his middle name erroneously as &quot;[[Tecumseh]]&quot;, apparently as a result of being nicknamed &quot;The Chief&quot; by teammates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=SzIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=denton+tecumseh+young&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UOgKvJLqQg&amp;sig=pkSlWLT8xwL7rgGWbER-hT9xOEA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6HdIS6ibOZHOM92L5I8J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=denton%20tecumseh%20young&amp;f=false ''Baseball Digest'']. November 1975, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was raised on one of the local farms and went by the name Dent Young in his early years.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/biography.htm |title=Cy Young Biography |accessdate=2007-06-14 |work= |publisher=''[[CMG Worldwide]]'' |date= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070602024410/http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/biography.htm |archivedate = June 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was also known as &quot;Farmer Young&quot; and &quot;Farmboy Young&quot;. Young stopped his formal education after he completed the [[sixth grade]]&lt;ref name=dugout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/dugout0e.shtml |title=Cy Young : A Life In Baseball |accessdate=2007-06-23 |work= Dr. Donald McKim |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; so he could help out on the family's farm. In 1885, Young moved with his father to [[Nebraska]], and in the summer of 1887, they returned to Gilmore. 

Cy Young played for many amateur baseball leagues during his youth, including a &quot;semi-pro&quot; Carrollton team in 1888. Young pitched and played second base. The first box score known containing the name Young came from that season. In that game, Young played first base and had three hits in three at-bats. After the season, Young received an offer to play for the minor league Canton team, which started Young's professional career.&lt;ref name=browning/&gt;

==Professional career==
===Before Major League Baseball===
Young began his professional career in {{Baseball Year|1889}} with the [[Canton, Ohio]] team of the [[Tri-State League]], a professional minor league. During his tryout, Young impressed the scouts, recalling years later, &quot;I almost tore the boards off the grandstand with my fast ball.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/deaths/cy_young_obituary.shtml |title=Cy Young Obituary |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=1955-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cy Young's nickname came from the fences that he had destroyed using his fastball. The fences looked like a cyclone (tornado) had hit them. Reporters later shortened the name to &quot;Cy&quot;, which became the nickname Young used for the rest of his life, although the Ken Burns' baseball series credited his nickname starting by his pro teammates as &quot;Cyrus&quot;, due to his rural upbringing and bearing.&lt;ref name=bl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Cy_Young_1867 |title=The Ballplayers - Cy Young  |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''baseball-library.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During Young's one year with the Canton team, he won 15 games and lost 15.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Franchises in the [[National League]], the major professional sports league at the time, wanted the best players available to them. Therefore, in {{Baseball Year|1890}}, Young signed with the [[Cleveland Spiders]], a team which had moved up from the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] to the National League the previous year.

===Cleveland Spiders===
On August 6, 1890, Young's major league debut, he pitched a three-hit [[Shutouts in baseball|shutout]].&lt;ref name=1890chron&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1890#August |title=1890 Chronology |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''baseball-library.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Young was on the Spiders, [[Chief Zimmer]] was his catcher more often than any other player. [[Bill James]], a baseball [[statistician]], estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other [[Battery (baseball)|battery]] in baseball history.&lt;ref name=abstract&gt;James, Bill. ''The New Bill James Historical Abstract'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001), pp. 410-411&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Young established himself as one of the harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his [[baseball glove]] to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball.&lt;ref name=abstract/&gt; In the absence of [[radar gun]]s, however, it is difficult to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On the last day of the season, Young won both games of a doubleheader.&lt;ref name=dugout/&gt; In the first weeks of Young's career, [[Cap Anson]], the player-manager of the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Colts]] spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager [[Gus Schmelz]], &quot;He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1890|r=0}}}} in current dollar terms) for him.&quot; Schmelz replied, &quot;Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube.&quot;&lt;ref name=quotes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/quotes.htm |title=Cy Young: Quotes |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''[[CMG Worldwide]]'' |date= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071229062724/http://www.cmgworldwide.com/baseball/young/quotes.htm |archivedate = December 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cy Young 1893.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An 1893 baseball card of Young]]
Two years after Young's debut, the National League moved the [[Baseball field#Pitcher's mound|pitcher's position]] back by {{convert|5|ft|m}}. Since {{by|1881}}, pitchers had pitched within a &quot;box&quot; whose front line was {{convert|50|ft|m}} from home base, and since {{by|1887}} they had been compelled to toe the back line of the box when delivering the ball. The back line was {{convert|55|ft|6|in|m}} away from home. In 1893, {{convert|5|ft|m}} was added to the back line, yielding the modern pitching distance of {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}}. In the book ''[[The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers]]'', [[Sports journalism|sports journalist]] [[Rob Neyer]] wrote that the speed with which pitchers like Cy Young, [[Amos Rusie]], and [[Jouett Meekin]] threw was the impetus that caused the move.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite book | last=Neyer | first=Rob | coauthors=Bill James | title=[[The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers]] | publisher=Fireside | year=2004 | pages=496 | month=June | isbn=0-7432-6158-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{by|1892}} regular season was a success for Young, who led the National League in wins (36), ERA (1.93), and shutouts (9). Just as many contemporary Minor League Baseball leagues operate today, the National League was using a [[split season]] format during the 1892 season.&lt;ref name=1892spiders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n20_v216/ai_14655929 |title=Of double seasons, Spiders and no fall stakes |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work=Steve Gietschier |publisher=''[[The Sporting News]]'' |date=1993-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atlanta Braves#Boston|Boston Beaneaters]] won the first-half title, and the Spiders won the second-half title, with a best-of-nine series determining the league champion. Despite the Spiders' second half run, the Beaneaters swept the series, five games to none. Young pitched three complete games in the series, but lost two decisions. He also threw a complete game shutout, but the game ended in a 0&amp;ndash;0 tie.

The Spiders faced the [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[Temple Cup]], a precursor to the [[World Series]], in {{by|1895}}. Young won three games in the series and Cleveland won the Cup, four games to one. It was around this time that Young added what he called a &quot;slow ball&quot; to his pitching repertoire to reduce stress on his arm. The pitch today is called a [[changeup]].&lt;ref name=dugout/&gt; 

In {{by|1896}}, Young lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning when [[Ed Delahanty]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] hit a single.&lt;ref name=1896chron&gt;{{Cite web| title=1896 Chronology | work=baseball-library.com | url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1896#July | accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first [[no-hitter]] of his career in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders committed four [[Error (baseball)|errors]] while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a [[Hit (baseball)|hit]], but the Cleveland [[third baseman]] sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.&lt;ref name=1897chron&gt;{{Cite web| title=1897 Chronology | work=baseball-library.com | url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1897#September | accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift to St. Louis===
Prior to the {{by|1899}} season, Frank Robison, the Spiders owner, bought the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]], thus owning two clubs at the same time. The Browns were renamed the &quot;Perfectos,&quot; and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including three future Hall of Famers: Young, [[Jesse Burkett]], and [[Bobby Wallace (baseball)|Bobby Wallace]].&lt;ref name=perfectos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcnet.org/~dlfleitz/cleve.htm |title=The 1899 Cleveland Spiders |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work=David Fleitz |publisher=''wcnet.org'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and {{by|1900}}. Meanwhile, the depleted Spiders lost 134 games, the most in MLB history, before folding. Young spent two years with St. Louis, which is where he found his favorite catcher, [[Lou Criger]]. The two men were teammates for a decade.&lt;ref name=dugout/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/cy-young-award |title=Biography:Cy Young |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''answers.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to the American League===
[[File:Cy Young.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Young in 1902]]
In 1901, the rival [[American League]] declared major league status and set about raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis and joined the American League's [[History of the Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]] for a $3,500 contract (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3500|1901|r=0}}}} in current dollar terms). Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In his first year in the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young led the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA{{ref_label|B|b|none}}, thus earning the colloquial [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown#American League|AL Triple Crown]] for pitchers.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Young won almost 42% of his team's games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team's 79 wins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php? |title=Cy Young from the Chronology |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''baseball-library.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1902, before the start of the baseball season, Young served as a pitching coach at [[Harvard University]]. The sixth-grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers.&lt;ref name=dugout/&gt; The following year, Young coached at [[Mercer University]] during the spring. The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903, 1904, and 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Spright Dowell, A History of Mercer University, 1833-1953 (Macon, Ga.: Mercer University, [1958][http://ourcollegetown.net/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=4#12]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston Americans played the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first modern [[World Series]] in 1903. Young, who started [[1903 World Series#Game 1|Game One]] against the visiting Pirates, thus threw the first pitch in modern World Series history. The Pirates scored four runs in that first inning, and Young lost the game. Young performed better in subsequent games, winning his next two starts. He also drove in three runs in [[1903 World Series#Game 5|Game Five]]. Young finished the series with a 2&amp;ndash;1 record and a 1.85 ERA in four appearances, and Boston defeated Pittsburgh, five games to three games.

After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] pitcher [[Rube Waddell]] taunted Young to face him so that he could repeat his performance against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a [[perfect game]] against Waddell and the Athletics.{{ref_label|A|a2|none}} It was the first perfect game in American League history.{{ref_label|A|a3|none}}&lt;ref name=bbhof&gt;{{Cite web| title=Hall of Fame profile | work=baseballhalloffame.org | url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=124692 | accessdate=2007-06-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013200502/http://baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=124692 |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/boxscore/05051904.shtml |title=Cy Young Perfect Game Box Score |accessdate=2008-07-27 |work= |publisher=''baseball-almanac.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, &quot;How do you like that, you hayseed?&quot; Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 24.1 innings, or 73 hitless batters.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, p.76, ISBN 0-917050-08-8, Retrieved on 2008-08-03&lt;/ref&gt; Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games.{{ref_label|A|a3|none}} This occurred in 1880, when [[Lee Richmond]] and [[John Montgomery Ward|John Ward]] pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only {{convert|45|ft|m}} from home base (the modern release point is about {{convert|10|ft|m}} farther away); walks required eight [[Strike zone|balls]]; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 4&amp;ndash;2, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: &quot;For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in.&quot;&lt;ref name=waddell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/rubevscy.htm |title=Waddell vs Young |accessdate=2007-06-23 |work=By Daniel O’Brien |publisher=''philadelphiaathletics.org''|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.

[[File:Cy young.jpg|thumb|left|125px|A 1911 baseball card of Young]]
In 1908, Young pitched the third no-hitter of his career. Three months past his 41st birthday, Cy Young was the oldest pitcher to record a no-hitter, a record which would stand 82 years until 43-year-old [[Nolan Ryan]] surpassed the feat. Only a walk kept Young from his second perfect game. After that runner was caught stealing, no other batter reached base. At this time, Young was the second-oldest player in either league. In another game one month before his no-hitter, he allowed just one single while facing 28 batters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot;/&gt; On August 13, 1908, the league celebrated &quot;Cy Young Day.&quot; No American League games were played on that day, and a group of All-Stars from the league's other teams gathered in Boston to play against Young and the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cy Young Day | work = brainyhistory.com | url=http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1908/august_13_1908_72365.html | accessdate = 2006-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland Naps and retirement===
Young was traded back to Cleveland, the place where he played over half his career, before the 1909 season, to the [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Naps]] of the American League. The following season, 1910, he won his 500th career game on July 23 against Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F10915FA395D11738DDDAD0A94DF405B808DF1D3 NY Times article &quot;Cy Young's Great Record&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He split {{by|1911}}, his final year, between the Naps and the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Rustlers]].

On September 22, 1911, Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates, 1&amp;ndash;0, for his last career victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1911/B09220PIT1911.htm |title=Boston Rustlers 1, Pittsburgh Pirates 0 |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work= |publisher=''retrosheet.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final start two weeks later, the last eight batters of Young's career combined to hit a [[Triple (baseball)|triple]], four [[Single (baseball)|singles]], and three [[Double (baseball)|doubles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1911/B10062BRO1911.htm |title=Brooklyn Superbas 13, Boston Rustlers 3 (2) |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work= |publisher=''retrosheet.com'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After baseball==
[[File:Cy Young etc 1912.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Young (far left) with (L to R) [[Jake Stahl]] and [[Bill Carrigan]] during spring training in 1912.]]
From 1912 until his death in 1955, Cy Young lived and worked on his farm. His wife, Robba, whom he had known since childhood, died in 1933.&lt;ref name=browning/&gt;&lt;ref name=dugout/&gt; After she died, Young tried several jobs, and eventually moved in with friends John and Ruth Benedum and did odd jobs for them. Young took part in many baseball events after his retirement.&lt;ref name=dugout/&gt; In 1937, 26 years after he retired from baseball, Cy Young was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was among the first to donate mementos to the Hall.

On November 4, 1955, Cy Young died on his farm at the age of 88. He was buried in [[Peoli, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cy Young | work = retrosheet.com | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/Y/Pyounc102.htm | accessdate = 2006-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball legacy==
Young retired with 511 career wins. His win total set the record for most career wins by a pitcher. At the time, [[Pud Galvin]] had the second most career wins with 364. [[Walter Johnson]], then in his fourth season, finished his career with 417 wins and, as of 2010, is second on the list. In 1921, Johnson broke Young's career record for strikeouts.&lt;ref&gt;SABR, p.210, ISBN 978-1-4165-3245-3 Retrieved on 2008-08-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Cy Young's career is seen as a bridge from baseball's earliest days to its modern era; he pitched against stars such as [[Cap Anson]], already an established player when the [[National League]] was first formed in 1876, as well as against [[Eddie Collins]], who played until 1930. When Young's career began, pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes. The pitcher's mound was not moved back to its present position of {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} until Young's fourth season; he did not wear a glove until his sixth season.&lt;ref name=dugout/&gt;

[[File:CyYoung photo and painting1.JPG|thumb|left|300px|A photo of Young taken in 1908 was the source for a painting that was displayed in the Baseball Hall of Fame.]]
Young led his league in wins five times (1892, 1895, and 1901&amp;ndash;1903), finishing second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two more than the runners-up, [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Warren Spahn]]. Young won two [[Earned run average|ERA]] titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, but this was not uncommon during the [[dead-ball era]]. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]] ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Cy Young is tied with [[Roger Clemens]] for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise.&lt;ref name=redsoxleaders&gt;{{Cite web| title=Boston Red Sox All-Time Leaders | work=mlb.com | url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/stats/historical/player_stats.jsp?c_id=bos&amp;baseballScope=BOS&amp;teamPosCode=all&amp;statType=2&amp;sitSplit=&amp;venueID=&amp;timeFrame=3&amp;timeSubFrame2=0&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;timeSubFrame=0&amp;&amp;sortByStat=W | accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly after his fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, &quot;Some may have thought it was essential to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control.&quot;&lt;ref name=quotes /&gt; In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Cy Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games.&lt;ref name=1897chron /&gt; By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in [[spring training]]. &quot;I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it,&quot; said Young, &quot;and there wasn't any use wasting them.&quot; Young once described his approach before a game:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I never warmed up ten, fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.&quot;&lt;ref name=quotes /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Quote box |width= 18em |border= 4px |align= right|bgcolor= #FAF0E6 |halign= center | title=''[[Line-Up for Yesterday]]''|quote=''Y is for Young''&lt;br/&gt;''The magnificent Cy;''&lt;br/&gt;''People batted against him,''&lt;br/&gt;''But I never knew why.''

By the time of his retirement, Young's control had faltered. Young had also gained weight.&lt;ref name=dugout/&gt; In three of his last four years, he was the oldest player in the league.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

In 1956, about one year after Young's death, the Cy Young Award was created. The first award was given to Brooklyn's [[Don Newcombe]]. Originally, it was a single award covering the whole of baseball. The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967, one for each league.

On September 23, 1993, a statue dedicated to him was unveiled by [[Northeastern University]] on the site of the Red Sox's original stadium, the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]]. It was there that Young had pitched the first game of the 1903 World Series, as well as the first perfect game in the modern era of baseball.  A home plate-shaped plaque next to the statue reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;On October 1, 1903 the first modern World Series between the American League champion Boston Pilgrims (later known as the Red Sox) and the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates was played on this site. General admission tickets were fifty cents. The Pilgrims, led by twenty-eight game winner Cy Young, trailed the series three games to one but then swept four consecutive victories to win the championship five games to three.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Boston's Pastime|title=Huntington Avenue Grounds: The Pre-Fenway Era |url=http://www.bostonspastime.com/stories/huntington.html|accessdate=200-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Young's 1955 obituary also used the phrase.

'''''Coronation Street''''' is a long-running British [[soap opera]] set in [[Weatherfield]], a fictional town based on [[City of Salford|Salford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=344239 |title=Far cry from rain-soaked rooftops of Weatherfield|quote=Salford's rows of terraced houses were the inspiration for the fictional Weatherfield in the soap Coronation Street |publisher=Times Educational Supplement|work=TES Connect |date=2 March 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[North West England]]. Created by [[Tony Warren]], it was first broadcast on 9 December 1960 by [[Granada Television]] and has been shown in all regions of [[ITV]] almost throughout its existence. 

Since first being aired it has been one of the most financially lucrative programmes on commercial television, underpinning the success of its broadcaster [[ITV]], and on 17 September 2010 became the world's longest-running TV soap opera currently in production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hemley&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coronation Street breaks two world records|first=Matthew|last=Hemley|work=The Stage|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29700/coronation-street-breaks-two-world-records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== 1960s ===
[[File:Ken barlow.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]] in the first episode of ''Coronation Street''.]]
The [[Coronation Street: The First Episode|first episode]] was aired on 9 December 1960 and was not initially a critical success; a columnist in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' claimed the series would only last three weeks. Granada Television commissioned only 13 episodes and some inside the company doubted the show would last its planned production run.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negativity, viewers were immediately drawn to the serial, won over by ''Coronation Street'''s 'ordinary' characters.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The programme also made use of [[Northern English]] language and [[dialect]]; affectionate local terms like &quot;eh, chook?&quot;, &quot;nowt&quot; ({{IPA-en|ˈnaʊt|IPA}}, rhymes with ''out'', means ''nothing''), and &quot;by heck!&quot; became widely heard on British television for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Miller |editor=Graham Nown |title=Street Talk: The Language of Coronation Street |publisher=[[Ward Lock]]|year=1986 |location=London|isbn= 978-0-7063-6514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early episodes told the story of student [[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Kenneth Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]), who had won a place at university and thus found his background something of an embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;TV Times. (1960) p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The character is one of the few to have experienced life 'outside' of ''Coronation Street'', and in some ways predicts the growth of [[globalisation]] and the decline of similar communities. Roache is the only remaining member of the original cast, and is currently the longest-serving actor in ''Coronation Street'' and in British and global soap overall. In a 1961 episode, Barlow declares: &quot;You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than [[Elsie Tanner]] and her boyfriends.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Granada Television | title =Coronation Street 1961 | medium = Television serial drama  | publisher = Granada | location =Quay Street, Manchester | date =8 November 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also at the centre of many early stories was [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), caretaker of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall, and her friends: timid [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]) and bespectacled [[Martha Longhurst]] ([[Lynne Carol]]). The trio were likened to the [[Greek chorus]], and the [[Weird Sisters|three witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', as they would sit in the [[Public house#Snug|snug bar]] of the [[Rovers Return Inn|Rovers Return]], passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Headstrong Ena often clashed with Elsie Tanner, whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which, most of the time, had little basis in reality.

In April 1961, [[Jed Stone]] made his first appearance and returned the following year in 1962. He left in 1963, but returned 3 years later in 1966. He left again and then returned 42 years later in 2008.

In March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' reached No.1 in the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|television ratings]] and remained there for the rest of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;/&gt; Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15 million) tuned into ''Corrie'' and by 1964 the programme had over 20 million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html|accessdate=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Storylines throughout the decade included: a mystery poison-pen letter received by Elsie Tanner, the 1962 marriage of Ken Barlow and [[Valerie Barlow|Valerie Tatlock]], [[Storylines of Coronation Street#Killing of Martha Longhurst|the death of Martha Longhurst]] in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to Steve Tanner as well as a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), the murder of Steve Tanner in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.

In spite of rising popularity with viewers, ''Coronation Street'' was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban [[working-class]], and its representation of a community that was a [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert C| last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first episode in 1960, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' printed: &quot;The programme is doomed from the outset.... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. pp.12–13&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the ''1950s''. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including [[Lucille Hewitt]] becoming addicted to [[drugs]], [[Jerry Booth]] being in a storyline about [[homosexuality]], [[Emily Nugent]] having an out of wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===

The show's [[production team]] was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s. When [[Arthur Leslie]] died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers landlord Jack Walker, died with him.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Reid]] quit as Valerie Barlow, and was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg73&quot;/&gt; Ratings reached a low of 8 million in February 1973, [[Pat Phoenix]] quit as [[Elsie Tanner]], [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]) was written out for most of the year due to illness, and [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker]]) took two months’ leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg86&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; ITV's other flagship soap opera ''[[Crossroads (TV series)|Crossroads]]'' saw a marked increase in viewers at this time, as its established cast, such as [[Meg Richardson]] ([[Noele Gordon]]), grew in popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg86&quot;/&gt; These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of [[Bet Lynch]], [[Ivy Tilsley]] ([[Lynne Perrie]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Hunt]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) and [[Mavis Wilton|Mavis Riley]] ([[Thelma Barlow]]) were built up between 1972 and 1973 with characters such as [[Gail Platt|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]), [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Patricia Cutts]] and [[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn]]) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.&lt;ref name = &quot;fsobxi&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comic storylines had been popular in the series in the 1960s but had become sparse during the early 1970s. These were re-introduced by new producer [[Bill Podmore]] who joined the series in 1976. He had worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.107.&lt;/ref&gt; Stan and Hilda Ogden were often at the centre of overtly funny storylines, with other comic characters including [[Eddie Yeats]] ([[Geoffrey Hughes]]), [[Fred Gee]] ([[Fred Feast]]) and [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[William Tarmey]]) all making their first appearances during the decade.

In 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned on a more regular basis as Ena.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coronation Street's'' stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and [[Suzie Birchall]] moved in with Elsie, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff Bet Lynch, [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]] and Fred Gee.

Storylines throughout the decade included: a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy Langton]] in 1977, the murder of [[Ernest Bishop]] in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of [[Brian Tilsley]] and Gail Potter (also in 1979).

For eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, industrial action forced ''Coronation Street'' and the whole of the ITV network (apart from the Channel Islands) off the air. When [[ITV]] did return, its first evening schedule included a special &quot;catch-up&quot; edition of ''Coronation Street'', in which storylines which would have taken place during the strike were explained away in the form of a narrative chat between Len Fairclough and Bet Lynch. For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show [[3-2-1]] were screened in its place. ''Coronation Street'' returned to ITV screens at a regular time late in 1979.

''Coronation Street'' had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially-viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working-class life.&lt;ref&gt;Liddement. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===
Between 1980 and 1989, ''Coronation Street'' underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, Ken Barlow stood as the only original [[cast member]], after the departures of Ena Sharples (in 1980), Annie Walker (in 1983), Elsie Tanner (in 1984) and [[Albert Tatlock]] (also 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.134. and pp.153–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[antihero]] [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson]]), one of the show's central male characters since 1961, was killed off, and in 1984, Stan Ogden (Bernard Youens) died.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) pp.153–59.&lt;/ref&gt; While the press predicted the end of ''Corrie'', H. V. Kershaw declared that &quot;There are no stars in ''Coronation Street''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with previously established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;little172&quot;&gt;Little. (1995) p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phyllis Pearce]] (Jill Summers) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while Percy Sugden ([[Bill Waddington]]) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.171.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, [[Shirley Armitage]] became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;little172&quot;/&gt;

Ken Barlow married Deirdre Langton on 27 July 1981. The episode was watched by over 24 million viewers – more ITV viewers than the wedding of [[Prince Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Icons – a portrait of England|title=Soaps through the decades |url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/the-archers/features/soaps-a-history|accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw the cementing of relationships between established characters: [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]) married [[Audrey Roberts|Audrey Potter]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) in 1985, [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) married [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.174, pp.182–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Bet Lynch married [[Alec Gilroy]] in 1987 and the marriages of Ivy Tilsley and [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street character)|Don Brennan]], and [[Derek Wilton]] and Mavis Riley took place in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) pp.184, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of [[Channel 4]] and its edgy new soap opera ''[[Brookside]]'' in 1982 was one of the biggest changes for ''Coronation Street''. Unlike ''Coronation Street'' which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, ''Brookside'' brought together working and middle class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in ''Coronation Street'' were largely about family affairs, ''Brookside'' concentrated on social affairs such as [[industrial action]], [[unemployment]] and the [[black market]]. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg165&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Brookside'', ''Eastenders'' had a more gritty premise than ''Coronation Street'', although unlike ''Brookside'' it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories. 

While ratings for ''Coronation Street'' remained consistent throughout the decade, ''EastEnders'' regularly obtained higher viewing figures.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; With prime time competition, ''Corrie'' was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg165&quot; /&gt; Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer, David Liddiment. A new exterior set had been built in 1982 and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed, with a new studio being built and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved from being shot on film to [[videotape]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg188&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; New pressures also saw introduction of the third weekly episode on 20 October 1989, broadcast each Friday at 19:30.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg188&quot;/&gt;

The 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as [[Deirdre Barlow]]'s affair with Mike Baldwin in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, Susan. In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return, which attracted an audience of just under 27 million, and between 1986 and 1989, the story of [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]]'s [[psychological abuse]] at the hands of [[Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), and his subsequent death under the wheels of a [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool tram]], was played out. The episode where Alan met his death under the tram gave ''Coronation Street'' its highest ever viewing figures of 26.9 million, and is still the 9th most watched UK broadcast of all time. Other stories included: the birth of [[Nick Tilsley|Nicky Tilsley]] in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and Stan Ogden's funeral in 1984, the birth of [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Tilsley]] in 1987, and Brian Tilsley's murder in 1989.

New characters were introduced, such as Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro), [[Curly Watts]] ([[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]]), [[Martin Platt]] ([[Sean Wilson (actor)|Sean Wilson]]), Reg Holdsworth ([[Ken Morley]]) and the McDonald family.

=== 1990s ===
In spite of updated sets and production changes, ''Coronation Street'' still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Council]], [[Lord Rees-Mogg]], criticised the low-representation of [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as '''Coronation Street'' shuts out blacks' (''[[The Times]]'') and 'Put colour in t'Street' (''Daily Mirror'').&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Stoddart of ''The Times'' wrote: &quot;The millions who watch ''Coronation Street'' – and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg – know real life when they see it [...] in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it was not until 1999 that show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family.

New characters [[Des Barnes|Des]] and Steph Barnes moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as '[[Yuppie]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.194.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raquel Watts|Raquel Wolstenhulme]] ([[Sarah Lancashire]]) first appeared in 1991 and went on to become one of the most popular characters. The McDonald family were developed and the fiery relationships between [[Liz McDonald|Liz]], [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim]], [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve]] and [[Andy McDonald (Coronation Street)|Andy]] interested viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; Other newcomers were [[Maud Grimes]] ([[Elizabeth Bradley]]), [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]), Judy and Gary Mallett, [[Fred Elliott|Fred Elliot]] ([[John Savident]]) and [[Ashley Peacock]] ([[Steven Arnold]]). The amount of [[slapstick]] and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comic characters such as Reg Holdsworth and his water bed.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Storylines in the early part of the decade included: the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, Mike Baldwin's wedding to Alma Sedgewick ([[Amanda Barrie]]) in 1992, [[Tommy Duckworth]] being sold by his father Terry in 1993, Deirdre Barlow's marriage to Moroccan Samir Rachid, and the rise of [[Tanya Pooley]] ([[Eva Pope]]) between 1993 and 1994.

Key character Bet Lynch departed in 1995 when her portrayer Julie Goodyear decided to leave. Bet would subsequently make brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.

In 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day he axed the characters of [[Derek Wilton]], [[Don Brennan (Coronation Street Character)|Don Brennan]], [[Percy Sugden]], [[Bill Webster]], Billy Williams and [[Maureen Holdsworth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg235&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.235.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thelma Barlow]], who played Derek's wife Mavis, was angered by the sacking of her co-star and resigned, while the production team also lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg235&quot;/&gt;

In line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by [[Adam Rickitt]], [[single parent|single mother]] [[Zoe Tattersall]] ([[Joanne Froggatt]]) first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]], eco-warriors, religious cults and a transsexual woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;little241&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; Park quit in 1998, after deciding that he had done what he intended to do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley Patterson]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]), the first [[transsexual]] character in a British soap.&lt;ref name=&quot;little241&quot;/&gt;

Some viewers were alienated by the new-look ''Coronation Street'', and the sections of the media voiced their disapproval. Having received criticism of being too out of touch, ''Corrie'' now struggled to emulate the more modern ''Brookside'' and ''EastEnders''. In the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] wrote: &quot;Apparently it doesn't matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg235&quot;/&gt;

One of ''Coronation Street'''s best known storylines took place in March/April 1998, with [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man Jon Lindsay. 19 million viewers watched Deirdre being sent to prison, and 'Free the Weatherfield One' campaigns sprung up in a media frenzy.&lt;ref name=&quot;little241&quot;/&gt; The then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] even passed comment on Deirdre’s sentencing in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM supports Weatherfield One|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/71934.stm|date=31 March 1998|accessdate=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deirdre was freed after three weeks, with Granada stating that they had always intended for her to be released, in spite of the media interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;little241&quot;/&gt;

=== 2000s ===
On 8 December 2000, the show celebrated its fortieth year by broadcasting a live, hour-long, [[Coronation Street: 40th anniversary live episode|episode]]. [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] made a cameo in the episode, appearing in a pre-recorded segment as himself in an [[ITV News]] bulletin report, presented by [[Sir Trevor McDonald|Trevor McDonald]].&lt;ref name=&quot;prince&quot;&gt;{{cite news | work=BBC News| title= Prince stars in live soap |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1061585.stm| accessdate=2 September 2006 | date=8 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the year, 13-year old [[Sarah-Louise Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]) had become pregnant and given birth to a baby girl, [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]], on 4 June. The episode where [[Gail Platt|Gail]] was told of her daughter's pregnancy was watched by 15 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg256&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.256.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the year, [[Alison Wakefield]], married [[Kevin Webster]] after discovering she was pregnant with his child. Their happiness was not to last. Their son Jake died just a day after his birth in June 2000 from a [[Group B streptococcal infection]]. Their tragedy was too much for Alison and, after kidnapping then returning Sarah-Lou Platt's newborn baby Bethany, she committed suicide by stepping in front of a lorry, leaving Kevin devastated. The year also saw the programme's first [[two-hander]], between Curly and Raquel Watts.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg256&quot;/&gt; In September 2000, Mike Baldwin married Linda Sykes but shortly afterwards, his drunken son Mark confessed he and Linda had been having an affair behind his dad's back. The episode attracted an audience of 16.8 million and in the 2001 [[British Soap Awards]] won Best Storyline.

From 1999–2001, Jane MacNaught was ''Coronation Street's'' executive producer, and received harsh criticism from both viewers and critics. In an attempt to compete with ''EastEnders'', issue-led storylines were introduced such as [[Toyah Battersby]]'s rape, Roy and Hayley Cropper abducting their [[foster care|foster child]], Sarah Platt's [[Chat room|Internet chat room]] abduction and [[Alma Baldwin|Alma Halliwell]]'s death of [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=CNProd&gt;{{cite web|title=Coronation Street Producer|publisher= Corrie.net |url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/producers.html|accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such storylines were unpopular with viewers and ratings dropped and in October 2001, Macnaught was abruptly moved to another Granada department and Carolyn Reynolds took over. ''Corrie'' continued to struggle in the ratings, with ''EastEnders'' introducing some of its strongest stories. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce &quot;gentle storylines and humour&quot;, after deciding that ''the Street'' should not try and compete with other soaps.&lt;ref name=CNProd/&gt;

In 2002, one of ''Coronation Street's'' best-known storylines began, which culminated in 2003. Gail Platt married [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), a [[financial adviser|financial advisor]], who would go on to leave [[Duggie Ferguson]] to die, murder his ex-wife Patricia, attempt to murder his [[mother-in-law]], Audrey Roberts, murder [[Maxine Peacock]] and attempt to murder [[Emily Bishop]]. After confessing to the murder of Maxine and his ex-wife, Hillman attempted to kill Gail, her children Sarah and [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David]], and her granddaughter Bethany, by driving them into a canal. The storyline received wide press attention, and viewing figures peaked at 19.4 million, with Hillman dubbed a &quot;serial killer&quot; by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Street drama hits ratings high|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2796201.stm |date=25 February 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Todd Grimshaw]] began to question his sexuality in 2003, becoming ''Corrie's'' first regular homosexual character, after years of criticism about non-representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Street gay kiss complaints rejected |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3238111.stm|accessdate=12 March 2007 | date=3 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003 saw the introduction of another gay male character, [[Sean Tully]] played by [[Antony Cotton]], who emerged as one of the show's most popular characters. The character of [[Karen McDonald]] ([[Suranne Jones]]) was developed, with her fiery marriage to Steve and warring with [[Tracy Barlow]].

In 2004, ''Coronation Street'' [[retconned]] the Baldwin family when Mike's nephew [[Danny Baldwin]] and his wife Frankie moved to the area from Essex, with their two sons [[Jamie Baldwin|Jamie]] and [[Warren Baldwin|Warren]]. Until this time, Mike Baldwin had been portrayed as an [[only child]], with his father appearing in the programme between 1980 and 1982 confirming the fact.

During the decade, a range of other storylines featured, such as the [[bigamy]] and of [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] and his addiction to alcohol, later in the decade, [[Maya Sharma]]'s revenge on former lover [[Dev Alahan]], [[Katy Harris]] murdering her father and subsequently committing suicide, Charlie Stubbs's psychological abuse of [[Shelley Unwin]], and the deaths of [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]], [[Vera Duckworth]] and [[Fred Elliott]]. Three new families were also introduced into the show: The Connors, The Mortons and The Windasses, the Mortons and Windasses being not as popular as the Connors when introduced,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shinymedia.headshift.com/corrieblog/2007/04/wednesday_yay_o_5.html Wednesday Yay or Nay – does anyone like the Mortons?]{{dead link|date=February 2011}} Corrieblog&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mortons being written out by the next year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Corrie axes kebab shop clan|work=The Sun|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/article1093364.ece|date=26 April 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2008|location=London|first=Sara|last=Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Windasses being brought in to replace them

In 2007, several groundbreaking storylines took place on ''Coronation Street'', such as Tracy Barlow murdering Charlie Stubbs and claiming it was self defence, as well as the show featuring its second two hander with Tracy Barlow confessing to her mother Deirdre Barlow she had planned to kill Charlie all along. The storyline saw viewing figures peaking at 13.3 million, and the episode on 2 April 2007 where Tracy was found guilty of Charlie's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, was watched by 12.6 million viewers. At the 2007 British Soap Awards it won Best Storyline, and [[Kate Ford]] was voted Best Actress for her portrayal. Other storylines included [[Leanne Battersby]] becoming a [[prostitute]] and the show's first bi-sexual love triangle (between [[Michelle Connor]], [[Sonny Dhillon]], and [[Sean Tully]]). The Connor family were central to many storylines during 2007 – the accidental death of a Polish worker at Underworld due to overworking, Michelle's discovery that her brothers [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]] and [[Liam Connor|Liam]] were the cause of her husband's death, Paul's use of an escort service, his kidnapping of Leanne and his subsequent death.

In July 2007, after 34 years in the role of [[Vera Duckworth]], [[Elizabeth Dawn]] left the show due to ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Street's Vera Duckworth quitting|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6910452.stm |accessdate=3 June 2010 | date=22 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conversation between Dawn and producers Kieran Roberts and [[Steve Frost]], the decision was made to kill Vera off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coronation Street's Vera Duckworth to be killed off|work=Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3668877/Coronation-Streets-Vera-Duckworth-to-be-killed-off.html|accessdate=3 June 2010| first1=Iain | last1=Gray | date=29 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, shortly before plans to retire to Blackpool, Vera's husband Jack found that she had died in her armchair.

[[Tina O'Brien]] revealed in the British press on 4 April 2007 that she would be leaving ''Coronation Street'' before the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;leaving Corrie&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date=4 April 2007 | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2007150484,00.html | title=Tina: I'm quitting Corrie | work=The Sun | accessdate=4 April 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah-Louise, who was involved in some of the decade's most controversial stories, left in December 2007.

The Connor family continued to dominate storylines in 2008 with Michelle learning that [[Ryan Connor|Ryan]] was not her biological son, having been accidentally swapped at birth and her emotional struggle to accept her biological son [[Alex Neeson]]. This story abruptly ended but Michelle soon had new troubles when she suspected boyfriend Steve McDonald had cheated on her. She had no idea his fling had been with [[Becky Granger]], a supporting character who slowly rose to more prominent status. Michelle hired her to work at the Rovers. Michelle became an ever-more prominent part of the Street, with [[Kym Marsh]] receiving £100,000 for another year on the soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Bryant |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/06/20/coronation-street-star-kym-marsh-gets-new-100k-contract-89520-20614285/ |title=Coronation Street star Kym Marsh gets new £100k contract|publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Carla Connor]] turned to Liam for comfort and developed feelings for him. In spite of knowing about her feelings, Liam married Maria Sutherland. Maria and Liam's baby son was stillborn in April, and during an estrangement from Maria upon the death of their baby, Liam had a one night stand with Carla, a story which helped pave the way for his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a88550/liam-quits-corrie-over-typecast-fears.html |title=Soaps – News – 'Liam' quits Corrie over &quot;typecast&quot; fears|publisher=Digital Spy |date=3 February 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the decade was spent on the family dramas of Gail Platt. The various problems of daughter Sarah-Louise occupied much of Gail's attention. Gail's son [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) became increasingly unbalanced, with various plots and schemes. These culminated in 2008 where he pushed her down the stairs in a fit of anger. Gail stood by him, partly due to her belief that her mother Audrey had not been there for her as a child. Enraged that Gail refused to press charges, David vandalised the Street and was sent to a young offenders' facility for several months. In May 2008, Gail finally met [[Ted Page]], the father she'd never known and in 2009, Gail's boyfriend, Joe McIntyre became addicted to pain killers, which came to a head when he broke into the medical centre.

In August 2008 [[Jed Stone]] returned after 42 years. He was seen when [[Tony Gordon]] tried to evict him from his property, causing Jed to have a heart attack. In late Liam Connor and his ex-sister in law Carla Connor gave into their feelings for each other and began an affair. Carla's fiancee Tony discovered the affair and subsequently had Liam killed in a hit-and-run in October, leaving his pregnant widow Maria distraught. Carla struggled to come to terms with Liam's death, but decided she still loved Tony and married him on 3 December, in an episode attracting 10.3 million viewers. Sally Webster showed Maria the footage of Carla and Liam kissing at the wedding reception, leading to Maria's mental breakdown. She rightly believed that Tony had murdered Liam, however, no one believed her except Tony's enemy Jed Stone, who was lodging with Emily Bishop. Jed tried to blackmail Tony, leading to a confrontation on Christmas Eve in ''Underworld'' when Tony strangled Jed in a fit of rage, just before the Christmas party. Believing Jed to be dead, Tony hid his body in the Christmas hamper during the party. When he returned to the factory on Christmas Day he discovered Jed had just been unconscious, and offered him a free flat in [[Wigan]] to buy his silence, which Jed accepted.

In April 2009 it was revealed that Eileen Grimshaw's father, [[Colin Grimshaw|Colin]] had slept with Eileen's old classmate, [[Paula Carp]] while she was still at school, and that Paula's daughter, [[Julie Carp|Julie]] was in fact also Colin's daughter. Colin later died from a stroke, before the police could arrest him. In May, Norris Cole received a blast from the past with the reappearance of his estranged brother [[Ramsay Clegg]] ([[Andrew Sachs]]) who wanted a reconciliation. Norris refused to have anything to do with the man whom he blamed for shaming his mother. Ramsay died on his way home to Australia, leaving a shocked Norris to discover that his mother had actually rejected Ramsay as a child and sent him away. Other significant storylines that year included Peter Barlow's battle against alcoholism, Ken Barlow's affair with actress [[Martha Fraser]] after his dog Eccles fell in the canal, Maria giving birth to Liam's son and her subsequent relationship with Liam's killer Tony, Steve McDonald's marriage to Becky Granger and Kevin Webster's affair with Molly Dobbs.

In late 2009, the long-running storyline involving Tony Gordon came to its conclusion when Carla returned and he suffered a heart attack. Convinced that he was about to die, he confessed to Roy Cropper that he was responsible for Liam's death. Unexpectedly he survived leaving Roy and Hayley fearing for their lives in anticipation of what he might do. After overhearing Hayley telling Maria that he had killed her husband, Tony confronted Roy by the canal. A physical confrontation ensued and Tony pushed Roy into the canal. However Tony then rescued Roy from the water and confessed to Liam's murder to the police. On Christmas Day 2009, Sally Webster told husband Kevin that she had breast cancer, just as he was about to leave her for lover Molly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/739615-sally-websters-breast-cancer-plot|title=Sally Webster's breast cancer plot|publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
The first months saw Gail Platt marry for the fourth time to Joe McIntyre, who, due to heavy debts, planned to fake his own drowning. When Gail refused to go along with the plan, Joe sailed away and in the attempt, drowned for real, leaving Gail to be charged with his murder. [[Molly Dobbs]] became pregnant, with the father being either [[Tyrone Dobbs]] or [[Kevin Webster]]; Molly reconciled with Tyrone and nearly lost her life after a crash in a car which had not been properly repaired by Kevin. After an absence of three years, Tracy Barlow returned on 7 May 2010, in a plot to reduce her sentence by convincing cellmate Gail to confess to Joe's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1268089/Coronation-Street-Tracy-Barlow-actress-Kate-Ford-returns-having-baby.html |title=I'm the one most petrified of Tracy Barlow going back to Corrie, says Kate Ford|publisher=Mail Online |date=23 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 saw the show's first lesbian storyline as [[Sophie Webster]] develops an attraction towards her best friend [[Sian Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronationstreet/news/a164337/corries-sophie-and-sian-ponder-lesbian-plot.html |title=Corrie's Sophie and Sian ponder lesbian plot |publisher=Digital Spy |date=9 July 2009 |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a179775/vincent-no-tongues-in-corrie-kiss.html |title=Vincent: 'No tongues in Corrie kiss' |publisher=Digital Spy |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This started in April and would develop during the year and into early 2011. May 2010 also saw the funeral of ''Coronation Street'' favourite [[Blanche Hunt]], who was written out after the death of her portrayer [[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]] on 2 December 2009. ITV honoured Blanche and Maggie with a half-hour special, ''Goodbye Blanche'', which was aired after the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shinychris |url=http://www.corrieblog.tv/2010/05/coronation_stre_1258.html |title=Coronation Street's Blanche Hunt honoured in documentary |publisher=Corrie Blog |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2010, the ''Coronation Street'' opening sequence was given a revamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a221987/watch-coronation-streets-new-title-sequence.html |title=Watch Coronation Street's new title sequence |publisher=Digital Spy |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that date all episodes of the series would be produced in High Definition.

Meanwhile, Gail Platt's murder trial kicks into high gear. Two separate endings for Gail's verdict were shown online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10217438.stm |title=Coronation Street to show two Gail verdicts online|publisher=BBC News |date= 2 June 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2010 an episode featuring a gun siege was postponed following the similar [[Cumbria shootings]] earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/180893-coronation-street-taken-off-air-following-cumbria-shooting/|title=Coronation Street taken off air following Cumbria shooting | publisher=STV News|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was left unannounced whether ''Coronation Street'' would return the following day, but it was later announced that it would not be returning that week, and return the following Monday as a result of what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/news/alternativeendings/|title=Corrie Scheduling Announcement| publisher=ITV|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 7 July 2010 it was announced that ''Coronation Street'' was working with [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]] and the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive]] (responsible for the operation of [[Manchester Metrolink]]) to film a spectacular and realistic tram crash. This crash would use the viaduct at the end of the Street. Reports stated that series producer Phil Collinson was distributing alternative scripts, that much loved characters would be killed, and that none of the cast would be told which characters will die. The events of the night of the crash were to be aired over a week's worth of episodes, similar to the Siege Week storyline. Survivors would take refuge in The Rovers Return, with the effects lasting well into 2011.

It was originally believed that a live episode had not been planned for the anniversary, but actor [[Keith Duffy]] confirmed on 29 August 2010 that one would be aired focussing on the aftermath of the upcoming tram crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a269430/duffy-corrie-will-go-live-for-50th.html|title=Duffy: 'Corrie will go live for 50th'|last=Daniels|first=Colin|publisher=Digital Spy|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The live episode took place on 9 December 2010.

On 17 September 2010 ''Coronation Street'' entered the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' book as the world's longest-running television soap opera after the American soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'' had its final episode. Roache was additionally listed as the world's longest-running soap actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hemley&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coronation Street breaks two world records|first=Matthew|last=Hemley|work=The Stage|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29700/coronation-street-breaks-two-world-records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode of ''[[EastEnders]]'' broadcast on the same day as ''Coronation Street''{{'s}} 50th anniversary episode included a tribute, with the character [[Dot Branning]] saying that she never missed ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.beehivecity.com/television/eastenders-to-celebrate-coronation-street-50th-with-on-screen-mention182823/|title=EastEnders to celebrate Coronation Street 50th with on screen mention|date=1 December 2010|work=Beehive City|publisher=Honeycomb Publishing &amp; Media|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Granada bosses commissioned trailers depicting famous ''Coronation Street'' fans, including former ''[[Brookside]]'' actress [[Sue Johnston]] ([[Sheila Grant]]).

In January 2011, it was announced that one of ''Coronation Street''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s original characters [[Dennis Tanner]] will make a return after 43 years off screen. The year will also see the departures of long-running cast members [[Beverley Callard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11581745 BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vicky Entwistle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10841614 BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; who play [[Liz McDonald]] and [[Janice Battersby]], respectively.

====50th Anniversary Week: &quot;Four Funerals and a Wedding&quot;====
{{main|Coronation Street: 50th anniversary live episode}}
[[Image:corrie crash.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The aftermath of the tram crash.]]
''Coronation Street'''s 50th anniversary week was celebrated by broadcasting seven consecutive episodes, along with a special one hour live episode, from 6–10 December. The anniversary was also constructed by a number of ITV specials and news broadcasts. Producer [[Phil Collinson]] marked the event with a sensational storyline in which the residents had to deal with a tragic accident and its aftermath. In the storyline, [[Nick Tilsley]] and [[Leanne Battersby]]'s bar - The Joinery - exploded during [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]]'s stag party. As a result, the viaduct was destroyed, sending a tram careering onto the street, destroying [[D&amp;S Alahan's Corner Shop]] and [[The Kabin]]. Two characters, [[Ashley Peacock]] and [[Molly Dobbs]], along with an unknown taxi driver were killed as a result of the disaster, [[Rita Sullivan]] survived despite being trapped under the rubble of her destroyed shop. [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] prematurely gave birth to a baby girl, Hope, after her husband, [[John Stape|John]], struck his stalker [[Charlotte Hoyle]] with a hammer to silence her. He later posed as Colin Fishwick, Charlotte's supposed partner, attempting to turn off her life support. She eventually died after a mutual decision with John and Charlotte's parents to turn off her life support. Peter Barlow married Leanne Battersby in an emergency hospital ceremony, shortly before going into cardiac arrest, although he later rallied and made a slow recovery.

[[Bliss (charity)|Bliss]], the special care baby charity, worked closely with production staff and actors to ensure accuracy in Fiz's storyline.

{{main|List of Coronation Street characters|List of past Coronation Street characters}}
Since 1960, ''Coronation Street'' has featured many characters whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]), [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Patricia Phoenix]]) and [[Annie Walker]] ([[Doris Speed]]) as central figures.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became [[archetype]]s of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street's busybody, battleaxe and self-proclaimed moral voice.&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsie was the [[Hooker with a heart of gold|tart with a heart]], who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love.&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.57.&lt;/ref&gt; Annie Walker, landlady of the [[Rovers Return Inn]], had [[delusions of grandeur]] and saw herself as better than other residents of ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref&gt;Tinker. p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coronation Street'' became known for the portrayal of strong female characters,&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, Christine. ''Women and Soap Opera'', Polity Press, London, 1991. (ISBN 978-0-7456-0568-5)&lt;/ref&gt; with characters like Sharples, Walker and Tanner, and [[Hilda Ogden]], becoming household names during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren's programme was largely matriarchal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Will |last = Hadcroft |title = Daran Little interview |url = http://www.corrie.net/profiles/interviews/little.html |work = Corrie.net |accessdate = 22 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the show has a long tradition of hen-pecked husbands, most famously [[Stan Ogden]] and [[Jack Duckworth]], husbands of Hilda and Vera, respectively.

Only one character from the first episode remains, [[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]). He entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and the model [[Twiggy]] were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off, Ken has remained the constant link throughout the entire series of ''Coronation Street''.

[[Stan Ogden]] and [[Hilda Ogden]] were introduced in 1964, with Hilda ([[Jean Alexander]]) becoming one of the most famous British soap characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, she was voted fourth most recognisable woman in Britain, after [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Little. (1995) p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; Hilda's best-known attributes were her [[Pinafore|pinny]], hair curlers, and the [[mural|&quot;muriel&quot;]] in her [[living room]] with three &quot;flying&quot; duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden's final episode on Christmas Day 1987, remains the highest-rated episode of ''Coronation Street'' ever, with nearly 27 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Dennis |last = Barker |title = Obituary: Leslie Duxbury |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1635800,00.html |work = The Guardian |date = 7 November 2005 |accessdate = 2 September 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bet Lynch ([[Julie Goodyear]]) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and went on to become one of the most famous ''Corrie'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; Bet stood as the central character of the show from 1985 until departing in 1995, often being dubbed as &quot;Queen of the Street&quot; by the media, and indeed herself. The character briefly returned in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Queen Of The Street The Amazing Life Of Julie Goodyear |url = http://www.alkenmrs.com/soapsrus/coronationstreet/csqueenstreet.html|work = Alken M R S |accessdate = 9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coronation Street'' and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some of its current cast based loosely on past characters. [[Blanche Hunt]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) embodied the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena Sharples, [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Whittaker]]) has grown snobbish, like Annie Walker, and a number of the programme's female characters mirror the vulnerability of Elsie Tanner and Bet Lynch. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran ([[Albert Tatlock]], [[Percy Sugden]]), the bumbling retail manager ([[Leonard Swindley]], [[Reg Holdsworth]], [[Norris Cole]]), and the perennial losers (Stan and Hilda Ogden, [[Jack Duckworth|Jack]] and [[Vera Duckworth]], and [[Les Battersby-Brown]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = David Liddiment | title =How Soaps Changed the World | medium = Television Documentary | publisher = Channel 4| date = 17 July 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's former archivist and scriptwriter Daran Little disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. &quot;Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and Co. were the first of their kind ever seen on British television. If later characters are stereotypes, it's because they are from the same original mould. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied ''Coronation Street''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg7&quot;&gt;Little. (1998) p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
=== Broadcast format ===
Between 9 December 1960 and 3 March 1961, ''Coronation Street'' was broadcast twice weekly, on Wednesday and Friday.&lt;ref&gt;Little (2000) p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Wednesday episode being pre-recorded 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later.&lt;ref name = &quot;xvvlbv&quot;&gt;Kershaw. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; When the programme went fully networked on 6 March 1961, broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The last regular episode to be shown live was broadcast on 3 February 1961.

The series was transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This installment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the event suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like [[BBC1]], the ITV network was broadcast in black and white at this point so the episode was broadcast in black and white.

The reasons why episodes were produced in colour for monochrome transmission are not stated in any literature but it is possible that it was for the purposes of testing the look of sets and costumes using the new cameras. The Rovers Return set underwent a subtle change of colours in November 1969 without any on-screen explanation.

Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on 24 November 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; The ITV network, like [[BBC1]], began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969 and it is therefore possible that the first transmitted colour episode is number 928 shown on 17 November.

In October 1970 a technician's dispute turned into a [[work-to-rule]] when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including ''Coronation Street''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Marson. &quot;Inside Updown – the story of &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot;. Kaleidoscope publishing 2001. p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 8 February 1971.

Episode 5191, originally broadcast on 7 January 2002, was the first to be broadcast in [[16:9]] widescreen format. ''Coronation Street'' was the last British soap to make the switch to 16:9 (''[[Take the High Road]]'' remained in [[4:3]] until it finished in 2003).

From 22 March 2010, ''Coronation Street'' was produced in 1080/50i for transmission on HDTV platforms on [[ITV1 HD]]. First transmission in this format was episode 7351 on 31 May 2010 with a new set of titles and re-recorded theme tune. On 26 May 2010 ITV1 previewed the new HD titles on the ''Coronation Street'' website. Due to copyright reasons only viewers residing in the U.K could see them on the ITV site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/s3/coronation-street/news/a219473/coronation-street-to-join-itv1-hd.html |title='Coronation Street' to join ITV1 HD |publisher=Digital Spy |date=12 May 2010|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production staff ===
''Coronation Street's'' creator, [[Tony Warren]] wrote the first 13 episodes of the programme in 1960, and continued to write for the programme intermittently until 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;top10writers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Coronation Street's top ten writers|work=Corrie.net|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/writers.html|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He still retains links with ''Coronation Street'', often advising on storylines.

[[H. V. Kershaw|Harry Kershaw]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H V Kershaw|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449958/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the script editor for ''Coronation Street'' when the programme began in 1960, working alongside Tony Warren. Kershaw was also a script writer for the programme and the show's producer between 1962 and 1971. He remains the only person, along with John Finch, to have held the three posts of script editor, writer and producer. Kershaw continued to write for the programme until his retirement in January 1988.

[[Adele Rose]] was the longest-serving ''Coronation Street'' writer, completing 455 scripts between 1961 and 1998. She also created ''[[Byker Grove]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adele Rose|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741220/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Podmore]] was the show's longest serving producer. By the time he stepped down in 1988 he had completed 13 years at the production helm. Nicknamed the &quot;godfather&quot; by the tabloid press,&lt;ref&gt;Podmore, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; he was renowned for his tough, uncompromising style and was feared by both crew and cast alike. He is probably most famous for sacking [[Peter Adamson]], the show's Len Fairclough, in 1983.

[[Michael Apted]], best known for the ''[[Up Series|Up!]]'' series of documentaries was a director on the programme in the early 1960s. This period of his career marked the first of his many collaborations with writer [[Jack Rosenthal]]. Rosenthal, noted for such television plays as ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'', began his career on the show, writing over 150 episodes between 1961 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Rosenthal|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742768/#writer1960|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Abbott]] was a story editor on the programme in the 1980s and began writing episodes in 1989, but left in 1993 to produce ''[[Cracker (British television)|Cracker]]'', for which he later wrote, before creating his own highly-acclaimed dramas such as ''[[Touching Evil]]'' and ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Abbott|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008036/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell T Davies]] was briefly a storyliner on the programme in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name=RTDIMDb&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell T Davies|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0203961/|accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; also writing the script for the [[direct-to-video]] special &quot;[[Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!|Viva Las Vegas!]]&quot;&lt;ref name=RTDIMDb/&gt; He, too, has become a noted writer of his own high-profile television drama programmes, including ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]'' and the 2005 revival of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=The Gallifrey Archives | title= Russell T Davies |url= http://www.gallifrey.org.uk/russelltdavies.html| accessdate=2 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy McGovern]] also wrote some episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Jones, Judith | work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications | title= Coronation street |url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/coronationst/coronationst.htm| accessdate=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current Executive Producer is Kieran Roberts who was once a Producer of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and the Producer is ex-Doctor Who producer Phil Collinson, who took over from Kim Crowther in summer 2010.

=== Theme music ===
The show's [[theme music]], a [[cornet]] piece, accompanied by a [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]] plus [[clarinet]] and [[double bass]], reminiscent of northern band music, was written by [[Eric Spear]].&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the trumpeter was not public knowledge until 1994, when jazz musician and journalist Ron Simmonds revealed that it was the Surrey musician Ronnie Hunt. He added, &quot;an attempt was made in later years to re-record that solo, using Stan Roderick, but it sounded too good, and they reverted to the old one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Simmonds, [http://www.jazzprofessional.com/interviews/Stan%20Roderick_3.htm &quot;Stan Roderick – A tribute&quot;], ''Jazz Professional'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' published a contradictory story that a young musician from Wilmslow called David Browning played the trumpet on both the original recording of the theme in 1960 and a re-recording in 1964, for a one-off payment of £36.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/127/127724_just_36_notes_for_corrie_trumpet.html Just 36 notes for Corrie trumpet] Manchester Evening News, 19 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilmslowexpress.co.uk/news/s/461/461909_trumpeter_dave_blows_the_lid_on_famous_career.html Trumpeter Dave blows the lid on famous career] Wilmslow Express, 19 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' resolved the matter. Browning conceded that Hunt recorded the original in 1960, but believed that his own re-recording in 1964&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_8003/is_2009_June_14/ai_n38233383/?tag=rel.res2 Corrie tune row as musicians blow own trumpets], ''Mail on Sunday'', 14 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or 1972 had been used since that date. [[ITV plc|ITV]] then confirmed to the ''Mail'' that a second version had been recorded in the 1970s, but was only used for a very short while before reverting to Hunt's 1960 recording. In the 1980s the same version was converted to [[stereo]].&lt;ref name=MOS-2010-06-21&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/mail-on-sunday-london-england-the/mi_8003/is_2009_June_21/brass-warfare-coronation-street-rival/ai_n38243210/ Brass warfare on Coronation Street as rival trumpeters say: I played that solo], ''Mail on Sunday'', 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronnie Hunt said he was paid £6, and found the experience frustrating as Eric Spear insisted on many takes before obtaining the sound that he wanted. After taking a break in a local pub, Hunt achieved the desired mournful sound by playing very close to the microphone.&lt;ref name=MOS-2010-06-21/&gt;

A new, completely re-recorded version of the theme tune replaced the old version when the series started broadcasting in HD on the 31st of May 2010. It accompanied a new montage-style credits sequence featuring images of Manchester and Weatherfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/news/newopeningtitles/ |title=New Opening Titles|work= Coronation Street - ITV Soaps |publisher=ITV.com |date= |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewing Figures ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Most episodes in the 1960, 70s, and 80s rated with over 20 million viewers and during the 1990s and early 2000s 15–20 million per episode would be typical. Like most terrestrial television in the UK, a dramatic decline in viewership has taken place and the show currently posts figures of between 8 and 14 million per episode. 

The programme currently rates as one of or the most watched programmes on UK television for every day it is aired. Viewership peaked on Christmas Day 1987 when an average of 28.5 million viewers tuned in to see Hilda Ogden leave the street to start a new life as a housekeeper for long term friend Dr Lowther (although there is some confusion as to whether or not this was actually the highest rating episode due to a special omnibus repeat of that week's episodes being combined with the original airing). Since EastEnders began in 1985, the two programmes have constantly battled it out for first place in the ratings.

=== Sets ===
{{Main|Coronation Street sets}}
[[File:Rosamund Street Viaduct 2002.jpg|thumb|Rosamund Street viaduct as seen in 2002 opening credits of ''Coronation Street'']]
The regular exterior buildings shown in ''Coronation Street'' include a row of terrace houses, several townhouses, and communal areas including a newsagents (''[[The Kabin]]''), a cafe (''Roy's Rolls''), a general grocery shop (''D&amp;S Alahan's''), a factory (''Underworld'') and ''Rovers Return Inn'' [[public house]]. The Rovers Return Inn is the main meeting place for the show's characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg73&quot;&gt;Little. (2000) p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1960 and 1968 street scenes were filmed before a set constructed in a studio, with the house fronts reduced in scale to 3/4 and constructed from wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinkerpg95&quot;&gt;Tinker. p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Granada built an outside set which was not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden façades from the studio simply being erected on the new site.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinkerpg95&quot;/&gt; These were replaced with brick façades, and back yards were added in the 1970s. [[File:Corronation Street Set October 2007.JPG|thumb|left|Shot of the ''Coronation Street'' exterior set (October 2007)]]

In 1982 a permanent full-street set was built in the Granada [[backlot]], constructed from reclaimed [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] brick.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinkerpg95&quot;/&gt; The set was updated in 1989 with the construction of a new factory, two shop units and three modern town houses on the south side of the street.&lt;ref name = &quot;vuqqwe&quot;&gt;Little.

Between 1989 and 1999 the [[Granada Studios Tour]] allowed members of the public to visit the set. The exterior set was extended and updated in 1999. This update added to the [[Rosamund Street]] and Victoria Street façades, and added a viaduct on Rosamund Street. The majority of interior scenes are shot in the adjoining purpose-built studio.&lt;ref name = &quot;vuqqwe&quot;/&gt;

== Broadcast history ==
=== United Kingdom ===
For 50 years, ''Coronation Street'' has remained at the centre of ITV's prime time schedule. The programme is currently shown in the UK in five episodes, over three evenings a week on ITV. From Friday 9 December 1960 until Friday 3 March 1961, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Wednesday and Friday at 19:00.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;/&gt; Schedules were changed and from Monday 6 March 1961 until Wednesday 11 October 1989, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Wednesday at 19:30.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg10&quot;/&gt; The third weekly episode was introduced on Friday 20 October 1989, broadcast at 19:30.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlepg188&quot; /&gt; From 1996, an extra episode was broadcast at 19:30 on Sunday nights. Aside from Granada, the programme originally appeared on the following stations of the ITV network: [[Anglia Television]], [[Associated-Rediffusion]], [[Television Wales and the West]], [[Scottish Television]], [[Southern Television]] and [[Ulster Television]]. From episode 14 on Wednesday 25 January 1961, [[Tyne Tees Television]] broadcast the programme. That left [[Associated Television|ATV]] in the Midlands as the only ITV station not carrying the show. When they decided to broadcast the programme, national transmission was changed from Wednesday and Friday at 19:00 to Monday and Wednesday at 19:30 and the programme became fully networked under this new arrangement from episode 25 on Monday 6 March 1961.

As the ITV network grew over the next few years, the programme was transmitted by these new stations on these dates onward: [[Westward Television]] from episode 40 on 29 April 1961, [[Border Television]] from episode 76 on 1 September 1961, [[Grampian Television]] from episode 84 on 30 September 1961, [[Channel Television]] from episode 180 on 1 September 1962 and [[Teledu Cymru]] (north and west Wales) from episode 184 on 14 September 1962. At this point, the ITV network became complete and the programme was broadcast almost continuously across the country at 19:30 on Monday and Wednesday for the next twenty-seven years.

From episode 2981 on Friday 20 October 1989 at 19:30, a third weekly episode was introduced and this increased to four episodes a week from episode 4096 on Sunday 24 November 1996, again at 19:30.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.229.&lt;/ref&gt; The second Monday episode was introduced in 2002 and was broadcast at 20:30 to usher in the return of [[Bet Lynch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Chris| last= Diamond |title= Coronation Street Review|url = http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2002/coronationstreet.htm|work= Off The Telly|date= 10 June 2002 |accessdate = 9 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061014022108/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/reviews/2002/coronationstreet.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monday 20:30 episode was used intermittently during the popular Richard Hillman story line but has become fully-scheduled since episode 5568 on Monday 25 August 2003. Additional episodes have been broadcast during the weekly schedule of ITV at certain times, notably in 2004 when, between 22 November and 26 November, eight episodes were shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |first= Neil| last= Wilkes |title= Corrie to be aired eight times in one week|url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a16769/corrie-to-air-eight-times-in-one-week.html |work= Digital Spy|date= 5 November 2004 |accessdate = 9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older episodes had been broadcast by satellite and cable channel [[Granada Plus]] from launch in 1996. The first episodes shown were from episode 1588 (Originally transmitted on Monday 5 April 1976) onwards. Originally listed and promoted as ''Classic Coronation Street'', the &quot;classic&quot; was dropped in early 2002, at which stage the episodes were from late 1989. By the time of the channel's closure in 2004, the repeats had reached January 1994.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In addition to this, &quot;specials&quot; were broadcast on Saturday afternoons in the early years of the channel with several episodes based on a particular theme or character(s) were shown. The latest episode shown in these specials was from 1991. In addition, on 27 and 28 December 2003, several [[Christmas Day]] editions of the show were broadcast.

From 23 July 2009 ''Coronation Street'' has been broadcast in five weekly instalments, at 19:30 and 20:30 on Mondays and Fridays, and at 20:30 on Thursday. The Thursday episode replaces the former Wednesday show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jul/08/coronation-street-move-wednesdays|title=Coronation Street to move from Wednesdays – after nearly 50 years|accessdate=8 July 2009 | work=guardian.co.uk | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=8 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional late night episodes of ''Coronation Street'' begin at 22:00, due to the [[watershed (television)|watershed]]. Repeat episodes, [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] broadcasts and specials have been shown on ITV and [[ITV2]]. In January 2008 the omnibus returned to the main ITV channel where it was aired on Saturday mornings/afternoons depending on the schedule and times. In May 2008 it moved to Sunday mornings until August 2008 when it returned to Saturdays. In January 2009 it moved back to Sunday mornings usually broadcasting at around 09:25 until December 2010. In January 2011 the omnibus has moved to Saturday mornings on ITV1 at 09:25.

=== International syndication ===
''Coronation Street'' is also shown in many countries worldwide. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], ''Coronation Street'' is [[simulcast]] on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]. The show is [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]]'s most watched programme with an average of 365,000 people watching each night. The show was so popular that an omnibus is also shown on weekends. For a number of months in 2009 [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]] provided repeats of the nights episode on sister channel [[3e]] at 9pm Monday, Wednesday &amp; Friday nights, this has since stopped. The show was first aired in 1978, beginning with episodes from 1976. Ireland eventually caught up with the current UK episodes in 1983. Until 1992 it was broadcast on [[RTÉ Two]] and from 1992 to 2001 it was broadcast on [[RTÉ One]]. In 2001 Granada TV bought 45% TV3, which resulted in TV3 broadcasting series since 2001. In 2006 ITV sold its share of the channel but TV3 and ITV have since agreed to allow the programme remain on TV3. It should be noted that many Irish households have access to ITV (either through Northern Ireland's UTV or ITV1 Wales) and can watch the show on ITV, if they so wish.

(1995) p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; The show eventually left free-to-air television in Australia in the 1970s. It briefly returned to the Nine Network in a daytime slot during 1994–95. In 2005 Channel Nine in Perth began to show episodes before the 18:00 news to improve the lead in to Nine News Perth, but this did not work and the show was cancelled a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3618&amp;st=75&amp;s=3d781df6ed1846c4dfd8bc83f262d6da |title=City by City Programming Differences – Forums – Page 4 |publisher=Media Spy |date= |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Pay-TV began and [[Arena (television network)|Arena]] began screening the series in one-hour instalments on Saturday and Sundays at 18:30.

Dutch broadcaster [[VARA (broadcaster)|VARA]] showed 428 sub-titled episodes on Netherlands TV between 1967 and 1975. It wanted to terminate the series in 1971 but due to public pressure continued until 1975. Because VARA was running well behind the with the British broadcasts, causing the actors to refer to past British politics, a special episode was produced for VARA to bridge and jump the gap and allow VARA to broadcast newer episodes.
In 2006, the small network Vitaya started broadcasting ''Coronation Street'' for viewers in Belgium, with episodes broadcast roughly two years behind the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgian Channel Takes Coronation Street|work=World Screen|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=bel42706.htm|accessdate=8 March 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[U.A.E.|United Arab Emirates]], episodes of ''Coronation Street'' are broadcast one month after their UK showing. In Sweden ''Coronation Street'' was shown in the country's largest broadcaster [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] during daytime in the early 2000s.

== Merchandise ==
Several classic episodes were released on VHS video in the 1980s and 1990s in different sets, while a number of specially recorded feature-length episodes were released exclusively to video (see [[Coronation Street VHS and DVD releases]]).

''The Street'', a magazine dedicated to the show, was launched in 1989. Edited by Bill Hill, the magazine contained a summary of recent storylines, interviews, articles about classic episodes, and stories that occurred from before 1960. The format was initially [[A5 paper size|A5 size]], expanding to A4 from the seventh issue.&lt;ref&gt;''The Street'', Issue 7, The Street Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine folded after issue 23 in 1993 when the publisher's contract with Granada Studios Tour expired and Granada wanted to produce their own magazine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Street'', Issue 23, The Street Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time when the studios tour was operating, a huge amount of branded merchandise was available from an on-site shop. Everything from soap, to tea-towels, to model houses. These items gradually became scarce as the tours complex was wound down. Although there were large numbers produced, these items are becoming collectable by fans.

On 25 June 2010 a video game of the show will be released on [[Nintendo DS]]. Players take the role of a detective as they work through a brand new storyline and befriend the various characters from the street, including Ken, Norris, Maria and Blanche.

===Discography===
An album featuring songs sung by some of the cast will be released for the show's 50th anniversary. The singers include [[William Roache]], [[Betty Driver]], [[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]] and [[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]. The album is titled ''Rogues, Angels, Heroes &amp; Fools''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/3201409/Coronation-Streets-50th-birthday-album.html| work=The Sun | title=Coronation Streets 50th birthday album | date=29 October 2010| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spin-offs and Specials ==

===Stage===
{{main|Corrie!}}
In August 2010, many of the characters of Coronation Street were brought to the stage to make a mockery of [[Jonathan Harvey| Jonathan Harvey's]] new comedy play ''[[Corrie!]]''. The play was commissioned to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the TV Series and was presented at [[The Lowry]] in Salford, England &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelowry.com/event/corrie &quot;Corrie!

===Films===
Over the years ''Coronation Street'' has released several straight-to-video films. Unlike other soaps which often used straight-to-video films to cover more contentious plot lines that may not be allowed by the broadcaster, ''Coronation Street'' has largely used these films to reset their characters in other locations.

In 1995, '''''Coronation Street: The Cruise''''' also known as '''''Coronation Street: The Feature Length Special''''' was released on VHS to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the show. ITV heavily promoted the programme as a direct-to-video exclusive but broadcast a brief version of it on 24 March 1996. The [[Independent Television Commission]] investigated the broadcast, as viewers complained that ITV misled them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Marianne|title=`Street' cruises for fall over video's brief honeymoon |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/street-cruises-for-fall-over-videos-brief-honeymoon-1304046.html|accessdate=1 October 2010|publisher=The Independent|date=10 April 1996|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, following the controversial cruise spin-off, '''''[[Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!]]''''' was released on VHS, featuring [[Jack Duckworth]], [[Vera Duckworth]], [[Fiona Middleton]] and [[Maxine Peacock]] on a trip to Las Vegas.

In 1999, six special episodes of ''Coronation Street'' were produced, following the story of [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street character)|Steve McDonald]], [[Vicky McDonald]], [[Vikram Desai]], [[Bet Gilroy]] and [[Reg Holdsworth]] in Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;Little. (2000) p.248.&lt;/ref&gt; This video was titled '''''Coronation Street: Open All Hours''''' and released on VHS.

In 2008, ITV announced filming was to get underway for a new special DVD episode, '''''[[Coronation Street: Out of Africa]]''''', following the Battersby-Brown family, which saw the temporary return of [[Cilla Battersby-Brown]].

In 2009, another DVD special, '''''[[Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday]]''''', was released. The feature-length comedy drama followed [[Roy Cropper|Roy]], [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley]] and [[Becky Granger|Becky]] as they travelled to [[Romania]] for the wedding of a face from their past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a160096/roy-hayley-becky-for-romanian-corrie-dvd.html |title=Roy, Hayley, Becky for Romanian Corrie DVD |publisher=Digital Spy |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2010, '''''[[Coronation Street: A Knight's Tale]]''''' was released. The film saw the return of [[Reg Holdsworth]] and [[Curly Watts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003YL40QC |title=Coronation Street-A Knight's Tale |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Taylor (Coronation Street)|Mary]] tries to take [[Norris Cole|Norris]] to an apparently haunted castle where she hoped to seduce him. [[Rosie Webster|Rosie]] gets a job there and she takes [[Jason Grimshaw|Jason]] with her. [[Brian Capron]] also guest starred as an assumes relative of [[Richard Hillman]].

A 2011 film is yet to be announced.

===50th Anniversary (2010)===
The BBC commissioned a one-off drama called ''[[The Road to Coronation Street]]'', about how the series first came into being. [[Jessie Wallace]] plays [[Pat Phoenix]] ([[Elsie Tanner]]) with [[Lynda Baron]] as [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]), [[Celia Imrie]] as [[Doris Speed]] ([[Annie Walker]]) and James Roache as his own father [[William Roache]] ([[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]]). It was broadcast on 16 September 2010 on [[BBC Four]].

In December 2010, ITV made a few special programs to mark the 50th anniversary. ''Coronation Street Uncovered: Live'', hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]] was shown after the episode with the tram crash was aired on ITV 2. On 7 and 9 December a countdown on the greatest Corrie moments, ''Coronation Street: 50 Years, 50 Moments'', the viewers voted &quot;The Barlows at Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; as the greatest moment. On 10 December [[Paul O'Grady]] hosted a quiz show, ''Coronation Street: The Big 50'' with three teams from the soap and a celebrity team answering questions about Coronation Street and other soaps. Also, ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Juice]]'' aired Coronation Street specials in the anniversary week.

=== Crossovers ===
''Coronation Street'' and rival soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' had a crossover for ''[[Children in Need 2010|Children in Need]]'' in November 2010 called &quot;[[East Street (Children in Need)|East Street]]&quot;. ''EastEnders'' stars confirmed to visit Weatherfield include [[Laurie Brett]] as [[Jane Beale]], [[Charlie G. Hawkins]] as [[Darren Miller]], [[Kylie Babbington]] as [[Jodie Gold]], [[Nina Wadia]] as [[Zainab Masood]] and [[John Partridge (performer)|John Partridge]] as [[Christian Clarke]].

''Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!'' also included some characters from ''[[Emmerdale]]''.

== Sponsorship ==
[[File:HarveysCorrieVanweb75.jpg|thumb|right|Harveys Publicity stunt.]]
[[Cadbury]] was the first [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] of ''Coronation Street'' beginning in July 1996. The original sponsorship had a chocolate-like version of the street (which can be seen in place at the [[Cadbury World]] museum in Bournville, Birmingham) with chocolate characters resembling some of the actual ''Coronation Street'' characters. In the summer of 2006, [[Cadbury Trebor Bassett]]s had to recall over one million chocolate bars, due to suspected salmonella contamination, and ''Coronation Street'' stopped the sponsorship for several months. In late 2006, Cadbury did not renew their contract, but agreed to sponsor the show until ''Coronation Street'' found a new sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kris|first=Green|title=Cadbury ends 10-year Corrie sponsorship|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a39413/cadbury-ends-10-year-corrie-sponsorship.html|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=14 January 2011|date=14 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September 2007, the Cadbury sponsor adverts were broadcast for the last time.

In July 2007, an ITV press release announced that [[Harveys Furniture|Harveys]] was the new sponsor of ''Coronation Street'' on the ITV Network. Harveys' sponsorship began on 30 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Harveys announced as new Corrie sponsor|url=http://m.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/s3/coronation-street/news/a63798/harveys-announced-as-new-corrie-sponsor.html|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=14 January 2011|date=2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday film, Roy and Hayley Cropper are filmed in front of a Harvey's store. In Coronation Street: A Knights Tale, a Harvey's truck can be seen driving past Mary Taylor's motor-home to further promote the brand.

'''Caligula''' ({{lang-la|Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Caligula's name would be inscribed as &lt;small&gt;GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 31 August AD 12 – 24 January AD 41), also known as '''Gaius''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 37 to 41. Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Caligula's father [[Germanicus]], the nephew and [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son of emperor [[Tiberius]], was a very successful general and one of Rome's most beloved public figures. The young Gaius earned the nickname Caligula (meaning &quot;little soldier's boot&quot;, the diminutive form of ''[[Caligae|caliga]]'', n. hob-nailed military boot) from his father's soldiers while accompanying him during his campaigns in [[Germania]]. When Germanicus died at [[Antioch]] in 19 AD, his wife [[Agrippina the Elder]] returned to Rome with her six children where she became entangled in an increasingly bitter feud with Tiberius. This conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Unscathed by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted the invitation to join the emperor on the island of [[Capri]] in 31, where Tiberius himself had withdrawn five years earlier. At the death of Tiberius in 37, Caligula succeeded his great-uncle and adoptive grandfather.

There are few surviving sources on Caligula's reign, although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, extravagance, and sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane [[tyrant]]. While the reliability of these sources has been questioned, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the authority of the emperor. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and notoriously luxurious dwellings for himself. However, he initiated the construction of two new [[aqueducts]] in Rome: the [[Aqua Claudia]] and the [[Anio Novus]]. During his reign, the empire annexed the [[Mauretania|Kingdom of Mauretania]] and made it into a [[Roman Mauretania|province]].

In early 41, Caligula was [[assassinated]] as the result of a conspiracy involving officers of the [[Praetorian Guard]], as well as members of the [[Roman Senate]] and of the imperial court. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the [[Roman Republic]] was thwarted: on the same day the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle [[Claudius]] emperor in his place.

==Early life==
===Family===
{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}
:''See [[Julio-Claudian Family Tree]].''
Caligula was born in Antium, the third of six surviving children born to [[Germanicus]] and Germanicus' second cousin [[Agrippina the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#7 7].&lt;/ref&gt; Gaius's brothers were [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero]] and [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;/&gt; His sisters were [[Julia Livilla]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] and [[Agrippina the Younger]] (Agrippina would be the fourth wife of [[Claudius]], and through her Caligula was a maternal uncle to the Emperor [[Nero]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;/&gt; Gaius was nephew to [[Claudius]] (the future emperor).&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-calig-6&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#6 LIX.6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrippina the Elder was the daughter of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] and [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;/&gt; She was a granddaughter of Augustus and [[Scribonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-7&quot;/&gt;

===Youth and early career===

As a boy of just two or three, Gaius accompanied his father, [[Germanicus]], on campaigns in the north of [[Germania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-9&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#9 9].&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers were amused that Gaius was dressed in a miniature soldier's uniform, including boots and armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-9&quot;/&gt; He was soon given his nickname ''Caligula'', meaning &quot;little (soldier's) boot&quot; in Latin, after the small boots he wore as part of his uniform.&lt;ref name=&quot;caligula-name&quot;&gt;&quot;Caligula&quot; is formed from the Latin word ''caliga'', meaning soldier's boot, and the [[diminutive]] [[infix]] ''-ul''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaius, though, reportedly grew to dislike this nickname.&lt;ref name=&quot;seneca-calig-18&quot;&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of a Wise Person'' XVIII 2–5. See Malloch, 'Gaius and the nobiles', Athenaeum (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suetonius]] reports that Germanicus was poisoned in Syria by an agent of [[Tiberius]], who viewed Germanicus as a political rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-2&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#2 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his father, Caligula lived with his mother until her relations with Tiberius deteriorated.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#10 10].&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius would not allow Agrippina to remarry for fear her husband would be a rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-4-52&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 4#52|IV.52]].&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippina and Caligula's brother, [[Nero (son of Germanicus)|Nero]], were banished in AD 29 on charges of treason.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-5-3&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 5#3|V.3]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-54&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#54 54].&lt;/ref&gt;

The adolescent Caligula was then sent to live first with his great-grandmother (and Tiberius's mother) [[Livia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt; Following Livia's death, he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt; In AD 30, his brother, [[Drusus Caesar]], was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-54&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-5-10&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 5#10|V.10]].&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius writes that after the banishment of his mother and brothers, Caligula and his sisters were nothing more than prisoners of Tiberius under the close watch of soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-64&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#64 64].&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 31, Caligula was remanded to the personal care of Tiberius on [[Capri]], where he lived for six years.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt; To the surprise of many, Caligula was spared by Tiberius.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-62&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#62 62].&lt;/ref&gt; According to historians, Caligula was an excellent natural actor and, recognizing danger, hid all his resentment towards Tiberius.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-20&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#20|VI.20]].&lt;/ref&gt; An observer said of Caligula, &quot;Never was there a better servant or a worse master!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-vi-20&quot;/&gt; After he became Emperor, Caligula claimed to have planned to kill Tiberius with a [[dagger]] in order to avenge his mother and brother: however, having brought the weapon into Tiberius's bedroom he did not kill the Emperor but instead threw the dagger down on the floor. Supposedly Tiberius knew of this but never dared to do anything about it.&lt;ref&gt;[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#12 12]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suetonius, Caligula was already uncontrollably cruel and vicious: he writes that, when Tiberius brought Caligula to Capri, his purpose was to allow Caligula to live in order that he &quot;...prove the ruin of himself and of all men, and that he was rearing a viper for the Roman People and a [[Phaëton]] for the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#11 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 33, Tiberius gave Caligula an honorary [[quaestor]]ship, a position he held until his rise to Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-57-23&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html#23 LVII.23].&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, both Caligula's mother and his brother Drusus died in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-6-25&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#25|VI.25]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-annals-6-23&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#23|VI.23]].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula was briefly married to Junia Claudilla in 33, though she died in childbirth the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-12&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#12 12].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula spent time befriending the Praetorian Prefect, [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], an important ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-12&quot; /&gt; Macro spoke well of Caligula to Tiberius, attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the emperor felt towards Caligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-6&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#VI|VI.35]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 35, Caligula was named joint heir to Tiberius's estate along with [[Tiberius Gemellus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-76&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#76 76].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor==
===Early reign===
When Tiberius died on 16 March AD 37, his estate and the titles of the [[Principate]] were left to Caligula and Tiberius's own grandson, [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]], who were to serve as joint heirs. Although Tiberius was 77 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still conjecture that he was murdered.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-calig-50&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]] writes that the [[Praetorian Prefect]], [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]], smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession, much to the joy of the Roman people,&lt;ref name=&quot;tacitus-calig-50&quot;/&gt; while [[Suetonius]] writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing, though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-12&quot;/&gt; Both [[Philo]], who wrote during Tiberius's reign, and [[Josephus]], record Tiberius as dying a natural death.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#IV|IV.25]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIII.6.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by Macro, Caligula had Tiberius' will nullified with regards to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberius' wishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-1&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#1 LIX.1].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eustache Caligula.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Caligula Depositing the Ashes of his Mother and Brother in the Tomb of his Ancestors'', by [[Eustache Le Sueur]], 1647]]

Caligula accepted the powers of the Principate as conferred by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and entered Rome on 28 March amid a crowd that hailed him as &quot;our baby&quot; and &quot;our star,&quot; among other nicknames.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-13&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#13 13].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula is described as the first emperor who was admired by everyone in &quot;all the world, from the rising to the setting sun.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-2-10&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.10]].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula was loved by many for being the beloved son of the popular [[Germanicus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-13&quot; /&gt; and because he was not [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#75 75].&lt;/ref&gt; It was said by Suetonius that over 160,000 animals were sacrificed during three months of public rejoicing to usher in the new reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-14&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#14 14].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-2-11&quot;&gt;Philo mentions widespread sacrifice, but no estimation on the degree, Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.12]].&lt;/ref&gt; Philo describes the first seven months of Caligula's reign as completely blissful.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-2-13&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.13]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Caligula's first acts were said to be generous in spirit, though many were political in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-1&quot; /&gt; To gain support, he granted bonuses to those in the military including the [[Praetorian Guard]], city troops and the army outside Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-1&quot; /&gt; He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that [[treason]] trials were a thing of the past and recalled those who had been sent into exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-15&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#15 15].&lt;/ref&gt; He helped those who had been harmed by the Imperial [[tax]] system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, such as gladiator battles.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-16&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#16 16].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-18&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#18 18].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.3.&lt;/ref&gt; He had his cousin and adopted son [[Tiberius Gemellus]] executed &amp;ndash; an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus mutual grandmother [[Antonia Minor]]. She is said to have committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father in law [[Marcus Silanus]] and his brother-in-law [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Lepidus]] executed as well. His uncle [[Claudius]] was spared only because Caligula kept him as a laughing stock. His favorite sister [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] died in AD 38 of a fever: his other two sisters, [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Livilla]] and [[Agrippina the Younger]], were exiled. He hated the fact that he was the grandson of [[Agrippa]], and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public reform===
[[File:RIC 0039.jpg|right|thumb|[[Quadrans|Quadran]] celebrating the abolition of a tax in AD 38 by Caligula. The obverse of the coin contains a picture of the liberty cap which symbolizes the liberation of the people from the tax burden.]]

In AD 38, Caligula focused his attention on political and public reform. He published the accounts of public funds, which had not been made public during the reign of Tiberius. He aided those who lost property in fires, abolished certain taxes, and gave out prizes to the public at gymnastic events. He allowed new members into the equestrian and senatorial orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-9-and-10&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#9 LIX.9–10].&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most significantly, he restored the practice of democratic elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-16-2&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#16.2 16.2].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassius Dio]] said that this act &quot;though delighting the rabble, grieved the sensible, who stopped to reflect, that if the offices should fall once more into the hands of the many ... many disasters would result&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-9-7&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#9.7 LIX.9.7].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, though, Caligula was criticized for executing people without full trials and for forcing his helper Macro to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-10&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#10 LIX.10].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial crisis and famine===
According to [[Cassius Dio]], a financial crisis emerged in AD 39.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-10&quot; /&gt; [[Suetonius]] places the beginning of this crisis in 38.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#37 37].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula's political payments for support, generosity and extravagance had exhausted the state's treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-38&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#38 38].&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other desperate measures by Caligula are described by historians. In order to gain funds, Caligula asked the public to lend the state money.&lt;ref name = &quot;gjxxsj&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#41 41].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula levied taxes on lawsuits, marriage and prostitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-calig-40&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#40 40].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula began auctioning the lives of the gladiators at shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#14 LIX.14].&lt;/ref&gt; Wills that left items to Tiberius were reinterpreted to leave the items instead to Caligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-15&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#15 LIX.15].&lt;/ref&gt; Centurions who had acquired property during plundering were forced to turn over spoils to the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-15&quot; /&gt; The current and past highway commissioners were accused of incompetence and embezzlement and forced to repay money.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-15&quot; /&gt; According to Suetonius, in the first year of Caligula's reign he squandered 2,700,000,000 [[sesterces]] that Tiberius had amassed.&lt;ref&gt;[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#37 37]&lt;/ref&gt; His nephew [[Nero Caesar]] both envied and admired the fact that Gaius had run through the vast wealth Tiberius had left him in so short a time.&lt;ref&gt;[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#30 30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:vatican obelisk.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Vatican Obelisk]] was first brought from Egypt to Rome by Caligula. It was the centerpiece of a large racetrack he built.]]
A brief famine of an unknown size occurred, perhaps caused by this financial crisis, but according to Suetonius a result of Caligula's seizure of public carriages,&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-38&quot;/&gt; according to Seneca because grain imports were disturbed by Caligula using boats for a pontoon bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Shortness of Life'' XVIII.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
Despite financial difficulties, Caligula embarked on a number of construction projects during his reign. Some were for the public good, while others were for himself.

[[Josephus]] describes as Caligula's greatest contribution to have improved the harbours at [[Rhegium]] and [[Sicily]], thereby allowing grain imports from Egypt to increase.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2.5]].&lt;/ref&gt; These improvements may have been made in response to the famine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Caligula completed the [[Temple of Divus Augustus|temple of Augustus]] and the [[theatre of Pompey]] and began an amphitheatre beside the Saepta.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-21&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#21 21].&lt;/ref&gt; He had the imperial palace expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#22 22].&lt;/ref&gt; He began the aqueducts [[Aqua Claudia]] and [[Anio Novus]], which [[Pliny the Elder]] considered engineering marvels.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#21 21], Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#20 20]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XXXVI.122.&lt;/ref&gt; He built a large racetrack known as the ''circus of Gaius and Nero'' and had an Egyptian obelisk (now known as the [[Vatican Obelisk]]) transported by sea and erected in the middle of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XVI.76.&lt;/ref&gt; At Syracuse, he repaired the city walls and the temples of the gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-21&quot; /&gt; He had new roads built and pushed to keep roads in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.15; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#37 37].&lt;/ref&gt; He had planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at Samos, to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at [[Ephesus]] and to found a city high up in the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-21&quot; /&gt; He planned to dig a canal through the Isthmus in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-21&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Nemi Ship Hull 1930.jpg|thumb|right|The hull of one of two ships recovered from [[Lake Nemi]] during the 1930s. [[Nemi ships|This massive vessel]] served as an elaborate floating palace to the emperor.]]
In 39, Caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary [[Pontoon bridge|floating bridge]] to be built using ships as [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]], stretching for over two miles from the resort of [[Baiae]] to the neighboring port of [[Puteoli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-19&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#19 19].&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that the bridge was to rival that of Persian King Xerxes' crossing of the Hellespont.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-19&quot; /&gt; Caligula, a man who could not swim,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#54 54].&lt;/ref&gt; then proceeded to ride his favorite horse, [[Incitatus]], across, wearing the breastplate of [[Alexander the Great#Fate after death|Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-19&quot; /&gt; This act was in defiance of a prediction by Tiberius's soothsayer [[Thrasyllus of Mendes]] that Caligula had &quot;no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;seutonius-calig-19&quot; /&gt;

Caligula had [[Nemi ships|two large ships]] constructed for himself, which were recovered from the bottom of [[Lake Nemi]] during the dictatorship of [[Benito Mussolini]]. The ships are among the largest vessels in the ancient world. The smaller ship was designed as a temple dedicated to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace that counted marble floors and plumbing among its amenities. Thirteen years after being raised, the ships were burned during an attack in the [[Second World War]], and almost nothing remains of the hulls, though many archeological treasures remain intact in the museum at Lake Nemi.

===Feud with the Senate===
In AD 39, relations between Caligula and the Roman Senate deteriorated.&lt;ref name=&quot;treason-trials&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.16; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of their disagreement is unknown. A number of factors, though, aggravated this feud. The Senate had become accustomed to ruling without an emperor between the departure of [[Tiberius]] for Capri in AD 26 and Caligula's accession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacitus, Annals IV.41&quot;&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' IV.41.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Tiberius's treason trials had eliminated a number of pro-Julian senators such as [[Gaius Asinius Gallus|Gallus Asinius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacitus, Annals IV.41&quot;/&gt;

Caligula reviewed Tiberius's records of treason trials and decided that numerous senators, based on their actions during these trials, were not trustworthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;treason-trials&quot;/&gt; He ordered a new set of investigations and trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;treason-trials&quot;/&gt; He replaced the consul and had several senators put to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-26&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suetonius]] reports that other senators were degraded by being forced to wait on him and run beside his chariot.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-26&quot;/&gt;

Soon after his break with the Senate, Caligula was met with a number of additional conspiracies against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-caligula-22&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.22.&lt;/ref&gt; A conspiracy involving [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|his brother-in-law]] was foiled in late 39.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-caligula-22&quot;/&gt; Soon afterwards, the governor of Germany, [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus]], was executed for connections to a conspiracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-caligula-22&quot;/&gt;

===Western expansion===
In AD 40, Caligula expanded the Roman Empire into [[Mauretania]] and made a significant attempt at expanding into [[Britannia]] – even challenging [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] in his campaign. The conquest of Britannia was fully realized by his successors.

Mauretania was a [[client kingdom]] of Rome ruled by [[Ptolemy of Mauretania]]. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then had him suddenly executed.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#35 35].&lt;/ref&gt; Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and divided into two provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' V.2.&lt;/ref&gt; This annexation of Mauretania led to a rebellion of some magnitude that was put down under [[Claudius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#8 LX.8], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#24 LX.24]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' V.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Details on these events are unclear. [[Cassius Dio]] had written an entire chapter on the annexation of Mauretania by Caligula, but it is now lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-25&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#25 LIX.25].&lt;/ref&gt;

There seemed to be a northern campaign to Britannia that was aborted.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-25&quot; /&gt; This campaign is derided by ancient historians with accounts of [[Gaul]]s dressed up as Germanic tribesmen at his triumph and Roman troops ordered to collect seashells as &quot;spoils of the sea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#45 45–47].&lt;/ref&gt; The few primary sources disagree on what precisely occurred. Modern historians have put forward numerous theories in an attempt to explain these actions. This trip to the [[English Channel]] could have merely been a training and scouting mission.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bicknell, &quot;The Emperor Gaius' Military Activities in AD 40&quot;, ''Historia'' 17 (1968), 496–505.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission may have been to accept the surrender of the British chieftain [[Adminius]].&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Davies, &quot;The Abortive Invasion of Britain by Gaius&quot;, ''Historia'' 15 (1966), 124–128; S.J.V.Malloch, 'Gaius on the Channel Coast', Classical Quarterly 51 (2001) 551-56; See Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#44 44].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Seashells&quot;, or ''conchae'' in Latin, may be a metaphor for something else such as female genitalia (perhaps the troops visited brothels) or boats (perhaps they captured several small British boats).&lt;ref&gt;D. Wardle, ''Suetonius' Life of Caligula: a Commentary'' (Brussels, 1994), 313; David Woods &quot;Caligula's Seashells&quot;, ''Greece and Rome'' (2000), 80–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of divinity===
[[File:RomaForoRomanoTempioCastori.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruins of the temple of Castor and Pollux in the [[Forum Romanum]]. Ancient resources as well as recent archaeological evidence suggest that, at one point, Caligula had the palace extended to annex this structure.]]When several kings came to Rome to pay their respects to him and argued about their nobility of descent, he cried out &quot;Let there be one Lord, one King&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#22 22]&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 40, Caligula began implementing very controversial policies that introduced religion into his political role. Caligula began appearing in public dressed as various gods and demigods such as [[Hercules]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XI|XI-XV]].&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he began referring to himself as a god when meeting with politicians and he was referred to as Jupiter on occasion in public documents.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#26 LIX.26].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-28&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#28 LIX.28].&lt;/ref&gt; A sacred precinct was set apart for his worship at Miletus in the province of Asia and two temples were erected for worship of him in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-28&quot; /&gt; The [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]] on the Forum was linked directly to the Imperial residence on the Palatine and dedicated to Caligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-28&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, J.: &quot;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2003/10%20september/caligula-910.html Did Caligula have a God complex?], ''Stanford Report'', 10 September 2003.{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would appear here on occasion and present himself as a god to the public. Caligula had the heads removed from various statues of gods and replaced with his own in various temples.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p. 209. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0739420259.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that he wished to be worshipped as ''Neos Helios'', the New Sun. Indeed, he was represented as a sun god on Egyptian coins. &lt;ref&gt;Allen Ward, Cedric Yeo, and Fritz Heichelheim, &quot;A History of the Roman People: Third Edition&quot;, 1999, Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caligula's religious policy was a departure from that of his predecessors. According to [[Cassius Dio]], living Emperors could be worshipped as divine in the east and dead Emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-51&quot;&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LI.20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustus]] had the public [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|worship his spirit]] on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-51&quot;/&gt; Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including Senators, worship him as a physical living god.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#26 LIX.26–28].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern policy===
Caligula needed to quell several riots and conspiracies in the eastern territories during his reign. Aiding him in his actions was his good friend, [[Herod Agrippa]], who became governor of the territories of Batanaea and Trachonitis after Caligula became emperor in AD 37.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 6|XVIII.6.10]]; Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#V|V.25]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of tensions in the east was complicated, involving the spread of Greek culture, Roman law and the rights of Jews.

Caligula did not trust the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had connections with Egyptian separatists.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' III.8, IV.21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' V.26–28.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as the king of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' V.29.&lt;/ref&gt; Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish [[synagogue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus VI|VI.43]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, riots broke out in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#VII|VII.45]].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#XXI|XXI.185]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Roman gold coins excavated in Pudukottai India one coin of Caligula 31 41 and two coins of Nero 54 68.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Roman gold coins excavated in [[Pudukottai]], [[India]], examples of [[Indo-Roman trade]] during the period. One coin of Caligula (31-41 CE), and two coins of [[Nero]] (54-68). [[British Museum]].]]
In 39, Agrippa accused [[Herod Antipas]], the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and [[Perea (Holy Land)|Perea]], of planning a rebellion against Roman rule with the help of [[Parthia]]. Herod Antipas confessed and Caligula exiled him. Agrippa was awarded with his territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-18-7-2&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 7|XVIII.7.2]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Riots again erupted in Alexandria in AD 40 between Jews and Greeks.&lt;ref name = &quot;zepjql&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 8|XVIII.8.1]].&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were accused of not honoring the emperor.&lt;ref name = &quot;zepjql&quot;/&gt; Disputes occurred in the city of Jamnia.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-30&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXX|XXX.201]].&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were angered by the erection of a clay altar and destroyed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-30&quot; /&gt; In response, Caligula ordered the erection of a statue of himself in the Jewish [[Temple of Jerusalem]],&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-statue&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXX|XXX.203]].&lt;/ref&gt; a demand in conflict with Jewish monotheism.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-caligula-16&quot;&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XVI|XVI.115]].&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[Philo]] wrote that Caligula &quot;regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion, as if they were the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-caligula-16&quot;/&gt;

The [[Roman Governor|governor]] of Syria, Publius Petronius, fearing civil war if the order were carried out, delayed implementing it for nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXXI|XXXI.213]].&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order.&lt;ref name = &quot;zepjql&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Caligula RIC 0033.jpg|thumb|left|Roman [[sestertius]] depicting Caligula, ''c.'' AD 38. The reverse shows Caligula's three sisters, Agrippina, Drusilla and Julia Livilla, with whom Caligula was rumoured to have carried on incestuous relationships.]]

===Scandals===
[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumCameeCaligula.jpg|thumb|Cameo depicting Caligula and a personification of Rome]]
Surviving sources present a number of stories about Caligula that illustrate cruelty and insanity.

The contemporary sources, [[Philo of Alexandria]] and [[Seneca the Younger]], describe an insane emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on a whim, and who indulged in too much spending and sex.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' xviii.1, ''On Anger'' III.xviii.1; ''On the Shortness of Life'' xviii.5; Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' XXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it,&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.1.&lt;/ref&gt; killing for mere amusement,&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' III.xviii.1.&lt;/ref&gt; deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation,&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Shortness of Life'' xviii.5.&lt;/ref&gt; and wanting a statue of himself erected in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] for his worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo-gaius-statue&quot;/&gt; Once at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the crowd into the arena during intermission to be eaten by animals because there were no criminals to be prosecuted and he was bored.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Daily life in the Roman City&quot;. Aldrete, Gregory.&lt;/ref&gt;

While repeating the earlier stories, the later sources of [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] provide additional tales of insanity. They accuse Caligula of [[incest]] with his sisters, [[Agrippina the Younger]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]] and [[Julia Livilla|Livilla]], and say he prostituted them to other men.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#11 LIX.11], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#22 LIX.22]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#24 24].&lt;/ref&gt; They state he sent troops on illogical military exercises,&lt;ref name=&quot;cassius-history-59-25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#46 46–47].&lt;/ref&gt; turned the palace into a brothel,&lt;ref name = &quot;gjxxsj&quot;/&gt; and most famously, tried to make his horse, [[Incitatus]], a consul and a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 55; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#14 LIX.14], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#28 LIX.28].&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of these accounts is debatable. In Roman political culture, insanity and sexual perversity were often presented hand-in-hand with poor government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Younger |first=John G. |title=Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415242525|pages=xvi |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination and aftermath===

Caligula's actions as emperor were described as being especially harsh to the Senate, the nobility and the equestrian order.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]] against Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' 16.17; Josephus, ''Antiquities of Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.2]].&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, a successful murder was planned by officers within the [[Praetorian Guard]] led by [[Cassius Chaerea]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.3]].&lt;/ref&gt; The plot is described as having been planned by three men, but many in the Senate, army and equestrian order were said to have been informed of it and involved in it.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.10]], [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.14]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Josephus, Chaerea had political motivations for the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.6]].&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius sees the motive in Caligula calling Chaerea derogatory names.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula considered Chaerea effeminate because of a weak voice and for not being firm with tax collection.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.5]].&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula would mock Chaerea with watchwords like &quot;[[Priapus]]&quot; and &quot;[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 41, Chaerea and other guardsmen accosted Caligula while he was addressing an acting troupe of young men during a series of games and dramatics held for the Divine Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].&lt;/ref&gt; Details on the events vary somewhat from source to source, but they agree that Chaerea was first to stab Caligula, followed by a number of conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.14]].&lt;/ref&gt; Suetonius records that Caligula's death was similar to that of [[Julius Caesar]]. He states that both the elder Gaius Julius Caesar (Julius Caesar) and the younger Gaius Julius Caesar (Caligula) were stabbed 30 times by conspirators led by a man named Cassius ([[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]] and Cassius Chaerea).&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#57 57], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cryptoporticus]] (underground corridor) where this event would have taken place was discovered beneath the imperial palaces on the Palatine Hill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4962109.ece Archaeologists unearth place where Emperor Caligula met his end] by Richard Owen, October 17, 2008. Retrieved 2010-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Caligula's loyal Germanic guard responded, the emperor was already dead. The Germanic guard, stricken with grief and rage, responded with a rampaging attack on the assassins, conspirators, innocent senators and bystanders alike.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 1|XIX.1.15]]; Suetonius, Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate attempted to use Caligula's death as an opportunity to restore the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2]].&lt;/ref&gt; Chaerea attempted to convince the military to support the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-19-4-4&quot;&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 4|XIX.4.4]].&lt;/ref&gt; The military, though, remained loyal to the office of the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-19-4-4&quot; /&gt; The grieving Roman people assembled and demanded that Caligula's murderers be brought to justice.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XI.1; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.20]].&lt;/ref&gt; Uncomfortable with lingering imperial support, the assassins sought out and stabbed Caligula's wife, [[Caesonia]], and killed their young daughter, [[Julia_Drusilla_(daughter_of_Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]], by smashing her head against a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 59.&lt;/ref&gt; They were unable to reach Caligula's uncle, [[Claudius]], who was spirited out of the city to a nearby Praetorian camp.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2.1]].&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius became emperor after procuring the support of the Praetorian guard and ordered the execution of Chaerea and any other known conspirators involved in the death of Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 3|XIX.3.1]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suetonius, Caligula's body was placed under turf until it was burned and entombed by his sisters. He was buried within the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]; in 410 during the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]] the tomb's ashes were scattered.

===Historiography===
The history of Caligula's reign is extremely problematic as only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived — the works of [[Philo]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Philo's works, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' and ''Flaccus'', give some details on Caligula's early reign, but mostly focus on events surrounding the Jewish population in Judea and Egypt with whom he sympathizes. Seneca's various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula's personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, there were detailed contemporaneous histories on Caligula, but they are now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' I.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Cluvius Rufus]] both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus was a friend of Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola'' X, ''Annals'' XIII.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Caligula's sister, [[Agrippina the Younger]], wrote an autobiography that certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula's reign, but it too is lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Lepidus]], who conspired against Caligula.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio-caligula-22&quot; /&gt; The inheritance of [[Nero]], Agrippina's son and the future emperor, was seized by Caligula. [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus|Gaetulicus]], a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but they too are lost.

The bulk of what is known of Caligula comes from [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]]. Suetonius wrote his history on Caligula 80 years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 180 years after Caligula's death. Though Cassius Dio's work is invaluable because it alone gives a loose chronology of Caligula's reign, his work only survives in a summary written by [[John Xiphilinus]], an 11th century monk.

A handful of other sources add a limited perspective on Caligula. [[Josephus]] gives a detailed description of Caligula's assassination. [[Tacitus]] provides some information on Caligula's life under [[Tiberius]]. In a now lost portion of his ''Annals'', Tacitus gave a detailed history of Caligula. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'' has a few brief references to Caligula.

There are few surviving sources on Caligula and no surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light. The paucity of sources has resulted in significant gaps in the reign of Caligula. Little is written on the first two years of Caligula's reign. Additionally, there are only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of [[Mauretania]], Caligula's military actions in [[Britannia]], and his feud with the [[Roman Senate]].

===Health===
All surviving sources, except [[Pliny the Elder]], characterize Caligula as insane. However it is not known whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for Caligula's behavior, citing as possibilities [[encephalitis]], [[epilepsy]] or [[meningitis]]. The question of whether or not Caligula was insane remains unanswered.

[[Philo of Alexandria]], [[Josephus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] state Caligula was insane, but describe this madness as a personality trait that came through experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-18-7-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of the Wise Person'' XVIII.1; Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' I.xx.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of the Wise Person'' XVII-XVIII; Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' I.xx.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him to think he was a god.&lt;ref name=&quot;josephus-antiquities-18-7-2&quot; /&gt; [[Philo of Alexandria]] reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of his illness in 39.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' III-IV.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juvenal]] reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.

[[Suetonius]] said that Caligula suffered from &quot;falling sickness&quot;, or [[epilepsy]], when he was young.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians have theorized that Caligula lived with a daily fear of seizures.&lt;ref&gt;D. Thomas Benediktson, &quot;Caligula's Phobias and Philias: Fear of Seizure?&quot;, ''The Classical Journal'' (1991) pp. 159–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite swimming being a part of imperial education, Caligula could not swim.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Augustus 64, Life of Caligula 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Epileptics are encouraged not to swim in open waters because unexpected fitting in such difficult rescue circumstances can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Pearn, &quot;Epilepsy and Drowning in Childhood,&quot; ''British Medical Journal'' (1977) pp. 1510–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Caligula reportedly talked to the full moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;suetonius-caligula-26&quot; /&gt; Epilepsy was long associated with the moon.&lt;ref&gt;O. Temkin, ''The Falling Sickness'' (2nd ed., Baltimore 1971) 3–4, 7, 13, 16, 26, 86, 92–96, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern historians think that Caligula suffered from [[hyperthyroidism]].&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Katz, &quot;The Illness of Caligula&quot; CW 65(1972),223-25, refuted by M.G. Morgan, &quot;Caligula's Illness Again&quot;, CW 66(1973), 327–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This diagnosis is mainly attributed to Caligula's irritability and his &quot;stare&quot; as described by Pliny the Elder.

A recent study of Caligula's life has argued that his illness may have been an indication of [[lead poisoning]]. The Romans believed that pure wine could only be brewed in lead bowls, and Caligula's drinking was reputed to be excessive. A contemporaneous bowl artifact was tested and revealed high amounts of lead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/ancients-behaving-badly/EP01191561 Ancients Behaving Badly].

===Rediscovery of burial site?===

==In popular culture==
''Caligula'', by French author [[Albert Camus]], is a play in which Caligula returns after deserting the palace for three days and three nights following the death of his beloved sister, Drusilla. The young emperor then uses his unfettered power to 'bring the impossible into the realm of the likely'.

In the novel ''[[I, Claudius]]'' by English writer [[Robert Graves]], Caligula is presented as being a murderous sociopath from his childhood, who became clinically insane early in his reign. At the age of only seven, he drove his father [[Germanicus]] to despair and death by secretly terrorizing him. Graves's Caligula commits incest with all three of his sisters and is implied to have murdered Drusilla.

American actor [[Jay Robinson]] famously portrayed a sinister and scene-stealing Caligula in two epic films of the 1950s, ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (1953) and its sequel ''[[Demetrius and the Gladiators]]'' (1954).

Caligula has been played by [[Ralph Bates]] in the 1968 [[ITV]] television series ''[[The Caesars (TV series)|The Caesars]]''; [[John Hurt]] in the 1976 [[BBC]] television series ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]''; [[John McEnery]] in the 1985 miniseries ''A.D.''; Szabolcs Hajdu in the 1996 film ''Caligula''; and [[John Simm]] in the 2004 miniseries ''Imperium Nerone''. In [[Muriel Spark]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The Takeover (novel)|The Takeover]]'' the eccentric Hubert Mallindaine believes himself to be a direct descendant of Caligula.

A feature-length historical film ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'' was completed in [[1979 in film|1979]], in which [[Malcolm McDowell]] played the lead role. The film alienated audiences with extremely explicit sex and violence and received extremely negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:7895~T1 Caligula &gt; Overview – AllMovie.com]. Retrieved 2010-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emlyn Williams]] was cast as Caligula in the never-completed 1937 film ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'', and [[Courtney Love]] appeared as Caligula in a fake trailer for ''Gore Vidal's Caligula'', ostensibly a remake of the 1979 film, but actually a parodic short film by conceptual artist Francesco Vezzoli.&lt;ref name=test&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/arts/design/26yabl.html?ex=1298610000&amp;en=d05471946d7b6eb0&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss, 'Caligula' Gives a Toga Party (but No One's Really Invited)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The play ''The Reckoning of Kit and Little Boots'' by Nat Cassidy, examines the lives of the Elizabethan playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]] and Caligula, with the fictional conceit that Marlowe was working on a play about Caligula around the time of his own murder. It emphasizes the similarities between the two characters—both stabbed to death at 29, both in part as a result to their controversial perspectives on religion. The play focuses on Caligula's love for his sister Drusilla, and his deep-rooted loathing for Tiberius. It received its world premiere in New York City in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/nycguide/451942,8.html]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytheatrecast.com/wordpress/archives/98 nytheatrecast » Blog Archive » Episode #223 – The Reckoning of Kit &amp; Boots and Hope’s Arbor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[Avatar Press]] started publishing a comic book Caligula written by horror comic writer [[David Lapham]]

In [[Computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], the '''Church–Turing thesis''' (also known as the '''Church–Turing conjecture''', '''Church's thesis''', '''Church's conjecture''', and '''Turing's thesis''') is a combined [[hypothesis]] (&quot;thesis&quot;) about the nature of functions whose values are [[effectively calculable]]; i.e. computable. In simple terms, it states that &quot;everything computable is computable by a [[Turing machine]].&quot;

Several attempts were made in the first half of the 20th Century to formalize the notion of [[computability]]: 
* American mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] created a method for defining functions called the [[Lambda calculus|λ-calculus]],
* British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] created a theoretical model for a machine, now called a [[universal Turing machine]], that could carry out calculations from inputs,
* Church, along with mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] and logician [[J. Barkley Rosser|J.B. Rosser]] created a formal definition of a class of functions whose values could be calculated by [[recursion]].
All three computational processes (recursion, the λ-calculus, and the Turing machine) were shown to be equivalent—all three approaches define the same class of functions.&lt;ref&gt;Church 1934:90 footnote in Davis 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1952:149&lt;/ref&gt; This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Informally the Church–Turing thesis states that if some method ([[algorithm]]) exists to carry out a calculation, then the same calculation can also be carried out by a Turing machine (as well as by a [[recursion|recursively]]-definable function, and by a [[lambda calculus|λ-function]]).

The Church–Turing thesis is a statement that characterizes the nature of computation and cannot be formally proven.  Even though the three processes mentioned above proved to be equivalent, the fundamental premise behind the thesis—the notion of what it means for a function to be &quot;effectively calculable&quot; (computable)—is &quot;a somewhat vague intuitive one&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;irmrxd&quot;&gt;Kleene 1952:317&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the &quot;thesis&quot; remains  an hypothesis.&lt;ref name = &quot;irmrxd&quot;/&gt;  

Despite the fact that it cannot be formally proven, the Church–Turing thesis now has near-universal acceptance.

==Formal statement==
{{See also|Effectively calculable}}

Rosser 1939 addresses the notion of &quot;effective computability&quot; as follows: &quot;Clearly the existence of CC and RC (Church's and Rosser's proofs) presupposes a precise definition of &quot;effective&quot;. &quot;[[Effective method]]&quot; is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the adverb-adjective &quot;effective&quot; is used in a sense of &quot;1a: producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect&quot;, and &quot;capable of producing a result&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following, the words &quot;effectively calculable&quot; will mean &quot;produced by any intuitively 'effective' means whatsoever&quot; and &quot;effectively computable&quot; will mean &quot;produced by a Turing-machine or equivalent mechanical device&quot;. Turing's 1939 &quot;definitions&quot; are virtually the same: 
:&quot;†We shall use the expression &quot;computable function&quot; to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let &quot;effectively calculable&quot; refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions.&quot;(cf. the footnote † in Turing 1939 (his Ordinals paper) in Davis 1965:160).

The thesis can be stated as follows:

:''Every effectively calculable function is a computable function''.&lt;ref&gt;Gandy (Gandy 1980 in Barwise 1980:123) states it this way: ''What is effectively calculable is computable.'' He calls this &quot;Church's Thesis&quot;, a peculiar choice of moniker.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing stated it this way:
:&quot;It was stated ... that 'a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process.' We may take this literally, understanding that by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. The development ... leads to ... an identification of computability † with effective calculability&quot; († is the footnote above, ibid).

&lt;!-- :''&quot;Every '[[function (mathematics)|function]] which would naturally be regarded as [[computable function|computable]]' can be computed by either [[recursion]] or by a [[Turing machine]].&quot;''

The term '''effectively calculable''' is commonly used for a function that is naturally regarded as computable, for example one for which an algorithm is provided.  Due to the vagueness of the concept of effective calculability, the Church–Turing thesis cannot formally be proven or refuted.

Any non-interactive computer program can be translated into a Turing machine, and any Turing machine can be translated into any [[Turing complete]] [[programming language]], so the thesis is equivalent to saying that any [[Turing complete]] programming language is sufficient to express any algorithm. This also means that any solvable problem can therefore be reduced to previously solved problems (the Turing machine instruction set) or by definition is unsolvable. --&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Church–Turing thesis}}

One of the important problems for logicians in the 1930s was [[David Hilbert|David Hilbert's]] [[Entscheidungsproblem]], which asked if there was a mechanical procedure for separating mathematical truths from mathematical falsehoods. This quest required that the notion of “algorithm” or “effective calculability” be pinned down, at least well enough for the quest to begin.&lt;ref&gt;Davis’s commentary before Church 1936 ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' in Davis 1965:88. Church uses the words “effective calculability” on page 100ff.&lt;/ref&gt; But from the very outset [[Alonzo Church]]'s attempts began with a debate that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;In his review of ''Church’s Thesis after 70 Years'' edited by Adam Olszewski et al. 2006, Peter Smith's criticism of a paper by Muraswski and Wolenski suggests 4 &quot;lines&quot; re the status of the Church–Turing Thesis: (1) empirical hypothesis (2) axiom or theorem, (3) definition, (4) explication. But Smith opines that (4) is indistinguishable from (3), cf Smith (July 11, 2007) ''Church’s Thesis after 70 Years'' at http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/Smith/godelbook/other/CTT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Was the notion of “effective calculability” to be (i) an &quot;axiom or axioms&quot; in an axiomatic system, or (ii) merely a ''definition'' that “identified” two or more propositions, or (iii) an ''empirical hypothesis'' to be verified by observation of natural events, or (iv) or just ''a proposal'' for the sake of argument (i.e. a &quot;thesis&quot;).

=== Circa 1930–1952 ===
In the course of studying the problem, Church and his student [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] introduced the notion of [[Lambda calculus|λ-definable functions]], and they were able to prove that several large classes of functions frequently encountered in number theory were λ-definable.&lt;ref&gt;cf footnote 3 in Church 1936 ‘’An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory’’ in Davis 1965:89&lt;/ref&gt; The debate began when Church proposed to [[Kurt Gödel]] that one should define the &quot;effectively computable&quot; functions as the λ-definable functions. Gödel, however, was not convinced and called the proposal &quot;thoroughly unsatisfactory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997:99&lt;/ref&gt; Rather in correspondence with Church (ca 1934–5), Gödel proposed ''axiomatizing'' the notion of &quot;effective calculability&quot;; indeed, in a 1935 letter to Kleene, Church reported that: 
:&quot;His [Gödel's] only idea at the time was that it might be possible, in terms of effective calculability as an undefined notion, to state a set of axioms which would embody the generally accepted properties of this notion, and to do something on that basis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sieg160&quot;/&gt;

But Gödel offered no further guidance. Eventually, he would suggest his (primitive) recursion, modified by [[Herbrand]]'s suggestion, that he (Gödel) had detailed in his 1934 lectures in Princeton NJ (Kleene and another student [[J. Barkley Rosser|J. B. Rosser]] transcribed the notes.). But &quot;he did not think that the two ideas could be satisfactorily identified &quot;except heuristically&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sieg 1997:160 quoting from the 1935 letter written by Church to Kleene, cf Footnote 3 in Gödel 1934 in Davis 1965:44&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Next, it was necessary to identify and prove the equivalence of two notions of effective calculability. Equipped with the λ-calculus and &quot;general&quot; recursion, [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] with help of Church and [[J. Barkley Rosser|J. B. Rosser]] produced proofs (1933, 1935) to show that the two calculi are equivalent. Church subsequently modified his methods to include use of Herbrand–Gödel recursion and then proved (1936) that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is unsolvable: There is no generalized &quot;effective calculation&quot; (method, algorithm) that can determine whether or not a formula in either the recursive- or λ-calculus is &quot;valid&quot; (more precisely: no method to show that a [[well formed formula]] has a &quot;normal form&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;cf Church 1936 in Davis 1965:105ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later in a letter to Davis (ca 1965), Gödel would confess that &quot;he was, at the time of these [1934] lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis's commentary before Gödel 1934 in Davis 1965:40&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963–4 Gödel would disavow Herbrand–Gödel recursion and the λ-calculus in favor of the Turing machine as the definition of “algorithm” or “mechanical procedure” or “formal system”.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of Gödel's adoption of Turing's machines as models of computation, see Shagrir date TBD at http://edelstein.huji.ac.il/staff/shagrir/papers/Goedel_on_Turing_on_Computability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''An hypothesis leading to a natural law?''': In late 1936 [[Alan Turing]]’s paper (also proving that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is unsolvable) had not yet appeared. On the other hand, [[Emil Post]]'s 1936 paper had appeared and was certified independent of Turing's work.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Editor's footnote to Post 1936 ''Finite Combinatory Process. Formulation I.'' at Davis 1965:289.&lt;/ref&gt; Post strongly disagreed with Church’s “identification” of effective computability with the λ-calculus and recursion, stating: 
:&quot;Actually the work already done by Church and others carries this identification considerably beyond the working hypothesis stage. But to mask this identification under a definition  . . . blinds us to the need of its continual verification.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Post 1936 in Davis 1965:291 footnote 8&lt;/ref&gt;
Rather, he regarded the notion of “effective calculability” as merely a &quot;working hypothesis&quot; that might lead by [[inductive reasoning]] to a &quot;[[natural law]]&quot; rather than by “a definition or an axiom”.&lt;ref&gt;Post 1936 in Davis 1952:291&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was &quot;sharply&quot; criticized by Church.&lt;ref&gt;Sieg 1997:171 and 176–7)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus Post in his 1936&lt;ref name=&quot;sieg160&quot;&gt;Sieg 1997:160&lt;/ref&gt; was also discounting [[Kurt Gödel]]'s suggestion to Church in 1934–5 that the thesis might be expressed as an axiom or set of axioms.&lt;ref name=&quot;sieg160&quot; /&gt;

'''Turing adds another definition, Rosser equates all three''': Within just a short time, Turing's 1936–37 paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot; appeared. In it he asserted another notion of &quot;effective computability&quot; with the introduction of his a-machines (now known as the [[Turing machine]] abstract computational model). And in a proof-sketch added as an &quot;Appendix&quot; to his 1936–37 paper, Turing showed that the classes of functions defined by λ-calculus and Turing machines coincided.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:263ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few years (1939) Turing would propose, like Church and Kleene before him, that ''his'' formal definition of mechanical computing agent was the correct one.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1939 in Davis:160&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by 1939, both Church (1934) and Turing (1939), neither having knowledge of the other’s efforts, had individually proposed that their &quot;formal systems&quot; should be ''definitions'' of &quot;effective calculability&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;cf Church 1934 in Davis 1965:100, also Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160)&lt;/ref&gt; neither framed their assertions as ''theses''. 

Rosser (1939) formally identified the three notions-as-definitions: 
: &quot;All three ''definitions'' are equivalent, so it does not matter which one is used.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;italics added, Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:226&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kleene proposes ''Church's Thesis''''': This left the overt expression of a &quot;thesis” to Kleene. In his 1943 paper ''Recursive Predicates and Quantifiers'' Kleene proposed his &quot;THESIS I&quot;:
:&quot;This heuristic fact [general recursive functions are effectively calculable]...led Church to state the following thesis(&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;). The same thesis is implicit in Turing's description of computing machines(&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;).
::&quot;THESIS I. ''Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general&lt;ref&gt;An archaic usage of Kleene et al. to distinguish Gödel's (1931) &quot;rekursiv&quot; (a few years later named [[primitive recursion]] by [[Rózsa Péter]] (cf Gandy 1994 in Herken 1994–5:68)) from Herbrand–Gödel's recursion of 1934 i.e. primitive recursion equipped with the additional [[mu operator]]; nowadays mu-recursion is called, simply, &quot;[[recursion]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; recursive'' [Kleene's italics]
:&quot;Since a precise mathematical definition of the term effectively calculable (effectively decidable) has been wanting, we can take this thesis ... as a definition of it...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis274&quot;&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274&lt;/ref&gt;
::&quot;(&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;) references Church 1936
::&quot;(&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;) references  Turing 1936–7
Kleene goes on to note that:
:&quot;...the thesis has the character of an hypothesis—a point emphasized by Post and by Church(&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;). If we consider the thesis and its converse as definition, then the hypothesis is an hypothesis about the application of the mathematical theory developed from the definition. For the acceptance of the hypothesis, there are, as we have suggested, quite compelling grounds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis274&quot; /&gt;

'''Kleene's Church–Turing Thesis''': A few years later (1952) Kleene would overtly name, defend, and express the two &quot;theses&quot; and then &quot;identify&quot; them (show equivalence) by use of his Theorem XXX:
:&quot;Heuristic evidence and other considerations led Church 1936 to propose the following thesis.
::Thesis I. ''Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive''.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:300&lt;/ref&gt;
:Theorem XXX: &quot;The following classes of partial functions are coextensive, i.e. have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions. . . &quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:376&lt;/ref&gt;
:Turing's thesis: &quot;Turing's thesis that every function which would naturally be regarded as computable is computable under his definition, i.e. by one of his machines, is equivalent to Church's thesis by Theorem XXX.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:376)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later developments ===
An attempt to understand the notion of &quot;effective computability&quot; better led [[Robin Gandy]] (Turing's student and friend) in 1980 to analyze ''machine'' computation (as opposed to human-computation acted out by a Turing machine). Gandy's curiosity about, and analysis of, &quot;[[cellular automata]]&quot;, &quot;[[Conway's game of life]]&quot;, &quot;parallelism&quot; and &quot;crystalline automata&quot; led him to propose four &quot;principles (or constraints) ... which it is argued, any machine must satisfy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gandy 1980 in Barwise 1980:123ff)&lt;/ref&gt; His most-important fourth, &quot;the principle of causality&quot; is based on the &quot;finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals; contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gandy 1980 in Barwise 1980:135&lt;/ref&gt; From these principles and some additional constraints—(1a) a lower bound on the linear dimensions of any of the parts, (1b) an upper bound on speed of propagation (the velocity of light), (2) discrete progress of the machine, and (3) deterministic behavior—he produces a theorem that &quot;What can be calculated by a device satisfying principles I–IV is computable.&lt;ref&gt;Gandy 1980 in Barwise:126&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;.

In the late 1990s [[Wilfried Sieg]] analyzed Turing's and Gandy's notions of &quot;effective calculability&quot; with the intent of &quot;sharpening the informal notion, formulating its general features axiomatically, and investigating the axiomatic framework&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(Sieg 1998–9 in Sieg–Somner–Talcott 2002:390ff; also Sieg 1997:154ff)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1997 and 2002 Sieg presents a series of constraints on the behavior of a ''computor''—&quot;a human computing agent who proceeds mechanically&quot;; these constraints reduce to: 
*&quot;(B.1) (Boundedness) ''There is a fixed bound on the number of symbolic configurations a computor can immediately recognize.''
*&quot;(B.2) (Boundedness) ''There is a fixed bound on the number of internal states a computor can be in.''
*&quot;(L.1) (Locality) ''A computor can change only elements of an observed symbolic configuration.''
*&quot;(L.2) (Locality) ''A computor can shift attention from one symbolic configuration to another one, but the new observed configurations must be within a bounded distance of the immediately previously observed configuration.''
*&quot;(D) (Determinacy) ''The immediately recognizable (sub-)configuration determines uniquely the next computation step (and id [instantaneous description] )''&quot;; stated another way: &quot;''A computor's internal state together with the observed configuration fixes uniquely the next computation step and the next internal state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In a footnote Sieg breaks Post's 1936 (B) into (B.1) and (B.2) and (L) into (L.1) and (L.2) and describes (D) differently. With respect to his proposed [[Gandy machine]] he later adds LC.1, LC.2, GA.1 and GA.2. These are complicated; see Sieg 1998–9 in Sieg–Somner–Talcott 2002:390ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter remains in active discussion within the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;A collection of papers can be found at ''Church’s Thesis after 70 Years'' edited by Adam
Olszewski et al. 2006. Also a review of this collection by Peter Smith (July 11, 2007) ''Church’s Thesis after 70 Years'' at http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/Smith/godelbook/other/CTT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success of the thesis==
Other formalisms (besides recursion, the [[Lambda calculus|λ-calculus]], and the [[Turing machine]]) have been proposed for describing effective calculability/computability . [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] (1952) adds to the list the functions &quot;''reckonable'' in the system S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; of [[Kurt Gödel]] 1936, and [[Emil Post]]'s (1943, 1946) &quot;''canonical'' [also called ''normal''] ''systems''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:320&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] and [[Martin Davis]] greatly simplified the one-tape Turing-machine model (see [[Post–Turing machine]]). [[Marvin Minsky]] expanded the model to two or more tapes and greatly simplified the tapes into &quot;up-down counters&quot;, which Melzak and [[Joachim Lambek|Lambek]] further evolved into what is now known as the [[counter machine]] model. In the late 1960s and early 1970s researchers expanded the counter machine model into the [[register machine]], a close cousin to the modern notion of the [[computer]]. Other models include [[combinatory logic]] and [[Markov algorithm]]s. Gurevich adds the [[pointer machine]] model of Kolmogorov and Uspensky (1953, 1958): &quot;...they just wanted to ... convince themselves that there is no way to extend the notion of computable function.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich 1988:2&lt;/ref&gt;

All these contributions involve proofs that the models are computationally equivalent to the Turing machine; such models are said to be [[Turing complete]]. Because all these different attempts at formalizing the concept of &quot;effective calculability/computability&quot; have yielded equivalent results, it is now generally assumed that the Church–Turing thesis is correct. In fact, Gödel (1936) proposed something stronger than this; he observed that there was something &quot;absolute&quot; about the concept of &quot;reckonable in S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;:
:&quot;It may also be shown that a function which is computable ['reckonable'] in one of the systems S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, or even in a system of transfinite type, is already computable [reckonable] in S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus the concept 'computable' ['reckonable'] is in a certain definite sense 'absolute', while practically all other familiar metamathematical concepts (e.g. provable, definable, etc.) depend quite essentially on the system to which they are defined&quot;&lt;ref&gt;translation of Gödel (1936) by Davis in ''The Undecidable'' p. 83, differing in the use of the word 'reckonable' in the translation in Kleene (1952) p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--In the early twentieth century, mathematicians often used the informal phrase ''effectively computable'', so it was important to find a good formalization of the concept. Modern mathematicians instead use the well-defined term ''Turing computable'' (or ''computable'' for short). Since the undefined terminology has faded from use, the question of how to define it is now less important.--&gt;

== Informal usage in proofs ==

Proofs in computability theory often invoke&lt;ref&gt;Horsten in Olszewski 2006:256&lt;/ref&gt; the Church–Turing thesis in an informal way to establish the computability of functions while avoiding the (often very long) details which would be involved in a rigorous, formal proof.  To establish that a function is computable by Turing machine, it is usually considered sufficient to give an informal English description of how the function can be effectively computed, and then conclude &quot;By the Church–Turing thesis&quot; that the function is Turing computable (equivalently partial recursive).

Dirk van Dalen (in Gabbay 2001:284&lt;ref&gt;Gabbay 2001:284&lt;/ref&gt;) gives the following example for the sake of illustrating this informal use of the Church–Turing thesis:

:EXAMPLE: Each infinite [[recursively enumerable|RE]] set contains an infinite recursive set.

:Proof: Let A be infinite RE.  We list the elements of A effectively, n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...
:From this list we extract an increasing sublist: put m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, after finitely many steps we find an n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; such that n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, put m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.  We repeat this procedure to find m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. this yields an effective listing of the subset B={m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...} of A, with the property m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; m&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;.
:''Claim''.  B is decidable.  For, in order to test k in B we must check if k=m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for some i.  Since the sequence of m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s is increasing we have to produce at most k+1 elements of the list and compare them with k.  If none of them is equal to k, then k not in B.  Since this test is effective, B is decidable and, '''by Church's thesis''', recursive.

(Emphasis added).  In order to make the above example completely rigorous, one would have to carefully construct a Turing Machine, or λ-function, or carefully invoke recursion axioms, or at best, cleverly invoke various theorems of computability theory.  But because the computability theorist believes that Turing computability correctly captures what can be computed effectively, and because an effective procedure is spelled out in English for deciding the set B, the computability theorist accepts this as proof that the set is indeed recursive.

As a rule of thumb, the Church–Turing thesis should only be invoked to simplify proofs in cases where the writer would be capable of, and expects the readers also to be capable of, easily (but not necessarily without tedium) producing a rigorous proof if one were demanded

The success of the Church–Turing thesis prompted variations of the thesis to be proposed. For example, the '''Physical Church–Turing thesis''' (PCTT) states:

::&quot;According to Physical CTT, all physically computable functions are Turing-computable&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gualtiero Piccinini|Piccinini]] 2007:101 [http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/Computationalism_Church-Turing_Thesis_Church-Turing_Fallacy.pdf &quot;Computationalism, the Church–Turing Thesis, and the Church–Turing Fallacy&quot;]. doi:10.1007/s11229-005-0194-z. in Synthese (2007) 154:97–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church–Turing thesis says nothing about the efficiency with which one model of computation can simulate another. It has been proved for instance that a (multi-tape) [[universal Turing machine]] only suffers a logarithmic slowdown factor in simulating any Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;Arora, Sanjeev; Barak, Boaz, [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/theory/complexity/ &quot;Complexity Theory: A Modern Approach&quot;], Cambridge University Press, 2009, ISBN 978-0-521-42426-4, section 1.4, &quot;Machines as strings and the universal Turing machine&quot; and 1.7, &quot;Proof of theorem 1.9&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; No such result has been proved in general for an arbitrary but ''reasonable'' model of computation. A variation of the Church–Turing thesis that addresses this issue is the '''Feasibility Thesis'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/Official_Problem_Description.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or '''(Classical) Complexity-Theoretic Church–Turing Thesis''' (SCTT), which is not due to Church or Turing, but rather was realized gradually in the development of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]. It states:&lt;ref name=kaye&gt;Phillip Kaye, Raymond Laflamme, Michele Mosca, ''An introduction to quantum computing'', Oxford University Press, 2007, ISBN 0-19-857049-X, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;''A [[probabilistic Turing machine]] can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation.''&quot;

The word 'efficiently' here means up to polynomial-time reductions. This thesis was originally called ''Computational Complexity-Theoretic Church–Turing Thesis'' by Ethan Bernstein and [[Umesh Vazirani]] (1997). The Complexity-Theoretic Church–Turing Thesis, then, posits that all 'reasonable' models of computation yield the same class of problems that can be computed in polynomial time.  Assuming the conjecture that probabilistic polynomial time ([[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]) equals deterministic polynomial time ([[P (complexity)|P]]), the word 'probabilistic' is optional in the Complexity-Theoretic Church–Turing Thesis. A similar thesis, called the ''Invariant Thesis'', was introduced by Cees F. Slot and Peter van Emde Boas. It states: ''&quot;Reasonable&quot; machines can simulate each other within a polynomially bounded overhead in time and a constant-factor overhead in space''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter van Emde Boas's, ''Machine Models and Simulations'', in ''Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science A'', Elsevier, 1990, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis originally appeared in a paper at [[STOC]]'84, which was the first paper to show that polynomial-time overhead and constant-space overhead could be ''simultaneously'' achieved for a simulation of a [[Random Access Machine]] on a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;C. Slot, P. van Emde Boas, ''On tape versus core: an application of space efficient perfect hash functions to the invariance of space'', [[STOC]], December 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

If production-scale [[quantum computing|quantum computers]] can be built,&lt;ref&gt;Liesbeth Venema, ''Quantum information: Reality check'', Nature 450, 175–176 (8 November 2007) doi:10.1038/450175a&lt;/ref&gt; they could invalidate the Complexity-Theoretic Church–Turing Thesis, since it is also conjectured that quantum polynomial time ([[BQP]]) is larger than BPP.  In other words, there are efficient [[quantum algorithms]] that perform tasks that are not known to have efficient [[probabilistic algorithms]]; for example, factoring integers. They would not however invalidate the original Church–Turing thesis, since a quantum computer can always be simulated by a Turing machine, but they would invalidate the classical Complexity-Theoretic Church–Turing thesis for efficiency reasons. Consequently, the '''Quantum Complexity-Theoretic Church–Turing thesis''' states:&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt;
:''&quot;A [[quantum Turing machine]] can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation.&quot;''

==Philosophical implications==
The Church–Turing thesis has some profound implications for the [[philosophy of mind]]; however many of the philosophical interpretations of the Thesis involve basic misunderstandings of the thesis statement.&lt;ref&gt;In particular see the numerous examples (of errors, of misappropriation of the thesis) at the entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. For a good place to encounter original papers see David J. Chalmers, ed. 2002, ''Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings'', Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Copeland|B. Jack Copeland]] states that it's an open empirical question whether there are actual deterministic physical processes that, in the long run, elude simulation by a Turing machine; furthermore, he states that it is an open empirical question whether any such processes are involved in the working of the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;B. Jack Copeland, ''Computation'' in Luciano Floridi (ed.), ''The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, ISBN 0-631-22919-1, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some important open questions which cover the relationship between the Church–Turing thesis and physics, and the possibility of [[hypercomputation]]. When applied to physics, the thesis has several possible meanings:

#The universe is equivalent to a Turing machine; thus, computing [[non-recursive function]]s is physically impossible.  This has been termed the Strong Church–Turing thesis and is a foundation of [[digital physics]].
#The universe is not equivalent to a Turing machine (i.e., the laws of physics are not Turing-computable), but incomputable physical events are not &quot;harnessable&quot; for the construction of a [[hypercomputation|hypercomputer]].  For example, a universe in which physics involves [[real numbers]], as opposed to [[computable number|computable real]]s, might fall into this category.
#The universe is a [[hypercomputation|hypercomputer]], and it is possible to build physical devices to harness this property and calculate [[non-recursive function]]s. For example, it is an open question whether all [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] events are Turing-computable, although it is known that rigorous models such as quantum Turing machines are equivalent to deterministic Turing machines.  (They are not necessarily efficiently equivalent; see above.)  [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] and, more famously, [[Roger Penrose]]&lt;ref&gt;cf his subchapter &quot;The Church–Turing Thesis&quot; (p. 47–49) in his chapter &quot;Algorithms and Turing machines&quot; in his 1990 (2nd edition) ''Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK. Also his a final chapter titled &quot;Where lies the physics of mind?&quot; where, in a subsection he asserts &quot;The non-algorithmic nature of mathematical insight&quot; (p. 416–8).&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the human mind might be the result of some kind of quantum-mechanically enhanced, &quot;non-algorithmic&quot; computation, although there is no scientific evidence for this proposal.

There are many other technical possibilities which fall outside or between these three categories, but these serve to illustrate the range of the concept.

== Non-computable functions ==

One can formally define functions that are not computable. A well known example of such a function is the [[busy beaver]] function. This function takes an input ''n'' and returns the largest number of symbols that a [[Turing machine]] with ''n'' states can print before halting, when run with no input. Using particular models of Turing machines, researchers have computed the value of this function for small values of ''n'':  0 through 4.  Simulations of Turing machines with 5 and 6 states have been performed, but without conclusive results. For higher values, only lower bounds have been given. Finding an upper bound on the busy beaver function is equivalent to solving the [[halting problem]], a problem known to be unsolvable by Turing machines. Since the busy beaver function cannot be computed by Turing machines, the Church–Turing thesis asserts that this function cannot be effectively computed by any method. 

Mark Burgin, Eugene Eberbach, Peter Kugel, and other researchers argue that [[super-recursive algorithm]]s such as inductive Turing machines disprove the Church–Turing thesis. Their argument relies on a definition of algorithm broader than the ordinary one, so that non-computable functions obtained from some inductive Turing machines are called computable. This interpretation of the Church–Turing thesis differs from the interpretation commonly accepted in computability theory, discussed above. The argument that super-recursive algorithms are indeed algorithms in the sense of the Church–Turing thesis has not found broad acceptance within the computability research community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In computing, '''multitasking''' is a method where multiple tasks, also known as [[Computer process|processes]], share common processing resources such as a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. In the case of a computer with a single CPU, only one task is said to be ''running'' at any point in time, meaning that the CPU is actively executing instructions for that task.
Multitasking solves the problem by [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] which task may be the one running at any given time, and when another waiting task gets a turn.  The act of reassigning a CPU from one task to another one is called a [[context switch]].
When context switches occur frequently enough the illusion of [[Parallel computing|parallelism]] is achieved.
Even on computers with more than one CPU (called [[multiprocessor]] machines), multitasking allows many more tasks to be run than there are CPUs.

Operating systems may adopt one of many different [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling strategies]], which generally fall into the following categories:
* In ''[[multiprogramming]]'' systems, the running task keeps running until it performs an operation that requires waiting for an external event (e.g. reading from a tape) or until the computer's scheduler forcibly swaps the running task out of the CPU. Multiprogramming systems are designed to maximize CPU usage.
* In ''[[time-sharing]]'' systems, the running task is required to relinquish the CPU, either voluntarily or by an external event such as a [[hardware interrupt]]. Time sharing systems are designed to allow several programs to execute apparently simultaneously. The expression 'time sharing' was usually used to designate computers shared by interactive users at terminals, such as IBM's [[Time Sharing Option|TSO]], and [[CP/CMS|VM/CMS]]
* In ''[[Real-time computing|real-time]]'' systems, some waiting tasks are guaranteed to be given the CPU when an external event occurs. Real time systems are designed to control mechanical devices such as industrial robots, which require timely processing.

The term ''time-sharing'' is no longer commonly used, having been replaced by simply ''multitasking'', and by the advent of personal computers and workstations rather than shared interactive systems.

== Multiprogramming ==
{{Merge from|Multiprogramming|date=February 2010}}
{{Main|Multiprogramming}}
In the early days of computing, [[CPU time]] was expensive, and [[peripheral]]s were very slow. When the computer ran a program that needed access to a peripheral, the CPU would have to stop executing program instructions while the peripheral processed the data. This was deemed very inefficient.
The first computer using a multitasking system was the British ''[[LEO_(computer)#Applications_and_successors|Leo III]]'' owned by [[J. Lyons and Co.]]. Several different programs in batch were loaded in the computer memory, and the first one began to run. When the first program reached an instruction waiting for a peripheral, the context of this program was stored away, and the second program in memory was given a chance to run. The process continued until all programs finished running.

Multiprogramming doesn't give any guarantee that a program will run in a timely manner. Indeed, the very first program may very well run for hours without needing access to a peripheral. As there were no users waiting at an interactive terminal, this was no problem: users handed on a deck of punched cards to an operator, and came back a few hours later for printed results. Multiprogramming greatly reduced wait times when multiple batches were being processed.

== Cooperative multitasking/time-sharing ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Apple IIGS]] --&gt;
When computer usage evolved from batch mode to interactive mode, multiprogramming was no longer a suitable approach. Each
user wanted to see his program running as if it were the only program in the computer. The use of time sharing made this possible, with the qualification that the computer would not seem as fast to any one user as it really would be if it were running only that user's program.

Early multitasking systems used applications that voluntarily ceded time to one another. This approach, which was eventually supported by many computer [[operating system]]s, is known today as cooperative multitasking. Although it is now rarely used in larger systems, cooperative multitasking was once the scheduling scheme employed by [[Microsoft Windows]] (prior to [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT]]) and [[Mac OS]] (prior to [[Mac OS X]]) in order to enable multiple applications to be run simultaneously. [[Windows 9x]] also used cooperative multitasking, but only for 16-bit legacy applications, much the same way as pre-[[Mac OS X v10.5|Leopard]] [[PowerPC]] versions of Mac OS X used it for [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] applications. The network operating system [[NetWare]] used cooperative multitasking up to NetWare 6.5. Cooperative multitasking is still used today on [[RISC OS]] systems.

Because a cooperatively multitasked system relies on each process regularly giving up time to other processes on the system, one poorly designed program can consume all of the CPU time for itself or cause the whole system to [[hang (computing)|hang]]. In a server environment, this is a hazard that makes the network brittle and fragile. All software must be evaluated and cleared for use in a test environment before being installed on the main server, or the entire network either slows down or comes to a halt when a program on the server misbehaves.

Despite the difficulty of designing and implementing cooperatively multitasked systems, time-constrained, real-time embedded systems (such as spacecraft) are often implemented using this paradigm. This allows highly reliable, deterministic control of complex real time sequences, for instance, the firing thrusters for deep space course corrections.

== Preemptive multitasking/time-sharing ==
{{Main|Preemption (computing)}}

Preemptive multitasking allows the computer system to more reliably guarantee each process a regular &quot;slice&quot; of operating time. It also allows the system to rapidly deal with important external events like incoming data, which might require the immediate attention of one or another process.

Operating systems were developed to take advantage of these hardware capabilities and run multiple processes preemptively. For example, preemptive multitasking was implemented in the earliest version of [[Unix]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/team/intro/unix/what.html The Digital Research Initiative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969, and is standard in Unix and [[Unix-like]] operating systems, including [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] with its [[Comparison of BSD operating systems|derivatives]].

At any specific time, processes can be grouped into two categories: those that are waiting for input or output (called &quot;[[I/O bound]]&quot;), and those that are fully utilizing the CPU (&quot;[[CPU bound]]&quot;). In primitive systems, the software would often &quot;[[Polling (computer science)|poll]]&quot;, or &quot;[[Busy waiting|busywait]]&quot; while waiting for requested input (such as disk, keyboard or network input). During this time, the system was not performing useful work. With the advent of interrupts and preemptive multitasking, I/O bound processes could be &quot;blocked&quot;, or put on hold, pending the arrival of the necessary data, allowing other processes to utilize the CPU. As the arrival of the requested data would generate an interrupt, blocked processes could be guaranteed a timely return to execution.

The earliest preemptive multitasking OS available to home users was [[Sinclair QDOS]] on the [[Sinclair QL]], released in 1984, but very few people bought the machine. Commodore's powerful [[Amiga]], released the following year, was the first commercially-successful home computer to use the technology, and its multimedia abilities make it a clear ancestor of contemporary multitasking personal computers. [[Microsoft]] made preemptive multitasking a core feature of their flagship operating system in the early 1990s when developing [[Windows NT 3.1]] and then [[Windows 95]]. It was later adopted on the Apple Macintosh by [[Mac OS]] 9.x &lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2006.html Technical Note TN2006: MP-Safe Routines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as an additional API, i.e. the application could be programmed to use the preemptive or cooperative model, and all legacy applications were multitasked cooperatively within a single process. [[Mac OS X]], being a [[Unix-like]] system, uses preemptive multitasking for all native applications, although [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] applications are multitasked cooperatively in a Mac OS 9 environment that itself is running as an OS X process (and is subject to preemption like any other OS X process).

A similar model is used in [[Windows 9x]] and the [[Windows NT|Windows NT family]], where native 32-bit applications are multitasked preemptively, and legacy 16-bit [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.x]] programs are multitasked cooperatively within a single process, although in the NT family it is possible to force a 16-bit application to run as a separate preemptively multitasked process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F2005%2Fs1606%2F08s06%2F08s06.asp Smart Computing Article - Windows 2000 &amp;16-Bit Applications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 64-bit editions of Windows, both for the [[x86-64]] and [[Itanium]] architectures, no longer provide support for legacy 16-bit applications, and thus provide preemptive multitasking for all supported applications.

== Real time ==
Another reason for multitasking was in the design of [[real-time computing]] systems, where there are a number of possibly unrelated external activities needed to be controlled by a single processor system. In such systems a hierarchical interrupt system was coupled with process prioritization to ensure that key activities were given a greater share of available process time.

== Multithreading ==
As multitasking greatly improved the throughput of computers, programmers started to implement
applications as sets of cooperating processes (e.g. one process gathering input data, one process
processing input data, one process writing out results on disk). This, however, required some tools to allow processes to efficiently exchange data.

[[Thread (computer science)|Threads]] were born from the idea that the most efficient way for cooperating processes to exchange
data would be to share their entire memory space. Thus, threads are basically processes that run
in the same memory context. Threads are described as ''lightweight'' because switching between threads does not involve changing the memory context.

While threads are scheduled preemptively, some operating systems provide a variant to threads, named ''[[Fiber (computer science)|fiber]]s'', that are scheduled cooperatively. On operating systems that do not provide fibers, an application may implement its own fibers using repeated calls to worker functions. Fibers are even more lightweight than threads, and somewhat easier to program with, although they tend to lose some or all of the benefits of threads on [[multiprocessing|machines with multiple processors]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Some systems directly support [[Multithreading (computer hardware)|multithreading in hardware]].

== Memory protection ==
{{Main|Memory protection}}

When multiple programs are present in memory, an ill-behaved program may (inadvertently or deliberately) overwrite memory belonging to another program, or even to the operating system itself.

The operating system therefore restricts the memory accessible to the running program. A program trying to access memory outside its allowed range is immediately stopped before it can change memory belonging to another process.

Another key innovation was the idea of privilege levels. Low privilege tasks are not allowed some kinds of memory access and are not allowed to perform certain instructions. When a task tries to perform a privileged operation a [[Trap (computing)|trap]] occurs and a supervisory program running at a higher level is allowed to decide how to respond.

== Memory swapping ==
Use of a [[Virtual memory|swap file]] or swap partition is a way for the operating system to provide more memory than is physically available by keeping portions of the primary memory in [[secondary storage]]. While multitasking and memory swapping are two completely unrelated techniques, they are very often used together, as swapping memory allows more tasks to be loaded at the same time.  Typically, a multitasking system allows another process to run when the running process hits a point where it has to wait for some portion of memory to be reloaded from [[secondary storage]].

== Programming in a multitasking environment ==
Processes that are entirely independent are not much trouble to program. Most of the complexity in multitasking systems comes from the need to share computer resources between tasks and to synchronize the operation of co-operating tasks.
Various [[concurrent computing]] techniques are used to avoid potential problems caused by multiple tasks attempting to access the same resource.

Bigger systems were sometimes built with a central processor(s) and some number of [[Channel I/O|I/O processors]], a kind of asymmetric [[multi-processing]].

Over the years, multitasking systems have been refined. Modern operating systems generally include detailed mechanisms for prioritizing processes, while [[symmetric multiprocessing]] has introduced new complexities and capabilities.

'''Chiang Kai-shek''' (October 31, 1887 – April 5, 1975) was a political and military leader of 20th century China. He is known as  '''Jiǎng Jièshí''' or '''Jiǎng Zhōngzhèng''' in Mandarin.

Chiang was an influential member of the Nationalist Party, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), and was a close ally of [[Sun Yat-sen]]. He became the [[Commandant]] of the Kuomintang's [[Whampoa Military Academy]], and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT when Sun died in 1925. In 1926, Chiang led the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] to unify the country, becoming China's nominal leader.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zarrow|first=Peter Gue|year=2005|title=China in War and Revolution, 1895-1949|pages=230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Chairman of the [[National Military Council]] of the Nationalist government of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) from 1928 to 1948. Chiang led China in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], during which the Nationalist government's power severely weakened, but his prominence grew. Chiang Kai-shek was socially conservative, promoting traditional Chinese culture in the [[New Life Movement]], and economically, he used heavy [[Chinese socialism|government control and intervention]], at times against private enterprises. 

Chiang's Nationalists engaged in a long standing [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] with the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP). After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Chiang once again became embroiled in a bloody civil war with the [[Communist Party of China]]. Ultimately, with support from the [[Soviet Union]], the CCP defeated the Nationalists, forcing the Nationalist government to [[KMT retreat to Taiwan|retreat]] to [[Taiwan]], where [[martial law]] was imposed, and from where the government continued to declare its intention to take back mainland China. Chiang ruled the island securely as the [[President of the Republic of China]] and Director-General of the Kuomintang until his [[Will of Chiang Kai-shek|death in 1975]].

General [[Joseph Stilwell]], an American military adviser to Chiang during World War II, strongly criticized Chiang and his generals for what he saw as their incompetence and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p.369&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings towards Chiang are mixed in Taiwan. While some still view him as a hero, others consider him with disdain. During the 2000-2008 presidency of [[Chen Shui-bian]], hundreds of [[Chiang Kai-shek statues|Chiang's statues]] were dismantled across the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2836725.stm|title=Taiwan divided over Chiang's memory|last=Leavey|first=Helen |date=2003-03-11|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Chiang was born in [[Xikou]], a town approximately 30 kilometers southwest of downtown [[Ningbo]], in [[Fenghua]], Ningbo, [[Zhejiang]]. However, his [[ancestral home]], a concept important in Chinese society, was the town of Heqiao (和橋鎮) in [[Yixing]], [[Wuxi]], [[Jiangsu]] (approximately {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} southwest of downtown Wuxi, and {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the shores of [[Lake Tai]]).  Chiang's father, Jiang Zhaocong (蔣肇聰), and mother, Wang Caiyu (王采玉), were members of an upper-middle to upper class family of salt merchants. Chiang's father died when he was only eight years of age, and he wrote of his mother as the &quot;embodiment of Confucian virtues.&quot; [[File:Chiang Kaishek in Baoding Military Academy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chiang Kai-shek in 1907 at the Baoding Military Academy]]

===In Japan===
Chiang grew up in a time period in which military defeats and civil wars among warlords had left China destabilized and in debt, and he decided to pursue a military career. He began his military education at the [[Baoding Military Academy]], in 1906. He then left for the ''Tokyo Shinbu Gakko'' (東京振武學校), an [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] Preparatory School for Chinese students, in 1907. There he was influenced by his compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the [[Qing Dynasty]] and to set up a Chinese republic. He befriended fellow Zhejiang native [[Chen Qimei]], and, in 1908, Chen brought Chiang into the [[Tongmenghui]], a precursor of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) organization. Chiang served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] from 1909 to 1911.

===Return to China===
Returning to China in 1911 after learning of the outbreak of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], Chiang intended to fight as an artillery officer. He served in the revolutionary forces, leading a regiment in Shanghai under his friend and mentor, Chen Qimei, as one of Chen's chief lieutenants. According to various sources, Chiang's first personal act of violence occurred around this time, when he either instigated or performed the assassination of a dissident member of the Revolutionary Alliance who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen Qimei.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. (1999) ''The Search for Modern China'', W.W. Norton and Company. pp. 272-273. ISBN 0-393-97351-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Xinhai Revolution]] ultimately succeeded with the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, and Chiang became a founding member of the KMT.

After the takeover of the Republican government by [[Yuan Shikai]] and the failed [[Second Revolution]] in 1913, Chiang, like his KMT comrades, divided time between exile in Japan and the havens of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In Shanghai, Chiang cultivated ties with the city's underworld gangs, dominated by the notorious [[Green Gang]] and its leader [[Du Yuesheng]]. On February 15, 1912, several KMT members, including Chiang, murdered [[Tao Chengzhang]], the leader of the [[Restoration Society]], in a [[Shanghai French Concession]] hospital.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

On May 18, 1916 agents of Yuan Shikai assassinated Chen Qimei. Chiang then succeeded Chen as leader of the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] in Shanghai. Sun Yat-sen's career was at its lowest point then, with most of his old Revolutionary Alliance comrades refusing to join him in the exiled Chinese Revolutionary Party.

===Establishment of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou===

In 1917, Sun Yat-sen moved his base of operations to [[Guangzhou]], and Chiang joined him in 1918. At this time Sun remained largely sidelined; and, without arms or money, was soon expelled from Guangzhou and exiled again to Shanghai. He was restored to Guangzhou with mercenary help in 1920. After returning to Guangzhou, a rift developed between Sun, who sought to militarily unify China under the KMT, and Guangdong Governor [[Chen Jiongming]], who wanted to implement a [[federalist]] system with Guangdong as a model province. On June 16, 1923 Chen attempted to assassinate Sun and had his residence shelled. During a prolonged skirmish between the troops of these opposing forces, Sun and his wife [[Soong Ching-ling]] narrowly evaded heavy machine gun fire and were rescued by gunboats under Chiang's direction. The incident earned Chiang the trust of Sun Yat-sen.

Sun regained control of Guangzhou in early 1924, again with the help of mercenaries from [[Yunnan]], and accepted aid from the [[Comintern]]. Undertaking a reform of the KMT, he established a revolutionary government aimed at unifying China under the KMT. That same year, Sun sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] political and military system. During his trip in Russia, Chiang met [[Leon Trotsky]] and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Russian model of government was not suitable for China.  Chiang later sent his eldest son, Ching-kuo, to study in Russia. After his father's split from the [[First United Front]] in 1927, Ching-kuo was forced to stay there, as a hostage, until 1937. Chiang wrote in his diary, &quot;It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=It+is+not+worth+it+to+sacrifice+the+interest+of+the+country+for+the+sake+of+my+son&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vwe9TIvGF8L78Aa81ZzGDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=It%20is%20not%20worth%20it%20to%20sacrifice%20the%20interest%20of%20the%20country%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20my%20son&amp;f=false|title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=59|isbn=0674002873|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=It+is+not+worth+it+to+sacrifice+the+interests+of+the+country+for+the+sake+of+my+son&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MgW9TNvcKsP78Abztqi1Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=It%20is%20not%20worth%20it%20to%20sacrifice%20the%20interests%20of%20the%20country%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20my%20son&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=205|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang even refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for the Chinese Communist Party leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=It+is+not+worth+it+to+sacrifice+the+interest+of+the+country+for+the+sake+of+my+son&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vAi9TLi0M8H68Ab-hJjsDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=It%20is%20not%20worth%20it%20to%20sacrifice%20the%20interest%20of%20the%20country%20for%20the%20sake%20of%20my%20son&amp;f=false|title=The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the birth of modern China|author=Hannah Pakula|year=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=|page=247|isbn=1439148937|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attitude remained consistent, and he continued to maintain, by 1937, that &quot;I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation's interests.&quot; Chiang had absolutely no intention of stopping the war against the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=chiang+sacrifice+son&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nQW9TLK5MoT68Aaw9uAC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chiang%20son%20i%20would%20rather%20have%20no%20offspring%20than%20sacrifice%20our%20%20interests&amp;f=false|title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=74|isbn=0674002873|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Kai-shek returned to Guangzhou, and in 1924 was appointed [[Commandant]] of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] by Sun. Chiang resigned from the office for one month in disagreement with Sun's extremely close cooperation with the Comintern, but returned at Sun's demand. The early years at Whampoa allowed Chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal to both the KMT and himself.

Throughout his rise to power, Chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist [[Tiandihui]] fraternity, to which Sun Yat-sen also belonged, and which remained a source of support during his leadership of China and, later, Taiwan.

==Succession of Sun Yat-sen==
[[File:E81599c6ee2dd8f3d000607f.jpg|thumb|left|General Chiang Kai-shek in 1926, during the [[Northern Expedition]].]]

===Competition with Wang Jingwei===
[[Sun Yat-sen]] died on March 12, 1925,&lt;ref name=sundeath&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eileen|first=Tamura|year=1998|title=China: Understanding Its Past|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a power vacuum in the [[Kuomintang]]. A contest ensued between Chiang, who stood at the right wing of the KMT, and Sun Yat-sen's close comrade-in-arms [[Wang Jingwei]], who leaned towards the left. Although Wang succeeded Sun as Chairman of the National Government, Chiang's relatively low position in the party's internal hierarchy was bolstered by his military backing and adept political maneuvering following the [[Zhongshan Warship Incident]]. On June 5, 1926, Chiang became [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA),&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p57&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on July 27 he launched a military campaign known as the [[Northern Expedition]] in order to defeat the warlords controlling northern China and to unify the country under the KMT.

The NRA branched into three divisions: to the west was Wang Jingwei, who led a column to take [[Wuhan]]; [[Bai Chongxi]]'s column went east to take Shanghai; Chiang himself led in the middle route, planning to take [[Nanjing]] before pressing ahead to capture Beijing. However, in January 1927, Wang Jingwei and his KMT leftist allies took the city of Wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare. Allied with a number of [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] and advised by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanking in March (and briefly visited Shanghai, now under the control of his close ally Bai Chongxi), Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang's leftist elements, which he believed threatened his control of the KMT.

Now with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Wang Jingwei's National Government was weak militarily, and was soon ended by Chiang with the support of a local warlord, ([[Li Zongren]] of [[Guangxi]]). Eventually, Wang and his leftist party surrendered to Chiang and joined him in Nanjing. In the [[Central Plains War]], Beijing was taken in June, 1928, from an alliance of the warlords [[Feng Yuxiang]] and [[Yan Xishan]]. In December, the [[Manchuria]]n warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]] pledged allegiance to Chiang's government, completing Chiang's nominal unification of China and ending the [[Warlord Era]].

Chiang made great efforts to gain recognition as the official successor of Sun Yat-sen. In a pairing of great political significance, Chiang was Sun's brother-in-law: he had married [[Soong May-ling]], the younger sister of [[Soong Ching-ling]], Sun's widow, on December 1, 1927. Originally rebuffed by her in the early-1920s, Chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with Soong May-ling's mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines, and promising to eventually convert to Christianity. On Jan. 07, 1929, the Nationalist Information Bureau stated that Chiaing was not a Christian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: Christian Majority|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=Monday, Jan. 07, 1929|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,929380,00.html|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, he was baptized in the [[Methodist]] church in 1929, a year after his marriage to Soong. Upon reaching Beijing, Chiang paid homage to Sun Yat-sen and had his body moved to the new capital of Nanjing to be enshrined in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]].

===Relationship with the Comintern===
In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang was known as the &quot;Red General&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hannah Pakula 2009 346&quot;/&gt; Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang. At Moscow, Sun Yat-sen University Portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls; and, in the Soviet May Day Parades that year, Chiang's portrait was carried along with the portraits of Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and other socialist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=chiang+portraits+streets&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UGCaTKLlBsGB8gbyyeBX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=snippet&amp;q=chiang%20portraits%20marx&amp;f=false|title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=42|isbn=0674002873|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States consulate and other Westerners in Shanghai were concerned about the approach of &quot;Red General&quot; Chiang, as his army was seizing control of large areas of the country in the Northern Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=03catqbPCmgC&amp;pg=PA602&amp;dq=red+general+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KniaTP6oC8G88gbJ7sGXAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=red%20general%20chiang&amp;f=false|title=The generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the struggle for modern China, Volume 39|author=Jay Taylor|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=602|isbn=0674033388|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wjCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=red+general+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KniaTP6oC8G88gbJ7sGXAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=red%20general%20chiang&amp;f=false|title=Moscow and Chinese Communists|author=Robert Carver North|year=1963|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=|page=94|isbn=0804704538|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western powers backed the [[Zhili Clique]], and were concerned about either the Soviet-backed Kuomintang or the Japanese-backed Fengtian Clique seizing control of China. The Japanese were also concerned that Chiang might defeat the Fengtian Clique.

On April 12, Chiang carried out [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|a purge]] of thousands of suspected Communists and dissidents in Shanghai, and began large-scale massacres across the country collectively known as the [[White Terror (Republic of China)|&quot;White Terror]]. Throughout April 1927, more than {{formatnum:12000}} people were killed in Shanghai. The killings drove most Communists from urban cities and into the rural countryside, where the KMT was less powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Mayhew |first= Bradley |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=IAe97m8sgw0C&amp;pg=PA51 |title= Shanghai |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |edition=2nd |year= 2004 |month= March |isbn= 978-1740593083 |accessdate=2009-07-22 |page= 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tutelage of China==

===Carrying Out Sun's Yat-sen's Will===
Having gained control of China, Chiang's party remained surrounded by &quot;surrendered&quot; warlords who remained relatively autonomous within their own regions. On October 10, 1928, Chiang was named director of the State Council, the equivalent to President of the country, in addition to his other titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with his predecessor Sun Yat-sen, the Western media dubbed him &quot;[[Generalissimo]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2009p57&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s plans, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) was to rebuild China in three steps: [[Martial law|military rule]], political tutelage, and constitutional rule. The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was [[democracy]], which was not considered to be feasible in China's fragmented state. Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang's rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be &quot;political tutelage&quot; in Sun Yat-sen's name. During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed.

The decade of 1928 to 1937 saw some aspects of foreign [[imperialism]], concessions and privileges in China, moderated through [[diplomacy]]. The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems, attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in [[narcotic]]s, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Not all of these projects were successfully completed. Efforts were made towards improving education standards; and, in an effort to unify Chinese society, the [[New Life Movement]] was launched to encourage [[Confucianism|Confucian]] moral values and personal discipline. [[Mandarin Chinese]], then known as ''Guoyu'', was promoted as an [[Official language|standard tongue]], and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) were used to encourage a sense of [[Chinese nationalism]] in a way that was not possible when the nation lacked an effective central government.

===Challenges and Limitations===
Any successes that the Nationalists did make, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals. While much of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated warlords and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and materiel. The 1930 [[Central Plains War]] alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost {{formatnum:250000}} casualties on both sides. In 1931 [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's old supporter, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under [[house arrest]], but he was released after national condemnation, after which he left Nanjing and supported a rival government in [[Guangzhou]]. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Guangzhou government and Chiang's Nationalist government. Chiang only won the campaign against Hu after a shift in allegiance by the warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]], who had previously supported Hu Hanmin.

Throughout his rule, complete eradication of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] remained Chiang's dream. After assembling his forces in [[Jiangxi]], Chiang led his armies against the newly established [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]. With help from foreign military advisers, Chiang's [[Fifth Campaign]] finally surrounded the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] in 1934. The Communists, tipped-off that a Nationalist offensive was imminent, retreated in the [[Long March]], during which [[Mao Zedong]] rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the Communist Party of China.

===Ideology: Nationalism and Anti-Capitalism===
Chiang, as a nationalist and a Confucianist, was against the iconoclasm of the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Motivated by his sense of [[nationalism]], he viewed some Western ideas as foreign, and he believed that the great introduction of Western ideas and literature that the [[May Fourth Movement]] promoted was not beneficial to China. He and Dr. Sun criticized the May Fourth intellectuals as corrupting the morals of China's youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dc4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=chiang+may+iconoclastic+nationalist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=P2yaTIiKJsKB8ga-oPVK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The May fourth movement in Shanghai: the making of a social movement in modern China|author=Joseph T.

Contrary to false Communist propaganda that Chiang was pro capitalist, Chiang Kai-shek antagonized the capitalists of Shanghai, often attacking them and confisticating their capital and assets for the use of the government. Chiang confiscated the wealth of capitalists even while he denounced and fought against communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gTv99LBYSL4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=chiang+shanghai+communists+capitalist+wealth+dictators&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lz7QTYXpAci-0AHNsJzgDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=communists%20charged%20shanghai%20ningbo%20capitalists%20interests%20seized%20their%20wealth&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of modern dictators: from Napoleon to the present|author=Frank J.

Chiang continued Dr. Sun Yat-sen's anti capitalist ideology, directing Kuomintang media to openly attack capitalists and capitalism, demanding [[Government-owned corporation|government controlled industry]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9nJF_19fnZ4C&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=chiang+shanghai+communists+capitalist+wealth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KD7QTdbGDfCD0QHeprWSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kuomintang%20denounced%20capitalism&amp;f=false|title=The Shanghai capitalists and the Nationalist government, 1927-1937|author=Parks M.

Chiang blocked Chinese capitalists from gaining any political power or voice within his regime. Once Chiang Kai-shek was done with his [[White Terror (mainland China)|&quot;reign of terror&quot;]] on pro-communist laborers, he proceeded to turn on the capitalists. [[Green Gang|Gangster connections]] allowed Chiang to attack them in the International Settlement, successfully forcing capitalists to back him up with their assets for his military expeditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;capitalists&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9nJF_19fnZ4C&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=chiang+shanghai+communists+capitalist+wealth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KD7QTdbGDfCD0QHeprWSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Shanghai capitalists and the Nationalist government, 1927-1937|author=Parks M.

Chiang has often been interpreted as being pro-capitalist, but this conclusion is the result of various misinterpretations.  Marxist writers have believed that governments must represent one or more social classes, and (falsely) concluded that, because Chiang oppressed some social classes more than urban capitalists (particularly the industrial proletariat), the urban capitalists were a logical social base for the Nanjing government. Shanghai capitalists did briefly support him out of fear of communism in 1927, but this support eroded in 1928, when Chiang turned his tactics of intimidation on them. The relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and Chinese capitalists remained poor throughout the period of his administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;capitalists&quot; /&gt;

===Chinese Civil War===
After the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, Chiang resigned as Chairman of the National Government. He returned shortly afterwards, adopting the slogan &quot;first internal pacification, then external resistance&quot;. However, this policy of avoiding a frontal war against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] was widely unpopular. In 1932, while Chiang was seeking first to defeat the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], Japan launched an [[January 28 Incident|advance]] on Shanghai and bombarded [[Nanjing]]. This disrupted Chiang's [[Chinese Civil War|offensives against the Communists]] for a time, although it was the northern factions of [[Hu Hanmin]]'s [[Guangzhou]] (Canton) government (notably the [[19th Route Army]]) that primarily led the offensive against the Japanese during this skirmish. Brought into the Nationalist army immediately after the battle, the 19th Route Army's career under Chiang would be cut short after it was disbanded for demonstrating socialist tendencies.

In December 1936, Chiang flew to [[Xi'an]] to coordinate a major assault on the [[People's Liberation Army|Red Army]] and the  Communist Republic that had retreated into [[Yan'an]]. However, Chiang's allied commander [[Zhang Xueliang]], whose forces were used in his attack and whose homeland of [[Manchuria]] had been recently invaded by the Japanese, did not support the attack on the Communists. On December 12, Zhang and several other Nationalist generals kidnapped Chiang for two weeks in what is known as the [[Xi'an Incident]]. They forced Chiang into making a &quot;[[Second United Front]]&quot; with the Communists against Japan. After releasing Chiang and returning to Nanjing with him, Zhang was placed under house arrest and the generals who had assisted him were executed. Chiang's commitment to the Second United Front was nominal at best, and it was all but broken up in 1941.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in July 1937, and in August of that year Chiang sent {{formatnum:600000}} of his best-trained and equipped soldiers to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]]. With over 200,000 Chinese casualties, Chiang lost the political cream of his [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa]]-trained officers. Though Chiang lost militarily, the battle dispelled Japanese claims that it could conquer China in three months and demonstrated to the Western powers that the Chinese would continue the fight. By December, the capital city of Nanjing had [[Rape of Nanking|fallen to the Japanese]], and Chiang moved the government inland, first to [[Wuhan]] and later to [[Chongqing]]. Having lost most of China's economic and industrial centers, Chiang withdrew into the hinterlands, stretching the Japanese supply lines and bogging down Japanese soldiers in the vast Chinese interior. However, these [[Scorched earth#Second Sino-Japanese War|scorched earth]] policies also resulted in many deaths.{{Quantify|date=June 2010}}  During the nationalist's retreat from Nanjing, the dams around the city were deliberately destroyed by the Nationalist army in order to delay the Japanese advance, killing 500,000 people in the subsequent [[1938 Yellow River flood]].

In 1939 Muslim leaders [[Isa Yusuf Alptekin]] and Ma Fuliang were sent by Chiang to several Middle eastern countries, including [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], and [[Syria]], to gain support for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese War against Japan]], and to express his support for Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC&amp;dq=xibei+jiuying+wangshi&amp;q=chiang+bughra#v=snippet&amp;q=chiang%20bughra%20return%20chongqing&amp;f=false|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=|isbn=0415582644|page=90|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese, controlling the puppet-state of [[Manchukuo]] and much of China's eastern seaboard, appointed [[Wang Jingwei]] as a [[Quisling]]-ruler of the occupied Chinese territories around Nanjing. Wang named himself President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the National Government (not the same 'National Government' as Chiang's), and led a surprisingly large{{Quantify|date=May 2010}} minority of anti-Chiang/anti-Communist Chinese against his old comrades. He died in 1944, within a year of the end of World War II.

In 1942 Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek  personally went on tour in Northwestern China in [[Xinjiang]], [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], [[Shaanxi]], and [[Qinghai]], where he met both Muslim Generals [[Ma Buqing]] and [[Ma Bufang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: He Who Has Reason|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=Monday, Oct. 05, 1942|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773741,00.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met the Muslim Generals [[Ma Hongbin]] and [[Ma Hongkui]] separately.

A border crisis erupted with Tibet in 1942. Under orders from Chiang Kai-shek, [[Ma Bufang]] repaired Yushu airport to prevent Tibetan separatists from seeking independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rozF-AZgmM8C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=ma+bufang+japanese&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBghTJLZOIKClAfC_Nxi&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20japanese&amp;f=false|title=Indo-Tibet-China conflict|author=Dinesh Lal|year=2008|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|location=|page=61|isbn=8178357143|pages=309|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang also ordered Ma Bufang to put his Muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of Tibet in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=449716|title=War or Stratagem?

Chiang did not like the Americans, and was suspicious of their motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=generalissimo+and+he+lost&amp;q=chiang+american+motives#v=snippet&amp;q=chiang%20did%20not%20like%20ally%20american%20motives&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=413|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he suspected that the American OSS (forerunner of the CIA) was showing an interest in seizing control of Chiang's regime, Chiang ordered the plotters arrested and executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C&amp;dq=chiang+portraits+streets&amp;q=chiang+alientae+stalin#v=onepage&amp;q=dai%20li%20oss&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=412|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang felt no friendliness towards the United States, and viewed it as pursuing imperialist motives in China. Chiang did not want to be  suboordinate to either the United States or the Soviet Union, but jockeyed for room between the two and wanted to get the most out of the Soviet Union and the Americans without taking sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Fenby 2005 464&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C&amp;dq=chiang+portraits+streets&amp;q=chiang+alientae+stalin#v=snippet&amp;q=he%20felt%20no%20debt%20washington&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=464|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted that war would come between the two, and that they would both seek China's alliance, which he would use to China's advantage. Abusive incidents occurred following a drunk American General making comments about Chiang's regime, and a low point in Sino-American relations followed the rape of a Chinese university student by American marines shortly after World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Fenby 2005 464&quot;/&gt; American officials, notably Stilwell, found Chiang to be incompetent and corrupt.

Chiang also differed from the Americans in ideological issues. He organized the Kuomintang as a [[Leninist]] style party, oppressed dissention, and banned democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=chiang+portraits+streets&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UGCaTKLlBsGB8gbyyeBX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=leninist%20chiang%20democracy&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=504|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of World War II, Chiang had come to believe that democracy was impossible for China to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+democracy&amp;q=emocracy+absolutely+impossible#v=onepage&amp;q=emocracy%20absolutely%20impossible&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=226|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang's communications with the Soviets and Americans during the war were not consistent. He first told the Americans that they would be welcome in talks between the Soviet Union and China, then secretly told the Soviets that the Americans were unimportant and that their opinions would not be considered. Chiang also used American support and military power in China against the ambitions of the Soviet Union to dominate the talks, stopping the Soviets from taking full advantage of the situation in China with the threat of American military action against the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x8b4an0T0twC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=renounce+tsarist+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3dqaTKqxDIO78gay3fVj&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=renounce%20tsarist%20chiang&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=256|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusal of French Indochina===
[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], through General Stilwell, privately made it clear that they preferred that the French not reacquire [[French Indochina]] (modern day Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) after the war was over. Roosevelt offered Chiang Kai-shek control of all of Indochina. It was said that Chiang Kai-shek replied: &quot;Under no circumstances!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v5YlBtzklvQC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+vietnam+Under+no+circumstances&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hI4OTZGwIcL98Aasn5iVDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chiang%20kai-shek%20vietnam%20Under%20no%20circumstances&amp;f=false|title=The march of folly: from Troy to Vietnam|author=Barbara Wertheim Tuchman|year=1985|publisher=Random House, Inc.|location=|page=235|isbn=0345308239|pages=|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General [[Lu Han]] were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to northern Indochina (north of the 16th parallel) to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces there, and remained in Indochina until 1946, when the French returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iF3MG43x--0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+vietnam+french+concessions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_Y0OTYTpIsL38Aa2_MiwDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=chiang%20kai-shek%20vietnam%20french%20concessions&amp;f=false|title=America's war in Vietnam: a short narrative history|author=Larry H.

In February, 1946 he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and to renounce their extraterritorial privileges in exchange for the Chinese withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region. Following France's agreement to these demands, the withdrawal of Chinese troops began in March 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pVNaoUu7veUC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+vietnam+french+concessions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_Y0OTYTpIsL38Aa2_MiwDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=chiang%20kai-shek%20vietnam%20french%20concessions&amp;f=false|title=The tragedy of the Vietnam War: a South Vietnamese officer's analysis|author=Van Nguyen Duong|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|location=|page=21|isbn=0786432853|pages=|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1I4HOcmE4XQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+vietnam+french+concessions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_Y0OTYTpIsL38Aa2_MiwDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chiang%20kai-shek%20vietnam%20french%20concessions&amp;f=false|title=Vietnam 1946: how the war began|author=Stein Tønnesson|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=|page=41|isbn=0520256026|pages=|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yQGqQ3LmExwC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=chiang+kai-shek+vietnam+french+concessions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_Y0OTYTpIsL38Aa2_MiwDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=chiang%20kai-shek%20vietnam%20french%20concessions&amp;f=false|title=The Vietnam War as history: edited by Elizabeth Jane Errington and B.J.C.

==Losing Mainland China==
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek 1947.jpg|thumb|right|May 20 Republican Year 37/1948, Chiang Kai-shek's inauguration speech as the first President of the Republic of China in the new constitution of 1948]]

===Treatment and Use of Japanese Soldiers===
In 1945, when [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japan surrendered]], Chiang's [[Chongqing]] government was ill-equipped and ill-prepared to reassert its authority in formerly Japanese-occupied China, and asked the Japanese to postpone their surrender until Kuomintang (KMT) authority could arrive to take over. This was an unpopular move among a population that, for many, had spent more than a decade under often brutal foreign occupation. American troops and weapons soon bolstered KMT forces, allowing them to reclaim cities. The countryside, however, remained largely under Communist control.

For over a year after the Japanese surrender, rumors circulated throughout China that the Japanese had entered into a secret agreement with Chiang, in which the Japanese would assist the Nationalists in fighting the Communists in exchange for the protection of Japanese persons and property there.  Many top nationalist generals, including Chiang, had studied and trained in Japan before the Nationalists had returned to the mainland in the 1920s, and maintained close personal friendships with top Japanese officers.  The Japanese general in charge of all forces in China, [[Yasuji Okamura|General Okamura]], had personally trained officers who later became generals in Chiang's staff. Reportedly, General Okamura, before surrendering command of all Japanese military forces in Nanjing, offered Chiang control of all 1.5 million Japanese military and civilian support staff then present in China.  Reportedly, Chiang seriously considered accepting this offer, but declined only in the knowledge that the United States would certainly be outraged by the gesture.  Even so, armed Japanese troops remained in China well into 1947, with some noncommissioned officers finding their way into the Nationalist officer corps.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. &quot;Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945-1949.&quot; ''The Journal of Asian Studies''.

February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  That the Japanese in China came to regard Chiang as a magnanimous figure to whom many Japanese owed their lives and livelihoods was a fact attested by both Nationalist and Communist sources.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. &quot;Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945-1949.&quot; ''The Journal of Asian Studies''.

===Conditions during the Chinese Civil War===
Following the war, the United States encouraged peace talks between Chiang and Communist leader Mao Zedong in Chongqing. Due to concerns about widespread and well-documented corruption in Chiang's government throughout his rule (though not always with his knowledge), the U.S. government limited aid to Chiang for much of the period of 1946 to 1948, in the midst of fighting against the [[People's Liberation Army]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. Alleged infiltration of the U.S. government by Chinese Communist agents may have also played a role in the suspension of American aid.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, John Earl; Harvey Klehr, ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', New Haven: Yale University Press (2000), ISBN 0-300-08462-5, pp. 142–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang's right hand man, the secret police Chief [[Dai Li]], was both anti-American and anti-Communist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C&amp;dq=chiang+portraits+streets&amp;q=chiang+alientae+stalin#v=snippet&amp;q=dai%20li%20oss%20anti%20american%20influence&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=414|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dai ordered Kuomintang agents to spy on American officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C&amp;dq=chiang+portraits+streets&amp;q=chiang+alientae+stalin#v=onepage&amp;q=dai%20li%20oss%20american%20officers%20spied&amp;f=false|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|author=Jonathan Fenby|year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|location=|page=413|isbn=0786714840|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Dai had been involved with the [[Blue Shirts Society]], a fascist-inspired paramilitary group within the Kuomintang, which wanted to expel Western and Japanese imperialists, crush the Communists, and eliminate [[feudalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jYYYQYK6FAYC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=blueshirts+red+bandits+foreign+insults&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gWmaTKa2L8G88gaF0rSxAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese secret service|author=Frederic E.

Though Chiang had achieved status abroad as a world leader, his government deteriorated as the result of corruption and inflation. In his diary on June 1948, Chiang wrote that the KMT had failed, not because of external enemies but because of rot from within.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/6731746.html Hoover Institution - Hoover Digest - Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for China]&lt;/ref&gt; The war had severely weakened the Nationalists, while the Communists were strengthened by their popular land-reform policies,&lt;ref&gt;Ray Huang, cong dalishi jiaodu du Jiang Jieshi riji (Reading Chiang Kai-shek's dairy from a macro-history perspective), Chinatimes Publishing Press, Taipei, 1994, p. 441-3&lt;/ref&gt; and by a rural population that supported and trusted them. The Nationalists initially had superiority in arms and men, but their lack of popularity, infiltration by Communist agents, low morale, and disorganization soon allowed the Communists to gain the upper hand in the civil war.

===Conflict with Li Zongren===
[[File:Lizhongren2.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren.]]
A new [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] was promulgated in 1947, and Chiang was formally elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] as the first term [[President of the Republic of China]] on May 20, 1948. This marked the beginning of what was termed the &quot;democratic constitutional government&quot; period by the KMT political orthodoxy, but the Communists refused to recognize the new Constitution, and its government, as legitimate. Chiang resigned as President on January 21, 1949, as KMT forces suffered bitter losses and defections to the Communists. After Chiang's resignation the vice-president of the ROC, [[Li Zongren]], became China's president.

Shortly after Chiang's resignation the Communists halted their advances and attempted to negotiate the virtual surrender of the ROC. Li attempted to negotiate milder terms that would have ended the civil war, but without success. When it became clear that Li was unlikely to accept Mao's terms, the Communists issued an ultimatum in April 1949, warning that they would resume their attacks if Li did not agree within five days.  Li refused.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. ISBN 0-393-97351-4. p.486&lt;/ref&gt;

Li's attempts to carry out his policies faced varying degrees of opposition from Chiang's supporters, and were generally unsuccessful. Chiang especially antagonized Li by taking possession of (and moving to Taiwan) US$200 million of gold and US dollars belonging to the central government that Li desperately needed to cover the government's soaring expenses. When the Communists captured the Nationalist capital of Nanjing in April 1949, Li refused to accompany the central government as it fled to [[Guangdong]], instead expressing his dissatisfaction with Chiang by retiring to Guangxi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin289&quot;&gt;Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911-1949''.  Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.  1967. p.289&lt;/ref&gt;

The former warlord [[Yan Xishan]], who had fled to Nanking only one month before, quickly insinuated himself within the Li-Chiang rivalry, attempting to have Li and Chiang reconcile their differences in the effort to resist the Communists. At Chiang's request Yan visited Li in order to convince Li not to withdraw from public life. Yan broke down in tears while talking of the loss of his home province of Shanxi to the Communists, and warned Li that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li went to Guangzhou. Li agreed to return under the condition that Chiang surrender most of the gold and US dollars in his possession that belonged to the central government, and that Chiang stop overriding Li's authority. After Yan communicated these demands and Chiang agreed to comply with them, Li departed for Guangdong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin289&quot; /&gt;

In Guangdong, Li attempted to create a new government composed of both Chiang supporters and those opposed to Chiang. Li's first choice of premier was [[Chu Cheng]], a veteran member of the Kuomintang who had been virtually driven into exile due to his strong opposition to Chiang.  After the Legislative Yuan rejected Chu, Li was obliged to choose Yan Xishan instead. By this time Yan was well-known for his adaptability, and Chiang welcomed his appointment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin289&quot; /&gt;

Conflict between Chiang and Li persisted. Although he had agreed to do so as a prerequisite of Li's return, Chiang refused to surrender more than a fraction of the wealth that he had sent to Taiwan. Without being backed by gold or foreign currency, the money issued by Li and Yan quickly declined in value until it became virtually worthless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin290&quot;&gt;Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911-1949''.  Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.  1967. p.290&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not hold a formal executive position in the government, Chiang continued to issue orders to the army, and many officers continued to obey Chiang rather than Li.  The inability of Li to coordinate KMT military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated in 1948. Instead of attempting to defend all of southern China, Li ordered what remained of the Nationalist armies to withdraw to Guangxi and Guangdong, hoping that he could concentrate all available defenses on this smaller, and more easily defensible, area. The object of Li's strategy was to maintain a foothold on the Chinese mainland in the hope that the United States would eventually be compelled to enter the war in China on the Nationalist side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillin290&quot; /&gt;

===Final Communist advance===
Chiang opposed Li's plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops still loyal to Chiang under the control of Li and Chiang's other opponents in the central government. To overcome Chiang's intransigence Li began ousting Chiang's supporters within the central government. Yan Xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides, creating the impression among Li's supporters that he was a &quot;stooge&quot; of Chiang, while those who supported Chiang began to bitterly resent Yan for his willingness to work with Li. Because of the rivalry between Chiang and Li, Chiang refused to allow Nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of Guangxi and Guangdong, with the result that Communist forces occupied Guangdong in October 1949. &lt;ref&gt;Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911-1949''.  Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.  1967. p.291&lt;/ref&gt;

After Guangdong fell to the Communists, Chiang relocated the government to [[Chongqing]], while Li effectively surrendered his powers and flew to [[New York]] for treatment of his chronic [[duodenum]] illness at the Hospital of [[Columbia University]]. Li visited the President of the United States, [[Harry S. Truman]], and denounced Chiang as a &quot;dictator&quot; and an &quot;usurper.&quot; Li vowed that he would &quot;return to crush&quot; Chiang once he returned to China. Li remained in exile, and did not return to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;CHINA: Return of the Gimo&quot;.  ''TIME Magazine''. Monday, Mar. 13, 1950.

In the early morning of December 10, 1949, Communist troops laid siege to [[Chengdu]], the last KMT controlled city in mainland China, where Chiang Kai-shek and his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] directed the defense at the Chengdu Central Military Academy. Chiang Kai-shek, father and son, sang the Republic of China National Anthem while leaving the Academy all the way to the airfield.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The aircraft ''May-ling'' evacuated them to Taiwan on the same day. Chiang Kai-shek would never return to the mainland.

Chiang did not formally re-assume the presidency until March 1, 1950. On January 1952, Chiang commanded the [[Control Yuan]], now in Taiwan, to impeach Li in the &quot;Case of Li Zongren's Failure to carry out Duties due to Illegal Conduct&quot; (李宗仁違法失職案). Chiang officially relieved  Li of the position as vice-president in the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] on March 1954.

==Presidency in Taiwan==
[[File:DoubleTenDayParadeOctober101966.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Chiang presiding over the 1966 [[Double Ten Day|Double Ten]] celebrations.]]

===Preparations to Retake the Mainland===
Chiang moved the government to [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], where he formally resumed duties as [[President of the Republic of China]] on March 1, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/appendix1-1.htm#1950 ROC Chronology: Jan 1911 - Dec 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang was reelected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] to be the President of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on May 20, 1954, and again in 1960, 1966, and 1972. He continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, including the territories held by his government and the [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic]], as well as territory the latter ceded to foreign governments, such as [[Tuva]] and [[Outer Mongolia]]. In the context of the [[Cold War]], most of the Western world recognized this position and the ROC represented China [[China and the United Nations|in the United Nations]] and other international organizations until the 1970s.

This is intended as an analogy to the situation between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China]]

During his presidency in Taiwan, Chiang continued to prepare to take back mainland China. He developed the ROC army to prepare for an invasion of the mainland, and to defend Taiwan in case of an attack by the Communist forces.

===Political Conditions in Early ROC-Era Taiwan===
Despite the democratic constitution, the government under Chiang was a [[one-party state]], consisting almost completely of [[Mainlander (China)|mainlander]]s; the &quot;[[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]&quot; greatly enhanced executive powers, and the goal of [[Project National Glory|retaking mainland China]] allowed the KMT to maintain a monopoly on power and the prohibition of opposition parties. The government's official line for these martial law provisions stemmed from the claim that emergency provisions were necessary, since the Communists and Kuomintang (KMT) were still technically in a state of war. Seeking to promote [[Chinese nationalism]], Chiang's government actively ignored and suppressed local cultural expression, even forbidding the use of local languages in mass media broadcasts or during class sessions.

The first decades after the Nationalists gained control of Taiwan are associated with the organized effort to resist Communism known as &quot;the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|&quot;White Terror&quot;]], around which 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned or executed for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang. Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang as &quot;bandit spies&quot; (匪諜), meaning spies for Chinese Communists, and punished as such.

The government offered limited civil and economic freedoms, property rights (personal{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and intellectual) and other liberties. Free debate within the confines of the legislature were permitted. He also jailed dissidents who were labeled by the KMT as supporters of [[Communist Party of China|communism]] or [[Taiwan independence]]. Later, Chiang's son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and Chiang Ching-kuo's successor, [[Lee Teng-hui]], would, in the 1980s and 1990s, increase native Taiwanese representation in the government and loosen the many authoritarian controls of the early era of ROC control in Taiwan.

Under the pretext that new elections could not be held in Communist-occupied constituencies, the National Assembly, [[Legislative Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]] members held their posts indefinitely. It was also under the Temporary Provisions that Chiang was able to bypass term limits to remain as president. He was reelected by the National Assembly as president four times — doing so in 1954, 1960, 1966, and 1972.

Believing that corruption and a lack of morals were key reasons that the KMT lost mainland China to the Communists, Chiang attempted to purge corruption by dismissing members of the KMT accused of graft. Some major figures in the previous mainland China government, such as [[H. H. Kung]] and [[T. V. Soong]], exiled themselves to the United States. Though politically authoritarian and, to some extent, dominated by government-owned industries, Chiang's new Taiwanese state also encouraged economic development, especially in the export sector. A popular sweeping Land Reform Act, as well as American foreign aid during the 1950s, laid the foundation for Taiwan's economic success, becoming one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

===Relationships with Foreign Governments===
====Japan====
In 1971, shortly after he had switched his country's diplomatic recognition from the [[Republic of China]] to the [[People's Republic of China]], the Australian Prime Minister, [[Gough Whitlam]], visited Japan. After meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Sato Eisaku]], Whitlam observed that the reason Japan at that time was hesitant to withdraw recognition from the Nationalist government was &quot;the presence of a treaty between the Japanese government and that of Chiang Kai-shek&quot;.  Sato explained that the continued recognition of Japan towards the Nationalist government was due largely to the personal relationship that various members of the Japanese government felt towards Chiang.  This relationship was rooted largely in the generous and lenient treatment of Japanese POWs by the Nationalist government in the years immediately following the Japanese surrender in 1945, and was felt especially strongly as a bond of personal obligation by the most senior members then in power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journal1&quot;&gt;Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. &quot;Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945-1949.&quot; ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 42, No. 3, May, 1983.  p. 516. Retrieved at: &lt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2055515&gt;.  February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Although Japan eventually recognized the People's Republic in 1972, shortly after [[Tanaka Kakuei]] succeeded [[Sato Eisaku]] as Prime Minister of Japan, the memory of this relationship was strong enough to be reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' (April 15, 1978) as a significant factor inhibiting trade between Japan and the mainland.  There is speculation that a clash between Communist forces and a Japanese warship in 1978 was caused by Chinese anger after [[Yasuo Fukuda|Premier Fukoda]] attended Chiang's funeral.  Historically, Japanese attempts to normalize their relationship with China were met with Taiwanese accusations of ingratitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Journal1&quot; /&gt;

====Americans and the CIA====
Chiang was suspicious that covert operatives of the United States plotted a coup against him. In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of the [[secret police]], which he remained until 1965. Chiang was suspicious of politicians who were overly friendly to the United States, and considered them his enemies. In 1953, seven days after surviving an assassination attempt, [[Wu Kuo-chen]] lost his position as governor of Taiwan Province to [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]. After fleeing to America the same year he became a vocal critic of Chiang's family and government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter R. Moody 1977 302&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AW9yrtekFRkC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=sun+li+jen+americans+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I679TJ2CMcKqlAfOu6WACQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=sun%20li%20jen%20americans%20chiang&amp;f=false|title=Opposition and dissent in contemporary China|author=Peter R.

Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated Soviet-style military organization in the Republic of China Military. He reorganized and Sovietized the political officer corps, and propagated Kuomintang ideology throughout the military. [[Sun Li-jen]], who was educated at the American [[Virginia Military Institute]], was opposed to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=sun+li+jen+americans+chiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I679TJ2CMcKqlAfOu6WACQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sun%20li%20jen%20americans%20chiang&amp;f=false|title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=195|isbn=0674002873|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chiang Ching-kuo orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General [[Sun Li-jen]] in August, 1955, for plotting a coup d'état with the American [[CIA]] against his father Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. The CIA allegedly wanted to help Sun take control of Taiwan and declare its independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter R.

==Death==
[[File:Cihu Chiang Kai-shek tomb (left).JPG|thumb|Chiang's body was not buried in the traditional Chinese manner but entombed in his former residence in [[Cihu Mausoleum|Cihu]] in respect for his wish to be buried in his native [[Fenghua]].]]
{{See also|s:Will of Chiang Kai-shek|l1=Will of Chiang Kai-shek}}

In 1975, 26 years after Chiang came to [[Taiwan]], he died in [[Taipei]] at the age of 87. He had suffered a major heart attack and [[pneumonia]] in the months before and died from [[renal failure]] aggravated with advanced cardiac malfunction at 23:50 on April 5.

A month of mourning was declared. Chinese music composer [[Hwang Yau-tai]] wrote the [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song]]. In [[mainland China]], however, Chiang's death was met with little apparent mourning and [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] state-run newspapers gave the brief headline &quot;Chiang Kai-shek Has Died.&quot; Chiang's body was put in a copper coffin and temporarily interred at his favorite residence in [[Cihu Mausoleum|Cihu]], [[Dasi, Taoyuan]]. When his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] died in 1988, he was entombed in a separate mausoleum in nearby [[Touliao Mausoleum|Touliao]] (頭寮). The hope was to have both buried at their birthplace in Fenghua if and when it was possible. In 2004, [[Chiang Fang-liang]], the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo, asked that both father and son be buried at [[Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery]] in [[Xizhi]], [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City). Chiang's ultimate funeral ceremony became a political battle between the wishes of the state and the wishes of his family.

Chiang was succeeded as [[President of the Republic of China|President]] by [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] [[Yen Chia-kan]] and as [[Kuomintang]] party leader by his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], who retired Chiang Kai-shek's title of Director-General and instead assumed the position of Chairman. Yen's presidency was interim; Chiang Ching-kuo, who was the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], became President after Yen's term ended three years later.

The Kuomintang used traditional Chinese religious ceremonies, and promoted [[Martyrdom in Chinese culture]].

==Contemporary Public Perception==
Chiang's legacy has been target of heated debates because of the different views held about him. For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious [[Northern Expedition]] against the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang Warlords]] in 1927, achieving [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese unification]], and who subsequently led China to ultimate victory against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1945. Some blamed him for not doing enough against the Japanese forces in the lead-up to, and during, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], preferring to withhold  his armies for the fight against the Communists, or merely waiting and hoping that the United States would get involved. Some also see him as a champion of [[anti-Communism]], being a key figure during the formative years of the [[World Anti-Communist League]]. During the [[Cold War]], he was also seen as the leader who led [[Free area of the Republic of China|Free China]] and the bulwark against a possible Communist invasion. However, Chiang presided over purges, political authoritarianism, and graft during his tenure in [[mainland China]], and ruled throughout a period of imposed [[martial law]]. His governments were accused of being corrupt even before he even took power in 1928. He also allied with known criminals like [[Du Yuesheng]] for political and financial gains. Some opponents charge that Chiang's efforts in developing Taiwan were mostly to make the island a strong base from which to one day return to mainland China, and that Chiang had little regard for the long-term prosperity and well-being of the [[Taiwanese people]].

Today, Chiang's popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying greater support among [[Kuomintang]] supporters. He is generally unpopular among [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) voters and supporters. In sharp contrast to his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and to [[Sun Yat-sen]], his memory is rarely invoked by current political parties, including the Kuomintang.

In the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the Communists. His constant demands for Western support and funding also earned him the nickname of &quot;General Cash-My-Check&quot;. In the West he has been criticized for his poor military skills. He had a record of issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fenby|first=Jonathan|title=History of Modern China|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been an attempt to find a more moderate interpretation of Chiang. Chiang is now increasingly perceived as a man simply overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight simultaneously Communists, Japanese and provincial warlords while having to reconstruct and unify the country. His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful nation have been noted by scholars such as [[Jonathan Fenby]] and [[Rana Mitter]]. Mitter has observed that, ironically, today's China is closer to Chiang's vision than to [[Mao Zedong]]'s. He argues that the Communists, since the 1980s, have essentially created the state envisioned by Chiang in the 1930s.

Like many other Chinese historical figures, Chiang used several names throughout his life. That inscribed in the genealogical records of his family is '''Jiang Zhoutai''' ({{zh|c=蔣周泰|w=Chiang Chou-tai}}). This so-called &quot;register name&quot; (譜名) is the one under which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he got married. In deference to tradition, family members did not use the register name in conversation with people outside of the family. In fact, the concept of real or original name is not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world.

In honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their offspring. In the meantime, they used a &quot;milk name&quot; (乳名), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family. Thus, the actual name that Chiang received at birth was '''Jiang Ruiyuan''' ({{zh|c=蔣瑞元|w=Chiang Jui-yuan}}).

In 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to [[Ningbo]] to be a student, and he chose a &quot;school name&quot; (學名). This was actually the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as the person grew older, younger generations would have to use one of the [[Chinese style name|courtesy name]]s instead). (Colloquially, the school name is called &quot;big name&quot; (大名), whereas the &quot;milk name&quot; is known as the &quot;small name&quot; (小名).) The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Zhiqing ({{zh|c=志清|w=Chi-ching}}; means &quot;purity of intentions&quot;). For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as '''Jiang Zhiqing'''. This is the name under which [[Sun Yat-sen]] knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in [[Guangzhou]] in the 1910s.

In 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name {{Audio|Zh-Jiang_Jieshi.ogg|'''Jiang Jieshi'''}} ({{zh|c=蔣介石|w=Chiang Chieh-shih}}) as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded (''Voice of the Army''—軍聲).

(''Jieshi'' is the [[pinyin]] romanization of the name, based on [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], but the common romanized rendering is ''Kai-shek'' which is in [[Cantonese|Cantonese romanization]]. As the republicans were based in Guangzhou (a Cantonese speaking area), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in [[Wade-Giles]]). In mainland China, ''Jiang Jieshi'' is the name under which he is commonly known today.

[[File:Cihu President Chiang Mausoleum entrance.JPG|thumb|right|The entrance to Chiang's tombsite at [[Tzuhu]] (Cihu) uses the official posthumous rendering of Chiang Kai-shek (''[[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|from right to left]]''): The President (space) Lord Chiang Mausoleum.]]

Jieshi soon became his [[Chinese style name|courtesy name]] (字). Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the ''[[I Ching]]''; others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generation line, while the second character of his courtesy name ''shi'' (石—meaning &quot;stone&quot;) suggests the second character of his &quot;register name&quot; ''tai'' (泰—the famous [[Mount Tai]] of China). Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person. As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name.

Sometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to [[Sun Yat-sen]], he changed his name from Jiang Zhiqing to '''Jiang Zhongzheng''' ({{zh|c=蔣中正|w=Chiang Chung-cheng}}). By adopting the name Chung-cheng (&quot;central uprightness&quot;), he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who was (and still is) known among Chinese as Zhongshan (中山—meaning &quot;central mountain&quot;), thus establishing a link between the two. The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the legitimate heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas. Not surprisingly, the Chinese Communists always rejected the use of this name and it is not well-known in [[mainland China]]. However, it was readily accepted by members of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] and is the name under which Chiang Kai-shek is still commonly known in Taiwan. Often the name is shortened to Chung-cheng only (Chung-cheng in [[Wade-Giles]]). For many years passengers arriving at the [[Chiang Kai-shek International Airport]] were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the &quot;Chung Cheng International Airport&quot;. Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang's memory in Taipei known in English as [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]] was literally named &quot;Chung Cheng Memorial Hall&quot; in Chinese. In Singapore, [[Chung Cheng High School]] was named after him.

His name is also written in Taiwan as &quot;'''The Late President Lord Chiang'''&quot; (先總統　蔣公), where the one-character-wide space known as [[nuo tai]] shows respect; this practice has lost some popularity. However, he is still known as ''Lord Chiang'' (蔣公) (without the title or space), along with the name ''Chiang Chung-cheng'', in Taiwan.

==Wives==
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Yao Zhicheng.jpg|[[Yao Yecheng]] (姚冶誠, 1889–1972) Came to Taiwan and died in Taipei.
File:Chen Jieru.jpg|[[Chen Jieru]] (陳潔如, 1906–1971) Lived in Shanghai. Moved to Hong Kong later and died there.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In an [[arranged marriage]], Chiang was married to a fellow villager named [[Mao Fumei]]. While married to Mao, Chiang adopted two [[concubine]]s (concubinage was still a common practice for well-to-do, non-Christian males in China): he married [[Yao Yecheng]] (姚冶誠, 1889–1972) in 1912 and [[Chen Jieru]] (陳潔如, 1906–1971) in December 1921. While he was still living in Shanghai, Chiang and Yao adopted a son, [[Chiang Wei-kuo|Wei-kuo]]. Chen adopted a daughter in 1924, named Yaoguang (瑤光), who later adopted her mother's surname. Chen's autobiography refuted the idea that she was a concubine. Chen claiming that, by the time she married Chiang, he had already divorced Mao, and that Chen was therefore his wife. Chiang and Mao had a son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo|Ching-kuo]], and a daughter, Chien-hua.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nndb.com/people/974/000086716/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the memoirs of Chen Jieru, Chiang's second wife, she contracted [[gonorrhea]] from Chiang soon after their marriage. He told her that he acquired this disease after separating from his first wife and living with his concubine Yao Yecheng, as well as with many other women he consorted with. His doctor explained to her that Chiang had sex with her before completing his treatment for the disease. As a result, both Chiang and Ch'en Chieh-ju became sterile, which explains why he had only one child, by his first wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Past''. p 83-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships with Generals, Ethnic Minorities, and Religions==
[[File:Chiang Kaishek with Muslim General Ma Fushou.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chiang Kai-shek with the Muslim General [[Ma Fushou]].]]

Chiang personally dealt extensively with religions and power figures in China during his regime.

===Relationship with Muslims===
Chiang Kai-shek developed relationships with other Generals. Chiang became sworn brother of the Muslim General [[Ma Fuxiang]] and appointed him to high ranking positions. Chiang addressed Ma Fuxiang's son [[Ma Hongkui]] as Shao Yun Shixiong&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zeSeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=chiang+sworn+brother+ma+fuxiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L2mKTLiJNIG8lQeZyPmkDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chiang%20sworn%20brother%20ma%20fuxiang&amp;f=false|title=Familiar China at war: regions of China, 1937-1945|author=Stephen R.

When Chiang became President of China after the [[Northern Expedition]], he carved out [[Ningxia]] and [[Qinghai]] out of Gansu province, and appointed Muslim Generals as Military Governors of all three provinces, the three Generals were [[Ma Hongkui]], [[Ma Hongbin]], and [[Ma Qi]]. Chiang continued to appoint Muslims as Governors of the three provinces, including [[Ma Lin (warlord)]] and [[Ma Fushou]]. This caused Islamic power in northwestern China to increase, no other President had dared to appoint Muslims as Governors of Gansu, and the three Muslim governors, known as [[Xibei San Ma]] (lit. ''the three [[Ma clique|Mas]] of the [[Northwestern China|Northwest]]''), controlled armies composed entirely of Muslims. Chiang called on the three and their suboordinates to wage war against the Soviet Russians, Tibetans, Communists, and the Japanese, which they did ferociously with their Muslim cavalry.  Chiang appointed a Muslim General, [[Bai Chongxi]], as the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of China, which controlled the ROC military.

Chiang also supported the Muslim General Ma Zhongying, whom he had trained at [[Whampoa Military Academy]] during the [[Kumul Rebellion]], in a [[Jihad]] against [[Jin Shuren]], [[Sheng Shicai]], and the Soviet Union during the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. Chiang designated Ma's Muslim army as the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] and gave his troops [[Kuomintang]] flags and uniforms. Chiang then supported Muslim General Ma Hushan against [[Sheng Shicai]] and the Soviet Union in the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]].  All Muslim Generals commissioned by Chiang in the National Revolutionary Army paid alleigance to him. Several, like [[Ma Shaowu]] and Ma Hushan were loyal to Chiang and Kuomintang hardliners.

The [[Ili Rebellion]] and [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]] plagued relations with the Soviet Union during Chiang's rule and caused trouble with the Uyghurs. During the Ili Rebellion and Peitashan incident, Chiang deployed [[Hui people|Hui]] troops against [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] mobs in Turfan, and against Soviet Russian and Mongols at Peitashan.

During Chiang's rule, attacks on foreigners by Kuomintang forces flared up in several incidents. One of these was the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] where a Muslim army loyal to the Kuomintang massacred 4,500 Uyghurs, and killed several British at the British consulate in Kashgar. The British were unable to retaliate.

[[Hu Songshan]], a Muslim Imam, backed Chiang Kai-shek's regime and gave prayers for his government. ROC flags were saluted by Muslims in Ningxia during prayer along with exhortations to nationalism during Chiang's rule. Chiang sent Muslim students abroad to study at places like [[Al Azhar]] and Muslim schools throughout China taught loyalty to his regime.

The Yuehua, a Chinese Muslim publication, quoted the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] to justify submitting to Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of China, and as justification for Jihad in the war against Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&amp;dq=ma+fuxiang+defence&amp;q=jiang#v=onepage&amp;q=jiang%20jieshi%20submit&amp;f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication|author=Stéphane A.

The [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan al Muslimun a.k.a. Muslim brotherhood) was the predominant Muslim sect backed by the Chiang government during Chiang's regime. Other Muslim sects, like the [[Xidaotang]] and Sufi brotherhoods like Jahriyya and Khuffiya were also supported by his regime. The Chinese Muslim Association, a pro-Kuomintang and anti-Communist organization, was set up by Muslims working in his regime. [[Salafism]] attempted to gain a foothold in China during his regime, but the Yihewani and Hanafi Sunni [[Gedimu]] denounced the Salafis as radicals, enaged in fights against them, and declared them heretics, forcing the Salafis to form a separate sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uHjR3yeIWzUC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=gedimu+ikhwan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AXmOTNbGOcWqlAf-y8jmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=gedimu%20ikhwan&amp;f=false|title=Muslim diversity: local Islam in global contexts |author=Leif O.

[[Ma Buqing]] was another Muslim General who fled to Taiwan along with Chiang. His government donated money to build the [[Taipei Grand Mosque]] on Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeimosque.org.tw/index.php?categoryid=9]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Buddhists and Christians===
Chiang had uneasy relations with the Tibetans. He fought against them in the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], and he supported the Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] in his bloody war against Tibetan rebels in Qinghai. Chiang ordered Ma Bufang to prepare his Islamic army to invade Tibet several times, to deter Tibetan independence, and threatened them with aerial bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rozF-AZgmM8C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=ma+bufang+japanese&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBghTJLZOIKClAfC_Nxi&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20japanese&amp;f=false|title=Indo-Tibet-China conflict|author=Dinesh Lal|year=2008|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|location=|page=61|isbn=8178357143|pages=309|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Chiang appointed Ma Bufang as ambassador to [[Saudi Arabia]].

Chiang incorporated Methodist values into the [[New Life Movement]] under the influence of his wife. Dancing and western music were discouraged. In one incident, several youths splashed acid on people wearing western clothing, although Chiang was not directly responsible for these incidents. Despite being a Methodist, he made reference to the Buddha in his diary, and encouraged the establishment of a Buddhist political party under Master [[Taixu]].

{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}

The '''compression ratio''' of an [[internal-combustion engine]] or [[external combustion engine]] is a value that represents the [[ratio]] of the volume of its [[combustion chamber]] from its largest capacity to its smallest capacity. It is a fundamental specification for many common combustion engines.

In a piston engine it is the ratio between the volume of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] and combustion chamber when the [[piston]] is at the [[bottom dead center|bottom of its stroke]], and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the [[top dead center|top of its stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  | last = Encyclopedia Britannica
  | title = Compression ratio
  | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130313/compression-ratio
  | accessdate =2009-07-21 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Picture a cylinder and its combustion chamber with the piston at the bottom of its stroke containing 1000&amp;nbsp;cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). When the piston has moved up to the top of its stroke inside the cylinder, and the remaining volume inside the head or combustion chamber has been reduced to 100&amp;nbsp;cc, then the compression ratio would be proportionally described as 1000:100, or with fractional reduction, a 10:1 compression ratio.

A high compression ratio is desirable because it allows an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of [[air-fuel mixture]] due to its higher [[thermal efficiency]].{{Cn|reason=this is not because of thermal efficiency, it is because greater compression increases the internal energy of the mixture that is then available to be converted into mechanical energy. The efficiency is how much of that internal energy is actually converted into useful mechanical energy but that is independent of the compression.|date=April 2011}} High ratios place the available oxygen and fuel molecules into a reduced space along with the [[adiabatic]] heat of compression–causing better mixing and evaporation of the fuel droplets.{{Cn|reason=you should not say adiabatic heat of compression because that is like saying the heat that has no heat transfer which does not make sense. Adiabatic usually refers to a process. You should say along with the adiabatic tendancies of the compression process or along with the fact that the compression process is adiabatic. Also it does not really make sense to say it causes better evaporation. What constitutes better evaporation. I would say it is because it increases pressure which increases the force pushing the piston down.|date=April 2011}} Thus they allow increased power at the moment of ignition and the extraction of more useful work from that power by expanding the hot gas to a greater degree.{{Cn|reason=you cannot say work is extracted from power. Power is work done over time, it is a measure of how fast the work is done. That would be like saying distance traveled is extracted from velocity. Also work is not a physical property, it is a change in something, so you cannot refer to it as a physical object to be extracted, as opposed to energy which is a physical property.|date=April 2011}}

Higher compression ratios will however make gasoline engines subject to [[engine knocking]] if lower octane-rated fuel is used, also known as detonation. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if knock sensors are not present to retard the timing. However, knock sensors have been a requirement of the [[OBD-II]] specification used in 1996 model year vehicles and newer.

[[Diesel engines]] on the other hand operate on the principle of compression ignition, so that a fuel which resists [[autoignition]] will cause late ignition which will also lead to engine knock.

==Formula==
The ratio is calculated by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{CR} = \frac { \tfrac{\pi}{4} b^2 s + V_c } {V_c}&lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;b\;&lt;/math&gt; = [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[Bore (engine)|bore]] (diameter)
:&lt;math&gt;s\;&lt;/math&gt; = [[piston]] [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] length
:&lt;math&gt;V_c\;&lt;/math&gt; = [[clearance volume]]. It is the volume of the combustion chamber (including [[head gasket]]). This is the minimum volume of the space at the end of the compression stroke, i.e. when the piston reaches top dead center (TDC). Because of the complex shape of this space, it is usually measured directly rather than calculated.

==Typical compression ratios==
===Petrol (gasoline) engine===
Due to [[engine knocking|pinging]] (detonation), the compression ratio in a [[gasoline]] or [[petrol]]-powered engine will usually not be much higher than 10:1, although some production automotive engines built for high-performance from 1955–1972 had compression ratios as high as 13.0:1, which could run safely on the high-octane [[Tetra-ethyl lead|leaded gasoline]] then available.

A technique used to prevent the onset of knock is the high &quot;swirl&quot; engine that forces the intake charge to adopt a very fast circular rotation in the cylinder during compression that provides quicker and more complete combustion. Recently, with the addition of variable valve timing and knock sensors to delay ignition timing, it is possible to manufacture gasoline engines with compression ratios of over 11:1 that can use 87 MON ([[octane rating]]) fuel.

In engines with a [[Engine knocking|'ping' or 'knock']] [[sensor]] and an [[electronic control unit]], the CR can be as high as 13:1 (2005 [[BMW K1200S]]).  In 1981, Jaguar released a cylinder head that allowed up to 14:1 compression; but settled for 12.5:1 in production cars.  The cylinder head design was known as the &quot;May Fireball&quot; head; it was developed by a Swiss engineer [[Michael May (racing driver)|Michael May]].

===Petrol/gasoline engine with pressure-charging===
In a [[turbocharged]] or [[supercharger|supercharged]] gasoline engine, the CR is customarily built at 9.32:1 or lower.

===Petrol/gasoline engine for racing===
Motorcycle racing engines can use compression ratios as high as 14:1, and it is not uncommon to find motorcycles with compression ratios above 12.0:1 designed for 86 or 87 octane fuel.

===Ethanol and methanol engines===

Ethanol and methanol can take significantly higher compression ratios than gasoline. Racing engines burning [[methanol]] and [[ethanol fuel]] often incorporate a CR of 14.5-16:1, with F1 engines coming closer to 17:1(which is very critical for maximizing volumetric/fuel efficiency at around 18000 rpm)

===Gas-fueled engine===
In engines running exclusively on [[Autogas|LPG]] or [[compressed natural gas|CNG]], the CR may be higher, due to the higher octane rating of these fuels.

===Diesel engine===
In an auto-ignition [[diesel engine]], (no electrical sparking plug—the hot air of compression lights the injected fuel) the CR will customarily exceed 14:1. Ratios over 22:1 are common.  The appropriate compression ratio depends on the design of the cylinder head.  The figure is usually between 14:1 and 16:1 for direct injection engines and between 18:1 and 23:1 for indirect injection engines.

==Fault finding and diagnosis==
Measuring the compression [[pressure]] of an engine, with a [[pressure gauge]] connected to the [[spark plug]] opening, gives an indication of the engine's state and quality.  There is, however, no formula to calculate compression ratio based on cylinder pressure.

If the nominal compression ratio of an engine is given, the pre-ignition cylinder pressure can be estimated using the following relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;p = p_0 \times \text{CR}^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_0\;&lt;/math&gt; is the cylinder pressure at bottom dead center which is usually at 1 atm, &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}&lt;/math&gt; is the compression ratio, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\;&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat ratio]] for the working fluid, which is about 1.4 for air, and 1.3 for methane-air mixture.

For example, if an engine running on gasoline has a compression ratio of 10:1, the cylinder pressure at top dead center is

:&lt;math&gt; p_\text{TDC} = 1 \text{ bar} \times 10^{1.4} = 25.1 \text{ bar}&lt;/math&gt;

This figure, however, will also depend on cam (i.e. valve) timing.  Generally, cylinder pressure for common automotive designs should at least equal 10 [[bar (unit)|bar]], or, roughly estimated in [[pounds per square inch]] (psi) as between 15 and 20 times the compression ratio, or in this case between 150 psi and 200 psi, depending on cam timing. Purpose-built racing engines, stationary engines etc. will return figures outside this range.

Factors including late intake valve closure (relatively speaking for camshaft profiles outside of typical production car range, but not necessarily into the realm of competition engines) can produce a misleadingly low figure from this test. Excessive [[connecting rod]] clearance, combined with extremely high [[oil pump]] output (rare but not impossible) can sling enough oil to coat the cylinder walls with enough oil to facilitate reasonable [[piston ring]] seal artificially give a misleadingly high figure, on engines with compromised ring seal.

This can actually be used to some slight advantage. If a compression test does give a low figure, and it has been determined it is not due to intake valve closure/camshaft characteristics, then one can differentiate between the cause being valve/seat seal issues and ring seal by squirting engine oil into the spark plug orifice, in a quantity sufficient to disperse across the piston crown and the circumference of the top ring land, and thereby effect the mentioned seal. If a second compression test is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the ring seal that is problematic, whereas if the compression test pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or rarer still cylinder wall damage) issue.

If there is a significant (greater than 10%) difference between cylinders, that may be an indication that [[poppet valve|valves]] or [[cylinder head]] [[gasket]]s are leaking, [[piston]] rings are worn or that the [[cylinder block|block]] is cracked.

If a problem is suspected then a more comprehensive test using a [[leak-down tester]] can locate the leak.

==Variable Compression Ratio (VCR) engines==
Because cylinder bore diameter, piston stroke length and combustion chamber volume are almost always constant, the compression ratio for a given engine is almost always constant, until engine wear takes its toll.

One exception is the [[experiment]]al [[Saab Variable Compression engine]] (SVC). This engine, designed by [[Saab Automobile]], uses a technique that dynamically alters the volume of the combustion chamber (V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), which, via the above equation, changes the compression ratio (CR).

The [[Atkinson cycle]] engine was one of the first attempts at [[Variable_compression_ratio|variable compression]].  Since the compression ratio is the ratio between dynamic and static volumes of the combustion chamber the Atkinson cycle's method of increasing the length of the powerstroke compared to the intake stroke ultimately altered the compression ratio at different stages of the cycle.

==Dynamic compression ratio==
The calculated compression ratio, as given above, presumes that the cylinder is sealed at the bottom of the stroke, and that the volume compressed is the actual volume.

However: intake valve closure (sealing the cylinder) always takes place after BDC, which may cause some of the intake charge to be compressed backwards out of the cylinder by the rising piston at very low speeds; only the percentage of the stroke after intake valve closure is compressed. Intake port tuning and scavenging may allow a greater mass of charge (at a higher than atmospheric pressure) to be trapped in the cylinder than the static volume would suggest ( This &quot;corrected&quot; compression ratio is commonly called the &quot;''dynamic compression ratio''&quot;.

This ratio is higher with more conservative (i.e., earlier, soon after BDC) intake cam timing, and lower with more radical (i.e., later, long after BDC) intake cam timing, but always lower than the static or &quot;nominal&quot; compression ratio.

The actual position of the piston can be determined by trigonometry, using the stroke length and the [[connecting rod]] length (measured between centers). The absolute cylinder pressure is the result of an exponent of the dynamic compression ratio. This exponent is a polytropic value for the ratio of variable heats for air and similar gases at the temperatures present. This compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression, as well as heat lost to the cylinder. Under ideal (adiabatic) conditions, the exponent would be 1.4, but a lower value, generally between 1.2 and 1.3 is used, since the amount of heat lost will vary among engines based on design, size and materials used, but provides useful results for purposes of comparison. For example, if the static compression ratio is 10:1, and the dynamic compression ratio is 7.5:1, a useful value for cylinder pressure would be (7.5)^1.3 × atmospheric pressure, or 13.7 [[bar (unit)|bar]]. (× 14.7 psi at sea level = 201.8 psi. The pressure shown on a gauge would be the absolute pressure less atmospheric pressure, or 187.1 psi.)

The two corrections for dynamic compression ratio affect cylinder pressure in opposite directions, but not in equal strength. An engine with high static compression ratio and late intake valve closure will have a DCR similar to an engine with lower compression but earlier intake valve closure.

Additionally, the cylinder pressure developed when an engine is running will be higher than that shown in a compression test for several reasons.

*The much higher velocity of a piston when an engine is running versus cranking allows less time for pressure to bleed past the piston rings into the crankcase.

*a running engine is coating the cylinder walls with much more oil than an engine that is being cranked at low RPM, which helps the seal.

*the higher temperature of the cylinder will create higher pressures when running vs. a static test, even a test performed with the engine near [[operating temperature]].

* A running engine does not stop taking air &amp; fuel into the cylinder when the piston reaches BDC; The mixture that is rushing into the cylinder during the downstroke develops momentum and continues briefly after the vacuum ceases (in the same respect that rapidly opening a door will create a draft that continues after movement of the door ceases).  This is called scavenging.  Intake tuning, cylinder head design, valve timing and exhaust tuning determine how effectively an engine scavenges.

==Compression ratio versus overall pressure ratio==

Compression ratio and [[overall pressure ratio]] are interrelated as follows:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
! Compression ratio
|| 2:1  || 3:1 || 5:1 || 10:1 || 15:1 || 20:1 || 25:1 || 35:1
|-
! Pressure ratio
|| 2.64:1 || 4.66:1 ||9.52:1 || 25.12:1 || 44.31:1 || 66.29:1 || 90.60:1 || 145.11:1
|}

The reason for this difference is that compression ratio is defined via the volume reduction:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;,
while pressure ratio is defined as the [[pressure]] increase:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{PR}=\frac{P_2}{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
In calculating the pressure ratio, we assume that an [[adiabatic compression]] is carried out (i.e. that no heat energy is supplied to the gas being compressed, and that any temperature rise is solely due to the compression). We also assume that air is a perfect gas. With those two assumptions we can define the relationship between change of volume and change of pressure as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma \Rightarrow
\frac{P_2}{P_1}= \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ ratio of specific heats ]] for air (approximately 1.4).
The values in the table above are derived using this formula. Note that in reality the ratio of specific heats changes with temperature and that significant deviations from adiabatic behavior will occur.

The '''Concordat of Worms''', sometimes called the '''Pactum Calixtinum''' by papal historians,&lt;ref&gt;In his article, &quot;The Pactum Callixtinum: An Innovation in Papal Diplomacy&quot;, (''The Catholic Historical Review'' '''8'''.2 [July 1922:180–190]) P. W. Browne observes that the term ''[[concordat]]'' was not in use until [[Nicolas of Cusa]]'s ''De concordantia catholica''&lt;/ref&gt; was an agreement between [[Pope Calixtus II]] and Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] on September 23, 1122 near the city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. It brought to an end the first phase of the power struggle between the [[Papacy]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and has been interpreted&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, &quot;Popes, Kings, and Endogenous Institutions: The Concordat of Worms and the Origins of Sovereignty&quot;, ''International Studies Review'' '''2'''.2, Continuity and Change in the Westphalian Order (Summer 2000), pp. 93–118: his thesis briefly expressed at the outset, is that &quot;the development of important institutions of the modern sovereign state are partially an endogenous product of strategic maneuvering between the Catholic Church and European kings over political control within their domains&quot; (p. 93).&lt;/ref&gt; as containing within itself the germ of [[Sovereignty|nation-based sovereignty]] that would one day be confirmed in the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] (1648); in part this was an unforeseen result of strategic maneuvering between the Church and the European sovereigns over political control within their domains. The King was recognized as having the right to invest bishops with secular authority (&quot;by the lance&quot;) in the territories they governed, but not with sacred authority (&quot;by ring and [[Crozier|staff]]&quot;); the result was that bishops owed allegiance in worldly matters both to the pope and to the king, for they were obligated to affirm the right of the sovereign to call upon them for military support, under his oath of fealty. Previous Holy Roman Emperors had thought it their right, granted by God, to name the Pope, as well as other Church officials, such as bishops.  One long-delayed result was an end to the belief in the [[divine right of kings]]. A more immediate result of the Investiture struggle identified a proprietary right that adhered to sovereign territory, recognizing the right of kings to income from the territory of a vacant diocese and a basis for justifiable taxation. These rights lay outside [[feudalism]], which defined authority in a hierarchy of personal relations, with only a loose relation to territory.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno de Mesquita 2000, p. 95,&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope emerged as a figure above and out of the direct control of the Holy Roman Emperor.

Following efforts by Lamberto Scannabecchi (later [[Pope Honorius II]]) and the [[Diet of Würzburg]] (1121) in 1122, Pope Calixtus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V entered into an agreement that effectively ended the [[Investiture Controversy]]. By the terms of the agreement, the election of bishops and abbots in Germany was to take place in the emperor's presence as judge between potentially disputing parties, [[simony|free of bribes]], thus retaining to the emperor a crucial role in choosing these great territorial magnates of the Empire. Beyond the borders of the Empire, in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and [[Italy]], the Emperor was to forward the symbols of authority within six months. Calixtus' reference to the feudal homage due the emperor on appointment is guarded: &quot;shall do unto thee for these what he rightfully should&quot; was the wording of the ''privilegium'' granted by Calixtus. The Emperor's right to a substantial imbursement on the election of a bishop or  abbot was specifically denied.

The Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and [[crosier]], the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration.  The two ended by granting one another peace.

The Concordat was confirmed by the [[First Council of the Lateran]] in 1123.

The Concordat of Worms was a part of the larger reforms put forth by many popes, most notably [[Pope Gregory VII]].  These included celibacy of the clergy, end of [[simony]] and autonomy of the Church from secular leaders (lack of autonomy was known as [[lay investiture]]).

==Inheritance and alienation==
The most prized and contested rights that attached to [[benefices]] were inheritance and security against confiscation.  Benefices were lands granted by the Church to faithful lords.  In exchange, the Church expected rent or other services, such as military protection.  These lands would then be further divided between lesser lords and commoners.  This was the nature of European [[feudalism]].  Inheritance was an important issue, since land could fall into the hands of those who did not have loyalty to the Church or the great lords. The usual grant was ''[[precaria|in precaria]]'', the granting of a [[life tenure]], whereby the tenant stayed on the land only at the pleasure of the lord.  The tenant could be expelled from the land at any time.  His tenancy was ''precarious''.   Counts’ benefices came to be inherited as counties were broken up and as counts assimilated their offices and ex-officio lands to their family property.  In central Europe, kings and counts probably were willing to allow the inheritance of small parcels of land to the heirs of those who had offered military or other services in exchange for tenancy.  This was contingent on the heirs being reasonably loyal and capable.  Churches in Germany, as elsewhere, were willing to allow peasants to inherit their land.  This was a source of profit to both churches and lords when the inheritors were charged a fee to inherit the land.  Most bishops had a different attitude toward freemen and nobles.  To these peasants, grants were made ''in precario'' or ''in beneficio'', usually for a specified and limited number of ''life tenures''. It was not impossible to recover land left to noble families for generations.  But the longer the family held church land, the more difficult it was to oust them from the land. Some church officials came to view granting land to noble families amounted to outright alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Urkundenbuch mittelrhein. Terr., I. No. 168,;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dip. Hein. II, no, 433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reg. Hist. Westfaliae, no. 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Susan, p. 430 “Fiefs and Vassals”,  Oxford, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;   By the twelfth century great churches in Germany, like those elsewhere were finding it difficult to hold out against the accumulation of lay custom and lay objections to temporary inheritance.  The Bishop of Worms issued a statement in 1120 indicating the poor and unfree should be allowed to inherit tenancy without payment of fees.  It appears to have been something novel.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, S. p. 431, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing masses of unfree and the marginal were needed for labor, and to bolster the military of both nobility and the church.  By the time of Henry IV, bargaining by the peasants for the benefit of the group was the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Dip. Hein. IV, no. 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, S. p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gregorian Reform==
[[Image:Pope gregory vii illustration.jpg|left|thumb| [[Pope Gregory VII]] began reforms that led to the Concordat of Worms.]]
The [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of [[Ottonian Dynasty]], when they came to the throne, believed they should have the power to appoint the pope.  They also believed they should appoint minor church officials.  The result was that, more often than not, bishops, abbots of monasteries, and even the pope were not independent, but resembled lackeys or sycophants of the crown of the Holy Roman Empire.  This attitude was bolstered by the general conception that the Holy Roman Emperor and all other European Kings were chosen by God to be leaders. 

For temporal secular reasons, the kings did nothing to dispel this attitude. It meant more power for them. A series of popes began to directly challenge this condition.  The most vocal and strident was [[Pope Gregory VII]]. Reform took a century, but brought greater autonomy for the papacy and the Church in general. 

In the period immediately after 1000, two figures appeared to lead Western Christendom, the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor. Antagonism between the two dominated the next century.  After the death of [[Pope Silvester II]] in 1003, the papacy fell under the influence of the nobility in Latium, and then after 1046, under the influence of the German emperors.  The reality for the west in the Middle Ages was not only the fact that government was split up into small particles but also the fact that vertical and horizontal powers were entangled.  People in the Middle Ages did not always know to which of the many lords, the Church and the individual churches, the towns, princes, and kings, they were subordinate.  This can be observed in the complexity even at the administrative and judicial level in the jurisdictional conflicts that fill medieval history.&lt;ref&gt;Le Goff “Medieval Civilization”, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church endeavored to become disengaged from the German control.  An example of this secular politicization is seen when  [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]] supported  [[Pope Benedict IX]], the most corrupt of any of the popes of the era. It took more than a century to end this manipulation, and was never complete. In the process, the whole Church emerged freed from the grip of all lay lords.  This was known as the [[Gregorian Reform]], which takes its name from [[Pope Gregory VII]], (1073–85) .  It was merely the latest and most visible of reforms that tended to move the Church back to its roots.  It was a question of restoring the autonomy and power of the priestly class in the face of increasing control by the warrior class.&lt;ref&gt;Le Goff, p. 96, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The clergy was forced to renew and define itself.  There was a battle against [[simony]].  The roadmap to celibacy was drawn, if not immediately enacted.  Monarchs were excluded from selecting popes.  This had been decreed by [[Pope Nicholas II]] in 1059.  Afterward, only cardinals could elect the pope.  Gregorian Reform reiterated this notion.  There was to be no more lay interference in the selection of clergy.  The aim was to deprive emperors and their under-lords the right to nominate and invest bishops.  The effect was to deprive lay kings power over the Church and increase both spiritual and temporal power in the Vatican and the bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Le Goff, p. 96, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Gregory VII appeared to have succeeded when the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] was humiliated at Canossa in 1077.  There, Henry begged in the snow to be let back into the good graces of the Church, having been excommunicated the year before by Gregory.  The penitent and humbled emperor did not remain in that state. Soon Henry IV took his revenge. He named his own pope [[Antipope Clement III]] in the old manner of the Holy Roman Emperors.  [[Pope Urban II]], more prudent than Gregory sidestepped the issue using a Crusade to gather Christian Europe together under his authority.  A compromise was reached in Worms in 1122, by which the emperor abandoned investiture “by ring and staff” to the pope, and promised to respect the freedom of elections and consecrations, but kept for himself the right to invest bishops with the temporalities of their sees “by scepter”.&lt;ref&gt;Le Goff, p. 96, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Emperor retained some power over imperial churches, his power was damaged irreparably because he lost the religious authority that previously belonged to the office of the king. In France, England, and the Christian state in Spain, the king could overcome rebellions of his magnates and establish the power of his royal demesne because he could rely the Church, which, for several centuries, had given him a mystical authority.  From time to time, rebellious and recalcitrant monarchs might afoul of the Church.  These could be excommunicated, and after an appropriate time and public penance, be received back into the communion and good graces of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. H. C., p. 256,  “ A History of Medieval Europe”, Longmans, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor==
[[Image:Canossa-three.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Henry IV begging forgiveness of Pope Gregory VII at [[Canossa]], the castle of the Countess Matilda, 1077.]]

[[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] was one of those monarchs who found himself excommunicated.  After 1080, he never showed any indication of repentance, and therefore remained excommunicate for twenty-six years (1080–1106).  He was unrepentant to the end.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 256, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue had revolved around the problem of investiture.  The German Kings had been the worst offenders, naming not only bishops, but popes as well.  Gregory VII condemned lay investiture.  Henry in turn called a council of bishops who proclaimed Gregory illegitimate.  Gregory excommunicated Henry in 1076.  In the process, he released all subjects of Henry from obedience to him.  It led to a great political struggle with many barons rising against Henry in open rebellion.  Henry made his way to the Canossa where the Pope was staying in the castle of Countess Matilda.  Henry wished to repent.  The pope was suspicious of the king’s motives, and did not believe he was truly repentant.  Henry did penance in the snow outside the castle for three days.  Finally, Gregory gave absolution to him.  The rebellious nobles in Germany who were interested in deposing Henry IV never forgave Pope Gregory VII for what they viewed as treachery.  By 1080, Henry had shown enough of a recalcitrant attitude that Gregory excommunicated him for good.  There was no going back after this point.&lt;ref&gt;Dahmus, Joseph, p. 228-229, “The Middle Ages, A Popular History”, Doubleday and Company, Inc. Garden City, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;    It was the consequence of this lengthy episode that a whole generation grew up in Germany and Northern Italy in an atmosphere of war, doubt and scepticism.  The papal backers had been busy propounding arguments to show that royal power was not of divine origin.  They had been so successful that the moral authority of the Emperor had been undermined in the minds of many of his subjects.  Serious divisions existed from this battle over the [[Investiture controversy]], which fractured large portions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Germany and Italy.  Davis argues these rifts were so deep and lasting that neither Germany nor Italy were able to form a cohesive nation state until the nineteenth century.  A similar situation arose from the French revolution, which caused fractures in France that still exist.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 256, 257, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of Henry’s excommunication, and his subsequent reluctance to repent left a turbulence in central Europe that lasted throughout the Middle Ages.  It may have been emblematic of certain German attitudes toward religion in general, and the perceived relevance of the German Emperor in the universal scheme of things.  

Henry IV became so filled with hubris over his position, that he renounced Gregory VII and named the bishop of Ravenna pope.  Perhaps he was only following what had been thought to be the right of kings: to name the Pope.  Henry had invested the Ravenna bishop, and now he referred to the new pope, Clement III, [[Antipope Clement III]] as “our pope”.  Henry attacked Rome, and on the outskirts of the city gained thirteen cardinals who became loyal to his cause.  On Palm Sunday, 1084, Henry IV solemnly enthroned Clement at [[St. Peter’s Basilica]] and on Easter Day, Clement returned the favor and crowned Henry IV as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.   Gregory VII was meanwhile still resisting a few hundred yards away from the basilica in the [[Castel San Angelo]], then known as the house of [[Cencius]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 252,253, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;    Gregory appealed to the Normans [[Image:Clement III - Antipope.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Contemporary illustration of Henry IV (left) and Anti-pope Clement III (center).]]
for help, and [[Robert Guiscard]] responded, entering Rome on May 27, 1084, rescuing him.  In the process, Rome was pillaged and partially burned.  Gregory VII died the next year on May 25, 1085 in exile.  He felt all was lost.  The last words he uttered were, ‘I have loved justice and hated iniquity, and therefore I die in exile.” &lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 253, 254, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory VII must have felt he died in utter failure, and to many of his contemporaries it appeared Henry IV and Antipope Clement III have won.  But the underlying current was that Henry had overreached, and his appointment of the antipope was beyond the pale.  Upon the death of Gregory, the cardinals elected a new pope, [[Victor III]].  He owed his elevation to the influence of the Normans.  Antipope Clement III still occupied St. Peter’s.  When Victor III died, the cardinals elected [[Urban II]] (1088–99).  He was one of three men Gregory VII suggested as his successor.  Urban II preached the First Crusade, which united Western Europe, and more importantly, reconciled the majority of bishops who had abandoned Gregory VII.  In the end, Gregorian Reform won out over Henry IV.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 253-254, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;   Preaching the Crusade had one important consequence.  The Pope was now viewed as the head of the Church.  No longer would kings and emperors think themselves equals of the pope, or the head of the Church in their kingdom.  This was the situation from 1122 until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p.255, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Several years later, Henry IV died in a deep gloom as had Gregory.  It remained for his successor, Henry V to agree with Pope Calixtus II in 1122 to a compromise of the conflict over lay investitures known as the Concordat of Worms.&lt;ref&gt;Dahmus, p. 228- 229, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reign of Henry IV showed the weakness of the German monarchy.  The ruler was dependent upon the good will of the great men, the nobility of his land.  These were technically royal officials and hereditary princes.  He was also dependent on the resources of the churches.  Henry IV alienated the Church of Rome and many of the magnates in his own kingdom.  Many of these spent years in open or subversive rebellion.  Henry failed to create a proper bureaucracy to replace his disobedient vassals.  The magnates became increasingly independent, and the Church withdrew support.  Henry IV spent the last years of his life desperately grasping to keep his throne.  It was a greatly diminished kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, Joseph, p. 215-216, “The Middle Ages, 395–1500, 4th Edition” Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc.  1959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor==
[[Image:Flag Germany Emperors Banner.svg|thumb|left| The German Emperors flew this banner prior to 1300.]]
The reign of Henry IV ended with a diminished kingdom and waning power.  Many of his underlords had been in constant or desultory revolt for years.  Henry IV’s insistence that [[Antipope Clement III]] was the real pope had initially been popular with some of the nobles, and even many of the bishops of Germany.  But as years passed, this support was slowly withdrawn.  The idea that the German king could and should name the pope was increasingly discredited and viewed as an anachronism from a by-gone era.  The Empire of the Ottos was virtually lost because of Henry IV.  

[[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]] was cold-blooded, shrewd and utterly unscrupulous.  He realized swift action and a change in his father's policy was necessary.   Henry had extorted the throne from his weakened father, Henry IV.   [[Pope Paschal II]] rebuked Henry V for appointing bishops in Germany.  The king crossed the Alps with an army in 1111.  The pope, who was weak and had few supporters was forced to suggest a compromise.  Henry gained greater control over the lands of his kingdom, especially those that had been in the hands of the church, but of contested title. Churchmen would avoid secular services.  The church would be given autonomy and Henry V got large parts of his empire that his father had lost restored.    Henry V was crowned by Pope Paschal II as the legitimate Holy Roman Emperor.  When the concessions of land were read in St. Peters, the crowd revolted in anger.  Henry took the pope and cardinals hostage until the pope granted Henry V the right of investiture.  Then he returned to Germany – emperor and victor over the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer p. 215, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The victory was as short lived as that of his father, Henry IV over Gregory VII.  The clergy urged Paschal to rescind his agreement, which he did in 1112.  The quarrel followed the predictable course: Henry V rebelled and was excommunicated.  Riots broke out in Germany, a new [[Antipope Gregory VIII]] was appointed by the German king,  nobles loyal to Rome seceded from Henry.  The civil war continued, just as under Henry IV.  It dragged on for another ten years.  Like his father before him, Henry V was faced with waning power.  He had no choice but to give up investiture and the old right of naming the pope.  The Concordat of Worms was the result.  After the Concordat, the German kings never had the same control over the Church as had existed in the time of the [[Ottonian Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, p. 215, 216, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Henry V died without heirs in 1125, three years after the Concordat.  He had designated his nephew, Frederick von Staufen duke of [[Swabia]], also known as [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia]] as his successor.   Instead, churchmen elected [[Lothar III]].   A long civil war erupted between the Staufen also known as [[Hohenstaufen]] supporters and the heirs of Lothar III.  The result was the Hohenstaufen [[Frederick I (Barbarossa)]] 1152–1190 who came to power.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, William C., p. 146, &quot;Europe in the High Middle Ages, Penguin History of Europe”, Viking, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charter of Liberties==
[[Image:La Tour Saint-Nicolas.jpg|thumb|right|The agreement reached at [[Bec Abbey]] in 1107 was essentially the same as the Concordat of Worms.]]

The Concordat of Worms was foreshadowed by the [[Charter of Liberties]] of [[Henry I of England]].  He was the youngest son of [[William the Conqueror]].  Through a series of political intrigues, Henry I gained the English throne in 1100.  Henry had three problems: (1) Conflict with the Church and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] in particular. (2) The earls and barons of England did not accept Henry as their king.  (3) The Anglo-Saxon populace did not accept him.  Henry reconciled with the Church and Anselm.  He married Edith, the daughter of the Scots King [[Malcolm III]].  The Anglo-Saxon population was ameliorated because they viewed Edith as one of their own.  Henry signed and issued the [[Charter of Liberties]] in 1100 from the Norman Chapel in the Tower of London.  This gave concessions to the earls and barons, as well as the Church.  The investiture issue was still contentious, but a compromise at [[Bec Abbey]] in 1107 was essentially identical to the Concordat of Worms.&lt;ref&gt;Fawtier, Robert, “The Capetian Kings of France”, London (1964), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dahmus, J., p. 290, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concordat of London, 1107==
The Concordat of London in 1107 was a forerunner of the compromise that was taken up in the Concordat of Worms.  In England, as in Germany,  the conflict between Church and State was rife. A distinction was being made in the king's chancery between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates.   Bowing to political reality,  [[Henry I of England]] ceded his right to invest his bishops and abbots and reserved the custom of requiring them to come and do homage.  The system of [[vassal]]age was not divided among great local lords in England as it was in France, for by right of the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] the king was in control.

[[Henry I of England]] perceived a danger in placing monastic scholars in his chancery and turned increasingly to secular clerks, some of whom held minor positions in the Church. He often rewarded these men with the titles of bishop and abbot. Henry I  expanded the system of [[scutage]] to reduce the monarchy's dependence on knights supplied from church lands. Unlike the situation in Germany, [[Henry I of England]] used the investiture controversy was to strengthen the secular power of the king.  It would continue to boil under the surface.  The controversy would surface in the [[Thomas Becket]] affair under [[Henry II of England]], the [[Great Charter of 1217]], the [[Statutes of Mortmain]] and the battles over [[Cestui que]] use of [[Henry VII of England]], and finally come to a head under [[Henry VIII of England]].

==Result of the Concordat of Worms==
[[Image:Wormser Dom Seitenansicht.jpg|right|thumb|The Cathedral of Worms was 10 years old when the Concordat was issued there in 1122.]]

Of the three reforms Gregory VII and his predecessors and successor popes had attempted, they had been most successful in regard to celibacy of the clergy.  Simony had been partially checked.  Against lay investiture they won only a limited success, and one that seemed less impressive as the years passed.  During the time following the Concordat of Worms, the Church gained in both stature and power.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike, Lynn, pp. 293–294  “The History of Medieval Europe, Third Edition”, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1956&lt;/ref&gt;   

According to the terms of the compromise, the election of bishops and abbots was to follow proper procedure, that is, the canons of the cathedral were to elect the bishop. The monks were to choose the abbot.  This was a minimum that the church had demanded.  In the compromise, the pope agreed that the king or his representative had the right to be present at such elections to resolve any disputes between candidates.  What this meant, in effect, was that the king would have the bishop he wanted, though some prelate would invest the new bishop with the insignia of the office.  As [[William of Champeaux]] assured Henry V, he had nothing to lose by surrendering the right of investiture.  In the Concordat of Worms the church accepted a face-saving concession.  The king retained substantially what he already possessed—the power to fill bishoprics with men of his choice.  Nevertheless, Gregory VII’s dramatization of the issue produced a significant improvement in the character of men raised to the episcopacy.  Kings no longer interfered so frequently in their election, and when they did, they generally nominated more worthy candidates for the office.&lt;ref&gt;Dahmus, J.  P. 229, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;   

The writing in the document was ambiguous, skirted some issues and avoided others all together.  This has caused some scholars to conclude that the settlement turned its back on Gregory VII and Urban II's genuine hopes for reform.  The emperor’s influence in episcopal was preserved, and he could decide disputed elections.  If the compromise was a rebuke to the most radical vision of the liberty of the Church, on at least one point its implication was firm and unmistakable: The king, even an emperor, was a layman. This dispelled the belief that the king was someone specially appointed by the grace of God. The [[divine right of kings]] was dealt a blow from which it never completely recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, William C., p. 99  “Europe in the Middle Ages, Penguin History of Europe” Viking, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  

There exists a misconception concerning the power of the pope in the Middle Ages.  Tradition affords him more power and authority than he actually possessed.  It is likely the Pope in modern ages is much more powerful than those in medieval times.  The most powerful of all medieval popes was [[Innocent III]].  His pronouncements on doctrinal matters and the judgments of his court were considered definitive and final.  Opposing the medieval pope was the primary and unyielding authority of the state.  The struggle over investiture between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] had dramatized the clash between church and state.  The Concordat of Worms had eased the situation for a generation. But in the end, it solved nothing.  Practically speaking, the king retained a decisive voice in the selection of the hierarchy.  All kings supported [[King John of England]]’s defiance of [[Pope Innocent III]] ninety years after the Concordat of Worms in the matter concerning [[Stephen Langton]].  In theory, the pope named his bishops and cardinals.  In reality, more often than not, Rome consecrated the clergy once it was notified by the kings who the incumbent would be.  Recalcitrance by Rome would lead to problems in the kingdom.  For the most part it was a no-win situation for Rome.  In this, the Concordat of Worms changed little. The growth of canon law in the [[Ecclesiastical Courts]] was based on the underlying Roman law and increased the strength of the Roman Pontiff.&lt;ref&gt;Dalmus, J., p. 320, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The English Church was left more or less in the power of the English monarchy.  This was the result of the [[Charter of Liberties]], 1100, and the agreement at [[Bec]] in 1107.  The effect of the Concordat of Worms was different.  It ended a civil war that had been going on for more than fifty years.  There was no going back to the situation that had preceded it.  The political and social structure of Germany had forever been altered.  The new generation of cardinals regarded German investiture with contempt and as an embarrassing vestige of the past.  They were willing to make concessions with Henry V and his successors in order to get along.  The belief after the Concordat was that investiture and the era of theocratic kingship was a discredited doctrine.  The German kings had a different view of the matter.  Henry V and his successors still believed they had the right and ability to name bishops.  In practice, this was true, but only in the territories held by their families.  Their domain in the religious sphere had been greatly diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, N., p. 301,  “Medieval History”, Macmillan, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Image:Façade du Palais des Papes.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Avignon Papacy]] occurring several centuries after the Concordat indicated there was continued interference in the papacy by kings.]]

The catastrophic political consequences of the struggle between pope and emperor also led to a  cultural disaster.  Germany lost intellectual leadership in western Europe.  In 1050, German monasteries were great centers of learning and art and German schools of theology and canon law were unsurpassed and probably unmatched anywhere in Europe.  The long civil war over investiture sapped the energy of both German churchmen and intellectuals.  They fell behind advances in philosophy, law, literature and art taking place in France and Italy.  In many ways, Germany never caught up during the rest of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, N, p. 303, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;     
Universities were established in France, Italy and England by the early 13th century.  Notable are [[University of Bologna]], 1088, [[University of Paris]], 1150, [[Oxford University]], 1167 and [[Cambridge University]], 1207. The first German university, the [[University of Heidelberg]] was not established until 1386. It was immediately steeped in medieval [[nominalism]] and early [[Protestantism]].   

Kings continued to attempt to control either the direct leadership of the church, or indirectly through political means for centuries.   This is seen most clearly in the [[Avignon Papacy]] when the popes moved from Rome to Avignon.  The conflict in Germany and northern Italy arguably left the culture ripe for various Protestant sects, such as the [[Cathars]], the [[Waldensians]] and ultimately [[Hus]] and [[Luther]].

==Text of the Concordat==
[[Image:Blason Bourgogne-comté ancien(aigle).svg|right|thumb| Pope Calixtus was of the House of Burgundy.]]

The following is an English translation of the  Concordat of Worms.  It consisted of two parts:

===Privilege of Pope Calixtus II===
{{quotation|I, bishop Calixtus, servant of the servants of God, do grant to thee beloved son, Henry-by the grace of God august emperor of the Romans-that the elections of the bishops and abbots of the German kingdom, who belong to the kingdom, shall take place in thy presence, without simony and without any violence; so that if any discord shall arise between the parties concerned, thou, by the counsel or judgment of the metropolitan and the co-provincials, may'st give consent and aid to the party which has the more right. The one elected, moreover, without any exaction may receive the regalia from thee through the lance, and shall do unto thee for these what he rightfully should. Be he who is consecrated in the other parts of the empire (i.e. Burgundy and Italy) shall, within six months, and without any exaction, receive the regalia from thee through the lance, and shall do unto thee for these what he rightfully should. Excepting all things which are known to belong to the Roman church. Concerning matters, however, in which thou dost make complaint to me, and dost demand aid-1, according to the duty of my office, will furnish aid to thee. I give unto thee true peace, and to all who are or have been on thy side in the time of this discord. }}
[[Image:Frankenrechen.svg|right|thumb| Henry IV and Henry V were of the House of Franconia.]]

===Edict of the Emperor Henry V===
{{quotation|In the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity, I, Henry, by the grace of God august emperor of the Romans, for the love of God and of the holy Roman church and of our master pope Calixtus, and for the healing of my soul, do remit to God, and to the holy apostles of God, Peter and Paul, and to the holy catholic church, all investiture through ring and staff; and do grant that in all the churches that are in my kingdom or empire there may be canonical election and free consecration. All the possessions and regalia of St. Peter which, from the beginning of this discord unto this day, whether in the time of my father or also in mine, have been abstracted, and which I hold: I restore to that same holy Roman church. As to those things, moreover, which I do not hold, I will faithfully aid in their restoration. As to the possessions also of all other churches and princes, and of all other lay and clerical persons which have been lost in that war: according to the counsel of the princes, or according to justice, I will restore the things that I hold; and of those things which I do not hold I will faithfully aid in the restoration. And I grant true peace to our master pope Calixtus, and to the holy Roman church, and to all those who are or have been on its side. And in matters where the holy Roman church shall demand aid I will grant it; and in matters concerning which it shall make complaint to me I will duly grant to it justice.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[formal language theory]], a  '''context-free language''' is a [[formal language|language]] generated by some [[context-free grammar]]. The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by [[pushdown automaton|pushdown automata]].

==Examples==
An archetypical context-free language is &lt;math&gt;L = \{a^nb^n:n\geq1\}&lt;/math&gt;, the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'s, and the entire second halves of which are &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;'s. &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to aSb ~|~ ab&lt;/math&gt;, and is accepted by the pushdown automaton &lt;math&gt;M=(\{q_0,q_1,q_f\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,z\}, \delta, q_0, \{q_f\})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\delta(q_0, a, z) = (q_0, a)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\delta(q_0, a, a) = (q_0, a)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\delta(q_0, b, a) = (q_1, x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\delta(q_1, b, a) = (q_1, x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\delta(q_1, \lambda, z) = (q_f, z)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathrm{state}_1, \mathrm{read}, \mathrm{pop}) = (\mathrm{state}_2, \mathrm{push})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is initial stack symbol and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; means pop action.
&lt;/center&gt;

Context-free languages have many applications in [[programming languages]]; for example, the [[Dyck language|language of all properly matched parentheses]] is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to SS ~|~ (S) ~|~ \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  Also, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars.

== Closure properties ==

Context-free languages are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are context-free languages, the following languages are context-free as well:

* the [[union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''
* the reversal of ''L''
* the [[concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L \cdot P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''
* the [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of ''L''
* the image φ(L) of ''L'' under a [[String_operations#String_homomorphism|homomorphism]] φ 
* the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under an [[String_operations#String_homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
* the [[cyclic shift]] of ''L'' (the language &lt;math&gt;\{vu : uv \in L \}&lt;/math&gt;)

Context-free languages are not closed under [[complement (complexity)|complement]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], or [[Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_complement|difference]]. However, if ''L'' is a context-free language and ''D'' is a regular language then both their intersection &lt;math&gt;L\cap D&lt;/math&gt; and their difference &lt;math&gt;L\setminus D&lt;/math&gt; are context-free languages.

===Nonclosure under intersection and complement===

The context-free languages are not closed under intersection.  This can be seen by taking the languages &lt;math&gt;A = \{a^m b^m c^n \mid m, n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \{a^m b^n c^n \mid m,n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which are both context-free.  Their intersection is &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be shown to be non-context-free by the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]].

Context-free languages are also not closed under complementation, as for any languages A and B:  &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \overline{\overline{A} \cup \overline{B}} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Decidability properties==

The following problems are [[Undecidable language|undecidable]] for arbitrary [[context-free grammar]]s A and B:
*Equivalence: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=L(B)&lt;/math&gt;?
*is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \cap L(B) = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; ? (However, the intersection of a context-free language and a ''regular'' language is context-free, so if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; were a regular language, this problem becomes decidable.)
*is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; ?
*is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \subseteq L(B)&lt;/math&gt; ?

The following problems are decidable for arbitrary context-free languages:
*is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; ?
*is &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; finite?
*Membership: given any word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, does &lt;math&gt;w \in L(A)&lt;/math&gt; ? (membership problem is even polynomially decidable - see [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Early Parser|Early's Algorithm]])

== Properties of context-free languages ==
* The reverse of a context-free language is context-free, but the complement need not be.
* Every [[regular language]] is context-free because it can be described by a [[regular grammar]]. 
* The intersection of a context-free language and a regular language is always context-free. 
* There exist [[context-sensitive language]]s which are not context-free.
* To prove that a given language is not context-free, one may employ the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]].

'''Caffeine'''&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled &quot;caffein&quot;. See {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Collins English Dictionary |title=caffeine or caffein |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/caffein |accessdate=2010-11-08 |edition=10th |year=2009 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a bitter, white crystalline [[xanthine]] [[alkaloid]] that is a [[psychoactive]] [[stimulant]]. Caffeine was isolated from [[coffee]] in 1820 by a German chemist, [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]], and in 1821 by French chemists working independently; namely, by [[Pierre Jean Robiquet|Robiquet]] and by [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier|Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou|Caventou]]. It was Pelletier, noting that the drug had been isolated from coffee ({{lang-fr|café}}), who coined the word &quot;cafeine&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier first used the word &quot;cafeine&quot; in print in {{cite book|title=Dictionnaire de Médecine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rFw_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=4|date=April 1822|publisher=Béchet Jeune|location=Paris|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the English word &quot;caffeine&quot;.

Caffeine is found in varying quantities in the [[seed]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[fruit]] of some plants, where it acts as a natural [[pesticide]] that [[paralyze]]s and kills certain [[insect]]s feeding on the plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;insecticide&quot; /&gt; It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the [[coffee bean|bean]] of the [[Coffea arabica|coffee plant]] and the leaves of the [[Camellia sinensis|tea bush]], as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the [[kola nut]]. Other sources include [[yerba maté]], [[guarana]] berries, and the [[yaupon holly]].

In humans, caffeine acts as a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) stimulant, temporarily warding off [[drowsiness]] and restoring [[alertness]]. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed [[psychoactive substance]],&lt;ref name=&quot;demon drink&quot; /&gt; but, unlike many other psychoactive substances, is legal and unregulated in nearly all jurisdictions.  Beverages containing caffeine, such as [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[soft drink]]s, and [[energy drink]]s, enjoy great popularity; in North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;demon drink&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last = Lovett|first = Richard|title = Coffee: The demon drink?|journal = New Scientist|issue = 2518|date = 24 September 2005|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725181.700|accessdate=2009-08-03}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) lists caffeine as a &quot;multiple purpose [[generally recognized as safe]] food substance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/aprqtr/21cfr182.1180.htm |title=21 CFR 182.1180 |accessdate=2009-08-03|date=2003-04-01 |work=U.S. [[Code of Federal Regulations]] |publisher=U.S. [[Office of the Federal Register]] |page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caffeine has [[diuretic]] properties when administered in sufficient doses to subjects who do not have a [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;diuretic&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maughan |first1=R.

==Health effects==
[[File:Effects of moderate caffeine consumption.svg|thumb|250px|Overview of effects of moderate caffeine consumption.&lt;ref&gt;References are found on [[Commons:File:Effects of moderate caffeine consumption.svg|image description page in Wikimedia Commons]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The precise amount of caffeine necessary to produce effects varies from person to person depending on body size and degree of tolerance to caffeine. It takes less than an hour for caffeine to begin affecting the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;effects&quot; /&gt; An oral dose of 200 mg caffeine appears to decrease [[reaction time]] by approximately 4 percent within 30 minutes, approximately 15 percent in 30 to 60 minutes and 18 percent in 60-90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1037/h0037225}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mild dose wears off in three to four hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;effects&quot; /&gt; Consumption of caffeine does not eliminate the need for sleep; it only temporarily reduces the sensation of being tired. Caffeine leads to fewer mistakes caused by tiredness in shift workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ker K, Edwards PJ, Felix LM, Blackhall K, Roberts I |title= Caffeine for the prevention of injuries and errors in shift workers |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=5 |pages= CD008508 |year=2010 |pmid= 20464765 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these effects, caffeine is an [[ergogenic aid|ergogenic]], increasing a person's capability for mental or physical labor. A study conducted in 1979 showed a 7% increase in distance cycled over a period of two hours in subjects that consumed caffeine compared to control subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ivy|first = JL|title = Influence of caffeine and carbohydrate feedings on endurance performance|journal = Med Sci Sports|volume = 11|issue = 1|pages = 6–11|year = 1979|pmid = 481158|last2 = Costill|first2 = DL|last3 = Fink|first3 = WJ|last4 = Lower|first4 = RW}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies attained much more dramatic results; one particular study of trained runners showed a 44% increase in &quot;race-pace&quot; endurance, as well as a 51% increase in cycling endurance, after a dosage of 9 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Graham|first = TE|title = Performance and metabolic responses to a high caffeine dose during prolonged exercise|journal = J Appl Physiol|volume = 71|issue = 6|pages = 2292–8|year = 1991|pmid = 1778925|last2 = Spriet|first2 = LL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies have reported similar effects.

Caffeine relaxes the [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal anal sphincter muscles]] and thus should be avoided by those with [[fecal incontinence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/fecalincontinence/ |title=Fecal incontinence|publisher=NIH|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While relatively safe for humans, caffeine is considerably more toxic to some other animals such as dogs, horses, and parrots{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} due to a much poorer ability to metabolize this compound. Caffeine also has a pronounced effect on mollusks and various insects as well as [[spider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Noever, R., J. Cronise, and R. A. Relwani. 1995. Using spider-web patterns to determine toxicity. NASA Tech Briefs 19(4):82. Published in [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14619750.500-spiders-on-speed-get-weaving.html New Scientist magazine, 29 April 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; (See also ''[[Effect of psychoactive drugs on animals]]''.)

Caffeine also increases the effectiveness of some drugs. Many over-the-counter headache drugs include caffeine in their formula. It is also used with [[ergotamine]] in the treatment of [[migraine]] and [[cluster headaches]] as well as to overcome the drowsiness caused by [[antihistamine]]s.

Caffeine may also have [[hepatoprotective]] properties. Studies have shown that increased caffeine consumption is associated with less severe [[liver]] injury among those at high risk for liver disease, such as those with [[alcoholism]], [[obesity]], or [[hemochromatosis]]. The mechanism by which this occurs is not known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/04/AR2005120400950.html Study Suggests Caffeine Can Help Liver].

===Tolerance and withdrawal===
Because caffeine is primarily an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the central nervous system's receptors for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[adenosine]], the bodies of individuals that regularly consume caffeine adapt to the continuous presence of the drug by substantially increasing the number of [[adenosine receptor]]s in the central nervous system. First, the stimulatory effects of caffeine are substantially reduced, a phenomenon known as a [[Drug tolerance|tolerance adaptation]]. Second, because these adaptive responses to caffeine make individuals much more sensitive to adenosine, a reduction in caffeine intake will effectively increase the normal physiological effects of adenosine, resulting in unwelcome withdrawal symptoms in tolerant users.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID 3003150&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=R M |last2=Stiles |first2=G L |title=Chronic caffeine ingestion sensitizes the A1 adenosine receptor-adenylate cyclase system in rat cerebral cortex. |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=222–7 |year=1986 |pmid=3003150 |pmc=423330 |doi=10.1172/JCI112280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research questions the idea that up-regulation of adenosine receptors is responsible for tolerance to the locomotor stimulant effects of caffeine, noting, among other things, that this tolerance is insurmountable by higher doses of caffeine (it should be surmountable if tolerance were due to an increase in receptors), and that the increase in adenosine receptor number is modest and does not explain the large tolerance that develops to caffeine.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1846425&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holtzman SG, Mante S, Minneman KP |title=Role of adenosine receptors in caffeine tolerance |journal=J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. |volume=256 |issue=1 |pages=62–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1846425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caffeine tolerance develops very quickly, especially among heavy coffee and energy drink consumers. Complete tolerance to the sleep disruption effects of caffeine develops after consuming 400 mg of caffeine 3 times a day for 7 days. Complete tolerance to subjective effects of caffeine was observed to develop after consuming 300 mg 3 times per day for 18 days, and possibly even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acnp.org/G4/GN401000165/CH161.html|accessdate=2009-08-03|title= Caffeine – A Drug of Abuse?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another experiment, complete tolerance of caffeine was observed when the subject consumed 750–1200 mg per day while incomplete tolerance to caffeine has been observed in those that consume more average doses of caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caffeinedependence.org/caffeine_dependence.html|accessdate=2009-08-03|title= Information About Caffeine Dependence}}&lt;/ref&gt; In everyday terms, the typical caffeine content of a single cup or mug of tea or coffee is well below the 300 - 400 mg level: an average mug of instant coffee contains approximately 100mg caffeine, the same level as a cup of brewed coffee. An average mug of tea contains 75mg of caffeine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcoffeeassociation.org/page_health_m_167.aspx|accessdate=2011-05-13|title= How much caffeine is in your cup?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because adenosine, in part, serves to regulate blood pressure by causing [[vasodilation]], the increased effects of adenosine due to caffeine withdrawal cause the blood vessels of the head to dilate, leading to an excess of blood in the head and causing a [[headache]] and [[nausea]]. This means caffeine has [[vasoconstriction]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002338.htm|title=Vasoconstriction|date=2009-02-23|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced [[catecholamine]] activity may cause feelings of [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and drowsiness. A reduction in [[serotonin]] levels when caffeine use is stopped can cause anxiety, irritability, inability to concentrate, and diminished motivation to initiate or to complete daily tasks; in extreme cases it may cause mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Together, these effects have come to be known as a &quot;crash&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthandgoodness.com/health/stimulants_risks.html|accessdate=2009-08-03|title= Health risks of Stimulants, healthandgoodness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Withdrawal]] symptoms—possibly including headache, irritability, an inability to concentrate, drowsiness, insomnia and pain in the stomach, upper body, and joints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Juliano |first1=Laura M. |last2=Griffiths |first2=Roland R. |title=A critical review of caffeine withdrawal: empirical validation of symptoms and signs, incidence, severity, and associated features |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=1–29 |year=2004 |pmid=15448977 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-2000-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;—may appear within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of caffeine intake, peak at roughly 48 hours, and usually last from one to five days, representing the time required for the number of adenosine receptors in the brain to revert to &quot;normal&quot; levels, uninfluenced by caffeine consumption. [[Analgesic]]s, such as [[aspirin]], may relieve the pain symptoms, as may a small dose of caffeine.

===Overuse===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Controlled Substances Act]] --&gt;
In large amounts, and especially over extended periods of time, caffeine can lead to a condition known as ''caffeinism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Mackay|first = DC|title = Caffeine and caffeinism|journal = Journal of the Royal Naval Medical Service|volume = 75|issue = 2|pages = 65–7 |year=1989|pmid = 2607498|last2 = Rollins|first2 = JW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BJoA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=Jack E. |last2=Stirling |first2=Keryn P. |title=Caffeine: A Survey of Some of the Known and Suspected Deleterious Effects of Habitual Use |journal=Addiction |volume=78 |pages=251–8 |year=1983 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1983.tb02509.x |pmid=6354232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caffeinism usually combines caffeine [[Substance dependence|dependency]] with a wide range of unpleasant physical and mental conditions including [[anxiety|nervousness]], [[irritability]], [[anxiety]], [[Tremor|tremulousness]], [[muscle twitching]] ([[hyperreflexia]]), [[insomnia]], [[headaches]], [[respiratory alkalosis]], and [[heart palpitation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;COAM&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leson |first1=CL |last2=McGuigan |first2=MA |last3=Bryson |first3=SM |title=Caffeine overdose in an adolescent male. |journal=Journal of toxicology.

There are four caffeine-induced psychiatric disorders recognized by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition'': caffeine intoxication, caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, [[caffeine-induced sleep disorder]], and caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified (NOS).

====Caffeine intoxication====
[[File:Main symptoms of Caffeine overdose.png|right|300px|Main symptoms of caffeine intoxication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline&quot; /&gt;|alt=Torso of a young man with overlayed text of main side-effects of caffeine overdose.]]

Caffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called ''caffeine intoxication'' ([[DSM-IV]] 305.90),&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th |publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]]|year = 1994|isbn=0-89042-062-9|author = American Psychiatric Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or colloquially the &quot;caffeine jitters&quot;. The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are not unlike overdoses of other [[stimulants]]. It may include restlessness, [[Fidgeting|fidgetiness]], [[nervousness]], excitement, [[euphoria]], insomnia, flushing of the face, [[diuresis|increased urination]], [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] disturbance, [[fasciculation|muscle twitching]], a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, [[cardiac arrhythmia|irregular]] or [[tachycardia|rapid heart beat]], and [[psychomotor agitation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EofMD&quot; /&gt; In cases of much larger overdoses, [[mania]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], lapses in judgment, [[disorientation]], [[disinhibition]], [[delusions]], [[hallucinations]], and [[psychosis]] may occur, and [[rhabdomyolysis]] (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Caffeine overdose|publisher = MedlinePlus|date = 2006-04-04|url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002579.htm|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verkhratsky |first1=A. |title=Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Calcium Store in the Endoplasmic Reticulum of Neurons |journal=Physiological Reviews |volume=85 |pages=381–3 |year=2005 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00004.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme overdose can result in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Man Dies From Caffeine Overdose |agency= Quebecor Media Inc |date=October 30, 2010 |work=Toronto Sun |url= http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/10/30/15889811.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) given orally, is 192 milligrams per kilogram in rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;ld50&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title = Factors Affecting Caffeine Toxicity: A Review of the Literature|last=Peters| first=Josef M.|journal = The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and the Journal of New Drugs|year= 1967|issue=7|pages=131–141 |url = http://jcp.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/7/3/131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of caffeine in humans is dependent on weight and individual sensitivity and estimated to be about 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body mass, roughly 80 to 100 cups of coffee for an average adult taken within a limited time frame that is dependent on [[Biological halflife|half-life]]. Though achieving lethal dose with caffeine would be exceptionally difficult with regular coffee, there have been reported deaths from overdosing on caffeine pills, with serious symptoms of overdose requiring hospitalization occurring from as little as 2 grams of caffeine. An exception to this would be taking a drug such as [[fluvoxamine]] or [[levofloxacin]], which block the liver enzyme responsible for the metabolism of caffeine, thus increasing the central effects and blood concentrations of caffeine dramatically at 5-fold. It is not contraindicated, but highly advisable to minimize the intake of caffeinated beverages, as drinking one cup of coffee will have the same effect as drinking five under normal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kerrigan |first1 = S |last2 = Lindsey |first2 = T |title = Fatal caffeine overdose: Two case reports |journal = Forensic Science International |volume = 153 |issue = 1 |pages = 67–69 |year = 2005 |pmid = 15935584 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmgren |first1=P |last2=Nordén-Pettersson |first2=L |last3=Ahlner |first3=J |title=Caffeine fatalities—four case reports |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=71–3 |year=2004 |pmid=14687776 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2003.09.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verkhratsky |first1=A. |title=Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Calcium Store in the Endoplasmic Reticulum of Neurons |journal=Physiological Reviews |volume=85 |pages=244–9 |year=2005 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00004.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verkhratsky |first1=A. |title=Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Calcium Store in the Endoplasmic Reticulum of Neurons |journal=Physiological Reviews |volume=85 |pages=571–2 |year=2005 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00004.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death typically occurs due to [[ventricular fibrillation]] brought about by effects of caffeine on the [[cardiovascular system]].

Treatment of severe caffeine intoxication is generally supportive, providing treatment of the immediate symptoms, but if the patient has very high serum levels of caffeine then [[peritoneal dialysis]], [[hemodialysis]], or [[hemofiltration]] may be required.

====Detection in biological fluids====
Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10 mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36 mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15 mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=8th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, CA |year=2008 |pages=214–7 |isbn=0-931890-08-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anxiety and sleep disorders====
Two infrequently diagnosed caffeine-induced disorders that are recognized by the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) are ''caffeine-induced sleep disorder'' and ''caffeine-induced anxiety disorder'', which can result from long-term excessive caffeine intake.

In the case of [[caffeine-induced sleep disorder]], an individual regularly ingests high doses of caffeine sufficient to induce a significant disturbance in his or her sleep, sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV&quot; /&gt;

In some individuals, large amounts of caffeine can induce [[anxiety]] severe enough to necessitate clinical attention. This caffeine-induced [[anxiety disorder]] can take many forms, from [[general anxiety disorder|generalized anxiety]] to [[panic attack]]s, [[obsessive-compulsive]] symptoms, or even [[Phobia|phobic symptoms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV&quot; /&gt; Because this condition can mimic organic mental disorders, such as [[panic disorder]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[akathisia]], or even [[schizophrenia]], a number of medical professionals believe caffeine-intoxicated people are routinely misdiagnosed and unnecessarily medicated when the treatment for caffeine-induced psychosis would simply be to stop further caffeine intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Shannon|first = MW|coauthors = Haddad LM, Winchester JF|title = Clinical Management of Poisoning and Drug Overdose |edition=3rd |year = 1998|isbn=0-7216-6409-1|publisher = Saunders|location = Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in the ''British Journal of Addiction'' concluded that caffeinism, although infrequently diagnosed, may afflict as many as one person in ten of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;BJoA&quot; /&gt;

===Memory and learning===
[[File:Caffeine.JPG|thumb|[[Anhydrous]] (waterless) caffeine ([[Spain|SP]])|alt=Photo of a capped chemical bottle on a table.]]
{{main|Effect of caffeine on memory}}

Researchers have found that long-term consumption of low dose caffeine slowed [[hippocampus]]-dependent learning and impaired long-term memory in mice. Caffeine consumption for 4 weeks also significantly reduced hippocampal [[neurogenesis]] compared to controls during the experiment. The conclusion was that long-term consumption of caffeine could inhibit hippocampus-dependent learning and memory partially through inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Han |first1=M |last2=Park |first2=K |last3=Baek |first3=S |last4=Kim |first4=B |last5=Kim |first5=J |last6=Kim |first6=H |last7=Oh |first7=S |title=Inhibitory effects of caffeine on hippocampal neurogenesis and function |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=356 |issue=4 |pages=976–80 |year=2007 |pmid=17400186 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.03.086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, caffeine was added to rat neurons ''[[in vitro]]''. The [[dendritic spine]]s (a part of the brain cell used in forming connections between neurons) taken from the [[hippocampus]] (a part of the brain associated with memory) grew by 33% and new spines formed. After an hour or two, however, these cells returned to their original shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/472473.stm|title=Caffeine clue to better memory |date=1999-10-12|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study showed that human subjects—after receiving 100 milligrams of caffeine—had increased activity in brain regions located in the frontal lobe, where a part of the working memory network is located, and the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], a part of the brain that controls attention. The caffeinated subjects also performed better on the memory tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Caffeine-Boosts-Short-Time-Memory-13828.shtml|title=Caffeine Boosts Short-Time Memory|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a different study showed that caffeine could impair short-term memory and increase the likelihood of the [[tip of the tongue]] phenomenon. The study allowed the researchers to suggest that caffeine could aid short-term memory when the information to be recalled is related to the current [[train of thought]], but also to hypothesize that caffeine hinders short-term memory when the train of thought is unrelated.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOT-Lesk_Womble&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lesk |first1=Valerie E. |last2=Womble |first2=Stephen P. |title=Caffeine, Priming, and Tip of the Tongue: Evidence for Plasticity in the Phonological System. |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=118 |pages=453–6 |year=2004 |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.118.3.453 |pmid=15174922}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, caffeine consumption increases mental performance related to focused thought while it may decrease broad-range thinking abilities.

===Cardiovascular===
Caffeine binds to Beta-adrenergic receptors on the surface of heart muscle cells, which leads to an increase in the level of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] inside the cells (by blocking the enzyme that degrades cAMP), mimicking the effects of [[epinephrine]] (which binds to receptors on the cell that activate cAMP production). cAMP acts as a &quot;second messenger,&quot; and activates a large number of protein kinase A (PKA; [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]]). This has the overall effect of increasing the rate of [[glycolysis]] and increases the amount of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] available for muscle contraction and relaxation. According to one study, caffeine in the form of coffee significantly reduces the risk of [[heart disease]] in epidemiological studies. However, the protective effect was found only in participants who were not severely [[hypertensive]] (i.e., patients that are not suffering from a very high blood pressure). Furthermore, no significant protective effect was found in participants aged less than 65 years or in [[cerebrovascular disease]] mortality for those aged equal or more than 65 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Greenberg|first = J.A.|year = 2007|title = Caffeinated beverage intake and the risk of heart disease mortality in the elderly: a prospective analysis|journal = Am J Clin Nutr|volume = 85|issue = 2|pages = 392–8|pmid = 17284734|last2 = Dunbar|first2 = CC|last3 = Schnoll|first3 = R|last4 = Kokolis|first4 = R|last5 = Kokolis|first5 = S|last6 = Kassotis|first6 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that drinking caffeinated coffee can cause a temporary increase in the stiffening of arterial walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;coffee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=A|last2=Feely|first2=J|title=Acute effect of caffeine on arterial stiffness and aortic pressure waveform.|journal=Hypertension|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–31|year=2001|pmid=11509481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In children===
It is a common myth that excessive intake of caffeine results in stunted growth within children, particularly younger children and teenagers—recently, scientific studies have disproved the notion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Fact or fiction: Common diet myths dispelled|publisher = MSNBC|month = December|year = 2006|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16280050|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are found to experience the same effects from caffeine as adults.

However, subsidiary beverages that contain caffeine, such as [[energy drink]]s, most of which contain high amounts of caffeine, have been banned in many schools throughout the world, due to other adverse effects having been observed in prolonged consumption of caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Caffeine and Your Child|publisher = KidsHealth|month = January|year = 2005|url = http://www.kidshealth.org/parent/food/general/caffeine.html|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, caffeinated [[cola]] has been linked to hyperactivity in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Caffeinated Cola Makes Kids Hyperactive|publisher = WebMD|month = May|year = 2005|url = http://children.webmd.com/news/20050523/caffeinated-cola-make-kids-hyperactive|accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During pregnancy===
A 2008 study suggested that 200 milligrams or more of caffeine per day &quot;significantly increases the risk of miscarriage&quot; for pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ckp.kp.org/newsroom/national/archive/nat_080121_caffeine.html|accessdate=2009-08-03|title= Kaiser Permanente Study Shows Newer, Stronger Evidence that Caffeine During Pregnancy Increases Miscarriage Risk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another 2008 study found no correlation between miscarriage and caffeine consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;PregDiffOutcomes&quot;&gt;[[David A. Savitz]], as reported in: {{cite web|last = Rubin|first = Rita|title = New studies, different outcomes on caffeine, pregnancy|work = USA TODAY|date = 2008-01-20|url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-01-20-caffeine_N.htm|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK [[Food Standards Agency]] has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake to less than 200 mg of caffeine a day—the equivalent of two cups of instant coffee, or one and a half to two cups of fresh coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/nov/caffeineadvice|accessdate=2009-08-03|title= Food Standards Agency publishes new caffeine advice for pregnant women}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/01/21/hfh.caffeine.miscarriage/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Study: Caffeine may boost miscarriage risk|author=Danielle Dellorto|date=January 21, 2008|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSA noted that the design of the studies made it impossible to be certain that the differences were due to caffeine per se, instead of other lifestyle differences possibly associated with high levels of caffeine consumption, but judged the advice to be prudent.

===Athletic performance===
Elite distant runners who consumed 10 mg of caffeine per kg of body mass immediately before treadmill run to exhaustion improved performance time compared to placebo and control conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McArdle|first=William|title=Physiology. 7th edition|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=97807818797818|pages=557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Kovacs and associates evaluated the effects of different dosages of caffeine (2.1, 3.2 and 4.5 milligrams per kilogram of body mass) added to a 7% carbohydrate electrolyte drink on performance during a one hour cycling time trial. All three caffeine doses improved performance compared with the carbohydrate electrolyte drink alone. The results also demonstrated that ingestion of 2.1, 3.2 and 4.5 mg/kg of caffeine produced the same level of performance enhancement. This study suggests that once the threshold dose of caffeine was reached, there was no further performance benefit from a higher amount of caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kovacs|first=Eva|coauthors=Stegen JHCH, Brouns F|title=Effect of caffeinated drinks on substrate metabolism, caffeine excretion, and performance.|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|year=1998|volume=85|pages=709–715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two potential mechanisms have been proposed for the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine. 1)In the classic, or 'metabolic' theory, caffeine may increase fat utilization and decrease glycogen utilization. Caffeine mobilizes free fatty acids from adipose and/or intramuscular triglycerides by increasing circulating epinephrine levels. The increased availability of free fatty acids increases fat oxidation and spares muscle glycogen, thereby enhancing endurance performance. 2)As a central nervous system stimulant, caffeine increases alertness and decreases the perception of effort during exercise. Caffeine may reduce the perception of effort by lowering the neuron activation threshold, making it easier to recruit the muscles for exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McArdle|first=William|title=Exercise Physiology. 7th edition|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=9780781797818|pages=559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise recovery===
A 2008 study at [[RMIT University]] in Bundoora, Australia and published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found a correlation between caffeine ingestion and the rate at which the body replenishes its muscle glycogen stores. The ingestion of caffeine along with carbohydrates after an exhaustive workout resulted in a 60% increase in the body's storage of muscle glycogen when compared to participants who did not ingest the caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1152/japplphysiol.01121.2007}}

===Genetics and caffeine metabolism===
A 2006 study by Dr. Ahmed El-Sohemy at the University of Toronto discovered a link between a gene affecting caffeine metabolism and the effects of coffee on health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheart.org/article/659871.do |accessdate=2009-08-03|title=Heavy coffee drinkers with slow caffeine metabolism at increased risk of nonfatal MI|date= March 7, 2006|author= Michael O'Riordan|publisher=theheart.org by WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some people metabolize caffeine more slowly than the general population due to variations in a specific [[cytochrome P450]] gene,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16522833&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cornelis |first1=M. C. |title=Coffee, CYP1A2 Genotype, and Risk of Myocardial Infarction |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=295 |pages=1135–41 |year=2006 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.10.1135 |pmid=16522833}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence people with this gene may be at a higher risk of [[myocardial infarction]] when consuming large amounts of coffee. For rapid metabolizers, however, coffee seemed to have a preventative effect. Slow and fast metabolizers are comparably common in the general population, and this has been blamed for the wide variation in studies of the health effects of caffeine.

===Genetics and caffeine intake===
A 2011 analysis published by ''[[Public Library of Science|PLoS]] Genetics'' reviewed 5 studies covering more than 47,000 subjects of European descent. Researchers determined that habitual caffeine intake is associated with variations in 2 genes that regulate how quickly the body processes caffeine. Subjects who had a high-intake mutation of either gene on both chromosomes consumed 40 mg more caffeine per day (equivalent to a can of soda) than people who did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Greg Gibson, Marilyn C.

===Intraocular pressure===
Recent data has suggested that caffeine consumption can raise [[intraocular pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Higginbotham EJ, Kilimanjaro HA, Wilensky JT, Batenhorst RL, Hermann D |title=The effect of caffeine on intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=624–6 |year=1989 |pmid=2636858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a significant consideration for those with [[open angle glaucoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Avisar |first1=Rahamim |last2=Avisar |first2=Erez |last3=Weinberger |first3=Dov |title=Effect of Coffee Consumption on Intraocular Pressure |journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=992–5 |year=2002 |pmid=12022898 |doi=10.1345/aph.1A279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[File:Roasted coffee beans.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Roasted [[coffee]] beans, a common source of caffeine|alt=Closeup photo of brownbeans]]
Caffeine is found in many [[plant]] species, where it acts as a natural [[pesticide]], with high caffeine levels being observed in seedlings still developing foliage, but are lacking mechanical protection;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frischknecht |first1=Peter M. |last2=Ulmer-Dufek |first2=Jindra |last3=Baumann |first3=Thomas W. |title=Purine alkaloid formation in buds and developing leaflets of Coffea arabica: Expression of an optimal defence strategy? |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=25 |pages=613–6 |year=1986 |doi=10.1016/0031-9422(86)88009-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caffeine [[Paralysis|paralyzes]] and kills certain [[insect]]s feeding upon the plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;insecticide&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nathanson |first1=J. |title=Caffeine and related methylxanthines: possible naturally occurring pesticides |journal=Science |volume=226 |issue=4671 |pages=184–7 |year=1984 |pmid=6207592 |doi=10.1126/science.6207592}}&lt;/ref&gt; High caffeine levels have also been found in the surrounding soil of coffee bean seedlings. Therefore, caffeine is understood to have a natural function as both a natural pesticide and an inhibitor of seed germination of other nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving it a better chance of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Baumann|first = T. W.|title = Metabolism and excretion of caffeine during germination of Coffea arabica L|journal = Plant and Cell Physiology|volume = 25|issue = 8|pages = 1431–6|year = 1984 |url=http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/8/1431.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common sources of caffeine are coffee, tea, and (to a lesser extent) chocolate derived from [[cocoa bean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Matissek|first = R|title = Evaluation of xanthine derivatives in chocolate: nutritional and chemical aspects|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2861730|journal = European Food Research and Technology|volume = 205|issue = 3|pages = 175–84|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly used sources of caffeine include the [[yerba maté]] and [[guarana]] plants,{{verify credibility|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mateine&quot;&gt;{{verify credibility|date=December 2010}}{{cite web|title = Does Yerba Maté Contain Caffeine or Mateine?|publisher = [[Erowid|The Vaults of Erowid]]|month = December|year = 2003|url = http://www.erowid.org/plants/yerba_mate/yerba_mate_chemistry1.shtml|accessdate = 2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are sometimes used in the preparation of teas and energy drinks. Two of caffeine's alternative names, ''mateine'' and ''guaranine'', are derived from the names of these plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = PubChem: mateina|publisher = National Library of Medicine|url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pccompound&amp;term=mateina|accessdate = 2009-08-03}}.

A., Harbowy M. E. and Graham H. N.|title = Tea: the Plant and its Manufacture; Chemistry and Consumption of the Beverage|journal = Caffeine|year = 1998|editor = G Spiller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the world's primary sources of caffeine is the coffee &quot;bean&quot; (which is the seed of the [[Coffea|coffee plant]]), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of [[coffee bean]] and the method of preparation used;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Caffeine|publisher=International Coffee Organization|url=http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80–100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety [[espresso]], to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of [[drip coffee]]. In general, dark-roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces a small amount of the bean's caffeine content.&lt;ref name=&quot;caffaq_roast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Coffee and Caffeine FAQ: Does dark roast coffee have less caffeine than light roast?|url=http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jeremiahspick&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Coffee: Caffeine Level|publisher=Jeremiah’s Pick Coffee Co|url=http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coffea arabica|''Arabica'']] coffee normally contains significantly (+/-50%) less caffeine than the [[Coffea canephora|''robusta'']] variety.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICO&quot; /&gt; Coffee also contains trace amounts of theophylline, but no theobromine.

Tea is another common source of caffeine. Although tea contains more caffeine than coffee (by dry weight), a typical serving contains much less, as tea is normally brewed much weaker. Besides strength of the brew, growing conditions, processing techniques and other variables also affect caffeine content. Certain types of tea may contain somewhat more caffeine than other teas. Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content.{{verify credibility|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caffeine in tea vs. steeping time|month=September|year=1996|url=http://www.nobleharbor.com/tea/caffiene.html|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teas like the pale Japanese [[green tea]], ''[[gyokuro]]'', for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like ''[[lapsang souchong]]'', which has very little.

Caffeine is also a common ingredient of [[soft drink]]s, such as [[cola]], originally prepared from [[kola nut]]s. Soft drinks typically contain about 10 to 50 milligrams of caffeine per serving. By contrast, [[energy drink]]s, such as [[Red Bull]], can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of [[decaffeination]] or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring [[slow-release]] [[excipient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haskell |first1=C.

[[Chocolate]] derived from cocoa beans contains a small amount of caffeine. The weak stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smit |first1=Hendrik J. |last2=Gaffan |first2=Elizabeth A. |last3=Rogers |first3=Peter J. |title=Methylxanthines are the psycho-pharmacologically active constituents of chocolate |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=176 |issue=3–4 |pages=412–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15549276 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-1898-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical 28-gram serving of a milk [[chocolate bar]] has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee, although some dark chocolate currently in production contains as much as 160 mg per 100g.

Various manufacturers market caffeine tablets, claiming that using caffeine of pharmaceutical quality improves mental alertness. These effects have been borne out by research that shows caffeine use (whether in tablet form or not) results in decreased fatigue and increased attentiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;effects&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last = Bolton |first = Sanford|title = Caffeine: Psychological Effects, Use and Abuse|journal = Orthomolecular Psychiatry|volume = 10|issue = 3|pages = 202–211|year = 1981 |url=http://intraspec.ca/1981-v10n03-p202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tablets are commonly used by students studying for their exams and by people who work or drive for long hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&amp;pg=PA195|page=195|title=The world of caffeine|author=Bennett Alan Weinberg, Bonnie K.

Humans have consumed caffeine since the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Escohotado|first = Antonio|coauthors = Ken Symington|title = A Brief History of Drugs: From the Stone Age to the Stoned Age|publisher = Park Street Press|year = 1999|isbn=0-89281-826-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early peoples found chewing the seeds, bark, or leaves of certain plants had the effects of easing fatigue, stimulating awareness, and elevating one's mood. Only much later was it found that the effect of caffeine was increased by steeping such plants in hot water. Many cultures have legends that attribute the discovery of such plants to people living many thousands of years ago.

According to one popular Chinese legend, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] [[Shennong]], reputed to have reigned in about 3000 BCE, accidentally discovered that when some leaves fell into boiling water, a fragrant and restorative [[caffeinated drink|drink]] resulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others= Michal Synek (translator) |year= 1998 |title= Všechny čaje Číny |location= Prague |publisher= DharmaGaia Praha |isbn= 80-85905-48-5 |language= Czech |pages= 19–20}} Translation of {{cite book |year= 1990 |title= All the Tea in China |place= San Francisco |publisher= China Books &amp; Periodicals Inc |isbn= 0-8351-2194-1 |author= Kit Chow, Ione Kramer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 1998 |title= Vůně čaje |trans_title= Smell of Tea |location= Benešov| publisher= Start |isbn= 80-902005-9-1 |language= Czech |page= 9 |author= Jana Arcimovičová, Pavel Valíček}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= John C.

The history of coffee has been recorded as far back as the ninth century. During that time, coffee beans were available only in their native habitat, [[Ethiopia]]. A popular legend traces its discovery to a [[goatherder]] named [[Kaldi]], who apparently observed goats became elated and sleepless at night after grazing on coffee shrubs and, upon trying the berries the goats had been eating, experienced the same vitality. The earliest literary mention of coffee may be a reference to Bunchum in the works of the 9th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[al-Razi]]. In 1587, [[Malaye Jaziri]] compiled a work tracing the history and legal controversies of coffee, entitled ''ʕUmdat aṣ-Ṣafwa Fī Ḥill al-Qahwah''. In this work, Jaziri recorded that one [[Sheikh]], Jamal-al-Din al-Dhabhani, [[mufti]] of [[Aden]], was the first to adopt the use of coffee in 1454, and in the 15th century, the [[sufism|Sufis]] of [[Yemen]] routinely used coffee to stay awake during prayers.

Towards the close of the 16th century, the use of coffee was recorded by a [[Europe]]an resident in [[Egypt]], and about this time it came into general use in the [[Near East]]. The appreciation of coffee as a beverage in Europe, where it was first known as &quot;Arabian wine&quot;, dates from the 17th century. A legend states that, after the Ottoman Turks retreated from the walls of Vienna after losing a battle for the city, many sacks of coffee beans were found among their baggage. Europeans did not know what to do with all the coffee beans, being unfamiliar with them. So Franz George Kolschitzky, a Pole who had actually worked for the Turks, offered to take them. He subsequently taught the Viennese how to make coffee, and the first coffee house in the Western world was opened in Vienna, thus starting a long tradition of coffee appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= All About Coffee |last= Ukers |first= W.H. |location= New York |publisher= The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal Company |year= 1922 |page= 40 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=Y5tXt7aoLNoC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=siege+of+vienna+and+coffee+beans&amp;q=siege%20of%20vienna%20and%20coffee%20beans| isbn= 0-8103-4092-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the first coffee houses were opened in [[London]] in 1652, at St Michael's Alley, [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]]. They soon became popular throughout [[Western Europe]], and played a significant role in [[social relation]]s in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Coffee|encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica|year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the [[kola nut]], like the coffee berry and tea leaf, appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many [[West Africa]]n cultures, individually or in a social setting, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs. In 1911, kola became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares, when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of [[Coca-Cola]] syrup in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]], alleging the caffeine in its drink was &quot;injurious to health&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benjamin |first1=Ludy T. |last2=Rogers |first2=Anne M. |last3=Rosenbaum |first3=Angela |title=Coca-Cola, caffeine, and mental deficiency: Harry Hollingworth and the Chattanooga trial of 1911 |journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=42–55 |year=1991 |pmid=2010614 |doi=10.1002/1520-6696(199101)27:1&lt;42::AID-JHBS2300270105&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13, 1911, the government initiated ''[[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'', hoping to force Coca-Cola to remove caffeine from its formula by making claims the product was adulterated and misbranded. The allegation of adulteration was, in substance, that the product contained an added poisonous or added deleterious ingredient: caffeine, which might render the product injurious to health. It was alleged to be misbranded in that the name 'Coca Cola' was a representation of the presence of the substances coca and cola; that the product 'contained no coca and little if any cola' and thus was an 'imitation' of these substances and was offered for sale under their 'distinctive name.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=U.S. v.

The earliest evidence of cocoa bean use comes from residue found in an [[Maya civilization|ancient Mayan]] pot dated to 600 BCE. In the New World, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called ''xocolatl'', often seasoned with [[vanilla]], [[chile pepper]], and [[achiote]]. ''Xocolatl'' was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], and cocoa beans were often used as currency.

''Xocolatl'' was introduced to [[Europe]] by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the [[Theobroma cacao|cacao tree]] into the [[West Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. It was used in [[alchemy|alchemical]] processes, where it was known as &quot;black bean&quot;.

The leaves and stems of the yaupon holly (''[[Ilex vomitoria]]'') were used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to brew a [[tea]] called ''asi'' or the &quot;[[black drink]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Charles M. Hudson (author)|Hudson, Charles M.]]|title =Black Drink| publisher = University of Georgia Press|year =1979|page = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have found evidence of this use stretch back far into antiquity, possibly dating to [[Archaic period in the Americas|Late Archaic times]].

Berzelius states on page 180: &quot;Cafein is eine Materie im Kaffee, die zu gleicher Zeit, 1821, von Robiquet und [von] Pelletier und Caventou entdekt wurde, von denen aber keine etwas darüber im Drucke bekannt machte.&quot; (Caffeine is a substance in coffee, which simultaneously, in 1821, was discovered by Robiquet and by Pelletier and Caventou, by whom however nothing was made known about it in print.)

Pelletier's elemental analysis of caffeine appears on [http://books.google.com/books?id=-BIAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 182–183] of the article: Dumas and Pelletier (1823) &quot;Recherches sur la composition élémentaire et sur quelques propriétés caractéristiques des bases salifiables organiques&quot; (Studies into the elemental composition and some characteristic properties of organic bases), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', vol. 24, pages 163–191.

Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iGs1AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=P270&amp;lpg=P270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=7|year=1828|language=German|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Es darf indessen hierbei nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass Runge (in seinen ''phytochemischen Entdeckungen'' 1820, p.146-7.) dieselben Methode angegeben, und das Caffein unter dem Namen ''Caffeebase'' ein Jahr eher beschrieben hat, als Robiquet, dem die Entdeckung dieser Substanz gewöhnlich zugeschrieben wird, in einer Zussamenkunft der Societé de Pharmacie in Paris die erste mündliche Mittheilung darüber gab.&quot; (However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his ''Phytochemical Discoveries'', 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name ''Caffeebase'' a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris.)

Caffeine and other methylxanthine derivatives are also used on newborns to treat [[apnea]] and correct irregular heartbeats.

Caffeine is metabolized in the [[liver]] by the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]] enzyme system (to be specific, the [[CYP1A2|1A2]] isozyme) into three [[metabolism|metabolic]] [[xanthine|dimethylxanthines]],&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Paraxanthine]] (84%): Has the effect of increasing [[lipolysis]], leading to elevated [[glycerol]] and free [[fatty acid]] levels in the [[blood plasma]].
* [[Theobromine]] (12%): Dilates [[blood vessel]]s and increases [[urine]] volume. Theobromine is also the principal alkaloid in the [[cocoa bean]], and therefore [[chocolate]].
* [[Theophylline]] (4%): Relaxes [[smooth muscle]]s of the [[bronchus|bronchi]], and is used to treat [[asthma]]. The therapeutic dose of theophylline, however, is many times greater than the levels attained from caffeine metabolism.

Each of these metabolites is further metabolized and then excreted in the urine.

Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP1A2, thereby reducing clearance, and thus increasing blood levels of [[tizanidine]] and [[methylxanthines]] (e.g.caffeine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harder S, Fuhr U, Staib AH, Wolff T |title=Ciprofloxacin-caffeine: a drug interaction established using in vivo and in vitro investigations |journal=Am.

[[File:Caffeine and adenosine.svg|thumb|left|250px|Caffeine's primary mechanism of action is as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine]] receptors in the brain|alt=Two skeletal formulas: left – caffeine, right – adenosine.]]

Caffeine readily crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine receptor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fisone |first1=G. |last2=Borgkvist |first2=A. |last3=Usiello |first3=A. |title=Caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences (CMLS) |volume=61 |pages=857–72 |year=2004 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3269-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AR-Daly&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Daly |first1=JW |last2=Jacobson |first2=KA |last3=Ukena |first3=D |title=Adenosine receptors: development of selective agonists and antagonists. |journal=Progress in clinical and biological research |volume=230 |pages=41–63 |year=1987 |pmid=3588607}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to the aglycone of [[adenosine]], [[adenine]], and is capable of binding the adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them (an &quot;antagonist&quot; mechanism of action), thereby acting as a [[competitive inhibitor]].

Adenosine is found in every part of the body, because it plays a role in the fundamental [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-related energy metabolism and is necessary for [[RNA synthesis]], but it has special functions in the brain. There is a great deal of evidence that concentrations of brain adenosine are increased by various types of metabolic stress including [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] and [[ischemia]]. The evidence also indicates that brain adenosine acts to protect the brain by suppressing neural activity and also by increasing blood flow through A2A and A2B receptors located on vascular smooth muscle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latini&quot; /&gt; By counteracting adenosine, caffeine reduces resting cerebral blood flow between 22% and 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Addicott |first1=Merideth A. |last2=Yang |first2=Lucie L. |last3=Peiffer |first3=Ann M. |last4=Burnett |first4=Luke R. |last5=Burdette |first5=Jonathan H. |last6=Chen |first6=Michael Y. |last7=Hayasaka |first7=Satoru |last8=Kraft |first8=Robert A. |last9=Maldjian |first9=Joseph A. |title=The effect of daily caffeine use on cerebral blood flow: How much caffeine can we tolerate? |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=3102–14 |year=2009 |pmid=19219847 |pmc=2748160 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caffeine also has a generally disinhibitory effect on neural activity. It has not been shown, however, how these effects cause increases in arousal and alertness.

Adenosine is released in the brain through a complex mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latini&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Latini |first1=Serena |last2=Pedata |first2=Felicita |title=Adenosine in the central nervous system: release mechanisms and extracellular concentrations |journal=Journal of Neurochemistry |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=463–84 |year=2008 |pmid=11701750 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00607.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that adenosine functions as a synaptically released neurotransmitter in some cases, but stress-related adenosine increases appear to be produced mainly by extracellular metabolism of ATP. It is not likely that adenosine is the primary neurotransmitter for any group of neurons, but rather that it is released together with other transmitters by a number of neuron types. Unlike most neurotransmitters, adenosine does not seem to be packaged into vesicles that are released in a voltage-controlled manner, but the possibility of such a mechanism has not been completely ruled out.

Several classes of adenosine receptors have been described, with different anatomical distributions. A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are widely distributed, and act to inhibit calcium uptake. A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are heavily concentrated in the basal ganglia, an area that plays a critical role in behavior control, but can be found in other parts of the brain as well, in lower densities. There is evidence that A &lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors interact with the [[dopamine]] system, which is involved in reward and arousal. (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors can also be found on arterial walls and blood cell membranes.)

Beyond its general neuroprotective effects, there are reasons to believe that adenosine may be more specifically involved in control of the sleep-wake cycle. [[Robert McCarley]] and his colleagues have argued that accumulation of adenosine may be a primary cause of the sensation of sleepiness that follows prolonged mental activity, and that the effects may be mediated both by inhibition of wake-promoting neurons via A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, and activation of sleep-promoting neurons via indirect effects on A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Basheer |first1=R |last2=Strecker |first2=R |last3=Thakkar |first3=M |last4=McCarley |first4=R |title=Adenosine and sleep?wake regulation |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=379–96 |year=2004 |pmid=15313333 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2004.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have provided additional evidence for the importance of A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, but not A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Zhi-Li |last2=Qu |first2=Wei-Min |last3=Eguchi |first3=Naomi |last4=Chen |first4=Jiang-Fan |last5=Schwarzschild |first5=Michael A |last6=Fredholm |first6=Bertil B |last7=Urade |first7=Yoshihiro |last8=Hayaishi |first8=Osamu |title=Adenosine A2A, but not A1, receptors mediate the arousal effect of caffeine |journal=Nature Neuroscience |pages=858–9 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/nn1491 |pmid=15965471 |volume=8 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the secondary effects of caffeine are probably caused by actions unrelated to adenosine. Like other methylated [[xanthines]], caffeine is both a

[[Phosphodiesterase inhibitors]] inhibit [[phosphodiesterase|cAMP-phosphodiesterase]] (cAMP-PDE) enzymes, which convert [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) in cells to its noncyclic form, thus allowing cAMP to build up in cells. Cyclic AMP participates in activation of [[protein kinase A]] (PKA) to begin the phosphorylation of specific enzymes used in glucose synthesis. By blocking its removal, caffeine intensifies and prolongs the effects of [[epinephrine]] and epinephrine-like drugs such as [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[methylphenidate]]. Increased concentrations of cAMP in [[parietal cell]]s causes an increased activation of [[CAMP-dependent protein kinase|protein kinase A]] (PKA), which in turn increases activation of [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|H+/K+ ATPase]], resulting finally in increased [[gastric acid]] secretion by the cell. Cyclic AMP also increases the activity of the [[funny current]], which directly increases heart rate. Caffeine is also a structural analogue of [[strychnine]] and, like it (though much less potent), a competitive antagonist at ionotropic [[glycine receptor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=L. |last2=Yang |first2=J. |last3=Slaughter |first3=M.

Metabolites of caffeine also contribute to caffeine's effects. [[Paraxanthine]] is responsible for an increase in the [[lipolysis]] process, which releases [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]] into the blood to be used as a source of fuel by the muscles. Theobromine is a [[vasodilation|vasodilator]] that increases the amount of oxygen and nutrient flow to the brain and muscles. Theophylline acts as a smooth [[muscle relaxant]] that chiefly affects [[bronchiole]]s and acts as a [[chronotropic|chronotrope]] and [[inotrope]] that increases heart rate and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Dews|first = P.B.|title = Caffeine: Perspectives from Recent Research|publisher = Berlin: Springer-Valerag|year = 1984|isbn=978-0-387-13532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Decaffeination}}

Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce decaffeinated coffee and caffeine, is an important industrial process and can be performed using a number of different solvents. [[Benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[trichloroethylene]], and [[dichloromethane]] have all been used over the years but for reasons of safety, environmental impact, cost, and flavor, they have been superseded by the following main methods:

===Water extraction===
Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]], which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decaffeination&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Senese|first=Fred|title=How is coffee decaffeinated?|publisher=General Chemistry Online|date=2005-09-20|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/decaffeinating-coffee.shtml|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter [[caffeine tablets]].

===Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction===
[[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1 °C and pressures above 73 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. Under these conditions, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is in a &quot;[[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]]&quot; [[Phase (matter)|state]]: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is then sprayed with high pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by [[Activated carbon|charcoal]] [[adsorption]] (as above) or by [[distillation]], [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], or [[reverse osmosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Decaffeination&quot; /&gt;

===Extraction by organic solvents===
Certain organic solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]] present much less health and environmental hazard than previously used chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.

==Religion==
Some [[Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]), [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Church of God (Restoration)]] adherents, and [[Christian Scientists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.redding.com/news/2008/Apr/12/voices-faith-april-12-2008/ |title= Voices of Faith: April 12, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not consume caffeine. A few followers from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: “With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided.”&lt;ref&gt;(Priesthood Bulletin, Feb. 1972, p. 4.)'' See also [[Word of Wisdom#Cola and other caffeinated beverages|Word of Wisdom]].''{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] generally also abstain from caffeine, as it is alleged to cloud the mind and over-stimulate the senses. To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine (along with alcohol, nicotine and other drugs) for at least a year.

In Islam the main rule on caffeine is that it is permissible, but it is worth noting that it should not be overused and can cause severe harm to one's body. With regard to the caffeine in coffee, Imam Shihab al-Din said: 'it is ''[[halal]]'' (lawful) to drink, because all things are ''[[halal]]'' (lawful) except that which God has made ''[[haraam]]'' (unlawful)'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-03|url=http://islamweb.net/ver2/Fatwa/ShowFatwa.php?lang=E&amp;Id=84417&amp;Option=FatwaId|title=Drinking drinks with caffeine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyc''' is an [[List of notable artificial intelligence projects|artificial intelligence project]] that attempts to assemble a comprehensive [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] and [[knowledge base]] of everyday [[common sense knowledge]], with the goal of enabling [[artificial intelligence|AI]] applications to perform human-like reasoning. 
The project was started in 1984 by [[Douglas Lenat]] at [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation|MCC]] and is developed by company [[Cycorp]].
Parts of the project are released as '''OpenCyc''', which provides an API, [http://sw.opencyc.org/ RDF endpoint], and [[data dump]] under an [[open source]] license.

==Overview==
The project was started in 1984 as part of [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation]]. The objective was to codify, in machine-usable form, millions of pieces of knowledge that comprise human common sense. CycL presented a proprietary knowledge representation schema that utilized first-order relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Cyc Project was spun off into [[Cycorp, Inc.]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1994. 

The name &quot;Cyc&quot; (from &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, pronounced like ''syke'') is a registered trademark owned by Cycorp. The original knowledge base is proprietary, but a smaller version of the knowledge base, intended to establish a common vocabulary for automatic reasoning, was released as OpenCyc under an [[open source]] (Apache) license. More recently, Cyc has been made available to AI researchers under a research-purposes license as [[Cyc#ResearchCyc|ResearchCyc]].

Typical pieces of knowledge represented in the database are &quot;Every tree is a plant&quot; and &quot;Plants die eventually&quot;. When asked whether trees die, the inference engine can draw the obvious conclusion and answer the question correctly. The Knowledge Base (KB) contains over one million human-defined assertions, rules or common sense ideas. These are formulated in the language [[CycL]], which is based on [[predicate calculus]] and has a [[syntax]] similar to that of the [[Lisp programming language]].

Much of the current work on the Cyc project continues to be [[knowledge engineering]], representing facts about the world by hand, and implementing efficient inference mechanisms on that knowledge. Increasingly, however, work at Cycorp involves giving the Cyc system the ability to communicate with end users in [[natural language]], and to assist with the [[knowledge formation]] process via [[machine learning]].

Like many companies, Cycorp has ambitions to use the  Cyc [http://www.cyc.com/cyc/cycrandd/areasofrandd_dir/cycrandd/nlu natural language understanding tools]  to parse the entire internet to extract structured data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyc.com/cyc/cycrandd/areasofrandd_dir/is|title=Cyc R&amp;D|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Cyc resources were mapped to many [[Wikipedia]] articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~olena/cyc.html|title=INTEGRATING CYC AND WIKIPEDIA: Folksonomy meets rigorously defined common-sense|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially easing the connecting with other open datasets like [[DBpedia]] and [[Freebase (database)|Freebase]].

==Knowledge base==
The concept names in Cyc are known as ''constants''. Constants start with an optional &quot;#$&quot; and are case-sensitive. There are constants for:
* Individual items known as ''individuals'', such as #$BillClinton or #$France. 
* ''Collections'', such as #$Tree-ThePlant (containing all trees) or #$EquivalenceRelation (containing all [[equivalence relation]]s). A member of a collection is called an ''instance'' of that collection.
* ''Truth Functions'' which can be applied to one or more other concepts and return either true or false. For example #$siblings is the sibling relationship, true if the two arguments are siblings. By convention, truth function constants start with a lower-case letter.  Truth functions may be broken down into logical connectives (such as #$and, #$or, #$not, #$implies), quantifiers (#$forAll, #$thereExists, etc.) and [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s.
* ''Functions'', which produce new terms from given ones. For example, #$FruitFn, when provided with an argument describing a type (or collection) of plants, will return the collection of its fruits. By convention, function constants start with an upper-case letter and end with the string &quot;Fn&quot;. 

The most important predicates are #$isa and #$genls. The first one describes that one item is an [[instance]] of some collection, the second one that one collection is a subcollection of another one. Facts about concepts are asserted using certain CycL ''sentences''. Predicates are written before their arguments, in parentheses:
  (#$isa #$BillClinton #$UnitedStatesPresident)
&quot;Bill Clinton belongs to the collection of U.S. presidents&quot; and
  (#$genls #$Tree-ThePlant #$Plant)
&quot;All trees are plants&quot;.
  (#$capitalCity #$France #$Paris)
&quot;Paris is the capital of France.&quot;

Sentences can also contain variables, strings starting with &quot;?&quot;. These sentences are called &quot;rules&quot;. One important rule asserted about the #$isa predicate reads
 (#$implies
    (#$and   
      (#$isa ?OBJ ?SUBSET)
      (#$genls ?SUBSET ?SUPERSET))
    (#$isa ?OBJ ?SUPERSET))
with the interpretation &quot;if OBJ is an instance of the collection [[subset|SUBSET]] and SUBSET is a subcollection of [[superset|SUPERSET]], then OBJ is an instance of the collection SUPERSET&quot;. Another typical example is
  (#$relationAllExists #$biologicalMother #$ChordataPhylum #$FemaleAnimal)
which means that for every instance of the collection #$ChordataPhylum (i.e. for every [[chordate]]), there exists a female animal (instance of #$FemaleAnimal) which is its mother (described by the predicate #$biologicalMother).

The [[knowledge base]] is divided into ''microtheories'' (Mt), collections of concepts and facts typically pertaining to one particular realm of knowledge. Unlike the knowledge base as a whole, each microtheory is required to be free from contradictions. Each microtheory has a name which is a regular constant; microtheory constants contain the string &quot;Mt&quot; by convention. An example is #$MathMt, the microtheory containing mathematical knowledge. The microtheories can inherit from each other and are organized in a hierarchy:
one specialization of #$MathMt is #$GeometryGMt, the microtheory about geometry.

==Inference engine==
An [[inference engine]] is a computer program that tries to derive answers from a knowledge base.
The Cyc inference engine performs general [[logical deduction]] (including [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], [[universal quantification]] and [[existential quantification]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyc.com/cyc/technology/technology/whatiscyc_dir/howdoescycreason|title=cyc Inference engine|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Releases==
=== OpenCyc ===
The latest version of OpenCyc, 2.0, was released in July 2009. OpenCyc 1.0 includes the entire Cyc ontology containing hundreds of thousands of terms, along with millions of assertions relating the terms to each other; however, these are mainly taxonomic assertions, not the complex rules available in Cyc. The knowledge base contains 47,000 concepts and 306,000 facts and can be browsed on the OpenCyc website.

The first version of OpenCyc was released in spring 2002 and contained only 6,000 concepts and 60,000 facts.  The knowledge base is released under the [[Apache License]]. [[Cycorp]] has stated its intention to release OpenCyc under parallel, unrestricted licences to meet the needs of its users. The [[CycL]] and [[SubL]] interpreter (the program that allows you to browse and edit the database as well as to draw inferences) is released free of charge, but only as a binary, without source code. It is available for [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. The open source Texai&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texai.org The open source Texai project]&lt;/ref&gt; project has released the [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]-compatible content extracted from OpenCyc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=176781 Texai SourceForge project files]&lt;/ref&gt;

===ResearchCyc===
In July 2006, Cycorp released the [[binaries]] of ResearchCyc 1.0, a version of Cyc aimed at the research community, at no charge. (ResearchCyc was in beta stage of development during all of 2004; a beta version was released in February 2005.) In addition to the taxonomic information contained in OpenCyc, ResearchCyc includes significantly more semantic knowledge (i.e., additional facts) about the concepts in its knowledge base, and includes a large lexicon, [[English (language)|English]] parsing and generation tools, and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based interfaces for knowledge editing and querying.

==Applications==
===Terrorism Knowledge Base===
The comprehensive [[Terrorism]] Knowledge Base is an application of Cyc in development that will try to ultimately contain all relevant knowledge about &quot;terrorist&quot; groups, their members, leaders, ideology, founders, sponsors, affiliations, facilities, locations, finances, capabilities, intentions, behaviors, tactics, and full descriptions of specific terrorist events. The knowledge is stored as statements in mathematical logic, suitable for computer understanding and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyc.com/doc/white_papers/TKB-IA2005.pdf|title=The Comprehensive Terrorism Knowledge Base in Cyc |accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclopedia===
Cyclopedia is being developed; it superimposes Cyc keywords on pages taken from Wikipedia pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.dbpedia.org/OpenCyc|title=DBpedia and (Open-)Cyc|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cycfoundation.org/cyclopedia.jpg Cyclopedia Sampleshowing cyc highlighted cyc concept for family]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland Clinic Foundation===
The [[Cleveland Clinic]] has used Cyc to develop a natural language query interface of biomedical information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/ClevelandClinic/]&lt;/ref&gt;
The query is parsed into a set of '''CycL''' (higher-order logic) fragments with open variables, then after applying various constraints (medical domain knowledge, common sense, discourse pragmatics, syntax), there is a way to fit those fragments together, one semantically meaningful formal query.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/2299]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the Cyc Project==
The Cyc project has been described as &quot;one of the most controversial endeavors of the artificial intelligence history&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bertino|Piero|Zarri|2001|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it has inevitably garnered its share of criticism.  Criticisms include:

* The complexity of the system—arguably necessitated by its encyclopedic ambitions—and the consequent difficulty in adding to the system by hand
* Scalability problems, from widespread [[reification (knowledge representation)|reification]], especially as constants
* Unsatisfactory treatment of the concept of [[Substance theory|substance]] and the related distinction between [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties]]
* The lack of any meaningful benchmark or comparison for the efficiency of Cyc's inference engine
* The current incompleteness of the system in both breadth and depth and the related difficulty in measuring its completeness
* Limited documentation
* The lack of up-to-date on-line training material makes it difficult for new people to learn the systems
* A large number of gaps in not only the ontology of ordinary objects, but an almost complete lack of relevant assertions describing such objects

{{spanish name 2|Valderrama|Palacio}}
'''Carlos Alberto Valderrama Palacio''' (born September 2, 1961 in [[Santa Marta]], [[Colombia]]), also known as ''El Pibe'' (&quot;The Kid&quot;) is a Colombian former [[association football|football player]]. His mass of blond, permed hair made him one of Colombia's most recognisable [[Association football|footballers]]. Valderrama was a member of the [[Colombia national football team]] in the 1990s known for his timing assists and passes. Between 1985 and 1998 he represented [[Colombia]] in 111 full internationals and scored 11 times, making him the most capped [[Association footballer|player]] in the country's history. He was the most famous football player in Colombia in the team of [[René Higuita]], [[Faustino Asprilla]], [[Freddy Rincón]], [[Adolfo Valencia]], [[Leonel Álvarez]], [[Óscar Córdoba]], [[Andrés Escobar]] and others.

==Carlos Valderrama: Retrospective==

Carlos Valderrama is today recognized by many football pundits, particularly in South America, as one of the all time greats in terms of passing the ball. Here we take a quick and detailed look at the most important information concerning Carlos Valderrama the football player.

=== Valderrama the locally famous footballer: 1981-1984 ===

In retrospective, the most relevant information concerning Valderrama is perhaps the most ignored information about him, that is, the fact that Valderrama had a slow and inauspicious start as a professional football player. The general story is that Carlos Valderrama had a slow and inauspicious start as a professional football player, but that he later improved and established himself as a talented player.

The general story concerning Carlos Valderrama the unknown footballer, is far from the truth, vague, and also gives the wrong impression about Valderrama as a footballer. Contrary to the mentioned vague and fictional stories concerning Carlos Valderrama the unknown footballer, the Colombian midfielder was not a player that had a slow and inauspicious start as a footballer because he slowly improved with time.

The real story about Carlos Valderrama the unknown footballer, is that he started his footballing career at a time when the freedom of expression was reserved for the individual that wore the number ten shirt, the classic number ten, the individual with the license to freely express himself on the pitch; freedom of expression was a luxury that was reserved for the individual that wore the number ten shirt.

Of course, the logical problem was, at the time, that the individual with the freedom of expression did not really have that much freedom, freedom of expression was both a privilege and a burden, the classic number ten was expected to play in advanced areas of the pitch, was expected to score goals on a consistent basis, amongst other requisites.

The main reason for why Carlos Valderrama enjoyed a slow and inauspicious start as a footballer, is because the Colombian midfield maestro wanted the freedom of expression that was generally reserved for the individual that wore the number ten shirt, the classic number ten, the individual that played behind the forwards; of course, the problem was, that Valderrama never actually was a classic number ten.

The mentioned dilemma resulted in many disagreements and conflicts between the unknown Valderrama and various managers. The managers at Union Magdalena wanted to employ Valderrama as a classic number ten, that is, positioning Valderrama behind the forwards; and Valderrama, lacking pace and lacking goal scoring ability, was not comfortable playing in the position of a classic number ten, since positioning Valderrama behind the forwards had a detrimental effect because it exaggerated his lack of pace and his lack of goal scoring talent.

Contrary to what was said about Carlos Valderrama after he established himself as a world class footballer, Valderrama was never the typical classic number ten of the time, he rarely ever scored free kicks, he rarely even attempted to shot at goal, and watching him run with the ball was one of the rarest sights you'd ever see on a football pitch; contrary to the general opinion concerning Carlos Valderrama the famous footballer, Valderrama never actually was a classic number ten in the classic South American mold.

Zico, Michel Platini, Diego Maradona, Roberto Baggio, were classic number ten, creative footballers who were employed in advanced areas of the pitch (behind the forwards), enjoying more freedom than a midfielder or a striker; on the other hand, Carlos Valderrama was a more modern type of creative footballer, with the creative flair of a classic number ten, but a creative football player that unlike the classic number ten was more comfortable when positioned in deeper areas of the pitch, very similar to Xavi Hernandez in that he possessed the creative flair of a classic number ten but was not comfortable when positioned behind the forwards.

Carlos Valderrama was a creative and distinctive midfielder who was not comfortable in advanced areas of the pitch, his lack of pace and lack of goal scoring ability meant that he was not a dangerous threat when positioned behind the strikers; unlike the typical classic number ten, Valderrama was more of a threat when positioned in deep areas of the pitch. 

The problem that Valderrama had to deal with at the beginning of his career, was that at the time, playing in deep positions of the pitch was regarded as defensive. And defensive football was an unwanted or undesirable characteristic in Colombian Football. 

In truth, the reason for why Carlos Valderrama enjoyed or endured a slow and inauspicious start as a footballer, was because Valderrama dropped deep when the manager wanted him to play in an advanced position, because Valderrama was not comfortable when positioned behind the forwards, because the managers at Union Magdalena and Millonarios deduced that Valderrama was not good enough to wear the number ten shirt.

In retrospective, the dilemma with Carlos Valderrama was not that he was a talented player that needed to improve in order to enjoy more success, the dilemma with Valderrama was that he was a talented player that needed to be properly employed in order to enjoy more success. At the time, creative players were positioned behind the strikers, Valderrama was a creative football player who was not comfortable when positioned in such an advanced area of the pitch.

The managers at Union Magdalena and Millonarios were convinced that they could shape Valderrama into a quality classic number ten, primarily because Valderrama was naturally gifted with the ball, and the managers were convinced that with enough practice Valderrama could play the role of a classic number ten; however, the factor that the managers at Union Magdalena and Millonarios did not considered, was that Valderrama was gifted at walking pace or at no pace, that Valderrama was average in terms of scoring goals, therefore positioning him behind the forwards would expose his lack of pace and lack of goal scoring ability.

The misconception that Carlos Valderrama was an old school number ten, was a misconception that followed him throughout his entire career, from beginning to end, the general opinion amongst the people was that Carlos Valderrama was a classic number ten in the typical South American mold; he never was, the typical South American number ten had the tendency of consistently asking for the ball and consistently running with the ball, Carlos Valderrama did consistently asked for the ball but he never agreed with consistently running with the ball.

=== Valderrama the nationally famous footballer: 1985-1987 ===

It was at Deportivo Cali that Carlos Valderrama made his name as a national attraction who remained rather anonymous to the rest of the world, forming a great partnership with teammate Bernardo Redin.

Valderrama's career at Deportivo Cali started badly because the person who managed Deportivo Cali at the time was doing the same exact thing that the other managers had done with him at Union Magdalena and Millonarios, that is, employing Valderrama in a position or role that exaggerated all the flaws of his game. And once again it was not working, since it gave the wrong impression about Valderrama, making Valderrama look like a slow player who was technically gifted but not good enough to play for the big Colombian clubs. 

However, when the Deportivo Cali manager tried to change the tactical scheme in an effort to click in with the blatantly unconventional Valderrama.... that was the defining point of Valderrama's career, it was all success from that point onwards.

The critical tactical change that proved successful, was that instead of forcing Carlos Valderrama into playing the type of role that required a lot of running with and without the ball, the manager decided to employ Valderrama in a deep position of the pitch, and at the same time, the manager also decided to pack the midfield with one more player in an effort to provide more freedom for Valderrama, and it worked perfectly, since as a result, it created the freedom that Valderrama needed in order to dictate the tempo of the game without doing too much running with and without the ball, the freedom that was needed so that Valderrama could slip the long ground passes that resulted in many goals and plays. It was now clear why Valderrama had yet to deliver, the other managers had employed him as a classic number ten playing behind the forwards, but he was very effective as a deep lying playmaker slipping dangerous ground passes from deep areas of the pitch; the new tactical scheme maximized the strengths of Valderrama and minimized his weaknesses.

The style of football that Carlos Valderrama created with the assistance of teammate Bernardo Redin was a sensation in Colombian Football, it was considered innovative at the time because playing in deep areas of the pitch was generally regarded as defensive, and now Valderrama and Redin were showing that you could play flowing attacking football without the necessity of placing a number ten behind the forwards.

The fact that Carlos Valderrama became famous in Colombia in year 1985 is not a sign of a player that improved after a disappointing season with Millonarios, the fact that Carlos Valderrama became famous in Colombia in year 1985 is simply what happened when Carlos Valderrama was employed as the modern midfielder that he always was. Evidence of the mentioned fact, can be easily obtained by watching the tactical scheme that Union Magdalena and Millonarios used, and then watching the tactical scheme that Deportivo Cali used, and then comparing the statistics, Carlos Valderrama did not improved just because he decided it was crunch time, Valderrama improved dramatically simply because he was correctly employed by the person who managed Deportivo Cali at the time.

In year 1986 Valderrama only grew in stature, as he developed a great understanding with teammate Bernardo Redin, the duo known as &quot;La Llave Redin-Valderrama&quot; (&quot;The Key Redin-Valderrama&quot;) created a new brand of football that openly contradicted the general consensus that playing in deep areas of the pitch was defensive, a very distinctive and vibrant brand of football where Valderrama and Redin would give the impression of omnipresence even though they were not renowned for their physical attributes: spraying short and long passes through the ground all over the pitch, short passing plays that started from the back and stretched all the way into the last third of the pitch, it was a sensation in Colombian Football and marked an era. Deportivo Cali was widely considered as the team that played the most attractive football, and Carlos Valderrama was being described as the best passer in Colombian Football.

After the 1986 season, Carlos Valderrama earned international recognition at the 1987 Copa America Tournament, Valderrama was recognized as the best performer of the tournament, ahead of Diego Maradona, Romario, Bebeto, Dunga, and other renowned players; in addition, his impressive display at the 1987 Copa America earned him the 1987 South American Footballer of the Year distinction.

==Club career==

Carlos Valderrama had a somewhat strange career at club level, he did not enjoyed a lot of success in terms of winning trophies but nonetheless enjoyed a great deal of success in terms of fame and recognition. Another distinction to his club career is that almost no video footage exists of Valderrama playing at club level. In the following sections we resume his football career at club level.

=== Unión Magdalena: 1981-1984 ===

Carlos Valderrama began his career at Unión Magdalena of the Colombian First Division in 1981. It was a slow and inauspicious start for Valderrama, mainly because Valderrama was badly employed in a position that maximized the flaws to his game and minimized the strengths of his game, which resulted in constant disagreements with the coach, at some point, it got so bad that Valderrama actually walked out of the team.

However, despite his many disagreements with the manager of the team, the manager Perfecto Rodríguez saw potential in him and wanted to give him a second chance. After a rocky start to his career at Union Magdalena, Carlos Valderrama soon established himself as the best player of the team, and played at a good level in his first two seasons with team, albeit with no results in terms of silverware. In his third year with the team, Valderrama found a new manager in Jorge Castelli, and Jorge Castelli was not satisfied with Valderrama, so Valderrama was benched. After not playing for a couple of months, Valderrama's pride was so affected that he decided to stop going to practice in an effort to pressure the club into making a decision, the conflict between the manager and the player could not be mended, and the club decided to sell Valderrama to CD Millonarios.

=== CD Millonarios: 1984 ===

Carlos Valderrama was signed by one of the big clubs of Colombian Football in 1984. After his promising displays in his first two years with Union Magdalena, the manager of Millonarios believed that he could shape Valderrama into a classic number ten.

Though unfortunately for Valderrama, the coach at Millonarios wanted a classic number ten, and when he realized that Valderrama was not a classic number ten, the coach responded by saying that Carlos Valderrama was not good enough to play for one of the big clubs, and Valderrama was benched once again.

=== Deportivo Cali: 1985-1987 ===

After the disappointing spell with Millonarios, Valderrama was signed by another one of the big clubs of Colombian Football: Deportivo Cali.

It was at Deportivo Cali that Carlos Valderrama made his name as a national attraction who remained rather anonymous to the rest of the world. His career at Deportivo Cali started badly because the coach was doing the same thing that the other managers had done with him at Union Magdalena and Millonarios, that is, forcing Valderrama into playing a type of football that showed all the flaws of his game, and once again it was not working; however, when the Deportivo Cali manager tried to change the scheme in an effort to click in with the unconventional Valderrama, that was the defining point of Valderrama's career, it was all success from that point onwards. 

The critical tactical change that proved successful, was that instead of forcing Carlos Valderrama into playing the type of role that required a lot of running, the manager decided to pack the midfield with one more player in an effort to provide more freedom for Valderrama, and it worked perfectly, since as a result, it created the freedom that Valderrama needed in order to slip the long ground passes that resulted in many goals and plays. It was now clear why Valderrama had yet to deliver, the other managers had employed him as a classic number ten playing behind the forwards, but he was very effective as a deep lying playmaker slipping dangerous ground passes from deep areas of the pitch.

The style of football that Carlos Valderrama created with the assistance of teammate Bernardo Redin was a sensation in Colombian Football, playing in deep areas of the pitch was generally regarded as defensive, and now Valderrama and Redin were showing that you could play flowing attacking football without the necessity of placing a number ten behind the forwards.

At the end of his first year with Deportivo Cali, season 1985, everyone in Colombia started talking about him since he was one of the few potential players who could wear the number ten shirt for Colombia, he represented a lot of promise for the Colombian National Team. His first year with Deportivo Cali represents the birth of his name as a consistent star player, before 1985 he was regarded as a player with talent but with a bad temper and a lack of consistency, a player who failed when Millonarios gave him a chance; after 1985, Valderrama was a well known name throughout Colombia.

In year 1986 he only grew in stature, as he developed a great understanding with teammate Bernardo Redin, the duo Valderrama-Redin created their own brand of football, a very distinctive and vibrant brand of football where Valderrama and Redin would give the impression of omnipresence even though they were not renowned for their physical attributes: spraying short and long passes through the ground all over the pitch, short passing one-two plays that started from the back and stretched all the way into the last third of the pitch, it was a sensation in Colombian Football and marked an era; the fact that Carlos Valderrama and Bernardo Redin were both Colombian, only helped them grow in stature as the year went by.

In year 1986, as the year went on and Valderrama gained more confidence in his ability, he developed and perfected his technique: now recognized as a superb dribbler who could retain possession even when surrounded by two or three opponents, his strongest qualities were his movement or positioning without the ball, which allowed him to be a presence on the pitch even though he played at a stroll, and above all, his strongest quality was the accuracy and speed of his passes, which were very accurate and very difficult to intercept.

At the end of the year, the sensational form of the Valderrama-Redin association was not enough to win the title for Deportivo Cali, which ended the year in second place; however, Carlos Valderrama was widely recognized as the best player in the country by both colleagues and fans, and Deportivo Cali was widely regarded as the team that played the most attractive football, not the silverware that you would expect after such a successful season, but a great distinction nonetheless.

As a result of this success, Valderrama earned himself his first call to defend his national side, it was a win or go home play-off against Paraguay, the winner would qualify to the 1986 World Cup, the loser would be eliminated. In the first leg, Valderrama played the last ten minutes, Colombia was already losing by a 3-0 margin, the game ended a 3-0 defeat for Colombia. In the return leg, Valderrama played from the start, Colombia won the game by a 2-1 margin, but it was not enough to qualify Colombia to the 1986 World Cup.

=== 1987 Copa America ===

Soon after the 1986 World Cup, the 1987 Copa America took place. The sensational form of the duo known as &quot;La Llave Redin-Valderrama&quot; (&quot;the Key Redin Valderrama&quot;) was enough to earn both players a call to represent Colombia at the 1987 Copa America Tournament. At the 1987 Copa America Tournament, played in Argentina, Colombia displayed the same distinctive brand of short passing football that the duo Valderrama-Redin had invented a year earlier, but this time it was on a grander scale; suddenly, Colombia was being recognized as a team that played attractive and distinctive football.

The first game was Colombia against Bolivia, which ended with an impressive and unexpected 2-0 win against Bolivia; Valderrama assisted for the first goal, the assist was a very long pass through the ground, and a game in which Valderrama scored the second goal, a collectors item, one of the very few goals for his country. More important than the fact that Colombia won the game, was the type of football that Carlos Valderrama and Bernardo Redin produced in the midfield, it was a short passing game of the highest order, with Valderrama and Redin pulling all the strings, permanently dictating the tempo of the game.

In the second match, Colombia reaffirmed their new found status with another comprehensive and entertaining display against Paraguay, this time winning the game by a 3-0 margin; once again it was Colombia playing with Valderrama and Redin, Valderrama provided two assists for the first two goals; suddenly, everyone was talking about this Colombian team which revolved around the player with the distinctive hairstyle and the distinctive technique, an individual whom appeared to move slowly with the ball and yet could move the ball from side to side so quickly and effortlessly.

At this point, after the 2-0 win against Bolivia and the 3-0 win against Paraguay, this was already considered a success in Colombia, as nothing out of the ordinary was expected, and based on expectations and statistics, people were expecting an early exit yet again. After the unexpected success, the semi-finals read: Colombia vs Chile, and Argentina vs Uruguay.

Both Colombia and Chile surprised everyone and had become the two favorites to win the tournament, Colombia with the comfortable wins against Bolivia and Paraguay, and Chile after defeating Brazil by a 4-0 margin; against a highly rated Brazilian side which consisted of players including Romario, Careca, and Rai. The semi-final clash between Colombia vs Chile was highly anticipated, as both teams were playing the best football by far.

On the day, Colombia did not play at their best as a team, showing excessive reliance on Valderrama and Redin; which exposed a weakness, a lack of goal scoring talent, Colombia lacked a player who could score a goal out of nothing. Valderrama and Redin stringed the best plays of the game, but the duo lacked consistency throughout the game, and the lack of goal scoring talent was obvious after it became clear that a goal would come, only if Valderrama or Redin made the perfect assist.

After 90 minutes the game was a goalless draw, extra time was required. In extra time, Valderrama appeared once again: a spot kick, the Colombian midfielder asked for the ball, he received the pass and started the play slowly from a deep midfield area, at walking pace he played a quick one-two and subsequently dribbled past a player, and soon after he passed the ball forwards to Redin who was positioned near the edge of the penalty area, Redin was fouled inside of the penalty box, and it was a penalty given.

Colombia went ahead in extra time thanks to the mentioned penalty kick, it looked like the game was over with just a few minutes left on the clock; however, something unexpected would happen, as charismatic goalkeeper Renee Higuita gifted Chile with an easy goal after misjudging a corner kick. After drawing the game at 1-1, Chile scored a quick second with only two minutes left on the clock: Chile came from behind to win the game by a 2-1 margin, Colombia would play for third place against Argentina.

Their 2-1 defeat against Chile was characteristic of Colombia and their lack of goal scoring talent, they played better football than Chile, but they simply lacked an imposing presence in the penalty area; as an example of this trait, the only goal that Colombia scored against Chile, was produced by Valderrama and Redin, and was scored by Redin from the penalty spot. Individually, this was yet another world class display by Carlos Valderrama, who was by far the player of the match.

The semi-final clash against Chile, also showed Colombia's lack of match experience at this stage: instead of closing shop after going 1-0 in front, they continued attacking, and due to an uncharacteristic mistake by the goalkeeper, they ended up losing the match in the last two minutes of play.

Colombia would go on to play for 3rd place against world champions Argentina, and the final would be Chile vs Uruguay. Argentina represented the first world class challenge for this new found Colombian side, Colombia had never won a game against South American giants Argentina, and therefore the statistics suggested that Argentina should win the game; even more so when Argentina had world class players like Diego Maradona and Claudio Caniggia.

The stadium ''El Monumental'' (River Plate Stadium) was the stage, an audience of approximately 40.000 pundits watched how Colombia, guided by Valderrama, defeated the world champions Argentina; Valderrama was involved in the first goal and gave the assist for the second goal, in a match that Colombia won by a 2-1 margin.

After the match, an Argentine journalist wrote:

&quot;In the Monumental Stadium we saw magic. Football painted by a yellow shirt and a big mop of blond hair. Skinny, socks dropped to his ankles, somewhat crooked, loosed arms, strange appearance, brilliant with the ball at his feet, splendid footballing display. Carlos Valderrama, knows what a number 10 should know and writes the story of a first half full of toque, heel passes, feints and passes, with all the precision in the world.&quot;

In truth, the praise by the Argentine press was a bit exaggerated, as this was by far the less impressive performance from Valderrama; although, once again, Valderrama was involved in both of Colombia's goals.

As it happened in 1986 with Deportivo Cali, the Valderrama-Redin inspired team was widely recognized as the most attractive team of the tournament, playing a distinctive and original brand of short passing football in which everyone had a touch on the ball and everything revolved around Valderrama or Redin; though again, this great success was not enough to win the silverware. Colombia finished 3rd, outplaying everyone they played against and defeating the very same Diego Maradona inspired Argentina that won the 1986 World Cup; Valderrama was recognized as the best player of the 1987 Copa America Tournament, which added to his club form, was enough to earn him the South American Footballer of the Year distinction.

It is also worth mentioning, that teammate Arnoldo Iguaran finished as top scorer of the tournament, with four goals to his name: three of them assisted by Valderrama. In four games played, Valderrama managed to give four assists and scored one goal, which added to the overall display, earned him the aforementioned distinction.

=== 1988 Rous Cup ===

Not long after the 1987 Copa America Tournament, after world wide recognition as a new figure in world football, after Carlos Valderrama was recognized as the South American Footballer of the Year; Colombia started a small tour around the world that would end in Europe, where Colombia was invited to take part in the 1988 Rous Cup competition. On May 24 of 1988, Colombia tested their strength against a European heavyweight, playing England at the Old Wembley Stadium.

On the day, expectations were realistic, most people expected a comfortable victory for England. However, once the match started a lot of people were deeply impressed by Colombia's performance, and particularly, by Valderrama: dictating the tempo with his attractive short passing brand of football, whenever he had the ball, he demonstrated his class with all his little dribbles in very small and packed spaces, it was unusual for European crowds to see someone dominating the midfield at almost walking pace.

Throughout the match, the only chances that England managed to create were through the air, since Colombia had most of the possession; Valderrama and Redin finding each other with incredible ease and composure. Despite the early impression, England went ahead in the first half, thanks to a cross, but Colombia drew the game in the second half: the game ended an exciting and memorable 1-1 draw.

Colombia playing England at the Old Wembley Stadium, is undoubtedly, one of the most enduring images of Carlos Valderrama playing at his best. Jorge Valdano had this to say about his performance: &quot;I remember the one of Colombia against England at Wembley, where the least English player in the world, which was Valderrama, made himself the owner of the match with his short passing football, permanently dictating the rhythm with his enormous personality.&quot;

=== Montpellier HSC ===

Soon after the game at Wembley, Montpellier HSC came calling: &quot;We had heard there was a great midfielder playing in Colombia so we went down to take a look for ourselves,&quot; explains Louis Nicollin, president of Montpellier Hérault Sporting Club.

At the time, Montpellier were considered to have made a &quot;steal&quot;. Valderrama played a blinder against England at Wembley and became the toast of the footballing world. Nicollin tells the story: &quot;We went to see him play for Colombia at Wembley in May 1988. We agreed terms with his club and Valderrama signed on right away. He played like a dream in London and the following day all the English papers ran stories entitled ‘Lucky Montpellier’.&quot;

Considering that Colombian players were largely ignored, as far as Europe was concerned: the great performance at Wembley added to the distinctive playing style and growing reputation of Valderrama, which resulted in people expecting great things from the Colombian midfielder.

The performance of Valderrama against England prompted comparisons with [[Ruud Gullit]], perhaps mostly due to the distinctive hairstyle and mustache; however, in truth, Carlos Valderrama and Ruud Gullit were very different type of players, both elegant and classy with the ball, but unlike Gullit; the Colombian number 10 was not strong in the air, was not a complete midfielder by any means, and was below average in terms of goal scoring ability.

With his afro-blond hairstyle, flashy jewellery and drooping mustache, Carlos Valderrama certainly did not go unnoticed when he arrived in Montpellier in 1988. The Colombian midfield magician had been on the shopping list at the modest French club for some time. It was here that he would begin his short-lived European career, and despite a tough start in his first season, ''El Pibe'' is remembered in the south of France with unabated affection. Here we take a look back at his three years on the Mediterranean coast.

Valderrama did not take to French football straight away. He was unfit when he arrived, &quot;burnt out&quot; Nicollin says, &quot;so our coach left him on the bench and stuck with more familiar faces. And as Carlos isn’t a born leader he didn’t get too upset about it.&quot;

[[Laurent Blanc]], who played alongside Carlos in his first season at Montpellier, remembers the difficulties this fabulously talented performer encountered while adapting to European football: &quot;The game in Europe is very different to the game in South America. Down there it’s all about passing. Here it’s more physical and there’s less space. It wasn’t easy for Carlos.&quot;

In fact Valderrama practically sat out the first season on the bench and bided his time. His chance came with the arrival of Polish coach Henryk Kasperczack in 1989. And his talent impressed even the most cynical observers. &quot;I really liked how he played. One touch, South American ‘toque’ style, very efficient. Carlos always made the right pass at the right time. It was a pleasure to play in the same team as him,&quot; says French international Stéphane Paille, who played alongside him for Montpellier.

With Valderrama in the side Montpellier went from strength to strength. &quot;In 1990, when we won the French Cup, he was the main man: he saved our skins in the semi-final against Saint-Étienne,&quot; says President Nicollin. Laurent Blanc, who also played in that team, feels the same way. &quot;It was in that semi-final that he really made people sit up and pay attention. He was absolutely fabulous.&quot; In European games against PSV Eindhoven and Steaua Bucharest, he also showed he had talent to spare.

After playing his second season with Montpellier, Valderrama was still somewhat unsettled at the club, drifting in and out of the starting 11, although he was one of the key references when Montpellier won the 1989-90 French Cup: one of the very few titles that Montpellier has won. The 1989-90 season had a lot of ups and downs for Valderrama, one of the biggest challenges for the Colombian midfielder was adjusting whenever he had to play for Colombia, because Montpellier played the European game, which was very different to the type of football played in South America.

==Retirement as player==

In February 2004, Valderrama ended his 22-year career in a tribute match at the Metropolitan stadium of [[Barranquilla]], with some of the most important football players of South America, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Enzo Francescoli]] and [[José Luis Chilavert]].

Valderrama has since become assistant manager of Atlético Junior. On November 1, 2007, Valderrama accused a referee of corruption by waving cash in the face of Oscar Julian Ruiz when the official awarded a penalty to [[América de Cali]]. Junior lost the match 4-1, which ended the club's hopes of playoff qualification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press|AP]] (2007), [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2007-11-01-3659438715_x.htm Valderrama expelled from match for taunting referee with cash], [[USA Today]], 1 November 2007, usatoday.com. Retrieved 10 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Cyborg]]s are a prominent staple in the [[science fiction]] genre. This article summarizes notable instances of '''cyborgs in fiction'''.

==Examples in history==
In 1966, [[Kit Pedler]], a medical scientist, created the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] for the TV program ''[[Doctor Who]]'', based on his concerns about science changing and threatening humanity. The Cybermen had replaced much of their bodies with mechanical prostheses and were now supposedly emotionless creatures driven only by logic.   

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story &quot;[[The Bicentennial Man]]&quot; explored cybernetic concepts. The central character is NDR, a robot who begins to modify himself with [[organic compound|organic]] components. His explorations lead to breakthroughs in human [[medicine]] ''via'' artificial [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and prosthetics. By the end of the story, there is little physical difference between the body of the hero, now called Andrew, and humans equipped with advanced prosthetics, save for the presence of Andrew's artificial positronic brain. Asimov also explored the idea of the cyborg in relation to robots in his short story &quot;[[Segregationist (short story)|Segregationist]]&quot;, collected in ''[[The Complete Robot]]''.   

The 1972 [[science fiction]] novel [[Cyborg (novel)|''Cyborg'']], by [[Martin Caidin]], told the story of a man whose damaged body parts are replaced by mechanical devices (&quot;bionics&quot;). This novel was adapted into a [[Television program|TV series]], ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', in 1973, and a spin-off, ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' in 1976. Caidin also addressed bionics in his 1968 novel, ''[[The God Machine (1968 novel)|The God Machine]]''.

In 1974, [[Marvel Comics]] writer [[Rich Buckler]] introduced the cyborg [[Deathlok|Deathlok the Demolisher]], and a [[dystopian]] [[post-apocalyptic]] future, in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25. Buckler's character dealt with rebellion and loyalty, with allusion to [[Frankenstein]]'s monster, in a twelve-issue run. Deathlok was later resurrected in ''[[Captain America]]'', followed by two others in 1990 and 1999.  

In the novel [[Man Plus]] by  [[Frederick Pohl]], an able-bodied astronaut, Roger Torraway, is surgically altered in order to augment his fragile human body and  allow him to function in the harsh climate of [[Mars]]. The result is both &quot;monstrous&quot; (he has bat-like wings, infrared sight, an enhanced brain capable of processing all the new sensory inputs) and &quot;freeing&quot; (his cyborg body is more &quot;naturally&quot; made for Mars, as opposed to his all-human colleagues on the Mars mission). Torraway's cyborg character is reprised in a 1995 sequel, Mars Plus.

The 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' featured creatures called [[replicants]], bio-engineered or bio-robotic beings. The Nexus series—genetically designed by the [[Blade Runner#Tyrell Corporation|Tyrell Corporation]]—are virtually identical to an adult human, but have superior strength, agility, and variable intelligence depending on the model. Because of their physical similarity to humans a replicant must be detected by its lack of emotional responses and empathy to questions posed in a [[Voight-Kampff machine|Voight-Kampff]] test. A derogatory term for a replicant is &quot;skin-job,&quot; a term heard again extensively in ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. In the opening crawl of the film, they are first said to be the next generation in robotics. The crawl also states genetics play some role in the creation of replicants. The original novel makes mention of the biological components of the androids, but also alludes to the mechanical aspects commonly found in other material relating to robots.   

The 1987 science fiction [[action film]] ''[[RoboCop]]'' features a cyborg protagonist. After being killed by a criminal gang, police officer Alex Murphy is transformed by a private company into a cyborg cop. The transformation is used to explore the theme of [[resurrection]]  and [[Psychological identity|identity]]. There are cyborg ''[[kaiju]]'' in the [[Godzilla]] films such as [[Gigan]] and [[Mechagodzilla]].   

Although frequently referred to onscreen as a cyborg, [[The Terminator]] might be more properly an [[android (robot)|android]]. While it has skin and blood (cellular organic systems), these serve mainly as a disguise and are not [[symbiotic]] with the machine components, a trait of true cyborgs. The endoskeletons beneath are fully functional robots and have been seen operating independently, especially during the future segments of the Terminator movies. The [[T-1000]] (which is said to be made completely of a liquid metal) of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' is definitely an android. The Terminator [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron Phillips]] seen in the TV series ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' is of a previously unseen model, and is once again referred to on screen (including once by another Terminator) as a cyborg. [[Terminator Salvation]] introduces Marcus Wright, a death-row convict who donated his body to Cyberdyne Systems, who was later revived as a one of a kind Terminator with his original brain and heart placed into an endoskeleton which was then covered by a copy of his original organic tissue. 

Cyborgs have also been present in [[real-time strategy]] video games. The &quot;[[Command &amp; Conquer]]&quot; video game series had cyborgs as a part of its plot - specifically Cyborgs created by the &quot;[[Brotherhood of Nod]]&quot; via [[Tiberium Infusion]] experimentation. They were frequently used for anti-personnel, though the Cyborg Commando proved to be useful in most situations. Cyborgs were brought back by the [[AI]] named [[Nod characters of Command &amp; Conquer#LEGION|LEGION]], (a predecessor to [[CABAL]]) under direct orders from [[Kane (Command &amp; Conquer)|Kane]]. The 'Marked of Kane' units also contain Cyborgs.  

The [[Metal Gear Solid]] series of video games has a recurring character known as [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Grey Fox|Grey Fox]] or the &quot;Cyborg Ninja&quot; who is a person wearing a cybernetic exoskeleton (either worn as a suit or grafted directly to the character's body) and wielding a high-frequency blade.   

The cyborg ninja suit has been donned by multiple characters, most recently by the character [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]''. He became the newest incarnation of the Cyborg Ninja after he was captured by [[Patriots (Metal Gear)|The Patriots]] after he stole the body of [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] for the Paradise Lost Army. His body was heavily experimented on for the purpose of creating the ultimate soldier and the only remaining organic parts of his original body are his head and spinal cord. His cyborg body is composed of artificial muscle, organs, bones, and blood( a &quot;white&quot; artificial blood that the PLA substituted for his old, [[nanomachine]] primed blood). His cyborg body was optimized for war and enabled him to fight on a superhuman level and withstand what would normally be considered fatal injuries.    

One of the most famous cyborgs is [[Darth Vader]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films. Vader was once [[Anakin Skywalker]], a famous [[Jedi]] turned to the Dark Side. After a furious battle with his former master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Anakin is left for dead beside a lava flow on Mustafar, and is outfitted with an artificial life support system as well as robotic arms and legs. [[General Grievous]], [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Lobot]], and [[Luke Skywalker]] are the three other most prominent cyborgs in the Star Wars universe.   

In [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[manga]]'' and ''[[anime]]'' series ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', a scientist named [[Dr. Gero]] created several [[cyborgs]], including villain [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]], sibling cyborgs [[Android 17]] and [[Android 18]], as well as [[Android 20]], who was built from Gero himself.   

A direct brain-to-computer interface is a valuable, but expensive, luxury in [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s novel ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]''.

In the ''manga'' and ''anime'' series ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', Motoko Kusanagi lived in a world where the majority of adults are cyborgs and can connect wirelessly to the Internet for real-time communication and data research. The most common augmentation in the series were artificial brains called cyberbrains.   

[[Bruce Sterling]] in his universe of [[Shaper/Mechanist]] suggested an idea of alternative cyborg called [[lobster (cyborg)|Lobster]], which is made not by using internal implants, but by using an external shell (''e.g.'' a [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|Powered Exoskeleton]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Bruce. Schismatrix. Arbor House. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike human cyborgs that appear human externally while being synthetic internally, a Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally. The computer game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' prominently featured the [[Omar (Deus Ex)|Omar]], where &quot;Omar&quot; is a Russian translation of the word &quot;Lobster&quot; (since the Omar are of Russian origin in the game).   

In the ''Brain and Brawn'' series of novels series by [[Anne McCaffrey]] and others, beginning with ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'', a &quot;brainship&quot; is a human body, usually one that could not develop normally, encased in the strongest materials available in that universe, and mentally connected to the controls of a spacecraft. Later novels link the brainship to fully functional humanoid androids.

*Jonas the (star) sailor in [[Gene Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Book of the New Sun|Book of the New Sun]]'' novels. His near light speed ship had been gone so long that on its return to Urth, there were no space port facilities any more, and it crashed. Other crew members patched him up from available parts. (However, he started out as fully robotic, and was repaired with human parts, rather than the more usual reverse).
*[[Molly Millions]], Henry Dorsett Case, and Peter Riviera all have some sort of cybernetic augmentation in [[William Gibson]]'s [[Sprawl trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, William. Neuromancer &lt;/ref&gt;

==Comics and manga==
*'''[[Jeremiah Gottwald]]''' from [[Code Geass]] becomes a cyborg when he barely survives the Battle of Narita and is turned into one when a team of government scientists operate on him experimentally. This results in a half-machine appearance. In R2, most of his mechanical parts are internalized.
*''[[8 Man]]'', a manga and anime superhero created in 1963 by writer [[Kazumasa Hirai (author)|Kazumasa Hirai]] and [[artist]] [[Jiro Kuwata]]. He is considered Japan's earliest cyborg superhero, before even ''[[Kamen Rider]]'' (the same year, [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] created ''[[Cyborg 009]]''), and was the inspiration for ''[[RoboCop]]''.
*The Major in the [[Hellsing (manga)|''Hellsing'' manga]] has recently been discovered to be a cyborg

*[[Masamune Shirow]]'s other major work, ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'' also contains a multitude of cyborg characters, with one of the main characters, [[Briareos Hecatonchires]], the mercenary [[Sokaku Tatara]] and his war buddies, and the [[Mumna Holy Republic]] diplomat [[Kainisu]], from the fourth chapter, are just a few.
*[[Vash the Stampede]] from ''[[Trigun]]'' has a prosthetic left arm, which he acquired after his brother [[Millions Knives]] shot it off. The arm has an [[automatic weapon]] inside.
*[[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] of the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' [[comic book]] series is a [[superhero]] with massive implants and prosthetics. He also appeared in the animated TV series. Not to be confused with [[Superman]] supervillain [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]], a technopathic entity who prefers cybernetic forms, who is occasionally referred to as merely &quot;The Cyborg.&quot;
*[[Cy-Gor]] from the [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]] series 
*Many of the characters of ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'' (also known in Japan as ''GUNNM'') are cyborgs, including the lead, Alita (Gally, Yoko).

*[[Android 17]] and [[Android 18]], along with [[Android 20]] from the anime-manga series ''[[Dragon Ball|Dragon Ball Z]]''. Despite their confusing English dub names, they are indeed cyborgs. In the original Japanese version, these three (along with the rest of Dr. Gero's artificial creations) are referred to as ''jinzouningen'', which is a blanket term in Japanese science fiction applying to robots and androids, as well as cyborgs. ''Jinzouningen'' is usually translated by fans to &quot;artificial human&quot;. [[Frieza]] is also a cyborg after his defeat on [[Namek]] and is saved and rebuilt by his Father [[King Cold]].
*[[Franky (One Piece)|Franky]] (also known as Cutty Flam), of the manga ''[[One Piece]]'' by [[Eiichirō Oda]], rebuilt most of his body with scrap metal after sustaining serious injuries. Giving him abilities ranging from (but not limited to) air cannons in his hands and rear end, guns in his wrists, and the ability to extend the front part of his lower body outward, making him look like a backwards centaur. However, as Franky did these adjustments to himself, only the front part of his body is cyborg. His backside (which he couldn't reach) is as vulnerable as any human back, rendering this his weak point. His cyborg abilities are powered by cola, stored in a refrigeration unit in Franky's stomach.
*'''Henrietta''', '''Triela''','''Rico''', '''Claes''', '''Angelica''','''Elsa de Sica''', and '''Elizaveta''' from [[Gunslinger Girl|Gunslinger Girl]] are adolescent girls who are made into cyborg assassins to fight for the government.

This allows him greater control of the armor. Stark can also remotely operate his armors (more than one Iron Man active at a time).
*[[Victor Mancha]] is an artificial life form with organic parts in [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]].
*[[Cable (comics)|Cable]], a mutant from the future in [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics]]. Roughly a third of his body is a &quot;[[techno-organic material|techno-organic]]&quot; mesh.
*The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] is a cyborg.
*[[Bunnie Rabbot]] in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog series|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Saturday morning TV series]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie comic)|US comic series]].
*Several characters in [[Spriggan (manga)|Spriggan]] such as the [[Trident Corporation]]'s agents (except [[Iwao Akatsuki]]), including ex-Machiner's Platoon agent Ironarm, have prosthetic limbs. These give them an advantage in combat since the limbs are outfitted with offensive weapons.
*One group of major antagonists in the manga ''[[Blame!]]'' are Silicon Creatures, humanoids of a silicon base that are similar to cyborgs.
* [[Transmetropolitan]] features many cyborgian ideas and characters. Spider Jerusalem himself is a cyborg especially when he takes the phone trait.
*Pinoko from [[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]] is technically a cyborg; as a living [[Teratoma]], she is mostly organs: most of her body was crafted by Blackjack from synthetic fiber.
* The comic series [[Concrete (comics)|Concrete]] (1986-) revolved around the life of an ordinary human whose brain had been placed in a large artificial stone body by aliens.

==Film==

A '''Caesar salad''' is a [[salad]] of [[romaine lettuce]] and [[crouton]]s dressed with [[parmesan cheese]], lemon juice, olive oil, egg, [[Worcestershire sauce]], and black pepper. It may be prepared tableside.

==History==
&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT add the claim that this salad is attributed to Julius Caesar unless you have a valid source for verification. You will be reverted and considered to have vandalized this article.  --&gt;
The salad's creation is generally attributed to restaurateur [[Caesar Cardini]], an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[Mexico|Mexican]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cesar Cardini, Creator of Salad, Dies at 60 |url= |quote=Caesar Cardini, 60, credited with the invention of the Caesar salad, died [...] |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 5, 1956 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; Cardini was living in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] but also working in [[Tijuana]] where he avoided the restrictions of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].&lt;ref name=Rosa1&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Rosa Cardini |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/09/22/db2203.xml |quote=Rosa Cardini, who has died in California aged 75, turned the salad dressing created by her father, Caesar, into a staple of modern dining and a million-dollar business. Although the origin of the Caesar Salad is a topic hotly debated by epicures, the generally accepted version is that it was first popularised in the United States in the late 1920s by an Italian immigrant, born Cesare Cardini. He and his brother Alessandro moved to [[San Diego]] from [[Milan]] after the Great War and then decided to open a restaurant just across the border in Tijuana, Mexico, to attract Americans frustrated by Prohibition. |publisher=''Telegraph'' |date=September 21, 2003 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Rosa (1928–2003) recounted that her father invented the dish when a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] 1924 rush depleted the kitchen's supplies. Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of the table-side tossing &quot;by the chef.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.aol.com/cdawriter/LifeInMyOpinion/ 1987 interview with Rosa Cardini, for ''Mailpac Magazine,'' LA.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Cardini's staff have claimed to have invented the dish.&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;&gt;In [http://www.tcpalm.com/tcp/lifestyle_columnists/article/0,2821,TCP_24456_5584351,00.html &quot;Hail Caesar&quot;], D. Grant quotes Aviator's salad and more (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/CaesarSalad/index.htm 1998 notes on claims]:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;''Paul Maggiora,'' a partner of the Cardini's, claimed to have tossed the first Caesar's salad in 1927 for American airmen from San Diego and called it &quot;Aviator's Salad. Caesar's brother ''Alex'' had claimed to have developed the salad (he too allegedly called it &quot;aviator's salad&quot;). ''Livio Santini'' claimed he made the salad from a recipe of his mother, in the kitchen of Caesar's restaurant when he was 18 years old, in 1925, and that Caesar took the recipe from him.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Child]] claimed to have eaten a Caesar salad at Cardini's restaurant when she was a child in the 1920s.&lt;ref name='child'&gt;Julia Child, ''From Julia Child's Kitchen'', 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest contemporary documentation of Caesar Salad is a 1946 Los Angeles restaurant menu, twenty years after the 1924 origin asserted by the Cardinis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbase1.lapl.org/images/menus/fullsize/f/rb04346-01.jpg &quot;Garden Room at the Town House&quot; restaurant, Los Angeles, menu dated October 8, 1946: &quot;Salads ... Caesar ... 1.50.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipe==
[[Image:GrilledCaesarSalad.jpg|thumb|right|A grilled Caesar Salad made with wood grilled [[Romaine lettuce|romaine]], [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]], [[Asiago cheese|asiago]], [[croutons]], and fried [[wontons]].]]
The original Caesar salad recipe (unlike Alex's ''Aviator's salad'')&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;/&gt; did not contain pieces of [[anchovy]]; the slight anchovy flavor comes from the Worcestershire sauce. Cardini was opposed to using anchovies in his salad.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;My father always used [[Lea and Perrins]] Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies are one of its ingredients. [...] He meant this to be a subtle salad, and anchovies can be overwhelming.&quot; (Above quoted 1987 interview with Rosa Cardini)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves, which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers; [[coddled eggs]]; and Italian olive oil.&lt;ref name='child'/&gt;

The trademarks &quot;Cardini's&quot;, &quot;Caesar Cardini's&quot; and &quot;The Original Caesar Dressing&quot; are all claimed to date to February 1950, though they were only registered decades later,&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent and Trademark Office, serial numbers 73426710 &quot;Cardini's&quot;, registered 1983 by Caesar Cardini Foods, 73782270 &quot;The Original Caesar Dressing&quot; and &quot;Caesar Cardini's&quot;, registered 1989 by Dolefam Corporation, which later merged with T. Marzetti, Search at http://tess2.uspto.gov&lt;/ref&gt; and more than a dozen varieties of bottled ''Cardini's'' dressing are available today. Some recipes include mustard, avocado, tomato, bacon bits, garlic cloves or anchovies. ''Cardini's Brand original Caesar dressing'' is somewhat different from Rosa's version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grumpygourmetusa.com/culinary_beat2.html Review on Caesar Salad, by &quot;The Grumpy Gourmet,&quot; Doral Chenoweth, quote:]&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Today the nearest to Cardini's recipe is a commercial Caesar dressing prepared and marketed by the Marzetti Co.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marzetti's &quot;Cardini's Original Caesar dressing&quot; is made with soy oil and anchovies, and [[gluten]] free, by now&amp;mdash; [http://www.marzetti.com/_admin/_includes/_NUTRITION/Cardini_Ceasar_Dressing.pdf Information on ingredients given by manufacturer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many restaurants offer a more substantial salad by topping a Caesar salad with grilled chicken, steak, or seafood. Certain Mexican restaurants may improvise on items such as substituting tortilla strips for croutons and [[Cotija cheese]] for the Parmesan, or the addition of tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grumpygourmetusa.com/culinary_beat2.html Doral Chenoweth] on this:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;In my reviewing career I have found alleged Caesar salads in this country prepared with [...] [editor's note: almost anything]. It was there that I decided to take up the cause.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I walked from the border to Caesar's Bar &amp; Grill, 5th and Main streets. The second floor ballroom was the salad restaurant. Two chefs were treating tourists to technique. They still use Cardini's preferred wooden bowls. My conversation with one of the chefs went like this:&lt;br /&gt;
* Q - Where does the Romaine come from?&lt;br /&gt;A - Da states.
* Q - Where does the grated Parmesan come from?&lt;br /&gt;A - Da states.
* Q - Where do you get the eggs?&lt;br /&gt;A - From da chickens.&lt;br/&gt;Those answers were satisfying. I recrossed the border vowing to defend Caesar Cardini.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ingredients===
[[File:Cardinicaeser.JPG|right|thumb|Cardini's recipe bottled salad dressing.]]
* Ingredients according to the Hotel Caesar's recipe from about 2006:&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.grumpygourmetusa.com/caesar_back_4.JPG &quot;The original Caesar's salad&quot; (JPG)], as obtained by ''Doral Chenoweth''&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[romaine lettuce|romaine or cos lettuce]]
** olive oil
** fresh crushed garlic – often in olive oil
** salt to taste
** fresh-ground black pepper
** wine vinegar&lt;ref&gt;The Rosa Cardini recipe does not call for this. As there hardly will be found an Italian salad recipe of that time without any vinegar at all, this might be just an omission.&lt;/ref&gt;
** lemon juice or lime juice - fresh squeezed
** [[Worcestershire sauce]]
** raw or [[coddled egg]] yolks
** freshly grated Parmesan cheese
** freshly prepared croutons

===Variations===
There are limitless variations. However, some of the more traditional are:

:* other varieties  of lettuce
:* grilled poultry, meat, shellfish, or fish
:* capers
:* [[Romano cheese]]
:* [[anchovy|anchovies]]
:* bacon

=== Raw egg and salmonella ===
There is potential risk of infection by [[salmonella]] bacteria occasionally found in raw egg from cracked or improperly washed eggshells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Egg_Products_and_Food_Safety/index.asp U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service ''Fact Sheet on Egg Products and Food Safety'']&lt;/ref&gt; This is a concern with many similar dressings that are [[emulsion|emulsified]] with eggs, though generally the [[pH]] level is thought to be [[acidic]] enough to kill those bacteria. Nevertheless, later versions of the recipe call at least for briefly cooked [[coddled egg]]s or [[pasteurized]] eggs. Recipes may omit the egg and produce a &quot;Caesar [[vinaigrette]]&quot;. [[Yogurt]] is sometimes substituted for the eggs to maintain a creamy texture.

'''Cecilia Beaux''' (May 1, 1855 &amp;ndash; September 7, 1942) was an [[United States|American]] society [[portraitist]], in the nature of [[John Singer Sargent]]. She was a near contemporary of better-known American artist [[Mary Cassatt]] and also received her training in Philadelphia and France. Her sympathetic renderings of American ruling class made her one of the most successful [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]] of her era.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cecilia Beaux was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the youngest daughter of French [[silk]] manufacturer Jean Adolphe Beaux and teacher Cecilia Kent Leavitt, daughter of prominent businessman [[John Wheeler Leavitt]] of New York City and his wife Cecilia Kent of [[Suffield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, unable to bear the grief of his loss, and feeling adrift in a foreign country, returned to his native France for 16 years, with only one visit back to Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Alice A. Carter, ''Cecilia Beaux'', Rizzoli, New York, 2005, p. 11, ISBN 0-8478-2708-9&lt;/ref&gt; He returned when Cecilia was two, but left four years later after his business failed. As she confessed later, “We didn’t love Papa very much, he was so foreign.  We thought him ''peculiar''”. Her father did have a natural aptitude for drawing and the sisters were charmed by his whimsical sketches of animals. Later, Beaux would discover that her French heritage would serve her well during her pilgrimage and training in France.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cecilia Beaux self-portrait.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Self-portrait]] by Beaux, 1894]]

In Philadelphia, Beaux’s aunt Emily married mining engineer William Foster Biddle, whom Beaux would later describe as ‘after my grandmother, the strongest and most beneficent influence in my life.” For fifty years, he cared for his nieces-in-law with consistent attention and occasional financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandmother, on the other hand, provided day-to-day supervision and kindly discipline. Whether with housework, handiwork, or academics, Grandma Leavitt offered a pragmatic framework, stressing that “everything undertaken must be completed, conquered.” The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years were particularly challenging but the extended family survived despite little emotional or financial support from Beaux’s father.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
After the war, Beaux began to spend some time in the household of “Willie” and Emily, both proficient musicians. Beaux learned to play the piano but preferred singing. The musical atmosphere later proved an advantage for her artistic ambitions. Beaux recalled, “They understood perfectly the spirit and necessities of an artist’s life.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In her early teens, she had her first major exposure to art during visits with Willie to the nearby [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], one of America’s foremost art schools and museums. Though fascinated by the narrative elements of some of the pictures, particularly the Biblical themes of the massive paintings of [[Benjamin West]], at this point Beaux had no aspirations of becoming an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Her childhood was a sheltered though generally happy one. As a teen she already manifested the traits, as she described, of “both a realist and a perfectionist, pursued by an uncompromising passion for carrying through.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the Misses Lyman School and was just an average student, though she did well in French and Natural History. However, she was unable to afford the extra fee for art lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, Beaux began art lessons with a relative, Catharine Ann Drinker, an accomplished artist who had her own studio and a going clientele. Drinker became Beaux’s role model, and she continued lessons with Drinker for a year. She then studied for two years with the painter Francis Adolf Van der Wielen, who offered lessons in perspective and drawing from casts during the time that the new Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts was under construction. Given the bias of the Victorian age, female students were denied direct study in anatomy and could not attend drawing classes with live models (who were often prostitutes) until a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New England Woman Cecilia Beaux.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''New England Woman''. Portrait of Mrs. Jedidiah H. Richards (Beaux's cousin Julia Leavitt), 1895. [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]]]]

At 18, Beaux was appointed drawing teacher at Miss Sanford's School, taking over Drinker’s post. She also gave private art lessons, and produced decorative art and small portraits. Her own studies were mostly self-directed. Beaux received her first introduction to [[lithography]] doing copy work for Philadelphia printer Thomas Sinclair and she published her first work in ''St. Nicholas'' magazine in December 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux demonstrated accuracy and patience as a scientific illustrator, creating drawings of fossils for Edward D. Cope, for a multi-volume report sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey. However, she did not find technical illustration suitable for a career (the extreme exactitude required gave her pains in the “solar plexus”). At this stage, she did not consider herself an artist as yet.&lt;ref&gt;Beaux, pp. 77-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaux began attending the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1876, then under the dynamic influence of [[Thomas Eakins]], whose great work [[The Gross Clinic]] had “horrified Philadelphia Exhibition-goers as a gory spectacle” at the [[Centennial Exhibition]] of 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; She steered clear of the controversial Eakins, though she much admired his work. His progressive teaching philosophy, focused on anatomy and live study (and allowed the female students to partake in segregated studios), eventually led to his firing as director of the Academy. She did not ally herself with Eakins' rabid student supporters, and later wrote, “A curious instinct of self-preservation kept me outside the magic circle.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she attended costume and portrait painting classes for three years taught by the ailing director [[Christian Schussele]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Academy, the 24 year old Beaux decided to try her hand at porcelain painting and she enrolled in a course at the National Art Training School. She was well suited to the precise work but later wrote, “this was the lowest depth I ever reached in commercial art, and although it was a period when youth and romance were in their first attendance on me, I remember it with gloom and record it with shame.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; She studied privately with [[William Sartain]], a friend of Eakins and a New York artist invited to Philadelphia to teach a group of art students, starting in 1881. Though Beaux admired Eakins more and thought his painting skill superior to Sartain’s, she preferred the latter’s gentle teaching style which promoted no particular aesthetic approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter, p. 65&quot;&gt;Carter, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Eakins, however, Sartain believed in [[phrenology]] and Beaux adopted a lifelong belief that physical characteristics correlated with behaviors and traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter, p. 65&quot;/&gt;

Beaux attended Sartain’s classes for two years, then rented her own studio and shared it with a group of women artists who hired a live model and continued without an instructor. After the group disbanded, Beaux set in earnest to prove her artistic abilities. She painted a large canvas in 1875, ''Les Derniers Jours d'enfance'', a portrait of her sister and nephew whose composition and style revealed a debt to [[James McNeill Whistler]] and whose subject matter was akin to [[Mary Cassatt]]’s mother-and-child paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded a prize for the best painting by a female artist at the Academy, and further exhibited in Philadelphia and New York.  Following that seminal painting, she painted over 50 portraits in the next three years with the zeal of a committed professional artist. Her invitation to serve as a juror on the hanging committee of the Academy confirmed her acceptance amongst her peers.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1880s, she was receiving commissions from notable Philadelphians and earning $500 per portrait, comparable to what Eakins commanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter, p. 70&quot;&gt;Carter, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; When her friend Margaret Bush-Brown insisted that “Les Derniers” was good enough to be exhibited at the famed [[Paris Salon]], Beaux relented and sent the painting abroad in the care of her friend, who managed to get the painting into the exhibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter, p. 70&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Clemenceau Beaux 1920.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Georges Clemenceau]] by Cecilia Beaux (1920)]]

===Paris===
At 32, despite her clear success in Philadelphia, Beaux decided that she still needed to advance her skills. She left for [[Paris]] with cousin May Whitlock, forsaking several suitors and overcoming the objections of her family. There she trained at the [[Académie Julian]], the largest art school in Paris, and at the [[Académie Colarossi]], receiving weekly critiques from established masters like [[Tony Robert-Fleury]] and [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote, “Fleury is much less benign than Bouguereau and don’t temper his severities…he hinted of possibilities before me and as he rose said the nicest thing of all, ‘we will do all we can to help you’…I want these men…to know me and recognize that I can do something.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Though advised regularly of Beaux’s progress abroad and to “not be worried about any indiscretions of ours”, her Aunt Eliza repeatedly reminded her niece to avoid the temptations of Paris, “Remember you are first of all a Christian &amp;ndash; then a woman and last of all an Artist.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

When Beaux arrived in Paris, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], a group of artists who had begun their own series of independent exhibitions from the official Salon in 1874, were beginning to lose their solidarity. Also known as the “Independents” or “Intransigents”, the group which at times included [[Degas]], [[Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Caillebotte]], [[Pissarro]], [[Renoir]], and [[Berthe Morisot]], had been receiving the wrath of the critics for several years. Their art, though varying in style and technique, was the antithesis of the type of Academic art that Beaux was trained in and of which her teacher William-Adolphe Bouguereau was a leading master. In the summer of 1888, with classes in summer recess, Beaux worked in the fishing village of [[Concarneau]] with the American painters Alexander Harrison and Charles Lasar. She tried applying the plein-air painting techniques used by the Impressionists to her own landscapes and portraiture, with little success.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike her predecessor [[Mary Cassatt]], who had arrived near the beginning of the Impressionist movement 15 years earlier and who had absorbed it, Beaux's artistic temperament, precise and true to observation, would not align with Impressionism and she remained a realist painter for the rest of her career, even as [[Cézanne]], [[Matisse]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Picasso]] were beginning to take art into new directions.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux mostly admired classic artists like [[Titian]] and [[Rembrandt]]. Her European training did influence her palette, however, and she adopted more white and paler coloration in her oil painting, particularly in depicting female subjects, an approach favored by Sargent as well.

===Return to Philadelphia===
[[File:SarahAlliboneLeavitt.jpg|thumb|230px|''Sita and Sarita (Jeune Fille au Chat)''. Portrait of Sarah Allibone Leavitt, 1893&amp;ndash;1894. Collection of the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]
Back in America in 1889, Beaux proceeded to paint portraits in the [[grand manner]], taking as her subjects members of her sister's family as well as the elite of Philadelphia. In making her decision to devote herself to art, she also thought it was best not to marry, and in choosing male company she selected men who would not threaten to sidetrack her career.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; She resumed life with her family, and they supported her fully, acknowledging her chosen path and demanding of her little in the way of household responsibilities, “I was never once asked to do an errand in town, some bit of shopping…so well did they understand.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; She developed a structured, professional routine, arriving promptly at her studio, and expected the same from her models.

The five years that followed were highly productive, resulting in over forty portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 she exhibited at the Paris Exposition, obtained in 1893 the gold medal of the [[Philadelphia Art Club]], and also the Dodge prize at the New York [[National Academy of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Her portrait of ''The Reverend Matthew Blackburne Grier'' was particularly well-received, as was ''Sita and Sarita'', a portrait of her cousin Charles W. Leavitt's wife Sarah (Allibone) Leavitt in white, with a small black cat perched on her shoulder, both gazing out mysteriously. The mesmerizing effect prompted one critic to point out “the witch-like weirdness of the black kitten” and for many years, the painting solicited questions by the press. But the result was not pre-planned, as Beaux’s sister later explained, “Please make no mystery about it—it was only an idea to put the black kitten on her cousin’s shoulder. Nothing deeper.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter, p. 114&quot;&gt;Carter, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sita and Sarita'' eventually was donated by the artist to the collection of the [[Musée d'Orsay]].&lt;ref&gt;Tappert, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Another highly regarded portrait from that period is ''New England Woman'' (1895), a nearly all-white oil painting which was purchased by the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].

In 1895 Beaux became the first woman to have a regular teaching position at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she instructed in portrait drawing and painting for the next twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; That rare type of achievement by a woman prompted one local newspaper to state, “It is a legitimate source of pride to Philadelphia that one of its most cherished institutions has made this innovation.” She was a popular instructor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter, p. 114&quot;/&gt; In 1896, Beaux returned to France to see a group of her paintings presented at the Salon. Influential French critic M. Henri Rochefort commented, “I am compelled to admit, not without some chagrin, that not one of our female artists…is strong enough to compete with the lady who has given us this year the portrait of Dr. Grier.  Composition, flesh, texture, sound drawing—everything is there without affectation, and without seeking for effect.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
By 1900 the demand for Beaux's work brought clients from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[Boston]], prompting the artist to move to New York City; it was there she spent the winters, while summering at Green Alley, the home and studio she had built in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux’s friendship with Richard Gilder, editor-in-chief of the literary magazine ''The Century'', helped promote her career and he introduced her to the elite of society.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Among her portraits which followed from that association are those of [[Georges Clemenceau]]; First Lady [[Edith Roosevelt]] and her daughter; and [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Admiral Sir David Beatty]]. She also sketched President [[Teddy Roosevelt]] during her [[White House]] visits in 1902, during which “He sat for two hours, talking most of the time, reciting [[Kipling]], and reading scraps of [[Browning]].”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Her portraits ''Fanny Travis Cochran'', ''Dorothea and Francesca'', and ''Ernesta and her Little Brother'', are fine examples of her skill in painting children; ''Ernesta with Nurse'', one of a series of essays in luminous white, was a highly original composition, seemingly without precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; She won the [[Logan Medal of the arts]] at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and became a member of the National Academy in 1902.

===Green Alley===
[[File:Cecilia Beaux painting Cardinal Mercier.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cecilia Beaux painting [[Cardinal Mercier]] (ca. 1919)]]

By 1906, Beaux began to live year round at Green Alley, in a comfortable colony of “cottages&quot; belonging to her wealthy friends and neighbors. All three aunts had died and she needed an emotional break from Philadelphia and New York. She managed to find new subjects for portraiture, working in the mornings and enjoying a leisurely life the rest of the time. She carefully regulated her energy and her activities to maintain a productive output, and considered that a key to her success. On why so few women succeeded in art as she did, she stated, “Strength is the stumbling block. They (women) are sometimes unable to stand the hard work of it day in and day out.  They become tired and cannot reenergize themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

While Beaux stuck to her portraits of the elite, American art was advancing into urban and social subject matter, led by artists such as [[Robert Henri]] who espoused a totally different aesthetic, “Work with great speed..Have your energies alert, up and active. Do it all in one sitting if you can.  In one minute if you can.  There is no use delaying…Stop studying water pitchers and bananas and paint everyday life.” He advised his students, among them [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Rockwell Kent]], to live with the common man and paint the common man, in total opposition to Cecilia Beaux’s artistic methods and subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The clash of Henri and [[William Merritt Chase]] (representing Beaux and the traditional art establishment) resulted in 1907 in the independent exhibition by the urban realists known as “The Eight” or the [[Ashcan School]]. Beaux and her art friends defended the old order, and many thought (and hoped) the new movement to be a passing fad, but it turned out to be a revolutionary turn in American art.

[[File:Howell.jpg|thumb|200px|Painting of [[William Henry Howell]] (1919)]]

In 1910, her beloved Uncle Willie died. Though devastated by the loss, at fifty-five years of age, Beaux remained highly productive. In the next five years she painted almost 25 percent of her lifetime output and received a steady stream of honors.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; She had a major exhibition of 35 paintings at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. in 1912. Despite her continuing production and accolades, however, Beaux was working against the current of tastes and trends in art. The famed “Armory Show” of 1913 in New York City was a landmark presentation of 1,200 paintings showcasing [[Modernism]]. Beaux believed that the public, initially of mixed opinion about the “new” art, would ultimately reject it and return its favor to the Pre-Impressionists. But she was wrong; the art the traditionalists deemed “not only incompetent, but grotesque” came to dominate the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaux was crippled after breaking her hip while walking in Paris in 1924, and afterwards her output dwindled. That same year Beaux was asked to produce a self-portrait for the Medici collection in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/index.cfm/fuseaction/Items.ViewImageDetails/ItemID/3552 Self Portrait, Cecilia Beaux, installation at the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy, Smithsonian Archives of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 she published an [[autobiography]], ''Background with Figures''. Her later life was filled with honors. In 1930 she was elected a member of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]]; in 1933 came membership in the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], which two years later organized the first major retrospective of her work. Also in 1933 [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] honored Beaux as &quot;the American woman who had made the greatest contribution to the culture of the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tappert, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 The National Institute of Arts and Letters awarded her a gold medal for lifetime achievement.

===Death and critical regard===
[[File:Landscape with Farm Building Cecilia Beaux.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|''Landscape with Farm Building'', 1888]]
Cecilia Beaux died at Green Alley at the age of eighty-seven, and was buried in [[Bala-Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]]. In her will she devised that a [[Duncan Phyfe]] rosewood secretaire made for her father go to her cherished nephew Cecil Kent Drinker, a Harvard physician, whom she had painted as a young boy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquesandthearts.com/TT-2005-02-08-13-32-47p1.htm Winter Antiques Show Bows in for 51st Year, R. Scudder Smith, Antiques and the Arts Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadstreetreview.com/article.php?idc=2&amp;ida=831 Cecilia Beaux at Pennsylvania Academy, Broad Street Review, April 26, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Beaux was an individualist, comparisons to Sargent would prove inevitable, and often favorable. Her strong technique, her perceptive reading of her subjects, and her ability to flatter without falsifying, were traits similar to his. &quot;The critics are very enthusiastic. (Bernard) Berenson, Mrs. Coates tells me, stood in front of the portraits &amp;ndash; Miss Beaux's three &amp;ndash; and wagged his head. 'Ah, yes, I see!' Some Sargents. The ordinary ones are signed John Sargent, the best are signed Cecilia Beaux, which is, of course, nonsense in more ways than one, but it is part of the generous chorus of praise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Though overshadowed by [[Mary Cassatt]] and relatively unknown to museum goers today, Cecilia Beaux’s craftsmanship and extraordinary output were highly regarded in her time. While presenting the Carnegie Institute’s Gold Medal to Beaux in 1899, [[William Merritt Chase]] stated “Miss Beaux is not only  the greatest living woman painter, but the best that has ever lived. Miss Beaux has done away entirely with sex [gender] in art.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

During her long productive life as an artist, she maintained her personal aesthetic and high standards against all distractions and countervailing forces. She constantly struggled for perfection, “A perfect technique in anything,” she stated in an interview, “means that there has been no break in continuity between the conception and the act of performance.” She summed up her driving work ethic, “I can say this: When I attempt anything, I have a passionate determination to overcome every obstacle…And I do my own work with a refusal to accept defeat that might almost be called painful.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Chrysler}}

The company was founded by [[Walter Chrysler]] (1875–1940) on June 6, 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Davis | first = Mike | last2 = Tell | first2 = David | title = The Technology Century: 100 years of The Engineering Society 1895-1995 | publisher = Engineering Society of Detroit | year = 1995 | page = 53 | isbn = 9781563780226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Lockwood | first = Cliff | url= http://www.chryslerclub.org/walterp.html | title = Early Chrysler Corporate History: 1903 - 1928 | date = October 18, 1968 | publisher=Chrysler Club pages|accessdate = June 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell Motor Company]] (est. 1904) was re-organized into the Chrysler Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chryslerclub.org/walterp.html|title=A Brief Look at Walter P. Chrysler|publisher=WPC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Malis | first = Carol | title = Michigan: celebrating a century of success | publisher = Cherbo Publishing Group | year = 1999 | page = 76 | isbn = 9781882933235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Chrysler arrived at the ailing Maxwell-[[Chalmers Automobile|Chalmers]] company in the early 1920s. He was hired to overhaul the company's troubled operations (after a similar rescue job at the [[Willys]] car company).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last = Kimes | editor-first = Beverly R. | editor2-last = Clark, Jr. | editor2-first = Henry A. | title = Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942 | year = 1996 | publisher = Krause Publications | isbn= 9780873414289 | page = 292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1923 production of the Chalmers automobile was ended.&lt;ref&gt;Kimes, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1924, Walter Chrysler launched the well-received Chrysler automobile. The Chrysler was a 6-cylinder automobile, designed to provide customers with an advanced, well-engineered car, but at a more affordable price than they might expect. (Elements of this car are traceable to a [[prototype]] which had been under development at Willys during Chrysler's tenure).&lt;ref&gt;Kimes, pp. 292 and 1498.&lt;/ref&gt; The original 1924 Chrysler included a carburetor air filter, high compression engine, full pressure lubrication, and an oil filter, features absent from most autos at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Chrysler Technological Innovations
| url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/technology.html
| accessdate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the innovations in its early years were the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed, and rubber engine mounts to reduce vibration.
Chrysler also developed a wheel with a ridged rim, designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel. This wheel was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide.

Following the introduction of the Chrysler, the Maxwell was dropped after its 1925 model year run, although in truth the new line of lower-priced [[inline-four engine|4-cylinder]] Chryslers which were then introduced for the 1926 model year were basically Maxwells which had been re-engineered and rebranded.&lt;ref&gt;Kimes, pp. 292–293, and 901.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time period of the early 1920s that Walter Chrysler assumed the presidency of Maxwell, with the company then ultimately incorporated under the Chrysler name.

In 1998, Chrysler and its subsidiaries entered into a partnership dubbed a &quot;merger of equals&quot; with German-based [[Daimler-Benz]] AG, creating the combined entity [[DaimlerChrysler AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/chrysler/history/|title=Chrysler History|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daimler subsequently acquired Chrysler, to the surprise of many stockholders, after the retirement of Chrysler CEO Bob Eaton. Under DaimlerChrysler, the company was named '''DaimlerChrysler Motors Company LLC''', with its US operations generally called the &quot;Chrysler Group&quot;. On May 14, 2007, DaimlerChrysler announced the sale of 80.1% of Chrysler Group to American [[private equity]] firm [[Cerberus Capital Management]], L.P., therefore being known as '''Chrysler LLC''', although Daimler (renamed as [[Daimler AG]]) continued to hold a 19.9% stake.&lt;ref name=&quot;dcx_20070514&quot;&gt;&quot;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7145-1-858191-1-0-0-0-0-0-11979-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Cerberus Takes Majority Interest in Chrysler Group and Related Financial Services Business for EUR 5.5 Billion ($7.4 billion)|publisher=DaimlerChrysler}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was finalized on August 3, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/arts/ci_6534916|title=Cerberus gains control of Chrysler|publisher=San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 27, 2009, Daimler AG signed a binding agreement to give up its 19.9% remaining stake in Chrysler LLC to Cerberus Capital Management and pay as much as $600 million into the automaker's pension fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090427-717397.html |title=Daimler Reaches Agreement On Separation From Chrysler |date=27 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2009, the sale of most of Chrysler assets to &quot;New Chrysler&quot;, formally known as '''Chrysler Group LLC''' was completed. The federal government financed the deal with US$6.6 billion in financing, paid to the &quot;Old Chrysler&quot;, a new company called Old Carco LLC was set up to take over the remaining assets and liabilities, which remained in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aBhumEPf5wbM Ramsey, Mike and Kary, Tiffany. &quot;Chrysler Assets Said to Have Little Net Proceeds for Creditors&quot; ''Bloomberg.com'', 2009-06-23], retrieved on 2009-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer does not include eight manufacturing locations, nor many parcels of real estate, nor equipment leases.

Fiat Auto plans to sell seven of its vehicles in the US by 2014, while Fiat-controlled Chrysler Group is to supply nine models to sell under Fiat brands in the European market, according to a five-year plan rolled out on 21 April 2010 in [[Turin]], Italy, by Fiat and Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne. At least five of the Fiat Auto models are expected to be marketed in the U.S. under its [[Lancia]] brand. Showing the level of integration envisioned, a Lancia product introduction timeline shows Chrysler-built compact and full-size SUVs going on sale in 2012 and 2014, respectively, as Lancias in both European and North American markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2010-04-21-fiat-splits_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=James R. | last=Healey | title=7 new Fiat models bound for U.S.; 9 Chryslers to go abroad | date=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sales and marketing==
===Domestic sales===
It is reported that Chrysler was heavy on fleet sales in 2010, hitting as high as 56 percent of total sales in February of that year. For the whole year, 38 percent of sales of Chrysler were to fleet customers. The industry average was 19 percent. However, the company hopes to reduce its fleet sales to the industry average in 2011 with a renewed product lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= |title=Chrysler to Bring Fleet Sales in-line with Industry Average|date=2011-02-15 |author= Drew Johnson |publisher=Left Lane News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global sales===
Chrysler is the smallest of the &quot;Big Three&quot; US automakers (Chrysler Group LLC, [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[General Motors]]).
Chrysler is the world's 16th largest vehicle manufacturer as ranked by OICA in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/ranking-2009.pdf| title=World Motor Vehicle Production – World Ranking of Manufactures 2009|publisher=OICA |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total Chrysler vehicle production was about 0.96 million that year.

Chrysler plans for [[Lancia]] to codevelop products, with some vehicles being shared. Olivier Francois, Lancia's CEO, was appointed to the [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] division in October 2009. Francois plans to reestablish the Chrysler brand as an upscale brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/lancia-chrysler-to-share-products.html |title=Lancia, Chrysler to share products |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Chrysler unveil their new &quot;Imported From Detroit&quot; campaign with ads feature in Detroit Rapper [[Eminem]] airing during the Super Bowl. The campaign highlights the rejuvenation of the entire product lineup, which includes the new, redesigned and repackaged 2011 200 sedan and 200 convertible, the Chrysler 300 sedan and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gutierrez |first=Dianna  |url=http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=FF89CD493D55543EC338709865812824?&amp;id=10512&amp;mid=23 |title=Chrysler Brand Launches New Marketing and Advertising Campaign |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2011-02-06 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental initiatives==
===Electric vehicles===
The first [[Battery electric vehicle|electric]] vehicle produced by Chrysler was the 1992 [[Dodge EPIC]] concept minivan. In 1993, Chrysler began to sell a limited-production electric minivan called the [[Chrysler TEVan|TEVan]]; however, this minivan did not gain much popularity throughout its lifetime. In 1997, a second generation, called the EPIC, was released. It was discontinued after 1999.

Chrysler intended to pursue new drive concepts through [[Envi (Automobile)|ENVI]], an in-house organization formed to focus on [[electric vehicle|electric-drive vehicles]] and related technologies. Established in September, 2007, Chrysler's ENVI division led by Lou Rhodes specifically deals with new all-electric and hybrid vehicles not based on existing models.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Chrysler LLC brought a wide range of green vehicles to the [[Detroit Auto Show]], including three [[concept vehicle]]s that incorporate [[electric vehicle|electric drive]] technologies:

# The [[Dodge ZEO]] concept—short for &quot;Zero Emissions Operation&quot;—is an [[all-electric vehicle|all-electric]] [[sport wagon]] combining a 64-[[kilowatt-hour]] [[lithium-ion]] battery pack with a 200-kilowatt (268 horsepower) electric motor. The rear-wheel-drive vehicle accelerates to {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in less than six seconds and has a range of at least {{convert|250|mi|km}}. There is also a [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle|plug-in hybrid electric]] version.
# The [[Chrysler ecoVoyager]] concept combines a similar battery pack and motor with a small hydrogen fuel cell to achieve a {{convert|300|mi|adj=on}} range. The vehicle can travel about {{convert|40|mi|km}} on battery power alone and can accelerate to {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in less than eight seconds.
# The [[Jeep Renegade]] concept, a [[plug-in hybrid]], combines a lithium-ion battery pack with dual {{convert|200|kW|abbr=on}} electric motors on each axle. The Jeep can travel {{convert|40|mi|km}} on battery power alone and can travel {{convert|400|mi}} with the help of its 1.5-liter, 3-cylinder clean diesel engine. The vehicle features a lightweight aluminum architecture.

Chrysler is also currently planning at least three [[hybrid vehicle]]s, the [[Chrysler Aspen]] hybrid, [[Dodge Durango]] hybrid, and the [[Dodge Ram]] hybrid including [[Chrysler Hemi engine|HEMI]] engines. 

Chrysler has also been experimenting with a [[Diesel-electric transmission|Hybrid Diesel truck]] for military applications.

Chrysler has debuted:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Neff |first=John |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/09/23/chrysler-llc-debuts-dodge-ev-jeep-ev-and-chrysler-ev/ |title=Chrysler LLC debuts Dodge EV, Jeep EV and Chrysler EV |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm#id_11990 |title=EERE News: EERE Network News |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[Dodge EV]], an [[all-electric vehicle|all electric]] [[sports car]] based on the [[Lotus Europa]], with plans for a {{convert|120|mph|abbr=on}} top speed and a range of {{convert|150|to-|200|mi}}.
* [[plug-in hybrid vehicle]]s (PHEVs), [[wikt:jolting|jolting]] the PHEV [[mass-production]] race:&lt;ref name=&quot;calcars.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1005.html |title=Chrysler &quot;Jolts&quot; PHEV Race; PHEV Ads; V2Green Acquired |publisher=Calcars.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** the [[Chrysler EV]], a series [[plug-in hybrid]] with {{convert|40|mi|adj=on}} all-electric range, based on [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]].
** and the [[Jeep EV]], based on a Jeep Wrangler. Chrysler is exploring [[in-wheel electric motor]]s for this vehicle.

At the 2009 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit, Chrysler unveiled the [[Chrysler 200C EV|200C EV]] Concept, a sports sedan with an all-electric range of {{convert|40|mi|km}} and an extended range of about {{convert|400|mi}}. It also added the Jeep Patriot EV, another range-extended electric vehicle. If Chrysler does release an all-electric sports car in 2010, it will be in direct competition with two North American startup companies: [[Tesla Motors]] and [[Fisker Automotive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12178 |title=EERE News: Chrysler, Ford, and Other Automakers Pursue Electric Vehicles |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler's [[Envi (automobile)|ENVI]] division, which is dedicated to creating production electric drive vehicles, announced in September 2008 that Chrysler LLC will have electric vehicles in showrooms by 2010. They showed three &quot;production intent&quot; vehicles and stated that these are going to be the first of a broad portfolio of electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chryslerllc.com/en/innovation/envi/overview/ |title=Innovation – ENVI |publisher=Chrysler LLC |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler Chief Executive Bob Nardelli said government loans would help speed the electric technology to market. But if they aren't approved, Chrysler will have to spend limited resources on developing new technology and would have to make cuts elsewhere, possibly in employment and development of conventional products. &quot;Unfortunately we have had to furlough many families as a result of the economy turmoil and certainly the downward spiraling in the industry,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd like to make sure that we don't have to go further to be able to support advanced technology work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;calcars.org&quot; /&gt;

The Chrysler executives said the day is coming when the whole Chrysler fleet has electric powertrains. &quot;The goal is to achieve fundamental technology, get economies of scale, improve our ability to make the future generations more robust, less cost, smaller, more powerful, better performance,&quot; Press said. &quot;Ultimately it will lead to a transformation of our entire fleet that will be in some manner electric drive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;calcars.org&quot; /&gt;

The '''City of London''' is a small area within [[Greater London]], [[England]]. It is the historic core of [[London]] around which the modern [[conurbation]] grew and has held [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] since [[time immemorial]]. The City’s boundaries have remained almost unchanged since the [[Middle Ages]], and it is now only a tiny part of the [[metropolis]] of London, though remains a notable part of [[central London]]. It is often referred to as '''the City''' (often written on [[map]]s as &quot;City&quot;) or the '''Square Mile''', as it is just over one square mile ({{convert|1.12|sqmi|km2|2|abbr=on|lk=off|disp=/}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/nr/rdonlyres/10feeb0b-3ded-4c2d-93d1-8534fcb28cc5/0/Census%202001.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2009-04-10 | title=City of London Resident Population Census 2001 | publisher = ''Corporation of London'' | month=July | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in area. These terms are also often used as [[Metonymy|metonyms]] for the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[financial services]] industry, which has historically been based here.

In the medieval period, the City was the full extent of London. The term ''London'' now refers to a much larger conurbation roughly corresponding to Greater London, a local government area which includes 32 [[London borough]]s as well as the City of London. The local authority for the City, the [[City of London Corporation]], is unique in the United Kingdom, and has some unusual responsibilities for a local authority in Britain, such as being the police authority for the City. It also has responsibilities and ownerships beyond the City's boundaries. The Corporation is headed by the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], an office separate from (and much older than) the [[Mayor of London]].

The City is today a major business and [[financial centre]], [[Global Financial Centres Index|ranking on a par]] with [[New York City]] as the leading centre of [[global finance]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zyen.com/PDF/GFC%207.pdf#page=30 |title=Global Financial Centres 7 |publisher=[[Z/Yen]] |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the 19th century, the City served as the world's primary business centre, and continues to be a major meeting point for businesses to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;world and its people&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The City has a resident population of around 10,000, but around 330,000 people work there, mainly in the financial services sector. The legal profession forms a major component of the western side of the City, especially in [[The Temple (London)|the Temple]] and [[Chancery Lane]] areas; these are where the [[Inns of Court]] are located, of which two — [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] — fall within the City of London boundary.

==History==
{{Main|History of London}}

===Toponymy===
The [[etymology of London|name &quot;London&quot;]] is now used for a wider area than just the City of London, which is often known simply as 'The City'.  This usage is documented as far back as the 16th century. 'The City' also denotes the trading and financial community based there. In this context it is also colloqually known as 'The Square Mile'.&lt;ref name= &quot;Mills&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Dictionary of London Place Names|year=2001|surname=Mills|first= AD |publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman origins===
[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque near Southwark Bridge noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]
[[File:London 1300 Historical Atlas William R Shepherd (died 1934).PNG|thumb|right|Map of London c. 1300.]]
It is believed that [[Roman London]] was established as a trading port by merchants on the tidal [[River Thames|Thames]] around 47 AD. The new settlement and port was centred where the shallow valley of the [[Walbrook]] meets the Thames. However in AD 60 or 61, little more than ten years after ''Londinium'' was founded, it was sacked by the [[Iceni]], led by the their queen [[Boudica]].  Londinium was rebuilt as a planned settlement (a ''[[civitas]]'') soon after and the new town was prosperous and grew to become the largest settlement in [[Roman Britain]] by the end of the 1st century. By the beginning of the 2nd century, Londinium had replaced [[Camulodunum|Colchester]] as the capital of Roman Britain (&quot;''Britannia''&quot;).

At its height, the Roman city had a population of approximately 45,000–60,000 inhabitants. The Romans built the [[London Wall]] some time between 190 and 225. The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though Londinium did not extend further west than [[Ludgate]]/the [[River Fleet]] and the Thames was considerably wider than it is today, thus the shoreline of the city was north of its present position. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as 50 AD, near to where [[London Bridge]] stands.

A number of Roman sites and artefacts can be seen in the City of London today, including the [[London Mithraeum| Temple of Mithras]], sections of the London Wall (at the Barbican and near the Tower of London), the [[London Stone]] and remains of the amphitheatre beneath the Guildhall. The [[Museum of London]], located in the City, holds many of the Roman finds and has permanent Roman exhibitions, as well as being a source of information on Roman London generally.

===Decline===
By the time of the construction of the London Wall, the city's fortunes were in decline, with problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including for example the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in 410 AD the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled ''Londinium'' to [[Lundenwic]] (&quot;London market&quot;), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.

===Anglo-Saxon restoration===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}

During the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came under the Kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and then later [[Wessex]], though was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]] and [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danes]].

[[Alfred the Great]], [[King of Wessex]] and arguably the first king of the 'English', occupied and began the resettlement of the old [[Roman Empire|Roman]] walled area, in [[886]], and  appointed his son-in-law [[Earl Aethelred of Mercia|Earl Æthelred of Mercia]] over it as part of their reconquest of the Viking occupied parts of England. The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] (&quot;London Fort&quot;, a [[borough]]). The historian Asser stated that &quot;Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, restored the city of London splendidly ... and made it habitable once more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Asser's ''Life of King Alfred'', ch. 83, trans. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred &amp; Other Contemporary Sources'' (Penguin Classics) (1984), pp. 97-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred's &quot;restoration&quot; entailed reoccupying and refurbishing the nearly deserted Roman walled city, building quays along the Thames, and laying a new city street plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Vince|Vince, Alan]], ''Saxon London: An Archaeological Investigation'', The Archaeology of London series (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred's taking of London and the rebuilding of the old Roman city was a marking point in history, not only as the permanent establishment of the City of London, but also as part of a unifying moment in early English history, with Wessex becoming the dominant English kingdom and the repealing (to some degree) of the Viking occupation and raids. Whilst London, and indeed England, afterwards would continue to come under further periods of Viking and Dane raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. London Bridge, which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of ''Londinium'', was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.

As the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the &quot;old settlement&quot;). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the &quot;old market-place&quot;), now a name given to a street and an area which lies in the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.

Following the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] marched on London, to [[Southwark]] and failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners.  He eventually crossed the River Thames at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], pillaging the land as he went. Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar Atheling|Edgar Ætheling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar, Earl of Northumbria|Morcar of Northumbria]] surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William rewarded London in granting the citizens a charter in 1075; the City of London was one of the few institutions where the English retained some authority. The City was not covered by the [[Domesday Book]].

William ensured against attack by building three castles nearby, to keep the Londoners subdued:

* [[Tower of London]]
* [[Baynard's Castle]]
* [[Montfichet's Castle]]

In 1132, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] recognised full [[county corporate|County]] status for the City, and by 1141 the whole body of the [[citizen]]ry was considered to constitute a single community. This 'commune' was the origin of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the citizens gained the right to appoint, with the king's consent, a Mayor in 1189 and to directly elect the Mayor from 1215.

The City continues to be composed of [[Wards of the City of London|25 ancient wards]], each headed by an [[Alderman]], who chair the Wardmotes. There was a [[Folkmoot]] for the whole of the city held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Many of the medieval positions and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique institution which the City, and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]], is.

The City was burned severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and then again (and more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.

By the late 16th century London increasingly became a major centre for banking and international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] to act as a centre of [[commerce]] for London's merchants and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre for the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street.

===Growth of London===
[[Image:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|right|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]
The 18th century was a period of rapid growth for London, reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].

In 1708 [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. However, the first service had been held on 2 December 1697; more than 10 years earlier. This Cathedral replaced the original St. Paul's which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London and is considered to be one of the finest in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].

Expansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.

===19th &amp; 20th centuries===
[[File:Stpaulsblitz.jpg|thumb|right|St Paul's Cathedral surviving the [[Blitz]].]]
An attempt was made in 1894 to [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London|amalgamate the City and the surrounding County of London]], but it did not succeed. The City of London therefore survived, and does so to this day, despite its situation within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Regarding representation to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the City elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], which it retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]] and into the 20th century. Today it is included wholly in the [[Cities of London and Westminster]] constituency, and statute requires that it not be divided between two neighbouring areas.

The City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century as people moved outwards to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]] and many houses were demolished to make way for modern office blocks. The largest residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. Here a major proportion of the City's population now live. The [[Museum of London]] is located here, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.

The City, like many areas of London and other British cities, fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], in what is known as [[The Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the City did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]]. A major rebuilding programme therefore occurred in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the City's urban landscape. The destruction of the City's older historic fabric however allowed, and continues to allow, the construction of modern and larger-scale developments in parts of the City, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage, the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in certain places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].

The 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot, 42-storey [[Natwest Tower]], which became the first [[skyscraper]] in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts of the City, with further skyscrapers being built including [[30 St Mary Axe]], [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. A fifth, the [[Bishopsgate Tower]] is set to begin rising in late 2010, and will overtake the Heron Tower to become the tallest building in the City of London, and the second tallest in Britain after the under-construction [[Shard of Glass]] at [[London Bridge Station]].

===Arms, motto and flag===
The Corporation of the City of London has a full [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] of armorial bearings consisting of a shield on which the arms are displayed, a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] displayed on a helm above the shield, [[supporters]] on either side and a motto displayed on a scroll beneath the arms.
&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first= Geoffrey |title=Civic and Corporate Heraldry: A Dictionary of Impersonal Arms of England, Wales and Northern Ireland |year=1971 |publisher=Heraldry Today |location=London |isbn=0900455217 |page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name=bening&gt;{{cite book|last=Beningfield|first=Thomas James|title=London, 1900-1964: Armorial bearings and regalia of the London County Council, the Corporation of London and the Metropolitan Boroughs|year=1964|publisher=J Burrow &amp; Co Ltd|location=Cheltenham and London|pages=21-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=arms/&gt;

The [[blazon]] of the arms is as follows:&lt;ref name=arms/&gt; &lt;ref name=briggs/&gt; &lt;ref name=bening/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Arms:''' ''Argent a cross gules, in the first quarter a sword in pale point upwards of the last.&lt;br&gt;
'''Crest:''' ''On a wreath argent and gules a dragon's sinister wing argent charged on the underside with a cross throughout gules.''&lt;br&gt;
'''Supporters:''' ''On either side a dragon argent charged on the undersides of the wings with a cross throughout gules.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[coat of arms]] of is &quot;[[time immemorial|anciently recorded]]&quot; at the [[College of Arms]]. They were in use in 1381, as they formed part of the design of a new mayoralty seal taken into use on the 17 April of that year. These arms consist of a white shield bearing a red cross with a red upright sword in the first quarter. The design combines the emblems of the patron saints of England and London: the [[Cross of St George]] with the symbol of the martyrdom of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]. The 1381 arms replaced an earlier shield, found on a charter of 1319, that depicted St Paul holding a sword.&lt;ref name=bening/&gt; &lt;ref name=arms/&gt; The sword is often erroneously supposed to commemorate the killing of [[Peasants' Revolt]] leader [[Wat Tyler]] by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] [[William Walworth]]. However the arms were in use some months before Tyler's death, and the tradition that Walworth's dagger is depicted may date from the late 17th century.&lt;ref name=sgiles/&gt; &lt;ref name=foxdavies/&gt; &lt;ref name=bening/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;crosley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosley|first=Richard|title=London's Coats Of Arms And The Stories They Tell|year=1928|publisher=Robert Scott|location=London|pages=14-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crest and supporters came into use in the 17th century but were used without authority until 30 April 1957 when they were confirmed and granted by [[letters patent]] from the College of Arms.&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt; &lt;ref name=bening/&gt; &lt;ref name=arms/&gt;

The crest is a dragon's wing bearing the cross of St George, borne upon a [[peerage of the United Kingdom|peer's]] helm. A primitive form of the crest first appeared in 1539 on the reverse of a new common seal. This showed a fan-like object bearing a cross. Over time this evolved into a dragon's wing, and was shown as such in 1633 when it appeared above the city's coat of arms in the frontispiece to the fourth edition of [[John Stow]]'s ''Survey of London''. It has been speculated that the use of a peer's helmet (rather than that of a gentleman, used in other civic arms) relates to the use of the [[honorific]] prefix &quot;[[The Right Honourable]]&quot; by the Lord Mayor.&lt;ref name=foxdavies/&gt; The helm was confirmed in 1957.&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt;

On the seal of 1381 two lions were shown supporting the arms. However, by 1609 the present supporters, two white dragons bearing red crosses upon their wings, had been adopted.&lt;ref name=arms/&gt; &lt;ref name=foxdavies/&gt; The dragons were probably suggested by the legend of [[St George and the Dragon]].&lt;ref name=bening/&gt; &lt;ref name=sgiles&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott-Giles |first=C Wilfrid |authorlink=Wilfrid Scott-Giles |title=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition |year=1953 |publisher=[[J.

The [[Latin]] motto of the City of London is &quot;''Domine dirige nos''&quot;, which translates as &quot;''Lord, direct (guide) us''&quot;. It appears to have been adopted in the 17th century, as the earliest record of it is was first recorded in 1633.&lt;ref name=&quot;arms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65DC8039-12C4-4AC4-8DAD-16F1608E99B7/0/cityarms.PDF|title=The City Arms|publisher=Corporation of London Records Office|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}
The City of London has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]]. Historically its system of government was not unusual, but it was not reformed by the [[Municipal Reform Act 1835]] and little changed by later reforms.

It is administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (not the same as the more recently created position of [[Mayor of London]]), which is responsible for a number of functions and owns a number of locations beyond the City's boundaries. Unlike other modern-day English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the now largely-ceremonial [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The Court of Aldermen represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of their size) returning one Alderman. The [[Chief Executive]] of the administrative side of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].

The City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]], although it has a Commission of Lieutenancy, headed by the Lord Mayor, instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]]. The City also has (instead of a [[High Sheriff]]) [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]], which are quasi-judicial offices and who are appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], another ancient political system (based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades]]) still extant in the City. Senior members of the Livery Companies are known as [[Liveryman|Liverymen]] and form a special electorate called the Common Hall — this body chooses the Lord Mayor of the City, the Sheriffs and certain other officers.

===Wards===
{{Main|Wards of the City of London}}
The City is made up of [[:Category:Wards of the City of London|25 wards]], which had their boundaries changed in 2003, though the number of wards and their names did not change. They are survivors of the mediaeval governmental system that allowed a very local area to exist as a self governing enclave within the wider city.&lt;ref&gt;The City of London - a history Borer, M.I.C. : New York,D.McKay Co, 1978 ISBN 0094618801 p112&lt;/ref&gt; They can be described as being both electoral/political divisions and permanent ceremonial, geographic and administrative entities within/sub-divisions of the City. Each ward has an [[Alderman]], who traditionally held office for life but in the modern era put themselves up for re-election at least every 6 years. Wards continue to have [[Beadle]]s, ancient functionary offices that are largely ceremonial in the modern era, the main remaining function being the running of the [[Wardmote]], an annual meeting in each ward of electors, representatives and officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/annual_wardmotes.htm City of London Corporation] Ward Motes&lt;/ref&gt; At the Wardmote the ward's Alderman appoints at least one Deputy for the year ahead. Each ward also has a Ward Club, which is similar to a [[residents' association]] found elsewhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundaries.htm City of London Corporation] Ward Boundaries, Beadles and Clubs&lt;/ref&gt;

The wards are ancient and their number has only changed three times since [[time immemorial]]: in 1394 [[Farringdon, London|Farringdon]] was divided into Farringdon Within and Farringdon Without; in 1550 the creation of Bridge Without, [[Southwark|south of the river]], with the ward of Bridge becoming Bridge Within;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/gh/11ii.htm Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section] City of London wards&lt;/ref&gt; and the merger of Bridge wards Within and Without, in 1978, into the present-day [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bridgewardclub.org.uk/ward%20of%20bridge.html Bridge Ward Club] History of the Bridge wards&lt;/ref&gt;

Following changes to the City of London's boundary in 1994 and later reform of the business vote in the City, a major boundary and electoral representation revision took place to the wards in 2003. The ward boundaries and electoral representation were reviewed again in 2010 for change in 2013, though not to such a dramatic extent. The review was conducted by senior officers of the Corporation and senior judges of the [[Old Bailey]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm Corporation of London] Ward Boundary Review (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the wards are not reviewed by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] under the [[Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986]] and (unlike with other local government electoral reviews in the country) the number and the names of the wards do not change. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with specific wards, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], or London Bridge with Bridge. Boundary changes in 2003 did remove some of these connected places from their wards, but that boundary review and the current review do take into account of these historic/traditional connections.

Current arrangements are that each ward elects an [[Alderman]], to the [[Court of Aldermen]] and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies (from 2 to 10) and depends on the size of the ward, in terms of the number of eligible votes. Since the 2003 review it is agreed that the four residential wards send 20 of the 100 Commoners, with the business-dominated wards returning the remaining allocation of 80 Commoners. Four of the wards are today regarded as being primarily residential, and recent boundary changes have reinforced this. They are: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]].

===Elections===
The City has a unique electoral system. Most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City. Its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters. In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.

The principal justification for the non-resident vote is that about 330,000 non-residents constitute the city's day-time population and use most of its services, far outnumbering the City's residents, who are fewer than 10,000. Nevertheless, the system has long been the cause of controversy.  The business vote was abolished in all other [[United Kingdom|UK]] local authority elections in 1969.

A private act of Parliament in 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/locact02/20020006.htm HMSO ''City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002 (2002 Chapter vi)'']&lt;/ref&gt; reformed the voting system for electing Members to the Corporation of London and received the [[Royal Assent]] on 7 November 2002. Under the new system, the number of non-resident voters has doubled from 16,000 to 32,000. Previously disfranchised firms (and other organizations) are entitled to nominate voters, in addition to those already represented, and all such bodies are now required to choose their voters in a representative fashion.

Bodies employing fewer than ten people may appoint one voter; those employing ten to 50 people may appoint one voter for every five employees; those employing more than 50 people may appoint ten voters and one additional voter for each 50 employees beyond the first 50.

The Act also removed other anomalies that had developed within the City's system, which had been unchanged since the 1850s.

===The Temple===
[[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] (which neighbour each other) are two of the few remaining [[Liberty (division)|liberties]], an old name for a geographic division. They are independent [[extra-parochial area]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agi.org.uk/SITE/UPLOAD/DOCUMENT/Events/AGI2009/papers/MartinLaker.pdf Association for Geographic Information] What place is that then? (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; historically not governed by the [[City of London Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1996/pdf/ukla_19960004_en.pdf City of London (Approved Premises for Marriage) Act 1996] &quot;By ancient custom the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple exercise powers within the areas of the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple respectively (&quot;the Temples&quot;) concerning (''inter alia'') the regulation and governance of the Temples&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (and are today regarded as local authorities for most purposes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middletemple.org.uk/the_inn/middle-temple-as-a-local-authority.html Middle Temple] as a local authority&lt;/ref&gt;) and equally outside the [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction]] of the [[Bishop of London]]. They geographically fall within the boundaries and liberties of the City, but can be thought of as independent [[enclave]]s. They are both part of the [[Farringdon Without]] ward of the City.

===Other functions===
[[Image:Leadenhall Market In London - Feb 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leadenhall Market]], just off [[Gracechurch Street]]]]
Within the City, the Corporation owns and runs both the [[Smithfield Market]] and [[Leadenhall Market]]. The Corporation owns and is responsible for a number of locations beyond the boundaries of the City. These include [[Corporation of London open spaces|various open spaces]] (parks, forests and commons) in and around greater London, including most of [[Epping Forest]], [[Hampstead Heath]] and many public spaces in [[Northern Ireland]] through [[The Honourable The Irish Society]].  It also owns [[Old Spitalfields Market]] and [[Billingsgate Fish Market]], both of which are within the neighbouring London Borough of [[Tower Hamlets]]. The Corporation also owns and helps fund the [[Old Bailey]], the Central Criminal Court for [[England and Wales]], as a gift to the nation, it having begun as the City and Middlesex Sessions.

The City has its own independent police force, the [[City of London Police]] - the Common Council (the main body of the Corporation) is the [[police authority]]. The rest of Greater London is policed by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], based at [[Scotland Yard|New Scotland Yard]].

The City of London has one hospital, [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Founded in 1123 and commonly known as 'Barts', the hospital is at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], and is  undergoing a long-awaited regeneration after many doubts as to it continuing in use during the 1990s.

The City is the third largest UK funding-patron of the arts. It oversees the [[Barbican Centre]] and subsidises several important performing arts companies.

The [[Port of London]]'s health authority is also the responsibility of the Corporation, which includes the handling of imported cargo at [[London Heathrow]] airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/port_health/ Port Health Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; The Corporation oversees the running of the [[Bridge House Trust]], which maintains five key bridges in central London, [[London Bridge]], [[Blackfriars Bridge]], [[Southwark Bridge]], [[Tower Bridge]] and the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]]. The [[Flag of the City of London|City's flag]] flies over Tower Bridge, although neither footing is in the City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishflags.net/cityoflondon.html britishflags.net- City of London]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes to boundary===
[[Image:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Dragon]] statue atop the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]].]]
The size of the City was constrained by a defensive perimeter wall, known as [[London Wall]], which was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the late 2nd century to protect their strategic port city. However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement - the [[River Fleet]] - along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other &quot;City bars&quot; which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.

The walls have almost entirely disappeared, although several sections remain visible. A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on 29 December 1940 at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]]. The River Fleet was [[canal]]ised after the Great Fire of 1666 and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the 18th century one of London's &quot;[[Subterranean rivers of London|lost rivers]]&quot;, today running entirely underground as a [[storm drain]].

The boundary of the City then remained fixed until minor boundary changes in 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary in places where its course had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In the process the City lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain of land (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate|Broadgate estate]] entirely in the City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], came within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]]. The City's administrative responsibility there, however, had in practice disappeared by the mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] period as various aspects of metropolitan government were extended into the neighbouring areas. Today it forms part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. The [[Tower of London]] has always been outside the City and today comes under the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]].

==Geography==
[[Image:City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The Tower of London, [[Tower Millennium Pier]] and the City's financial core, as seen from [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in 2008.]]
The City of London is England's [[List of ceremonial counties of England|smallest ceremonial county]] by area and population, and the fourth most densely populated. Of the [[Districts of England|326 English districts]], it is the second smallest [[List of English districts by population|by population]], after the [[Isles of Scilly]], and the smallest [[List of English districts by area|by area]]. It can also be regarded as the [[List of smallest cities in the United Kingdom|second smallest]] [[City status in the United Kingdom|British city]] in population, after [[St David's]] in [[Wales]].

===Boundary===
[[Image:City of London map 01.svg|thumb|right|Borders of the City of London, showing surrounding [[London borough]]s and the pre-1994 boundary (where changed) in red. The area covered by the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple]] is marked.]]
Beginning in the west, where the City borders Westminster, the boundary crosses the [[Victoria Embankment]] from the Thames, passes to the west of [[Middle Temple]], then turns for a short distance along [[Strand, London|Strand]] and then north up [[Chancery Lane]], where it borders Camden. It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]]. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent of the City. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]], so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]] from the City, and then reaches the river. The City's boundary then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that the entire span of [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; additionally the City controls the full span of [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.

The boundaries of the City are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and at major entrances, such as at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] on Fleet Street, a grander monument, with a dragon facing outwards, marks the boundary.

[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundaries_map.htm Official boundary map, with wards.]

In some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the political boundaries of the City, notably to the north and east, into the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Islington, and informally these locations are seen as part of the &quot;Square Mile&quot;. Since the 1990s the eastern fringe of the City, extending into Hackney and Tower Hamlets, has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the availability of large sites there compared to within the City.

===Gardens and public art===
{{See also|List of public art in the City of London}}
[[File:Finsbury Circus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Finsbury Circus]], the largest public open space in the City, as seen from Tower 42]]
The City has no sizeable [[park]]s within its boundary, but does have a network of a large number of gardens and small open spaces, many of which are maintained by the Corporation. These range from formal gardens such as the one in [[Finsbury Circus]], containing a [[bowling green]] and [[bandstand]], to churchyards such as one belonging to the church of [[St Olave Hart Street|St. Olave Hart Street]], to water features and artwork found in some of the courtyards and pedestrianised lanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardensofthecityoflondon.co.uk Gardens of the City of London]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardens include:
* Barber-Surgeon's Hall Garden, London Wall
* Cleary Garden, [[Queen Victoria Street]]
* [[Finsbury Circus]], Blomfield Street/London Wall/[[Moorgate]]
* [[Jubilee Garden]], [[Houndsditch]]
* Portsoken Street Garden, Portsoken Street/Goodman's Yard
* [[Postman's Park]], [[Little Britain, London|Little Britain]]/[[Aldersgate]]
* Seething Lane Garden, Seething Lane
* [[St Dunstan-in-the-East|St. Dunstan-in-the-East]], St. Dunstan's Hill/Idol Lane
* [[St Mary Aldermanbury|St. Mary Aldermanbury]], [[Aldermanbury]]
* St. Olave Hart Street churchyard, Seething Lane
* St. Paul's churchyard, [[St Paul's Cathedral]]
* West Smithfield Garden, [[Smithfield, London|West Smithfield]]
* Whittington Gardens, College Street/[[Upper Thames Street]]

Additionally there are a number of private gardens and open spaces, found often within courtyards of the larger commercial developments. Two of the largest private gardens are those of the [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] Inns of Court, in the far southwest of the City.

The Thames and its riverside walks are increasingly being valued as open space for the City and in recent years efforts have been made to increase the ability for pedestrians to access and walk along the river.

==Public services==
===Police and security===

The City is a [[police area]] and has its own [[territorial police force]], the [[City of London Police]], which is a separate organisation to the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] which covers the remainder of Greater London. The City Police have three [[police station]]s, located at Snow Hill, [[Wood Street, London|Wood Street]] and [[Bishopsgate]], and has 813 [[police officer]]s, 85 [[Special Constables]] and 48 [[Police Community Support Officer|PCSOs]]. Covering just the City of London, it is the smallest territorial police force in [[England and Wales]], both in terms of geographic area and the number of police officers.

Where the majority of British police forces have silver-coloured badges, those of the City Police are black and gold featuring the City crest. The force also have a unique red and white chequered cap bands and red and white striped duty arm bands on the sleeve of the tunics of constables and sergeants (red and white being the colours of the City of London), which in most other British police forces are black and white. City police sergeants and constables wear crested [[Custodian helmet|helmets]] whilst on foot patrol. These helmets do not feature the [[Brunswick Star]], which is used on most other police helmets in England and Wales.

The City's position as the United Kingdom's financial centre and a critical part of the country's economy, contributing about 2.5% of the UK's [[gross national product]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm Key facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in it becoming a target for political violence. The [[Provisional IRA]] exploded several [[bomb]]s in the City in the early 1990s, including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]].

The area is also spoken of as a possible target for [[al-Qaeda]]. For instance, when in May 2004 the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme examined the preparedness of Britain's emergency services for a terrorist attack on the scale of [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], they simulated a chemical explosion on [[Bishopsgate]] in the east of the City.

The [[Ring of steel (London)|&quot;Ring of Steel&quot;]] is a particularly notable measure, established in the wake of the IRA bombings, that has been taken against terrorist threats.

===Fire brigade===
{{Main|London Fire Brigade}}
[[Image:LFBstn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dowgate]] [[fire station]]]]
The City has fire risks in many places, including [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's Cathedral]], [[The Old Bailey]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], [[Smithfield Market]], the [[Bank of England]], the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], [[Tower 42]] (formerly the NatWest Tower) and [[30 St. Mary Axe]] (The Gherkin). There is one London Fire Brigade station within the City, at Dowgate, with one pumping [[Fire appliances in the United Kingdom|appliance]].&lt;ref name = &quot;zlqtbi&quot;&gt;[http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/media/City_of_London.pdf London Fire Brigade - City of London Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; The City relies upon stations in the surrounding London boroughs to support it at some incidents. Within the City the first fire engine is in attendance in roughly five minutes on average, the second when required in a little over five and a half minutes.&lt;ref name = &quot;zlqtbi&quot;/&gt; There were 1,814 incidents attended in the City in 2006/2007 - the lowest in Greater London amongst the 32 London boroughs. No one has died in an event arising from a fire in the City in the last four years prior to 2007.&lt;ref name = &quot;zlqtbi&quot;/&gt;

== Demography ==
[[Image:Population of the City of London over time.png|thumb|Population between 1800 and 2000]]
In June 2010, the [[Office for National Statistics]] estimated that the City of London's population for mid-2009 was 11,500;&lt;ref name=&quot;2009pop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/mid-09-uk-eng-wales-scot-northern-ireland-24-06-10.zip|format=zip|title=Mid-2009 Population Estimates: Quinary age groups and sex for local authorities in the United Kingdom|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]|date=2010-06-24|accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4,315 more people than that of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|last census]] from 2001, which indicated that the City had a population of 7,185.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00aa.asp|title=City of London Census 2001 profile|accessdate=2010-10-23|work=[[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]]|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the 2001 UK census, the ethnic composition of the City was 84.6% [[White people|White]], 6.8% [[British Asian|South Asian]], 2.6% [[Black British|Black]], 2.3% [[British Mixed-Race|Mixed]], 2.0% [[British Chinese|Chinese]] and 1.7% were listed as &quot;[[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|other]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot; /&gt; To the right is a graph showing the change in population of the City since 1801 based [[Census in the United Kingdom|decadal censuses]]. The first half of the 19th century shows a population staying between 120,000-140,000 people, however the population decays exponentially from 1851 to 1991, with a small increase in population between 1991 and 2001. The only notable boundary changes to the City since the first census in 1801 occurred in 1994.

The City of London's full-time working residents have much higher gross weekly pay compared to [[London]] and Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): £773.30 compared to £598.60 and £491.00 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/report.aspx?town=city%20of%20london#tabrespop|title=Labour Market Profile: City of London|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]|work=nomis|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting, however, that there is a large inequality between genders (£1,085.90 in men compared to £653.50 in women).&lt;ref name=nomis /&gt; The 2001 Census showed the City of London as a unique district amongst 376 districts surveyed in [[List of English districts|England]] and Wales.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; The City had the highest proportional population increase, households without a car or van, one-person households, people with qualifications at degree level or higher and the highest overcrowding indicator.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; It recorded the lowest proportion of households with cars or vans, married couple households, people who travel to work by car and the lowest average household size; just 1.58 people.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; It was also ranked highest within London for percentage of people with no religion and people who are employed.&lt;ref name=census /&gt;

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of London}}
[[Image:London.bankofengland.arp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bank of England]], on [[Threadneedle Street]], is the central bank of the [[United Kingdom]].]]
The City vies with [[New York City]] as the [[financial centre|financial capital]] of the world and many banking and insurance institutions have their headquarters there. The [[London Stock Exchange]] ([[shares]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]),  [[Lloyd's of London]] ([[insurance]]) and the [[Bank of England]] are all based in the City. Over 500 [[bank]]s have offices in the City, and the City is an established leader in trading in [[Eurobonds]], [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], [[energy]] [[Futures contract|futures]] and global insurance. The [[Alternative Investment Market]], a market for trades in [[Equity investment|equities]] of smaller firms, is a recent development. In 2008, the City of London accounted for 4% of UK [[GDP]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

London is the world's greatest [[foreign exchange market]], with much of the trade conducted in the City of London. Of the $3.98 trillion daily global turnover, as measured in 2007, trading in London accounted for around $1.36 trillion, or 34.1% of the total.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIS_survey&quot;&gt;[http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfxf07t.pdf BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey], published in December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pound Sterling]], the currency of the United Kingdom, is globally the fourth most traded currency and the third most held [[reserve currency]].

Since 1991 [[Canary Wharf]], a few miles east of the City in Tower Hamlets, has become a second centre for London's financial services industry and houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile. This development does not appear to have damaged the City: growth has continued in both locations.

===Headquarters===
[[Image:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|[[Paternoster Square]], home of the [[London Stock Exchange]]]]
Many major global companies have their headquarters in the City, including [[Aviva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|title=Contact us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Aviva}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BT Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|title=Contact BT|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=BT Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyds Banking Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|title=Company Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Lloyds Banking Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Mutual]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|title=Investor Relations Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Old Mutual}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prudential plc|Prudential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|title=Contact|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Prudential}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Chartered Bank|Standard Chartered]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|title=Contact Us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Standard Chartered}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Unilever PLC|Unilever]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx Unilever registered offices].&quot; [[Unilever]]. Retrieved on 5 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the world's largest law firms are headquartered in the City, including [[Allen &amp; Overy]], [[Clifford Chance]] , [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[DLA Piper]], [[Hogan Lovells]], [[Linklaters]] and [[Slaughter &amp; May]].

===Non-financial diversification===
The trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites. The City has a target of 90 additional dwellings per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm City of London Corporation] Core Strategy&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre-[[World War II]] [[listed building]]s, which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment.

Since the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the City's first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010. However, large sections of the City remain very quiet at weekends, especially those areas in the eastern section of the City, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pub]]s and cafes closed on these days. The new centre at One New Change however is open 7 days a week.

===Other sectors===
Whilst the financial sector, and related businesses and institutions, continue to dominate the City, the City's economy is not limited to that sector. The legal profession has a strong presence in the City, especially in the western half (i.e. towards the [[Inns of Court]]). Retail businesses were once important in the City, but have gradually moved to the [[West End of London]], though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at [[Cheapside]] near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the [[Barbican Centre]] and adjacent [[Museum of London]], though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the &quot;night-time&quot; economy does feature in the Bishopsgate area, towards [[Shoreditch]]. The meat market [[Smithfield Market|at Smithfield]], wholly within the City's boundaries, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest [[butcher|meat market]]. In the east of the City is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.

==Landmarks==
===Historic buildings===
Fire, bombing and post-[[World War II|War]] redevelopment has meant that the City, despite its history, has relatively few intact notable historic structures remaining. Those that are present today include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] (&quot;the Monument&quot;), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and also in the Barbican area. The [[Tower of London]] is not within the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City.

Other landmark buildings include a number of the modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], the [[Lloyd's building]], and the [[Barbican Estate]].

===Skyscrapers===

====Completed====
A growing number of tall buildings and [[skyscraper]]s exist in the City, principally for use by the financial sector. Almost all are situated in the eastern side of the Square Mile, in what is the City's financial core. In the north of the City there is a smaller cluster comprising the [[Barbican Estate]]'s three tall residential towers and the commercial CityPoint tower — another residential tower at Milton Court is under construction adjacent to CityPoint. In 2007, the 100&amp;nbsp;m (328&amp;nbsp;ft) tall [[Drapers' Gardens]] building was demolished and replaced by a shorter tower. The thirteen tallest buildings (those taller than 100[[metre|m]]) at present in the City are:

[[File:Mill.bridge.from.tate.modern.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]], looking north towards St. Paul's Cathedral and the City.]]

===Rail===
The City is well served by the [[London Underground]] network, as well as the [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR), with 12 [[List of London Underground stations|tube stations]] (counting Bank and Monument stations separately) and 2 [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations|DLR stations]] within its boundary. Three [[National Rail]] termini stations are located in the City, at [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]], [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] and [[Cannon Street station|Cannon Street]], and [[London Bridge station]] is on the other end of London Bridge in Southwark. The [[Thameslink]] mainline runs north-south through the western half of the City, with two stations within the City boundary: [[City Thameslink railway station|City Thameslink]] and [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]]. As well as being an Underground station, [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]] is the terminus of the [[Northern City Line]]. The whole of the City of London lies in [[Travelcard Zone 1]].

The high capacity west-east [[Crossrail]] railway line, which is scheduled to be completed by 2017, will run underground across the north of the City, with two stations at [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]] (linked also to [[Barbican station|Barbican]]) and Liverpool Street (linked also to Moorgate).

===Road===
The national [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], [[A3 road|A3]], and [[A4 road (England)|A4]] road routes begin in the City of London. The entirety of the City lies within the [[London congestion charge]] zone, with the small exception on the eastern boundary of the parts of the A1210/A1211 routes which form part of the [[Inner Ring Road, London|inner ring road]]. The following bridges, listed west to east (heading downstream), cross the [[River Thames]] from the City of London to the southern bank: [[Blackfriars Bridge]], [[Blackfriars Railway Bridge]], [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] (footbridge), [[Southwark Bridge]], [[Cannon Street Railway Bridge]] and [[London Bridge]]. The famous landmark, the [[Tower Bridge]], is not in the City of London. The City, like most of central London, is well [[Buses in London|served by buses]], including night buses. Two bus stations are located in the City, at [[Aldgate bus station|Aldgate]] on the eastern border with Tower Hamlets, and at [[Liverpool Street bus station|Liverpool Street]] by the railway station there. There are approximately 28 [[Barclays Cycle Hire]] docking stations in the City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.barclayscyclehire.tfl.gov.uk/maps Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme] map of docking station locations&lt;/ref&gt; A number of existing and proposed cycle routes criss-cross the City, as part of the [[London Cycle Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londoncyclenetwork.org.uk/uploaded_files/library/documents/A0_City_v7.pdf London Cycle Network] City of London cycle map&lt;/ref&gt;

===River===
One [[London River Services]] pier exists on the Thames along the City of London shore, the [[Blackfriars Millennium Pier]], though the [[Tower Millennium Pier]] lies adjacent to the City's boundary, near the Tower of London. One of the [[Port of London]]'s 25 [[safeguarded wharf]]s in central London, [[Walbrook Wharf]], is located on the City of London's shore, adjacent to Cannon Street station, and is used by the Corporation of London to transfer waste via the river. Swan Lane Pier, just upstream of London Bridge on the City shore, is proposed to be replaced and upgraded for regular passenger services. This work is planned to take place in the period 2012-2015. Before then, Tower Pier is to be extended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/pdf/River_Thames_Pier_Plan_Diagram_9_1.pdf River Thames Pier Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

A public riverside walk exists along the entire shoreline of the City, having been instigated in stages in recent years, with the only remaining section not running along the river being a short stretch at [[Queenhithe]]. The walk runs along Walbrook Wharf and is only closed to pedestrians at this point when waste is being transferred onto barges.

==Education==
[[Image:KCLMaughanLibrary2.jpg|thumb|[[The Maughan Library]], [[King's College London]]]]
The City has only one directly maintained primary school,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/Education/schools/schools.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match Schools&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John Cass's Foundation Primary School at [[Aldgate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/Education/schools/primary_schools.htm Primary schools&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (ages 4 to 11). It is a Voluntary-Aided (VA) [[Church of England]] school, maintained by the Education Service of the City of London.

City residents may send their children to schools in neighbouring [[Local Education Authority|Local Education Authorities]], such as [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]].

The City controls three very well regarded{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[independent schools]], [[City of London School]] (a boys school) and [[City of London School for Girls]] (girls) which are in the City itself, and the [[City of London Freemen's School]] (co-educational day and boarding) which is in [[Ashtead]], [[Surrey]]. The City of London School for Girls has its own preparatory department for entrance at age seven. It is also the principal sponsor of the [[City of London Academy]] which is based in Southwark.

The City is also home to the renowned [[Cass Business School]], the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] and parts of three of the [[universities in London]]: [[The Maughan Library]] of [[King's College London#Strand campus|King's College London's Strand Campus]], and the business school of [[London Metropolitan University]]. A third business school in the City is a campus of the [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business]] at Ropemaker Place. [[The College of Law]] has its London campus in [[Moorgate]].

=== Public libraries ===
Libraries operated by the City of London Corporation include Barbican Library, Camomile Street Library, City Business Library, Guildhall Library, and Shoe Lane Library.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Libraries/City_of_London_libraries/index.htm City of London libraries].&quot; ''City of London''. Retrieved on 13 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The City of London has been granted various special privileges since the Norman Conquest such as the right to run its own affairs &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Local_history_and_heritage/development.htm Development of local government] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wattpad.com/9747-the-corporation-of-london-its-rights-and?p=1 The Corporation of London, it's right and privileges]&lt;/ref&gt; partly due to the power of its financial capital. These are also mentioned by the Statute of William and Mary in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46790 Statute of William and Mary], confirming the Privileges of the Corporation, A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, voting rights for the City of London’s municipal authority are granted to its 32,000 business in addition to residents which now number less than 9000. This unique patronage system ensures that business interests usually take priority. Despite this, multiple attempts to reform the City have been thwarted, and maintaining these privileges is the role of an unelected official lobbyist in Parliament called the Remembrancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2011/02/london-corporation-city New Statesman, The tax haven in the heart of Britain], Nicholas Shaxson, 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The power and influence of the City over government policy has enraged democratically elected leaders down the ages. For example, the former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, wrote “Over and over again we have seen that there is in this country another power than that which has its seat at Westminster. The City of London, a convenient term for a collection of financial interests, is able to assert itself against the Government of the country. Those who control money can pursue a policy at home and abroad contrary to that which has been decided by the people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clement Atlee The Labour Party in Perspective, p179&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, following the financial crises of the late 2000s, the City came in for criticism due to an apparent lack of control and regulation. It is also claimed that many of the recent financial catastrophes which were partly caused by a lack of such controls, can be traced to companies who work in the City, or London based offices.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Shaxson - ''Treasure Islands – Tax havens and the men who stole the world'' – P.249 Chapter 12 Griffin The City of London Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

English secretive trust laws and strong libel laws are two factors that make the City an attractive offshore haven for the assets of foreign business. Eva Joly states “The City of London that state within a state’ has never transmitted even the smallest piece of usable evidence to a foreign magistrate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.fr/Notre-affaire-tous-Eva-Joly/dp/207042376X Eva Joly, Notre affaire à tous], page 243.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a lucrative environment for money laundering and assets to be sheltered from tax, free from examination by law enforcement agencies by maintaining plausible deniability. Rich private clients also benefit through the domicile rules.&lt;ref&gt; Nicholas Shaxson - Treasure Islands – Tax havens and the men who stole the world – p250 &amp; p276 Chapter 12 Griffin The City of London Corporation &lt;/ref&gt; Although the City of London’s headline tax rate is the same as the rest of the UK, by influencing and using the legal system and laws of disclosure it has the means to allow clients to avoid or reputedly evade tax.

Although there is no agreed definition of a tax haven, many authors have accused the City of London of being one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.mercopress.com/2009/11/03/delaware-cayman-islands-and-london-city-among-most-secretive-tax-havens%20 Markets in vice, markets in virtue] - John Braithwaite  mercopress.com March 17th 2011 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/jul/08/tax.business1%20 Welcome to London, the onshore tax haven]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tax Justice Network, goes further and accuses the City of London as being “the biggest tax haven in the world” as well as ‘a state within a state’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taxjustice.blogspot.com/2009/02/corporation-of-london-state-within.html Taxjustice, Corporation of London State within a state].&lt;/ref&gt;
Ian Doyle and Jem Bendell, summarise these claims with the following statement: the City “is the most powerful lobby in Britain and possibly the world, and as a result . . . exerts enormous political influence to resist regulation and extract tax exemption. It has fostered criminality by ensuring that the City ranks amongst the least accountable of financial centres on the face of the Earth”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenleaf-publishing.com/content/pdfs/jcc35worldreview.pdf?productid=3051 World Review, Ian Doyle and Jem Bendell], The Journal of Corporate Citizenship 35, Autumn 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that many criticisms of the 'City of London' also apply to the UK financial services industry. However, these activities still tend to be centered on London and the City of London in particular.

The '''clitoris''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Clitoris pronunciation 1.ogg|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|t|ər|ɨ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|Clitoris pronunciation 2.ogg|k|l|ɨ|ˈ|t|ɔər|ɨ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|k|l|aɪ|t|ɒr|&lt;s&gt;ɪ&lt;/s&gt;|s}}) is a [[sex organ|sexual organ]] that is present only in [[female]] [[mammal]]s. In humans, the visible button-like portion is located near the [[anterior]] junction of the [[labia minora]], above the opening of the [[urethra]] and [[vagina]]. Unlike the [[penis]], which is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the clitoris, the clitoris does not contain the [[distal]] portion of the urethra. The only known exception to this is in the [[Spotted Hyena]]. In this species, the [[urogenital system]] is unique in that the female urinates, mates and gives birth via an enlarged, [[Erectile tissue|erectile]] clitoris, known as a [[pseudo-penis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baskina, Laurence S. et al. |title=A Neuroanatomical Comparison of Humans and Spotted Hyena, a Natural Animal Model for Common Urogenital Sinus: Clinical Reflections on Feminizing Genitoplasty |journal=Journal of Urology |volume=175 |issue=1 |pages=276–83 |month=January |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(05)00014-5 |pmid=16406926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, the clitoris is the most sensitive [[erogenous zone]] of the female, the [[sexual stimulation|stimulation]] of which may produce [[sexual excitement]] and [[clitoral erection]]; its continuing stimulation may produce [[sexual pleasure]] and [[orgasm]], and is considered the key to females' sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Connell HE, Sanjeevan KV, Hutson JM |title=Anatomy of the clitoris |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=174 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=1189–95 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16145367 |laysummary= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5013866.stm Time for rethink on the clitoris: |laysource=[[BBC News]] |laydate=11 June 2006 |doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000173639.38898.cd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation and etymology==
The plural forms are ''clitorises'' in English and ''clitorides'' in Latin. In slang, it is sometimes abbreviated as ''clit'', which originated in the 1950s. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' suggests that the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|aɪ|t|ɒr|&lt;s&gt;ɪ&lt;/s&gt;|s}} is also used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and gives the likely etymology as coming from the Greek {{polytonic|κλειτορίς}}, ''kleitoris'', perhaps derived from the verb {{polytonic|κλείειν}}, ''kleiein'', to shut. The [[Online Etymology Dictionary]] states that the etymology of this diminutive is uncertain. Possible etymological candidates are a Greek word meaning &quot;key&quot;, &quot;latch&quot;, &quot;hook&quot;; a Greek verb meaning &quot;to touch or titillate lasciviously&quot;, &quot;to tickle&quot; (the clitoris is called in German slang ''der Kitzler'', &quot;the tickler&quot;), although this verb is more likely derived from &quot;clitoris&quot;; and a Greek word meaning &quot;side of a hill&quot;, from the same root as &quot;[[climax]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|clitoris}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its Latin [[genitive]] is ''clitoridis'', as in &quot;[[clitoral glans|glans clitoridis]]&quot;.

==Structure==
The head or glans of the clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a [[pea]], although it can be significantly larger or smaller.

The clitoris is a complex structure, with both external and internal components. Projecting at the front of the labial [[commissure]] where the edges of the outer lips ([[labia majora]]) meet at the base of the pubic mound is the [[clitoral hood]] (prepuce), which in full or part covers the head ([[clitoral glans]]). Following from the head back and up along the shaft, it is found that this extends up to several centimeters before reversing direction and branching.  The resulting branched shape forms an inverted &quot;V&quot;, extending as a pair of &quot;legs&quot; known as the [[clitoral crura]] formed of the [[corpus cavernosum clitoridis|corpora cavernosa]]. The clitoral crura are concealed behind the [[labia minora]], and terminate with attachment to the pubic arch (according to some),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalook.com/human_anatomy/organs/Vulva.html Vulva] on MedicaLook Human Anatomy&lt;/ref&gt; or follow interior to the labia minora to meet at the [[frenulum labiorum pudendi|fourchette]] (according to others).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalker&quot;/&gt;

Associated are the [[urethral sponge]], clitoral/[[vestibular bulbs]], [[perineal sponge]], a network of nerves and blood vessels, suspensory ligaments, muscles and pelvic diaphragm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francoeur&quot;/&gt;

There is considerable variation in how much of the clitoris protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from complete, covered invisibility to full, protruding visibility. An article published in the ''Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology'' in July 1992 states that the average width of the clitoral glans lies within the range of {{convert|2.5|to|4.5|mm|in}}, indicating that the average size is smaller than a [[Pencil#Eraser attached|pencil-top eraser]]. Recent discoveries about the size of the clitoris show that clitoral tissue extends some considerable distance inside the body, around the vagina. It is now clear that clitoral tissue is far more widespread than the small visible part most people associate with the word.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt;  There is no identified correlation between the size of a clitoris and a woman's age, height, weight, use of [[hormonal contraceptive]]s, or being [[menopause|post-menopausal]].
==Sexual stimulation==
[[Image:Edsim Vascular.jpg|thumb|left|[http://www.ed-sim.com/clitoral_vascularization Click here to see a video showing clitoris becoming engorged with blood]]]

Most women can only achieve [[orgasm]] through clitoral stimulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;health.discovery.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Orgasm| publisher=Health.discovery.com| accessdate=2010-04-21|url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/orgasm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;womenshealth.about.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Tracee|last=Cornforth|title=The Clitoral Truth|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=2009-07-17|accessdate=2010-04-21|url=http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/sexuality/a/clitoraltruthin_2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.sexualhealth.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Birch |title=Did you orgasm?|publisher=Sexualhealth.com|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2010-04-21|url=http://www.sexualhealth.com/article/read/women-sexual-health/orgasm/486/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Masters and Johnson]] were the first to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia, determining that all orgasms are of clitoral origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Federation of Feminist Women’s Health Centers |year=1991 |title=A New View of a Woman’s Body |publisher= Feminist Heath Press |pages=46 |isbn=0-929945-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Australian [[Urology|urologist]] Dr. Helen O'Connell, using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technology, noted a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the [[erectile tissue]] of the clitoral bulbs and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt; She asserts that this interconnected relationship is the physiological explanation for the conjectured [[G-Spot]] and experience of [[Orgasm#Female orgasm|vaginal orgasm]], taking into account the stimulation of the internal parts of the clitoris during vaginal penetration.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt; &quot;The vaginal wall is, in fact, the clitoris,&quot; said O'Connell. &quot;If you lift the skin off the vagina on the side walls, you get the bulbs of the clitoris – triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue.&quot; The idea had simply been that the clitoris is more than just its glans – the &quot;little hill&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt;  
[[Image:Clit.jpg|thumb|right|Pulled-out clitoris]]
During [[sexual arousal]] and during orgasm, the clitoris and the whole of the genitalia engorge and change color as these erectile tissues fill with [[blood]], and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. Masters and Johnson documented the [[sexual response cycle]], which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm. More recent research has determined that some can experience a sustained intense orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris and remain in the orgasmic phase for much longer than the original studies indicated, evidenced by genital engorgement, color changes, and vaginal contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bodansky |first=Vera &amp; Steve|year=2002 |title=The Illustrated Guide to Extended Massive Orgasm |publisher= Hunter House |isbn=0897933621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryonic development==
[[Image:Stages in the development of the external sexual organs in the female (from Gray1119).png|thumb|right|[[Development_of_the_reproductive_system#External_genitalia|Stages in the development of clitoris]]]]
During the [[embryogenesis|development of an embryo]], at the time of [[development of the urinary and reproductive organs]], the previously undifferentiated [[genital tubercle]] develops into either a clitoris or penis, along with all other major organ systems, making them [[homologous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Francoeur&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Francoeur |first=Robert T. |year=2000 |title=The Complete Dictionary of Sexology |publisher=The Continuum Publishing Company |pages=180 |isbn=0-82640-672-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clitoris is formed from the same tissues that would have become the glans and upper shaft of a [[penis]] if the [[embryo]] had been exposed to “male” hormones.  Changes in appearance of male and female embryos begin roughly eight weeks after conception.  By birth, the genital structures have developed into the [[Female reproductive system (human)|female reproductive system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reinisch, Beasley |first=June and Ruth|year=1990 |title=The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex |publisher= St. Martin’s Press |isbn=0312063865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embryo sex based on external genitalia is apparent to a doctor at the end of the 14th menstrual week, and the sex can usually be identified by an ultrasound after 16 to 18 menstrual weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heffner |first=Linda|year=2001 |title=Human Reproduction at a Glance |publisher= Blackwell Sciences, Ltd |isbn=0632054611}}&lt;/ref&gt; A condition that can develop from naturally occurring or deliberate exposure to higher than average levels of [[testosterone]] is [[clitoromegaly]].

==Recognition of existence==
The clitoris has been thought of as &quot;discovered&quot; and &quot;rediscovered&quot; through empirical documentation by male scholars repeatedly over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;(Harvey 2001, Laqueur 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of more than 2,500 years, some have considered the clitoris and the penis equivalent in all respects except their arrangement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chalker |first=Rebecca |year=2000 |title=The Clitoral Truth |url=http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100427350 |publisher=Seven Seas Press |pages=1 |isbn=1-58322-473-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Realdo Colombo]] (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo) was a lecturer in [[surgery]] at the [[University of Padua]], [[Italy]], and in 1559 he published a book called ''De re anatomica''&lt;ref&gt;Realdi Columbi Cremonensis, [http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/NOMA/new/books/34/suema00000000f6d.html De re anatomica, libri XV.] Venetiis: Ex typographia Nicolai Beuilacquæ, 1559.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described the &quot;seat of woman's delight&quot;. Disregarding females' awareness of their own bodies, Colombo concluded, &quot;Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Hos igitur processus, atque eorundem usum cum nemo hactenus animadverterit, si nomina rebus a me inventis imponere licet, amor Veneris, vel dulcedo appeletur.''&quot; Realdo Colombo, [http://books.google.it/books?id=g_k7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false De re anatomica], 1562. Old Latin version in Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at [[University of Padua|Padua]], [[Gabriele Falloppio]] (who discovered the [[fallopian tube]]), who claimed that he was the first to discover the clitoris. [[Caspar Bartholin the Younger|Caspar Bartholin]], a 17th-century Danish [[anatomy|anatomist]], dismissed both claims, arguing that the clitoris had been widely known to [[medicine|medical science]] since the second century. Indeed, [[Hippocrates]] used the term columella (''little pillar''). [[Avicenna]] named the clitoris the albatra or virga (''rod''). [[Albucasis]], an Arabic medical authority, named it tentigo (''tension''). It was also known to the Romans, who named it (vulgar slang) ''[[Latin profanity#Landīca: the clitoris|landica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Latin Sexual Vocabulary |author=J.N. Adams |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=1982 |pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This cycle of suppression and discovery continued, notably in the work of [[Regnier de Graaf]] (''Tractatus de Virorum Organis Generationi Inservientibus, De Mulierum Organis Generationi Inservientibus Tractatus Novus'') in the 17th century and [[Georg Ludwig Kobelt]] (''Die männlichen und weiblichen Wollustorgane des Menschen und einiger Säugetiere'') in the 19th. De Graaf criticised Columbo's claims for this. (Harvey, Laqueur).

The full extent of the clitoris was alluded to by Masters and Johnson in 1966, but in such a muddled fashion that the significance of their description became obscured. In 1981, the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Clinics (FFWHC) continued this process with anatomically precise illustrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalker&quot;/&gt; Today, [[MRI]] complements these efforts, as it is both a live and multiplanar method of examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt;

==Female genital modification==
{{Main|Genital modification and mutilation}}

The external part of the clitoris may be partially or totally removed during [[female genital cutting]], also known as a clitoridectomy, female circumcision, or female genital mutilation (FGM). This can be a voluntary or involuntary procedure. The topic is highly controversial with many countries condemning the traditions that give rise to involuntary procedures, and with some countries outlawing even voluntary procedures. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that over 2 million involuntary female circumcisions are being performed every year, mainly in [[Africa]]n countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.Amnesty.org/en |title=What is Female Genital Mutilation? |date=30 |month=September |year=1997 |work=Amnesty International |page=2 |doi=ACT77/06/97 |accessdate=2010-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various cultures, the clitoris is sometimes [[clitoris piercing|pierced directly]]. In U.S. body modification culture, it is actually extremely rare for the clitoral shaft itself to be pierced, as of the already few people who desire the piercing, only a small percentage are anatomically suited for it; furthermore, most piercing artists are reluctant to attempt such a delicate procedure. Some styles, such as the [[Isabella piercing|Isabella]], do pass through the clitoris but are placed deep at the base, where they provide unique stimulation; they still require the proper genital build, but are more common than shaft piercings. Additionally, what is (erroneously) referred to as a &quot;clit piercing&quot; is almost always the much more common (and much less complicated) [[clitoral hood piercing]].

Enlargement may be intentional or unintentional. Those taking hormones and/or other medications as part of [[female-to-male]] [[transitioning (transgender)|transition]] usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires (and the difficulties of surgical phalloplasty) often result in the retention of the original genitalia, the enlarged clitoris analogous to a penis as part of the transition. However, the clitoris cannot reach the size of most [[cissexual]] men's penises through hormones. Surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as [[metoidioplasty]] or clitoral release, are alternatives to [[phalloplasty]] (construction of a penis) which permit retention of sexual sensation in the clitoris.  

On the other hand, use of [[anabolic steroid]]s by bodybuilders and other athletes can result in significant enlargement of the clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on their bodies. Temporary engorgement results from suction pumping, practiced to enhance sexual pleasure or for aesthetic purposes.

==History==
{{Main|History of Chicago}}
{{See also|Origin of the name &quot;Windy City&quot;}}
During the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by a native American tribe known as the [[Potawatomi]], who had taken the place of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]] and [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sauk and Fox]] peoples. The 1780s saw the arrival of the first known non-indigenous permanent settler in Chicago, [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]], who is believed to be of African and European descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swenson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=John W|title=Jean Baptiste Point de Sable—The Founder of Modern Chicago|url=http://www.earlychicago.com/essays.php?essay=7|work=Early Chicago|publisher=Early Chicago, Inc.|accessdate=2010-08-08|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795, following the [[Northwest Indian War]], an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over by some Native Americans in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] to the United States for a military post.

In 1803, the United States Army built [[Fort Dearborn]], which was destroyed in the [[War of 1812]] [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]]. The [[Odawa people|Ottawa]], [[Ojibwe]], and Potawatomi had ceded additional land to the United States in the 1804 [[Treaty of St. Louis]]. The Potawatomi were eventually forcibly removed from their land following the [[Treaty of Chicago]] in 1833. On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of around 200 at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= | title= Timeline: Early Chicago History| url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/timeline/index.html| archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5h38n983V| work= Chicago: City of the Century | publisher= WGBH Educational Foundation

The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837—the same day that [[Martin van Buren]] was inaugurated as President (succeeding [[Andrew Jackson]]).

[[File:Chicago - State St at Madison Ave, 1897.ogv|thumb|[[State Street (Chicago)|State]] and [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Streets]], the busiest corner in Chicago (1897)]]
As the site of the [[Chicago Portage]], the city emerged as an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]], opened in 1848, which also marked the opening of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]. The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the [[Great Lakes]] to connect to the [[Mississippi River]]. A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] abroad. Manufacturing and retail sectors became dominant among Midwestern cities, influencing the American economy, particularly in meatpacking, with the advent of the [[refrigerator car|refrigerated rail car]] and the regional centrality of the city's [[Union Stock Yards]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Elizabeth and Rodolfo Estrada. (1994) [http://www.oznet.ksu.edu/meatscience/column/industry.htm/ &quot;Development of the U.S. Meat Industry&quot;]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} – Kansas State University Department of Animal Sciences and Industry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago experienced some of the [[Chicago#Demographics|fastest population growth in the world]], requiring infrastructure investments. In February 1856, the Chesbrough plan for the building of Chicago's and the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system was approved by the Common Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathanriley.net/chn.html#y1856_m02_d14 |title=Chicago Daily Tribune, Thursday Morning, February 14 |publisher=Jonathanriley.net |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project [[Raising of Chicago|raised much of central Chicago]] to a new grade. While raising Chicago out of its mud and sewage, and at first improving the health of the city, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the [[Chicago River]], thence into [[Lake Michigan]], polluting the primary source of fresh water for the city. Chicago responded by tunneling two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) out into Lake Michigan to newly built [[water crib]]s. In 1900, the problem of sewage was largely resolved when the city undertook a major engineering feat. The city reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that water flowed from Lake Michigan into the river, instead of the water flowing from the river into the lake. It began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and completed with the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] leading to the [[Illinois River]] which joins the [[Mississippi River]].
[[File:Chicago-fire1.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's rendering of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]]]]
After the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] destroyed a third of the city, including the entire central business district, Chicago experienced rapid rebuilding and growth.&lt;ref&gt;Bruegmann, Robert (2004–2005). [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/181.html Built Environment of the Chicago Region]. ''Encyclopedia of Chicago (online version)''.&lt;/ref&gt; During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's [[Home Insurance Building|first skyscraper]] in 1885, using [[steel frame|steel-skeleton]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Frederick E. (March 2003). &quot;[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_68.shtml Where They Went to See the Future]&quot; ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''. Retrieved 7-29-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labor history of the United States|Labor conflicts]] and unrest followed, including the [[Haymarket affair]] on May 4, 1886. Concern for social problems among Chicago's lower classes led [[Jane Addams]] to be a co-founder of [[Hull House]] in 1889. Programs developed there became a model for the new field of social work. The city also invested in many large, well-landscaped [[Chicago Park District|municipal parks]], which also included public sanitation facilities.

In the 19th century, Chicago became an important railroad center and in 1883 the standardized system of North American [[Time Zones]] was adopted by the general time convention of railway managers in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=GmfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA19  Annual report of the Commissioner of Railroads made to the Secretary of the Interior for the year ending June 30, 1883],'' pp. 19–20. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the continent its uniform system for telling time.

In 1893, Chicago hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] on former marshland at the present location of [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. The Exposition drew 27.5 million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choosechicago.com/media/history.html Chicago History]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}. ''Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Chicago]] was founded in 1892 on the same South Side location. The term &quot;midway&quot; for a fair or carnival referred originally to the [[Midway Plaisance]], a strip of park land that still runs through the University of Chicago campus and connects [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington]] and Jackson Parks.

The 1920s brought notoriety to Chicago as [[American gangsters during the 1920s|gangsters]], including the notorious [[Al Capone]], battled each other and law enforcement on the city streets during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era. Chicago had over 1,000 gangs in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gang (crime) – History |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/225308/gang|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|year=2009|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s also saw a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted African Americans from the South. Between 1910 and 1930, the black population of Chicago increased from 44,103 to 233,903.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://bentley.umich.edu/research/publications/migration/ch1.php Detroit and the Great Migration, 1916–1929 by Elizabeth Anne Martin]&quot;. Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving in the hundreds of thousands during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the newcomers had an immense cultural impact. It was during this wave that Chicago became a center for [[jazz]], with [[Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver|King Oliver]] leading the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/bessie.html |title=Bessie Smith |accessdate=2007-10-29 |publisher=The Red Hot Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Chicago Mayor [[Anton Cermak]] was fatally wounded in Miami during a [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots#Franklin D. Roosevelt|failed assassination]] attempt on President-elect [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In 1933 and 1934, the city celebrated its centennial by hosting the [[Century of Progress]] International Exposition [[Worlds Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm4/index_uic_cop.php?CISOROOT=/uic_cop Century of Progress World's Fair, 1933-1934 (University of Illinois at Chicago) : Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago's founding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/225.html Century of Progress Exposition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1942, physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] conducted the world's first controlled nuclear reaction at the [[University of Chicago]] as part of the top-secret [[Manhattan Project]].

Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] was elected in 1955, in the era of [[political machine|machine politics]]. Starting in the early 1960s due to blockbusting, many white residents, as in most American cities, left the city for the suburbs. Whole neighboorhoods were completely changed based on race. Structural changes in industry caused heavy losses of jobs for lower skilled workers. In 1966 [[James Bevel]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Albert Raby]] led the Chicago Open Housing Movement, which culminated in agreements between Mayor Richard J. Daley and the movement leaders. Two years later, the city hosted the tumultuous [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall, including full-scale [[riot]]s, or in some cases [[police riot]]s, in city streets. Major construction projects, including the Sears Tower (now known as the [[Willis Tower]], which in 1974 became the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|world's tallest building]]), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[McCormick Place]], and [[O'Hare International Airport]], were undertaken during Richard J. Daley's tenure. When Richard J. Daley died, [[Michael Anthony Bilandic]] served as mayor for three years. Bilandic's subsequent loss in a primary election has been attributed to the city's inability to properly plow city streets during a heavy snowstorm. In 1979, [[Jane Byrne]], the city's first female mayor, was elected. She popularized the city as a [[filming location|movie location]] and [[Tourism in the United States|tourist]] destination.

In 1983, [[Harold Washington]] became the first African American to be elected to the office of mayor, in one of the closest mayoral elections in Chicago. After Washington won the Democratic primary, racial motivations caused a few Democratic alderman and ward committeemen to back the Republican candidate [[Bernard Epton]], who ran on the race-baiting slogan ''Before it's too late''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Washington's term in office saw new attention given to poor and minority neighborhoods. Washington died in office of a heart attack in 1987, shortly after being elected to a second term. [[Richard M. Daley]], son of Richard J. Daley, was elected in 1989. His accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for [[sustainable development]]. After successfully standing for reelection five times and becoming Chicago's longest serving Mayor, in 2010, Richard M. Daley announced he would step down at the end of his final term in May 2011.

On February 23, 2011, former White House chief of staff and congressman [[Rahm Emanuel]] won the municipal election to succeed Daley, beating five rivals with 55 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41715205/ns/politics-more_politics/ MSNBC News: Rahm Emanuel wins Chicago mayoral race]&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel was sworn in as Mayor on May 16, 2011.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Chicago}}

===Topography===
[[File:Full chicago skyline.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of downtown and the North Side with beaches lining the lakeshore.]]
Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois at the southwestern tip of [[Lake Michigan]]. It sits on a [[continental divide]] at the site of the [[Chicago Portage]], connecting the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] [[drainage basin|watersheds]]. The city lies beside freshwater Lake Michigan, and two rivers—the [[Chicago River]] in downtown and the [[Calumet River]] in the industrial far South Side—flow entirely or partially through Chicago. The [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] connects the Chicago River with the [[Des Plaines River]], which runs to the west of the city. Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge [[lake freighter]]s use the city's [[Port of Chicago|Lake Calumet Harbor]] on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.

When Chicago was founded in 1833, most of the early building began around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html|title=Thompson's Plat of 1830|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall [[Land grading|grade]] of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is {{convert|579|ft|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]. The lowest points are along the lake shore at {{convert|577|ft|abbr=on}}, while the highest point, at {{convert|735|ft|abbr=on}}, is a landfill located in the [[Hegewisch, Chicago|Hegewisch]] community area on the city's far south side.

[[File:20070909 Chicago Half Marathon.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chicago Half Marathon]] on [[Lake Shore Drive]] next to [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]] in the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]]]]
The [[Chicago Loop]] is the central business district but Chicago is also a city of [[Chicago#Neighborhoods|neighborhoods]]. [[Lake Shore Drive]] runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's lakefront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include [[Lincoln Park]], [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]] and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. 29 public [[Chicago beaches|beaches]] are also found along the shore. Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for [[Navy Pier]], [[Northerly Island]], the [[Museum Campus Chicago|Museum Campus]], and large portions of the [[McCormick Place]] Convention Center. Most of the city's high-rise commercial and residential buildings can be found close to the waterfront.

An informal name for the Chicago metropolitan area is ''[[Chicagoland]]'', used primarily by copywriters, advertising agencies, and traffic reporters. There is no precise definition for the term &quot;Chicagoland,&quot; but it generally means the city and its suburbs together. The [[Chicago Tribune]], which coined the term, includes the city of Chicago, the rest of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], eight nearby Illinois counties: [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake]], [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry]], [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]], [[Grundy County, Illinois|Grundy]], [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] and [[Kankakee County, Illinois|Kankakee]], and three counties in [[Indiana]]: [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake]], [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter]] and [[LaPorte County, Indiana|LaPorte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/ |title='&amp;#39;Chicago Tribune'&amp;#39; Classifieds map of Chicagoland |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County ''without'' the city of Chicago, and only Lake, DuPage, Kane and Will counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicagoland Region|url=http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|year=2009|work=EnjoyIllinois.com|publisher=Illinois Department of Tourism|accessdate=14 August 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce]] defines it as all of Cook and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Chicago}}

The city lies within the [[humid continental climate]] zone, and experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are hot and humid, with a July daily average of {{convert|84.7|°F|1}}. In a normal summer temperatures exceed {{convert|90|°F|0|abbr=on}} on 21 days.&lt;ref name = &quot;ILoffice&quot;/&gt; Winters are cold, snowy, and windy, with some sunny days, and with a January average of {{convert|23.5|°F|1}}. Temperatures often (43 days) stay below freezing for an entire day, and subzero lows occur on eight nights per year.&lt;ref name = &quot;ILoffice&quot;/&gt; Spring and fall are mild seasons with low humidity.

According to the [[National Weather Service]], Chicago's highest official temperature reading of {{convert|107|F|abbr=on}} was recorded on June 1, 1934 and July 11, 1936, both at Midway Airport. The lowest temperature of {{convert|&amp;minus;27|°F|0}} was recorded on January 20, 1985,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/ORD:9 Monthly Averages for  O'Hare International Airport].

The outcome of the Great Chicago Fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation. Perhaps the most outstanding of these events was the relocation of many of the nation's most prominent architects from [[New England]] to the city for construction of the 1893 World Columbian Exposition.

In 1885, the first [[steel frame|steel-framed high-rise building]], the [[Home Insurance Building]], rose in Chicago, ushering in the skyscraper era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/timeline/skyscraper1.html Chicago (2004)]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}. ''Chicago Public Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Chicago's skyline is among the world's tallest and most dense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultrapolisproject.com/ultrapolis_017.htm World's Tallest Cities]. ''UltrapolisProject.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; The nation's two tallest buildings are both located in Chicago; [[Willis Tower]] (formerly Sears Tower), and [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]]. The Loop's historic buildings include the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], the [[Fine Arts Building (Chicago)|Fine Arts Building]], [[35 East Wacker]], and the [[Chicago Building]], [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] by [[Mies van der Rohe]], along with many others. The [[Merchandise Mart]], once first on the [[list of largest buildings in the world]], and still listed as 20th with its own ZIP code, stands near the junction of the North and South branches of the Chicago River. Presently, the four tallest buildings in the city are [[Willis Tower]], [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]], the [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]] (previously the Standard Oil Building), and the [[John Hancock Center]]. [[Industrial district]]s, such as on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], the areas along the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], [[Chicago Southland]], and [[Northwest Indiana]] are clustered.
[[File:Oak Street Beach in Chicago.jpg|thumb|North [[Lake Shore Drive]] and the [[Gold Coast, Chicago]]]]
Chicago gave its name to the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]] and was home to the [[Prairie School]], movements in architecture. Multiple kinds and scales of houses, townhouses, condominiums, and apartment buildings can be found in Chicago. Large swaths of Chicago's residential areas away from the lake are characterized by [[bungalow]]s built from the early 20th century through the end of World War II. Chicago is also a prominent center of the [[Polish Cathedral style]] of [[church architecture]]. One of Chicago's suburbs, [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]], was home to the architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who had designed The [[Robie House]] located near the [[University of Chicago]].

One of the city's most famous thoroughfares, [[Western Avenue (Chicago)|Western Avenue]], is one of the longest urban streets in the world. Other famous streets include [[Belmont Avenue (Chicago)|Belmont Avenue]], [[Pulaski Road (Chicago)|Pulaski Road]], and [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]]. The [[City Beautiful movement]] inspired Chicago's Boulevards and Parkways.

===City sections===
Over one-third of the city population is concentrated in the lakefront neighborhoods (from [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]] in the north to [[South Shore, Chicago|South Shore]] in the south). The city has many upscale dining establishments as well as many ethnic restaurant districts. These include the Mexican villages, such as Pilsen on 18th street and ''La Villita'' on 26th street, the [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] enclave ''Paseo Boricua'' in the [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]] neighborhood, &quot;Greektown&quot; on South Halsted, &quot;Little Italy&quot; on Taylor Street, just west of Halsted, &quot;Chinatown&quot; on the near South Side, Polish fare reigns at Belmont-Central, &quot;Little Seoul&quot; on and around Lawrence Avenue, a cluster of Vietnamese restaurants on Argyle Street and South Asian (Indian/Pakistani) on Devon Avenue.

Downtown is the center of Chicago's cultural, commercial and financial institutions, and home to [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] and many of the city's [[Willis Tower|skyscapers]]. Many of the city's financial institutions (for example, [[Chicago Board of Trade|CBOT]], [[Chicago Fed]]) are located within a section of downtown called &quot;The Loop&quot;, which is an eight block by five block square of city streets that are encircled by elevated rail tracks. The name &quot;The Loop&quot; is sometimes also used to refer to the entire downtown area. The central area often is portrayed, as in the map at right, to include parts of [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] and [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]], as well as the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]. These areas contribute famous [[John Hancock Center|skyscrapers]], [[Magnificent Mile|shopping]], [[Museum Campus|museums]], a [[Soldier Field|stadium]] for the [[Chicago Bears]] and [[McCormick Place|convention facilities]]. Similarly, the area just [[Near West Side, Chicago#West Loop Gate / West Loop|west of the Loop]] and the [[Chicago River]] contributes to the commercial core.

The North Side contains [[Lincoln Park]], a {{convert|1200|acre|abbr=on|sing=on}} park stretching for {{convert|5.5|mi|abbr=on}} along the waterfront with the [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] and the [[Lincoln Park Conservatory]]. The [[River North Gallery District, Near North Side, Chicago|River North]] neighborhood features the nation's largest concentration of contemporary art galleries outside of New York City. As a [[Polonia]] center, due to the city having a very large Polish population, Chicago celebrates every [[Labor Day]] weekend at the [[Taste of Polonia]] Festival in the [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago's Polish neighborhoods&quot; &gt;{{cite web| title=Chicago's Polish neighborhoods | url=http://www.usaweekend.com/05_issues/050515/050515travel_diverse.html#chicago | publisher=USA Weekend Magazine | date=2005-05-15 | accessdate=2009-04-25}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Cubs]] play in the North Side's [[Wrigleyville]]. Two North Side neighborhoods in particular, Lakeview and the Andersonville area of the Edgewater neighborhood, are home to many [[LGBT]] businesses and organizations. The area surrounding the North Side intersections of [[Halsted Street|Halsted]], [[Belmont Avenue (Chicago)|Belmont]], and [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark]] is a gay district known as &quot;[[Boystown, Chicago|Boystown]].&quot;

The South Side is home to the [[University of Chicago]], and the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]]. It also hosts one of the city's largest parades, the annual African American [[Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic|Bud Billiken Day]] parade. [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]] stretches along the waterfront of the South Side. Two of the city's largest parks are located here: [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], bordering the waterfront, hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893 and is home of the aforementioned museum; slightly west sits [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]]. U.S. automaker, [[Ford Motor Company]], has an assembly plant located on the South Side. Also, most of the facilities of the [[Port of Chicago]] are here. The [[Chicago White Sox]] play at 35th Street.

The West Side holds the [[Garfield Park Conservatory]], one of the largest collections of tropical plants of any US city. Prominent [[Latino]] cultural attractions found here include [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]]'s Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Puerto Rican Day Parade, as well as the [[National Museum of Mexican Art]] and [[St. Adalbert's in Chicago|St. Adalbert's Church]] in [[Pilsen, Chicago|Pilsen]]. The Near West Side holds the television production company of [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Studios]] and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] call the West Side home at the [[United Center]] sports arena.

===Entertainment, the arts, and performing arts===
{{See also|Theatre in Chicago|Visual arts of Chicago}}
[[File:20070620 Chicago Theatre sign.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Chicago Theatre]]]]
Chicago's theatre community spawned modern [[improvisational theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer 2002, p 14&lt;/ref&gt; Two renowned comedy troupes emerged—[[The Second City]] and [[I.O.]] (formerly known as ImprovOlympic). Renowned Chicago theater companies include the [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] (on the city's north side), the [[Goodman Theatre]], and the [[Victory Gardens Theater]].

When Chicago was incorporated in 1837, it chose the motto ''Urbs in Horto'', a [[Latin]] phrase which translates into English as &quot;City in a Garden&quot;. Today, the [[Chicago Park District]] consists of 552 parks with over {{convert|7300|acre}} of [[municipal park]]land. There are 33 sand [[Chicago beaches]], a plethora of museums, two world-class conservatories, 16 historic lagoons, and 10 bird and wildlife gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/docs/7fb8e301-0cdd-431b-9dcb-78b2cd6ac348_document.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 29430CHIdoc.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lincoln Park]], the largest of the city's parks, covers {{convert|1200|acre}} and has over 20 million visitors each year, making it second only to [[Central Park]] in New York City in number of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Park Facts |publisher=The Trust for Public Land, Center for City Park Excellence |month=June | year=2006 |url=http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=20531&amp;folder_id=3208|accessdate=2006-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; With berths for more than 5,000 boats, the Chicago Park District operates the nation's largest municipal harbor system; even larger than systems in cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, or Miami. In addition to ongoing beautification and renewal projects for the existing parks, a number of new parks have been added in recent years, such as the [[Ping Tom Memorial Park]] in Chinatown, [[DuSable Park (Chicago)|DuSable Park]] on the Near North Side, and most notably, [[Millennium Park]] in a section of one of Chicago's oldest parks, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in the Chicago Loop.

The wealth of greenspace afforded by Chicago's parks is further augmented by the [[Cook County Forest Preserves]], a network of open spaces containing forest, [[prairie]], [[wetland]], streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie along the city's periphery, home to both the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]] in Glencoe and the [[Brookfield Zoo]] in Brookfield.

A popular modification is the Combo – an Italian beef sandwich with the addition of an Italian sausage.
