The Roman Catholic and some major Protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the &quot;New Churches&quot; which  actively proselytize.

{{Main|Health in Angola}}
A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient [[niacin]] status was common in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seal AJ, Creeke PI, Dibari F, ''et al.'' |title=Low and deficient niacin status and pellagra are endemic in postwar Angola |journal=Am.

Many regions in this country have high incidence rates of [[tuberculosis]] and high [[HIV]] prevalence rates. [[Dengue]], [[filariasis]], [[leishmaniasis]], and [[onchocerciasis]] (river blindness) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region. Angola has one of the highest [[infant mortality rate]] in the world and one of the the world's lowest [[life expectancy]]. [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on [[Malaria]], [[Domestic Violence]] and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angola Surveys&quot;&gt;[http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/metadata.cfm?surv_id=344&amp;ctry_id=76&amp;SrvyTp=ctry&amp;cn=Angola Angola Surveys],&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lwena Moxico-Angola.jpg|thumb|Training center in [[Luena, Moxico Province|Luena]], [[Moxico Province]]]]
Although by law, [[education]] in Angola is compulsory and free for 8 years, the government reports that a certain percentage of students are not attending school due to a lack of school buildings and teachers.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;&quot;Botswana&quot;. [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2005/tda2005.pdf ''2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor'']. [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]]. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are often responsible for paying additional school-related expenses, including fees for books and supplies.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

In 1999, the gross primary enrollment rate was 74 percent and in 1998, the most recent year for which data are available, the net primary enrollment rate was 61 percent.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; There continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas. In 1995, 71.2 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; It is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; During the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed, leading to current problems with overcrowding.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

The Ministry of Education hired 20,000 new teachers in 2005, and continued to implement teacher trainings.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Teachers tend to be underpaid, inadequately trained, and overworked (sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day).&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Some teachers may also reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their students.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Other factors, such as the presence of landmines, lack of resources and identity papers, and poor health also prevent children from regularly attending school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004, the education system in Angola continues to be extremely under-funded.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

[[Literacy]] is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;CIA world factbook 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/angola_statistics.html |title=Angola - Statistics |publisher=UNICEF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools, [[polytechnical]] institutes, and universities in [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]] and [[Cuba]] through bilateral agreements; in general, these students belong to the Angolan elites.

[[Portugal]] has been present in [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola for 400&amp;nbsp;years]], occupied the territory in the 19th and early 20th century, and ruled over it for about 50 years. As a consequence, both countries share cultural aspects: language ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]) and main religion ([[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, the Angolan culture is mostly native [[Bantu people|Bantu]] which was mixed with [[culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]]. The diverse ethnic communities with their own cultural traits, traditions and native languages   include the [[Ovimbundu]], [[Mbundu|Ambundu]], [[Bakongo]], [[Chokwe language|Chokwe]], and other peoples.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Heritage ==
Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold, copper.
Also a non-commerciable rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest, and fossils.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Angola]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Image:Angola demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of [[Angola]], Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
From the ethnic point of view, three main groups have to be distinguished, each speaking a [[Bantu language]]: the [[Southern Mbundu people|Ovimbundu]] who represent 37% of the population, [[Mbundu people|(Ambundu]] with 25%, and the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] 13%. Other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] and Lunda, the [[Ganguela]] and [[Nhaneca-Humbe]], in both cases classification terms which stand for a variety of small groups, the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], the [[Herero people|Herero]],  the [[Xindonga]] and scattered residual groups of [[Khoisan]]. In addition, mixed race (European and African) people amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] (as a [[Angola (Portugal)|former overseas territory of Portugal]] until 1975, the Portuguese make up currently the largest non-African population, with certainly more than 100,000, a number that has been constantly increasing from the 2000s, because of Angola's growing demand for qualified human resources. &lt;ref&gt;It should be recalled that in 1974, white Angolans made up a population of 330 thousand to 350 thousand people in an overall population of 6,3 thousand Angolans at that time. The only reliable source on these numbers is Gerald Bender &amp; Stanley Yoder, ''Whites in Angola on the Eve of Independence: The Politics of Numbers'', ''Africa Today'', 21 (4) 1974, pp. 23 - 37. Today, many Angolans who are not ethnic Portuguese can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law. Estimates on the overall population are given in [http://www.opais.net/pt/opais/?det=7192 O País]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/12079340?story_id=12079340 www.economist.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/angola/34.htm Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://jn.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Sociedade/Interior.aspx?content_id=1165354 Portugueses em Angola quadruplicaram], [[Jornal de Notícias]] (March 10, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;. Besides the Portuguese, significant numbers of people from other European and from diverse Latin American countries (especially Brazil) can be found. From the 2000s many Chinese have settled and started up small businesses, while at least as many have come as workforce for large (construction or other) enterprises. Observers claim that the Chinese community in Angola might iclude as many as 300,000 persons at the end of 2010, but nothin near to reliable statistics are at this stage available on this point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9052011.stm Chinese karaoke fans sing Angola's praises]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974/75, up to 250,000 [[Cuba]]n soldiers arrived in Angola to help the MPLA forces during the decolonisation conflict. Once this was over, a massive development cooperation in the field of health and education brought in numerous civil personnel from Cuba. However, only a very small percentage of all these people has remained in Angola, either for personal reasons (intermarriage) or as professionals (e.g. medical doctors).
The largest religious denomination  is [[Roman Catholicism]], to which adheres about half the population, Roughly 26% are followers of traditional forms of [[Protestantism]] (Congregationals, Methodists, Baptista, Lutherans, Reformed), but over the last decades there has in addition been a real explosion of Pentecostal communities and [[African Initiated Church]]es. As of 2006, one out of 221 people were [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Blacks from Mali, Nigeria, and Senegal are mostly Sunnite Muslims, but do not make up more than 1 - 2% of the population. By now few Angolans retain [[African Traditional Religion]]s following different ethnic faiths.

==CIA World Factbook demographic statistics==
The following demographic statistics are from the [[CIA World Factbook]], unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;It should be underlined that many of these satistics are not fully reliable and/or outdated.

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of Angola, but [[Bantu language|Bantu]] and other African languages are also widely spoken. Literacy is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese. 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Angola}}
'''Politics of Angola''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Angola]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. [[Angola]] changed from a [[Single-party state|one-party]] [[Marxist]]-[[Leninist]] system ruled by the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]] to a formal multiparty democracy following the 1992 elections. President [[José Eduardo dos Santos|dos Santos]] won the first round election with more than 49% of the vote to [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s 40%. A runoff never has taken place. The subsequent renewal of civil war and collapse of the [[Lusaka Protocol]] have left much of this process stillborn, but democratic forms exist, notably the [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]].

Currently, political power is concentrated in the Presidency. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Prime Minister (currently [[Paulo Kassoma]]) and Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, composed of all government ministers and vice ministers, meets regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented. Courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has never been constituted despite statutory authorization.

The 26-year long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically [[Luanda]] (population approximately 4 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.

Currently, a constitutional commission is putting together a new constitutions. According to the commission, which is composed of 45 permanent members from the main political parties, a new constitution will be ready by the end of the first quarter of 2010.

==Executive branch==

==Legislative branch==
The '''[[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]]''' (''Assembleia Nacional'') has 223 members, elected for a four year term, 130 members by [[proportional representation]], 90 members in provincial districts, and 3 members to represent Angolans abroad. The next general elections, due for 1997, have been rescheduled for 5 September 2008. The ruling party MPLA won 82% (191 seats in the National Assembly) and the main opposition party won only 10% (16 seats). The elections however have been described as only partly free but certainly not fair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kas.de/proj/home/pub/8/2/year-2008/dokument_id-15323/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists up all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kas.de/proj/home/pub/8/2/year-2009/dokument_id-17396/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economy of Angola''' is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;&gt;Birgitte Refslund Sørensen and Marc Vincent. ''Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced'', 2001. Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Economist said that for 2001 to 2010, Annual average GDP growth for Angola was 11.1 percent, whereas China was 10.5 percent,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart Retrieved on January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but is still recovering from the [[Angolan Civil War]] that plagued Angola from [[Alvor Agreement|independence in 1975]] until 2002. Despite extensive [[Crude oil|oil and gas]] resources, [[diamond]]s, hydroelectric potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the country has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions. High international oil prices and rising oil production have led to a very strong economic growth in recent years, but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.

==History==
[[Kingdom of Portugal]]'s explorers and settlers, founded trading posts and forts along the coast of [[Africa]] since the 15th century, and reached the [[Angola]]n coast in the 16th century. Portuguese explorer [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded [[Luanda]] in 1575 as &quot;São Paulo de Loanda&quot;, and the region developed as a [[Slavery in Angola|slave trade]] market with the help of local [[Imbangala]] and [[Mbundu]] peoples who were [[African slave trade|notable slave hunters]]. Trade was mostly with the Portuguese [[colony of Brazil]]; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the [[Jesuits]] in religion and education. War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade. The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell. In the Planalto (the high plains), the most important states were those of [[Bié Province|Bié]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, so that by the beginning of this century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area. During the period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580–1640), Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], a major enemy of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions, including [[Luanda]]. The Dutch ruled Luanda from 1640 to 1648 as Fort Aardenburgh. They were seeking black slaves for use in [[sugarcane]] plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]], [[Recife]]) which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Meanwhile, with the [[independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the slave trade was abolished in 1836, and in 1844 Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping. By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside [[Mainland Portugal]], full of trading companies, exporting (together with [[Benguela]]) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products. Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally. The Angolan bourgeoisie was born. From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastruture, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] discovered [[petroleum]] in Angola in 1955. Production began in the [[Cuanza basin]] in the 1950s, in the [[Congo basin]] in the 1960s, and in the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] in 1968. The [[Portuguese government]] granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of [[ChevronTexaco]], in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt; Oil production surpassed the exportation of [[coffee]] as Angola's largest export in 1973.

A leftist military-led coup d'état, started on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, overthrew the [[Marcelo Caetano]] government in Portugal, and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government. [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the [[President of Zaire]], met with [[António de Spínola]], the transitional [[President of Portugal]], on September 15, 1974 on [[Sal island]] in [[Cape Verde]], crafting a plan to empower [[Holden Roberto]] of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[Jonas Savimbi]] of [[UNITA]], and [[Daniel Chipenda]] of the [[MPLA]]'s eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader [[Agostinho Neto]] while retaining the facade of national unity. Mobutu and Spínola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The Angolan [[exclave]] has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroleum&quot;&gt;Erik P. Hoffmann and Frederic J. Fleron. ''The Conduct of Soviet Foreign Policy'', 1980. Page 524.&lt;/ref&gt; After independence thousands of white Portuguese left, most of them to [[Portugal]] and many travelling overland to [[South Africa]]. There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.

The Angolan government created [[Sonangol]], a state-run oil company, in 1976. Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Angola/pdf.pdf Angola] Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt; After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between 1975 and 2002.

===1990s===
[[United Nations Angola Verification Mission III]] and [[MONUA]] spent [[USD]]1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the [[Lusaka Protocol]], a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war. The protocol prohibited UNITA from buying foreign arms, a provision the [[United Nations]] largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in [[Albania]] and [[Bulgaria]], and from [[Zaire]], [[South Africa]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Zambia]], [[Togo]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 to 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of [[Belarus]], [[Brazil]], Bulgaria, the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[South Africa]]. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required.&lt;ref name=&quot;lusaka&quot;&gt;Vines, Alex. ''Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process'', 1999. Human Rights Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===2000s===
An economic reform effort was launched in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The Angolan economy ranked 160 out of 174 nations in the [[United Nations Human Development Index]] of 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;/&gt; In April 2000 Angola started an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with [[World Bank]] assistance, has begun with the [[Banco do Comércio e Indústria|BCI]] bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The civil war [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced]] 3.8 million people, 32% of the population, by 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;/&gt; The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Image:Africa by gdp.png|right|frame|National GDP per capita ranges from wealthier states in the north and south to poorer states in the east. These figures from the 2002 World Bank are converted to US dollars.]]
Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed {{convert|1.4|Moilbbl/d}} in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d}} by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs in building roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Because of severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. [[Coffee]] production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production, now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at {{convert|800|koilbbl/d}}. Diamonds provided much of the revenue for [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Exports in 2004 reached [[United States dollar|US$]]10,530,764,911. The vast majority of Angola's exports, 92% in 2004, are petroleum products. [[United States dollar|US$]]785 million worth of diamonds, 7.5% of exports, were sold abroad that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;exports&quot;&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/16248 99.4% of Angola's exports are oil, diamonds] Afrol News&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of Angola's oil goes to the United States, {{convert|526|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2006, making it the eighth largest supplier of oil to the United States, and to the [[People's Republic of China]], {{convert|477|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2006. In the first quarter of 2008, Angola became the main exporter of oil to China.&lt;ref name=&quot;China&quot;&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aqJ3Wjxs.OWs Angola Overtakes Saudi Arabia as Biggest Oil Supplier to China] Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of its petroleum exports go to [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt; U.S. companies account for more than half the investment in Angola, with Chevron-Texaco leading the way. The U.S. exports industrial goods and services, primarily oilfield equipment, mining equipment, chemicals, aircraft, and food, to Angola, while principally importing petroleum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Trade between Angola and [[South Africa]] exceeded USD&amp;nbsp;300 million in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;safrica&quot;&gt;[http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/news.php?ID=3726 Angola-South Africa trade worth over US$ 300 million per year] MacauHub&lt;/ref&gt; From the 2000s many Chinese have settled and started up businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9052011.stm Chinese karaoke fans sing Angola's praises]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resources==
===Petroleum===
Angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], surpassing [[Nigeria]] in the [[2000s in Angola|2000s]]. In January 2007 Angola became a member of [[OPEC]]. By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields. Oil sales generated USD&amp;nbsp;1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the government's budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of [[GDP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oilview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;budgincrease&quot;&gt;OECD (2006). Page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chevron Corporation]] produces and receives {{convert|400|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, 27% of Angolan oil. Elf Oil, [[Texaco]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Agip]], [[Petrobras]], and [[British Petroleum]] also operate in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;oilhistory&quot;/&gt;

Block Zero provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production&lt;ref name=&quot;zero&quot;&gt;OECD (2006). Page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; with {{convert|370|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}} produced annually&lt;!-- per day per year ...? --&gt;. The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B). [[ChevronTexaco]] operates in Block Zero with a 39.2% share. [[SONANGOL]], the state oil company, [[Total S.A.|Total]], and [[Eni|ENI-Agip]] own the rest of the block. ChevronTexaco also operates Angola's first producing deepwater section, Block 14, with {{convert|57|koilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;opec&quot;/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has criticized the Angolan government for using torture, rape, summary executions, arbitrary detention, and disappearances, actions which Angolan government has justified on the need to maintain oil output.&lt;ref name=&quot;hroil&quot;&gt;Omeje, Kenneth C. ''High Stakes And Stakeholders: Oil Conflict And Security in Nigeria'', 2006. Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;thirdlargest&quot;&gt;United States Congress. ''Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations for 1998: Hearings'', 1997. Page 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. imports 7% of its oil from Angola, about three times as much as it imported from [[Kuwait]] just prior to the [[Gulf War]] in 1991. The U.S. Government has invested USD $4 billion in Angola's petroleum sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuwait&quot;&gt;Vines, Alex. ''Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process'', 1999. Human Rights Watch. Page 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diamonds===
{{Main|Mining in Angola}}
Angola is the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa and has only explored 40% of the diamond-rich territory within the country, but has had difficulty in attracting foreign investment because of corruption, human rights violations, and diamond smuggling.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfr&quot;&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200705071105.html Angola: U.S. Must Strengthen Ties to Protect Strategic Energy and Security Interests] Council on Foreign Relations via AllAfrica&lt;/ref&gt; Production rose by 30% in 2006 and [[Endiama]], the national diamond company of Angola, expects production to increase by 8% in 2007 to 10 million carats annually. The government is trying to attract foreign companies to the [[Provinces of Angola|provinces]] of [[Bié (province)|Bié]], [[Malanje (province)|Malanje]] and [[Uíge Province|Uíge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diaexploration&quot;&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN637551.html Angola wants foreign investors for diamond sector], July 26, 2007. Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angolan government loses $375 million annually from diamond smuggling. In 2003 the government began Operation Brilliant, an anti-smuggling investigation that arrested and deported 250,000 smugglers between 2003 and 2006. Rafael Marques, a journalist and human rights activist, described the diamond industry in his 2006 ''Angola's Deadly Diamonds'' report as plagued by &quot;murders, beatings, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations.&quot; Marques called on foreign countries to boycott Angola's &quot;[[conflict diamonds]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;marques&quot;&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/15888 Angola to double diamond production in 2006] Afrol News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron===
{{Main|Mining in Angola}}
Under Portuguese rule, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] began mining [[iron]] in 1957, producing 1.2 million tons in 1967 and 6.2 million tons by 1971. In the early 1970s, 70% of Portuguese Angola's iron exports went to [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diaexploration&quot;/&gt; After independence in 1975, the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002) destroyed most of the territory's mining infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Angolan mining industry started in the late 2000s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transport in [[Angola]]''' comprises:

== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Angola}}
There are three separate railway lines in Angola:
* [[Luanda Railway]] (northern)
* [[Benguela Railway]] (central)
* [[Moçâmedes Railway]] (southern)

== Highways ==
* ''total:'' 52,429&amp;nbsp;km
:''country comparison to the world:'' 79
* ''paved:'' 5,349&amp;nbsp;km
* ''unpaved:'' 46,080&amp;nbsp;km (2001)

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles.  Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt.  In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road.

The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads, though.  Many companies are coming into the country from China and surrounding nations to help improve road surfaces.  The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes.  Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.

== Waterways ==
* 1,300&amp;nbsp;km navigable (2008)
:''country comparison to the world:'' 36

== Pipelines ==
* gas, 2&amp;nbsp;km; crude oil 87&amp;nbsp;km (2008)

The '''Angolan Armed Forces''' ('''FAA''') is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense.

There are three components, the '''Army''', Navy ('''Marinha de Guerra''', MdG), and '''[[National Air Force of Angola|Força Aérea Nacional Angolana]]''' (FANA). Total manpower is about 65,000. The army is by far the largest of the services with about 55,000+ men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Military Technology, World Defence Almanac, Vol. XXXII, Issue 1, 2008, p.301-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy numbers about 1,000 and operates several small patrol craft and barges. Air force personnel total about 3,500; its equipment includes [[Russia]]n-manufactured fighters and transport planes.

A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville).

In 2005, FAPLA had a total of 90,000 active personnel of which the Army had 100,000 members, whose major equipment included over 300 main battle tanks, 600 reconnaissance vehicles, over 250 armored infantry fighting vehicles, 170 armored personnel carriers and more than 1,396 artillery pieces.

In 1990-91, the Army had ten military regions and an estimated 73+ 'brigades', each with a mean strength of 1,000 and comprising inf, tank, APC, artillery, and AA units as required (IISS Military Balance 1990 or 1991). The Navy had an estimated 2,400 personnel whose major naval units consisted of nine patrol/coastal vessels. The Air Force /Air Defense Forces had 6,000 personnel and 90 combat capable aircraft , including 22 fighters, 59 fighter ground attack aircraft and 16 attack helicopters.

The defense budget in 2005 totalled $1.16 billion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Angola}}
The '''foreign relations of Angola''' are based on Angola's strong support of [[U.S. foreign policy]] as the [[Angolan economy]] is dependent on U.S. foreign aid.

From 1975 to 1989, [[Angola]] was aligned with the [[Eastern bloc]], in particular the [[Soviet Union]], [[Libya]], and [[Cuba]]. Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with [[Western world|Western countries]], cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in [[Central Africa]] through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the [[United States]]. It has entered the [[Southern African Development Community]] as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south. [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]] joined Angola in its military intervention in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], where Angolan troops remain in support of the [[Joseph Kabila]] government. It also has intervened in the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville) to support the existing government in that country.

Since 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the [[UN Security Council]] to impose and carry out sanctions on [[UNITA]]. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on [[conflict diamonds]], the primary source of revenue for UNITA. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries ([[CPLP]]) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with [[Portugal]] (its former ruler) and [[Brazil]] (which shares many cultural affinities with Angola) in particular.

==Sub-Saharan Africa==
===Cape Verde===
{{main|Angola–Cape Verde relations}}
[[Cape Verde]] signed a friendship accord with [[Angola]] in December 1975, shortly after Angola gained its independence. Cape Verde and [[Guinea-Bissau]] served as stop-over points for [[Cuban troops]] on their way to Angola to fight [[UNITA]] rebels and [[South Africa]]n troops. [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde|Prime Minister]] [[Pedro Pires]] sent [[FARP]] soldiers to Angola where they served as the personal bodyguards of [[Angolan President]] [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobban|first=Richard|year=1995|title=Cape Verde:Crioulo Colony to Independent Nation|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
Many thousands of Angolans fled the country after the civil war. More than 20,000 people were forced to leave the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 2009, an action the DR Congo said was in retaliation for regular expulsion of Congolese diamond miners who were in Angola illegally. Angola sent a delegation to DR Congo's capital [[Kinshasa]] and succeeded in stopping government-forced expulsions which had become a &quot;tit-for-tat&quot;&lt;ref name=Bearak /&gt; immigration dispute. &quot;Congo and Angola have agreed to suspend expulsions from both sides of the border,&quot; said Lambert Mende, DR Congo information minister, in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congo and Angola 'end expulsions' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8304282.stm|date=October 13, 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-10-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We never challenged the expulsions themselves; we challenged the way they were being conducted — all the beating of people and looting their goods, even sometimes their clothes,&quot; Mende said.&lt;ref name=Bearak&gt;{{cite news|author=Bearak, Barry|title=Congo and Angola Agree to End Expulsions |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/africa/14angola.html|date=October 13, 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namibia===
{{main|Angola–Namibia relations}}
Namibia borders Angola to the south. In 1999 Namibia signed a mutual defense pact with its northern neighbor [[Angola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Situation Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This affected the [[Angolan Civil War]] that had been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Namibia's ruling party [[SWAPO]] sought to support the ruling party [[MPLA]] in Angola against the rebel movement [[UNITA]], whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering to Namibia. The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s UNITA.

===Nigeria===
{{main|Angola–Nigeria relations}}
Angolan-Nigerian relations are primarily based on their roles as oil exporting nations. Both are members of the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]], the [[African Union]] and other multilateral organizations.

===South Africa===
{{main|Angola–South Africa relations}}
Angola-South Africa relations are quite strong as the ruling parties in both nations, the African National Congress in South Africa and the MPLA in Angola, fought together during the Angolan Civil War and South African Border War. They fought against UNITA rebels, based in Angola, and the apartheid-era government in South Africa who supported them. Nelson Mandela mediated between the MPLA and UNITA factions during the last years of Angola's civil war.

===Zimbabwe===
{{main|Angola–Zimbabwe relations}}
Angola-Zimbabwe relations have remained cordial since the birth of both states, Angola in 1975 and Zimbabwe in 1979, during the [[Cold War]].  While Angola's foreign policy shifted to a pro-U.S. stance based on [[Economy of Angola|substantial economic ties]], under the rule of [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] [[Robert Mugabe]] Zimbabwe's ties with the [[Western world|West]] soured in the late 1990s.

===France===
{{main|Angola–France relations}}
Relations between the two countries have not always been cordial due to the former [[French government]]'s policy of supporting militant separatists in Angola's [[Cabinda province]] and the international [[Angolagate]] scandal embarrassed both governments by exposing corruption and illicit arms deals. Following French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s visit in 2008, relations have improved.

===Portugal===
{{main|Angola–Portugal relations}}
Angola-Portugal relations have significantly improved since the [[Angola]]n government abandoned [[communism]] and nominally embraced [[democracy]] in 1991, embracing a pro-[[Angola-United States relations|U.S.]] and to a lesser degree pro-[[Europe]] foreign policy. [[Portugal]] ruled Angola for 400 years,&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Alker|first=Hayward R.|coauthors=Ted Robert Gurr, Kumar Rupesinghe|year=2001|title=Journeys Through Conflict: Narratives and Lessons|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; colonizing the territory from 1483 until independence in 1975. Angola's war for [[Angolan War for Independence|independence]] did not end in a military victory for either side, but was suspended as a result of a [[Carnation Revolution|coup in Portugal]] that replaced the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano regime]].

From the mid-1980s through at least 1992, the United States was the primary source of military and other support for the [[UNITA]] rebel movement, which was led from its creation through 2002 by [[Jonas Savimbi]].  The U.S. refused to recognize Angola diplomatically during this period.

Relations between the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Angola|Republic of Angola]] (formerly the [[People's Republic of Angola]]) have warmed since Angola's ideological renunciation of [[Marxism]] before the [[Angolan presidential election, 1992|1992 elections]].

'''Albert Sidney Johnston''' (February 2, 1803 &amp;ndash; April 6, 1862) was a career [[United States Army]] officer, a [[Republic of Texas|Texas Army]] [[General officer|general]], and a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate States]] [[General (CSA)|general]]. He saw extensive combat during his military career, fighting actions in the [[Texas War of Independence]], the [[Mexican-American War]], the [[Utah War]], as well as the [[American Civil War]].

Considered by [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] to be the finest general officer in the Confederacy before the emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]], he was killed early in the Civil War at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and was the highest ranking officer, Union or Confederate, killed during the entire war.&lt;ref name=Eicher322&gt;Eicher, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis believed the loss of Johnston &quot;was the turning point of our fate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Johnston was born in [[Washington, Kentucky]], the youngest son of Dr. John and Abigail Harris Johnston. His father was a native of [[Salisbury, Connecticut]]. Although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky, he lived much of his life in [[Texas]], which he considered his home. He was first educated at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], where he met fellow student Jefferson Davis. Both were appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]], Davis two years behind Johnston.&lt;ref name=Woodworth46&gt;Woodworth, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826 Johnston graduated eighth of 41 cadets in his class from West Point with a commission as a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Infantry]].&lt;ref name=Eicher322&gt;Eicher, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston was assigned to posts in [[New York]] and [[Missouri]] and served in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832 as chief of staff to Bvt. Brig. Gen. [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]]. In 1829 he married Henrietta Preston, sister of Kentucky politician and future civil war general [[William Preston (Kentucky)|William Preston]]. He resigned his commission in 1834 to return to Kentucky to care for his dying wife, who succumbed two years later to [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=Woodworth46/&gt; They had one son, Col. [[William Preston Johnston]], who would also serve in the Confederate Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csawardept.com/history/Cabinet/WPJohnston/index.html W.P. Johnston biography.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas Army==
In April 1834, Johnston took up farming in [[Texas]], but enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Texas Army during the Texas War of Independence against the Republic of [[Mexico]] in 1836. One month later, Johnston was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] and the position of [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Sam Houston]]. He was named [[Adjutant General]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the Republic of Texas Army on August 5, 1836. On January 31, 1837, he became senior brigadier general in command of the Texas Army.

On February 7, 1837, he fought in a [[duel]] with Texas Brig. Gen. [[Felix Huston]], challenging each other for the command of the Texas Army; Johnston refused to fire on Huston and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis. The second president of the [[Republic of Texas]], [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], appointed him Secretary of War on December 22, 1838. Johnston was to provide the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in northern Texas. In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky, where he married Eliza Griffin in 1843. They settled on a large [[plantation]] he named China Grove in [[Brazoria County, Texas]].

==U.S. Army==
[[File:Albert S Johnston.jpg|thumb|Albert S. Johnston]]
Johnston returned to the Texas Army during the Mexican-American War under General [[Zachary Taylor]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers. The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the [[Battle of Monterrey]]. Johnston managed to convince a few volunteers to stay and fight as he himself served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and [[Battle of Buena Vista|Buena Vista]]. Johnston remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] Taylor to the U.S. Army as a [[Major (United States)|major]] and was made a [[U.S. Army Paymaster|paymaster]] in December 1849. He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than {{convert|4000|mi|km}} annually on the Indian frontier of Texas. He served on the Texas frontier at [[Fort Mason (Texas)|Fort Mason]] and elsewhere in the West. In 1855 President [[Franklin Pierce]] appointed him colonel of the new 2nd U.S. Cavalry (the unit that preceded the modern [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th U.S.]]), a new regiment, which he organized. As a key figure in the [[Utah War]], he led U.S. troops who established a non-Mormon government in the formerly [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]] territory. He received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in 1857 for his service in Utah. He spent 1860 in Kentucky until December 21, when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army [[Department of the Pacific]] in [[California and the Civil War|California]]. He resigned his commission soon after he heard of the [[secession]] of Texas. It was accepted by the War Department on May 6, 1861, effective May 3.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28 he moved to Los Angeles where he had family and remained there until May when, suspected by local Union authorities, he evaded arrest and joined the [[Los Angeles Mounted Rifles]] as a private, leaving [[Warner's Ranch]] May 27.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, pp. 268, 275-91.&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to [[Texas]], crossing the [[Colorado River]] into the [[Confederate Territory of Arizona]] on July 4, 1861. He reached [[Richmond, Virginia]], on or about September 1, 1861. There Johnston was appointed a [[General (CSA)|full general]] by his friend, Jefferson Davis. On May 30, 1861,&lt;ref name=Eicher807&gt;Eicher, p. 807. From General Command Line List.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston became the second highest ranking Confederate general (after the little-known [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]]) as commander of the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Department]]. He raised the [[Army of Mississippi]] to defend Confederate lines from the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Kentucky]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains]].

Although the [[Confederate States Army]] won a morale-boosting victory at [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in the East in 1861, matters in the West turned ugly by early 1862. Johnston's subordinate generals lost [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] on February 6, 1862, and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]] on February 16, 1862, to Union [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Johnston has been faulted for poor judgment in selecting Brig. Gens. [[Lloyd Tilghman]] and [[John B. Floyd]] for those crucial positions and for not supervising adequate construction of the forts. Union [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Don Carlos Buell]] subsequently captured the vital city of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] was sent west to join Johnston and they organized their forces at [[Corinth, Mississippi]], planning to ambush Grant's forces at [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].

===Shiloh===
[[File:Johnston Shiloh Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Johnston at [[Shiloh National Military Park]].]]
Johnston concentrated many of his forces from around the theater and launched a massive surprise attack against Grant at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on April 6, 1862. As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line. At about 2:30 p.m., while leading one of those charges, he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. He did not think the wound serious at the time, and sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded captured Union soldiers instead. It is possible that Johnston's duel in 1837 had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result. The bullet had in fact clipped his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot was filling up with blood. Within a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off his horse. Among his staff was [[Isham G. Harris]], the [[Governor of Tennessee]], who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that [[Abraham Lincoln]] had appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: &quot;General, are you wounded?&quot; Johnston glanced down at his leg wound and replied with his last words: &quot;Yes, and I fear seriously.&quot; Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and moved him to a small ravine near the famous &quot;Hornets Nest&quot; and desperately tried to aid the general. He bled to death minutes later. Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent until the Confederate Army withdrew to Corinth the next day, April 7, 1862. From there, his body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and laid in state for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;Sword, pp. 270-73, 443-46; Cunningham, pp. 273-76; Smith, pp. 26-34. Sword offers evidence that Johnston lived as long as an hour after receiving his fatal wound.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round. No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge, while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Sword, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston was the highest-ranking casualty of the war on either side, and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis considered him the best general in the country; this was two months before the emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]] as the pre-eminent general of the Confederacy.

==Epitaph==
[[File:Albert Sidney Johnston Tomb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johnston's tomb in the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]]]

[[Image:Closeup of Albert Johnston grave, Austin, TX IMG_2179.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Close-up of Johnston tomb sculpture]]

Johnston was initially buried in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. In 1866, a joint resolution of the [[Texas Legislature]] was passed to have his body reinterred to the [[Texas State Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] The re-interment occurred in 1867. Forty years later, the state appointed [[Elisabet Ney]] to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at his gravesite.

The [[Texas Historical Commission]] has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once his [[plantation]]. An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the [[Daughters of The Republic of Texas]] and the Lee, Roberts, and Davis Chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy|United Daughters of the Confederate States of America]].

The [[University of Texas at Austin]] has also recognized Johnston with a statue on the South Mall.

An '''android''' is a [[robot]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 10&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|title=Science in popular culture: a reference guide|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|location=Westport|year=2002|page=10|isbn=0-313-31822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[synthetic biology|synthetic organism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Dinello109&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dinello|first=Daniel|title=Technophobia!: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=2005|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to look and act like a human. Although &quot;android&quot; is used almost universally to refer to both sexes, and those of no particular sex,&quot;Android&quot; is the male form, while &quot;[[Gynoid]]&quot; is the feminine form. Until recently, androids have largely remained within the domain of [[science fiction]], frequently seen in film and television.

==Etymology==
The word was coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ανδρ- 'man' and the suffix ''[[Wiktionary:-oid|-oid]]'' 'having the form or likeness of'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' traces the earliest use (as &quot;Androides&quot;) to [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]],'' in reference to an [[automaton]] that St. [[Albertus Magnus]] allegedly created.&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' at &quot;android&quot; citing Ephraim Chambers, ''Cyclopædia; or, an universal dictionary of arts and sciences.'' 1728.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word was popularized by the French writer [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers]] in his 1886 novel ''[[The Future Eve|L'Ève future]]''. The term &quot;android&quot; appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=QhIAAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=patent:40891%7C|title=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent# 40891, ''Toy Automation''|publisher=[[Google Patents]]| accessdate = 2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;[[Droid (robot)|droid]]&quot;, coined by [[George Lucas]] for the original ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of &quot;android&quot;, but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-humaniform machines like [[R2-D2]]. The abbreviation &quot;andy&quot;, coined as a [[pejorative]] by writer [[Philip K. Dick]] in his novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', has seen some further usage, such as within the TV series ''[[Total Recall 2070]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR2070&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Rough Whimper of Insanity|url=http://www.fancast.com/tv/Total-Recall-2070/10604/full-episodes|series=Total Recall 2070|serieslink=Total Recall 2070|credits=Levin, Drew S. (exec. prod.)|network=[[Channel Zero Inc.|Channel Zero]]|station=[[CHCH-TV]]|city=[[Toronto]]|airdate=February 23, 1999|season=1|number=7|minutes=2:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
===Japan===
[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|DER 01, a Japanese [[actroid]]]]
The Intelligent Robotics Lab, directed by [[Hiroshi Ishiguro]] at [[Osaka University]], and Kokoro Co., Ltd. have demonstrated the [[Actroid]] at [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan. In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&amp;nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The &quot;air servosystem&quot; which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.

The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.

The [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To &quot;copy&quot; a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.

===Korea===
[[File:Ever-2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[EveR-2]], the first android that has the ability to [[singing|sing]]]]

KITECH researched and developed [[EveR-1]], an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial &quot;musculature&quot; and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words. She is {{nowrap|160 cm}} tall and weighs {{nowrap|50 kg}}, matching the average figure of Korean women in their twenties. EveR-1's name derives from the [[Eve|Biblical Eve]], plus the letter ''r'' for ''robot''. EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enables [[speech recognition]] and vocal synthesis, at the same time processing lip synchronization and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-[[charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras with [[facial recognition system|face recognition technology]]. An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression, body coordination, and emotion expression. Her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face, neck, and lower body; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing. In South Korea, the [[Ministry of Information and Communication (South Korea)|Ministry of Information and Communication]]  has an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060906-robots.html&lt;/ref&gt; Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2009 at a cost of 500 billion won, of which 50 billion is direct government investment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/27/south-korea-set-to-build-robot-land/&lt;/ref&gt; The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070316-robot-ethics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Walt Disney and a staff of [[Imagineers]] created [[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]] that debuted at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois_pavillion&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nywf64.com/illinois02.shtml|title=Pavilions &amp;amp; Attractions - Illinois - Page Two|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hanson (robotics designer)|Hanson Robotics, Inc.]], of Texas and [[KAIST]] produced an android portrait of [[Albert Einstein]], using Hanson's facial android technology mounted on KAIST's life-size walking bipedal robot body. This Einstein android, also called &quot;[[Albert Hubo]]&quot;, thus represents the first full-body walking android in history (see video at &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansonrobotics.wordpress.com Einstein Video&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). Hanson Robotics, the FedEx Institute of Technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedex.memphis.edu FedEx Institute of Technology :: FedEx Institute of Technology :: University of Memphis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Texas at Arlington also developed the android portrait of sci-fi author [[Philip K. Dick]] (creator of ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', the basis for the film ''[[Blade Runner]]''), with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author's works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pkdandroid.org/about.htm About the Philip K Dick Android]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the PKD android won a first place [[artificial intelligence]] award from [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]].

===United Kingdom===
In 2001, Steve Grand OBE, creator of the computer game, Creatures, created an android, or anthropoid, he named Lucy. The intention was that she would have to learn everything, including how to use her mechanical vocal chords to speak. Her systems were made to be similar to a human's.

===Iran===
{{main|Surena (robot)}}
Surena (Persian: سورنا) is a humanoid robot which has been developed and fabricated through a joint project between “Center for Advanced Vehicles (CAV), University of Tehran” and “the R&amp;D Society of Iranian Industries and Mines”. The Surena 2 model has the ability to dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/08/17/iran-dancing-humanoid-robot/ Iran Has a Dancing, Humanoid Robot], ''[[Fox News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and distinctions==
Unlike the terms &quot;robot&quot; (a &quot;[[mechanics|mechanical]]&quot; being) and ''[[cyborg]]'' (a being that is partly [[organic compound|organic]] and partly mechanical), the word &quot;android&quot; has been used in literature and other media to denote several different kinds of [[synthetic life|artificially constructed beings]]:

* a robot that closely resembles a human
* an artificially or synthetically created being that closely resembles a human; also referred to in many series (mostly anime) as [[Biorobotics|Bio Android]]
* any machine that mimics a human

Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[Simulacrum|simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[Automata theory|automata]]'' (devices that have independence).

The term ''android'' was popularized by the French author [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] in his work ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'' (1886), featuring an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, &quot;In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.&quot;

Although [[Karel Čapek|Karel Čapek's]] robots in ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)&amp;nbsp;– the play that introduced the word ''robot'' to the world&amp;nbsp;– were organic artificial humans, the word &quot;robot&quot; has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings. The term &quot;android&quot; can mean either one of these, while a cyborg (&quot;cybernetic organism&quot; or &quot;bionic man&quot;) would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.

The word &quot;android&quot; is a combination of Ancient Greek ''andros'' and the suffix ''-oid'', which literally means &quot;in the form of a man (male human being)&quot;. This could be contrasted with the more general term &quot;[[anthropoid]]&quot;, which means humanlike. According to this fashion, a female human-like robot would be a &quot;gynoid&quot;.

==Fiction==
{{See also|List of fictional robots and androids}}
&lt;!-- Please add descriptions of individual androids to that list, not here, so as to avoid duplication. Thanks! --&gt;

Androids are a staple of [[science fiction]]. Authors have used the term ''android'' in more diverse ways than ''[[robot]]'' or ''[[cyborg]]''. In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics. In other stories, authors have used the word &quot;android&quot; to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation. Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.

One thing common to most fictional androids, though, is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots&amp;nbsp;– such as the creation of [[Strong AI|strong artificial intelligence]]&amp;nbsp;– are assumed to have been solved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;&gt;Van Riper, op.cit., p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Fictional androids are generally depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans&amp;nbsp;– moving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt;

The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance&amp;nbsp;– or even human ambitions&amp;nbsp;– of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt; Some android heroes seek, like [[Pinocchio]], to become human, as in the films ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', ''[[Hollywood (Kannada film)|Hollywood]]'', ''[[Enthiran]]'' and ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot; /&gt; or [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] in the science-fiction television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Others, as in the film ''[[Westworld]]'', rebel against abuse by careless humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt; Android hunter [[Deckard]] in American writer [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' discovers that his targets are, in some ways, more human than he is.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt; Android stories, therefore, are not essentially stories &quot;about&quot; androids; they are stories about the [[human condition]] and what it means to be human.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 11&quot;/&gt;

One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring [[racism]] in society, as in ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' and its film adaptation ''Blade Runner''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dinello76&quot;&gt;Dinello, op. cit., p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the clearest example of such an exploration is [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner's]] 1968 novel ''[[Into the Slave Nebula]]'', where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|last= D'Ammassa|first=Don|year=2005|publisher=Facts on File|page = 58|isbn = 9780816059249}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the androids [[Bishop (Aliens)|Bishop]] and Annalee Call in the films ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an &quot;[[Other]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1353/cj.2005.0011|last=Nishime|first=LeiLani|title=The Mulatto Cyborg: Imagining a Multiracial Future|journal = Cinema Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=34–49|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|date=Winter 2005|accessdate=2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female androids, or &quot;[[gynoid]]s&quot;, are often seen in science fiction, and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical &quot;perfect woman&quot;.&lt;ref name=melzer202&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought|last=Melzer|first=Patricia|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|page=202|isbn= 9780292713079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]'' and the female robot Maria in [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]''. Some gynoids, like Pris in [[Blade Runner]], are designed as sex-objects, with the intent of &quot;pleasing men's violent sexual desires&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Melzer, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Fiction about gynoids or female cyborgs has therefore been described as reinforcing &quot;essentialist ideas of femininity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = SciFi in the mind's eye: reading science through science fiction|last=Grebowicz|first=Margret|authorlink= |coauthors= L. Timmel Duchamp, Nicola Griffith, Terry Bisson|year=2007|publisher=Open Court|page=xviii|isbn=9780812696301}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and [[misogyny]] in society.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dinello77&quot;&gt;Dinello, op. cit., p 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alberta''' {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|ɜr|t|ə}} is a [[provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Canada]]. It had an estimated population of 3.7 million in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/100929/dq100929b-eng.htm | title=Canada's population estimates | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=2010-09-29 | accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most populous of Canada's three [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]].

Alberta is located in [[western Canada]], bounded by the provinces of [[British Columbia]] to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the [[Northwest Territories]] to the north, and the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]] to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and is also one of only two provinces that are [[landlocked]].

[[Edmonton]], the [[capital city]] of Alberta, is located near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's [[Athabasca Oil Sands|oil sands]] and other northern resource industries. Approximately {{convert|300|km|sigfig=2}} south of the capital is [[Calgary]], Alberta's largest city and a major distribution and transportation hub. According to recent population estimates, these two [[census metropolitan area]]s have now both exceeded 1 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics Canada—CMA population estimates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/getcans/sorth.cgi?lan=eng&amp;dtype=fina&amp;filename=demo05a.htm&amp;sortact=2&amp;sortf=6|title=Statistics Canada—CMA population estimates|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Census Agglomeration|Census agglomerations]] in the province include [[Lethbridge]], [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], [[Medicine Hat]], [[Wood Buffalo, Alberta|Wood Buffalo]] (includes [[Fort McMurray]]), [[Lloydminster]], [[Brooks, Alberta|Brooks]], [[Okotoks]], [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]], [[Cold Lake, Alberta|Cold Lake]], and [[Wetaskiwin]].&lt;ref name=StatCan2006CMAs/&gt;  Notable tourist destinations in the province include Canmore, [[Sylvan Lake, Alberta|Sylvan Lake]], [[Drumheller]], [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], and [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]].

Alberta is named after [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise Caroline Alberta]] (1848–1939), the fourth daughter of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alberta.ca/home/182.cfm|title=History|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. Princess Louise was the wife of the [[John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]],  [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1878 to 1883. [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]], the Village of [[Caroline, Alberta|Caroline]], and [[Mount Alberta]] were also named in honour of Princess Louise. 

The current [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]] of the province is [[Ed Stelmach]].

To the south, the province borders on the [[49th parallel north]], separating it from the U.S. state of [[Montana]], while on the north the [[60th parallel north]] divides it from the [[Northwest Territories]]. To the east the [[110th meridian west]] separates it from the province of [[Saskatchewan]], while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the [[120th meridian west]] south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the [[Continental Divide]] at the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.

The province extends {{convert|1223|km}} north to south and {{convert|660|km}} east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is {{convert|3747|m|ft|0}} at the summit of [[Mount Columbia (Alberta)|Mount Columbia]] in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border, while its lowest point is {{convert|152|m|ft|0}} on the [[Slave River]] in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in the northeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutab&quot;&gt;

With the exception of the [[semi-arid]] [[steppe]] of the southeastern section, the province has adequate [[water resources]]. There are numerous [[list of rivers of Alberta|rivers]] and [[list of lakes in Alberta|lakes]] used for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[fishing]] and a range of [[water sports]]. There are three large lakes, [[Lake Claire (Albertan lake)|Lake Claire]] ({{convert|1436|km2}}) in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], [[Lesser Slave Lake]] ({{convert|1168|km2}}), and [[Lake Athabasca]] ({{convert|7898|km2}}) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan.

&lt;/ref&gt; The largest river is the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] with an average flow of 2161 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the [[Slave River]], a tributary of the [[Mackenzie River]].

[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Moraine Lake]] in [[Banff National Park]].]]
Alberta's capital city, [[Edmonton]], is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest [[oil field]]s, has most of western Canada's oil [[refinery]] capacity. [[Calgary]] is located approximately {{convert|280|km}} south of Edmonton and {{convert|240|km}} north of Montana, surrounded by extensive [[ranching]] country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]].

Most of the northern half of the province is [[boreal forest]], while the [[Rocky Mountains]] along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see [[Alberta Mountain forests]] and [[Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests]]). The southern quarter of the province is [[prairie]], ranging from [[shortgrass prairie]] in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central [[aspen parkland]] region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to [[Lloydminster]], contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to [[grain]] or to [[dairy farming]], with [[mixed farming]] more common in the north and centre, while [[ranching]] and [[irrigated agriculture]] predominate in the south.&lt;ref&gt;

The Alberta [[badlands]] are located in southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep [[canyon]]s and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Brooks, Alberta]], showcases the badlands terrain, [[desert]] [[flora (plants)|flora]], and remnants from Alberta's past when [[dinosaur]]s roamed the then lush landscape.

=== Climate ===
Alberta has a dry [[continental climate]] with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from {{convert|-54|C|sigfig=2}} in northern Alberta to {{convert|-46|C|sigfig=2}} in southern Alberta. In the summer, continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from {{convert|32|C}} in the mountains to {{convert|40|C}} in southern Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;climatlas&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta extends for over {{convert|1200|km}} from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average temperatures in January range from {{convert|-8|C|sigfig=2}} in the south to {{convert|-24|C|sigfig=2}} in the north, and in July from {{convert|24|C}} in the south to {{convert|16|C}} in the north.  The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the [[prevailing westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a [[rain shadow]] over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the [[Pacific Ocean]] cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|300|mm}} in the southeast to {{convert|450|mm}} in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where rainfall can reach {{convert|600|mm}} annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutab&quot;/&gt;

In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around {{convert|21|C}} in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north to {{convert|27|C}} in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation.
Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 and 2500 hours per year. Northern Alberta receives about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;climatlas&quot;/&gt;

In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry [[chinook winds]] blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at [[Pincher Creek]], temperatures soared from {{convert|-18.9|C|sigfig=2}} to {{convert|3.3|C|sigfig=2}} in one hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutab&quot;/&gt;  The region around [[Lethbridge]] has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year, while [[Calgary]] has a [[white Christmas]] only 59% of the time as a result of these winds. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Northern Alberta is mostly covered by [[taiga|boreal forest]] and has a [[subarctic climate]]. The agricultural area of southern Alberta have a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that [[evapotranspiration|evaporates or is used by plants]]. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the [[Palliser Triangle]], experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent [[crop yield]] problems and occasional severe [[drought]]s. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter [[chinook wind]]s. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a [[biome]] transitional between [[prairie]] to the south and boreal forest to the north.

After [[Southern Ontario]], [[Central Alberta]] is the most likely region in Canada to experience [[tornadoes]]. [[Thunderstorm]]s, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is notable for having the highest frequency of [[hail]] in Canada, which is caused by [[orographic lifting]] from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

=== Ecology ===
==== Flora ====
In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie crocus [[anemone]], the three flowered avens, [[golden bean]], [[Rosa acicularis|wild rose]] and other early flowers. The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the [[sunflower]] family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower, [[fleabane]], and [[Sagebrush|sage]]. Both yellow and white [[sweet clover]] fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents.

The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[balsam poplar]] (or [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]]), and [[paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species. [[Conifer]]s include [[Jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[Lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[tamarack]].

==== Fauna ====
[[Image:Ovis canadensis 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[bighorn sheep]] is Alberta's provincial animal]]
The four climatic regions ([[alpine climate|alpine]], [[boreal forest]], [[Aspen parkland|parkland]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the [[American bison|bison]], commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[grizzly bear|grizzly]] and [[American Black Bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[canidae|canine]] and [[Felidae|feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]], [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[mountain lion]] (cougar).

[[Herbivorous]] animals are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], and [[white-tail deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the [[Rocky Mountains]]. [[Rabbit]]s, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of [[venomous snake]], the prairie [[rattlesnake]].

[[Image:Mill woods edmonton waterfowl.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Water birds in Edmonton]]Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[walleye]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], and [[brown trout|brown]] [[trout]], and even [[sturgeon]]. [[Turtle]]s are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. [[Frog]]s and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.

Alberta is the only province in Canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument |title = The History of Rat Control in Alberta| author=Alberta Department of Agriculture| accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1950s, the government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can be kept in the province by only zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions. In 2009, several rats were
found and captured, in small pockets in Southern Alberta,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodents defying Alberta's rat-free claim&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/Rodents+defying+Alberta+free+claim/1949949/story.html|title=Rodents defying Alberta's rat-free claim|last=Markusoff|first=Jason|date=2009-09-01|publisher=Calgary Herald|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting Alberta's rat-free status in jeopardy.

== History ==
[[File:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Alexander C. Rutherford]], Alberta's first premier]]
{{Main|History of Alberta}}
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
The first people in Alberta were [[Paleo-Indians]] who arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the [[last ice age]]. They probably migrated from [[Siberia]] to [[Alaska]] on a [[Beringia|land bridge]] across the [[Bering Strait]], and then may have moved down the east side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] through Alberta to [[Settlement of the Americas|settle the Americas]]. Alternatively they may have [[Coastal Migration#Coastal migration hypothesis in the New World|migrated down the coast]] of British Columbia and then moved inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | title = Canada's First Nations  | work = Applied History  | publisher = University of Calgary  | year = 2000 | url = http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/firstnations/theories.html | accessdate = 2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time they differentiated into various [[First Nations]] peoples, including the [[Plains Indian]] tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]] and the [[Plains Cree]], who generally lived by hunting buffalo ([[American bison]]), and the more northerly tribes such as the [[Woodland Cree]] and  [[Chipewyan]] who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = First Nations | work = History | publisher = Government of Alberta | date = 1995 - 2011 | url = http://alberta.ca/home/182.cfm#Nations | accessdate = 2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[British America|British arrival in Canada]], approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the [[Athabasca River]] drainage, became part of [[Rupert's Land]] which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into [[Hudson Bay]]. This area was granted by [[Charles II of England]] to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it. After the arrival of [[French Canadian]]s in the west around 1731, they settled near fur trading posts, establishing communities such as [[Lac La Biche, Alberta|Lac La Biche]] and [[Bonnyville, Alberta|Bonnyville]]. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in 1752.

The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the [[Arctic Ocean]] instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who learned of the [[Methye Portage]], which allowed travel from southern  rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land.  Fur traders formed the [[North West Company]] (NWC) of [[Montreal]] to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac la Biche]] in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the [[Mackenzie River]]—which he followed to its outlet in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the [[Pacific Ocean]], and so he became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=2521|title=Alexander Mackenzie Biography|author=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|accessdate=2006-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], [[Louisiana Purchase|sold to the United States]] in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the [[49th parallel north|Forty-Ninth Parallel]] was ceded to Great Britain. 

Fur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities. The amalgamated Hudson's Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870, when the newly formed [[Canadian Government]] purchased Rupert's Land. Northern Alberta was included in the [[North-Western Territory]] until 1870, when it and Rupert's land became Canada's [[Northwest Territories]].

The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] as the first premier.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Alberta}}
[[File:Alberta population.svg|thumb|190px|right|Alberta's population has grown steadily for over a century.]]
Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Components of population growth of Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm|title=Components of population growth, by province and territory |publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas. The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;muntypes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/ms_TypesMunicipalitiesAlberta.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061214100557/http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/ms_TypesMunicipalitiesAlberta.htm|archivedate=2006-12-14|author=Alberta Municipal Affairs|title=Types of Municipalities in Alberta|date=2006-05-16|accessdate=December 18, 2006|authorlink =Alberta Municipal Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Alberta's cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history.

The [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 census]] found that [[English language|English]], with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the province's population. The next most common mother tongues were various [[Chinese languages]] with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by [[German language|German]] with 84,505 nativespeakers (2.62%) and [[French language|French]] with 61,225 (1.90%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Detailed Mother Tongue Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89201&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=701&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;GID=838045|title=Detailed Mother Tongue (186), Knowledge of Official Languages (5), Age Groups (17A) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2001 and 2006 Censuses – 20% Sample Data|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from [[English Canadian|England]],  [[Scottish Canadian|Scotland]], [[Irish Canadian|Ireland]] and [[Canadians of Welsh descent|Wales]], but large numbers also came from other parts of [[Europe]], notably [[German Canadian|Germans]], [[French people|French]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainians]] and [[Scandinavians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada Highlight Tables | work = 2006 Census | publisher = Statistics Canada | year = 2008 | url = http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/index.cfm?Lang=E | accessdate = 2008-08-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of [[Francophones]] in western Canada (after [[Manitoba]]). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of [[Franco-Albertan|Alberta's French-speaking residents]] live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.

As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic [[Chinatown]]s, and Calgary has Canada's third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. [[Aboriginal peoples in Alberta|Aboriginal Albertans]] make up approximately three percent of the population.

In the 2006 [[Census in Canada|Canadian census]], the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 [[English-Canadian|English]] (27.2%); 679,705 [[German-Canadian|German]] (20.9%); 667,405 [[Canadian people|Canadian]] (20.5%); 661,265 [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]] (20.3%); 539,160 [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] (16.6%); 388,210 [[French Canadian|French]] (11.9%); 332,180 [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] (10.2%); 172,910 [[Canadians of Dutch descent|Dutch]] (5.3%); 170,935 [[Polish Canadians|Polish]] (5.2%); 169,355 [[North American Indian]] (5.2%); 144,585 [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] (4.4%); and 137,600 [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] (4.2%). (Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable.)''&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=48&amp;Data=Count&amp;Table=2&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000|title=Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-08-07}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst those of British origins, the [[Scottish Canadian|Scots]] have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]], [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]], and [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] having [[Scottish place names in Canada|Scottish]] origins.

Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of [[visible minorities]] after British Columbia and [[Ontario]] with 13.9% of the population consisting of [[visible minorities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Visible minority groups Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=1&amp;Data=Dist&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=5&amp;Display=Page&amp;CSDFilter=500|title=Visible minority groups, percentage distribution (2006), for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-08-09}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly one-fourth of the populations of [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]] belong to a visible minority group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visible minority groups, percentage distribution Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=CSD&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=1&amp;Data=Dist&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=5&amp;Display=Page&amp;CSDFilter=5000|title=Visible minority groups, percentage distribution (2006), for Canada and census subdivisions (municipalities) with 5,000-plus population – 20% sample data|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-08-09}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboriginal Identity Peoples make up 5.8% of the population, about half of whom consist of [[North American Indians]] and the other half are [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]]. There are also small number of [[Inuit]] people in Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aboriginal identity population by age groups Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/Aboriginal/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=1&amp;Data=Count&amp;Sex=1&amp;Age=1&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=5&amp;Display=Page|title=Aboriginal identity population by age groups, median age and sex, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-08-09}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aboriginal identity population by age groups Alberta&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Alberta Population by Religion.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Alberta has a large number of different religions, of which Catholicism is the most common.]]
As of the [[Canada 2001 Census]] the largest religious group was [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], representing 25.7% of the population. Alberta had the second highest percentage of [[non-religious]] residents in Canada (after British Columbia) at 23.1% of the population. Of the remainder, 13.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the [[United Church of Canada]], while 5.9% were [[Anglican Church in Canada|Anglican]]. [[Lutherans]] made up 4.8% of the population while [[Baptists]] comprised 2.5%.

The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. The [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province and made up 1.7% of the population. Alberta has a population of [[Hutterite]]s, a communal [[Anabaptist]] sect similar to the [[Mennonites]] (Hutterites represented 0.4% of the population while Mennonites were 0.8%), and has a significant population of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] at 0.3%. Alberta is home to several [[Byzantine Rite]] Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton]], and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]]'s [[Archbishop of Edmonton and Western Canada|Western Diocese]] which is based in Edmonton.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Alberta}}

Alberta's economy is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the burgeoning [[petroleum]] industry and to a lesser extent, [[agriculture]] and technology. The per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]74,825. This was 61% higher than the national average of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]46,441 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.statcan.ca/english/ads/11-010-XPB/pdf/sep06.pdf|format=PDF |author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | title= The Alberta economic Juggernaut:The boom on the rose| month= September |year= 2006| accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2006 census,&lt;ref name=&quot;Median earnings for economic families with earnings Alberta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/income/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=5&amp;Data1=1&amp;Data2=1&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=2&amp;Display=Page|title=Median earnings for economic families with earnings, both senior and non-senior families, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole).

The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).&lt;ref name=&quot;CECorridor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style [[quality of life]], offering [[universal health care]] benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other [[List of cities in Canada|Canadian cities]] at that time.

The [[Fraser Institute]] states that Alberta also has very high levels of [[economic freedom]] and rates Alberta as the free-est economy in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://oldfraser.lexi.net/media/media_releases/2001/20010626.html | title= Alberta Rated as Best Investment Climate | author= The Fraser Institute | authorlink= Fraser Institute| year= 2006| month= November | accessdate= 2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second free-est economy amongst U.S. states and Canadian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= http://www.freetheworld.com/efna.html | title= Economic Freedom of North America 2008 Annual Report| author= The Fraser Institute | authorlink= Fraser Institute| year= 2008| accessdate= 2008-08-01 | ISBN=0-88975-213-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry ===
[[File:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]].]]
Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska and Alberta - An Overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061215031033/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm|archivedate=2006-12-15|title=Alaska and Alberta – An Overview|publisher=Government of Alaska|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in [[North America]] are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, world class [[polyethylene]] and [[vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical]] industry to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca oil sands]] have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6&amp;nbsp;trillion barrels (254&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]], which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude.{{Dubious|date=January 2011}} Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the [[oil sands]]. With current technology and at current prices, about 315 billion barrels (50&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing  cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canada's Oil and Gas Industry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buyusa.gov/montana/canadaoilsands.html|title=Canada Oilsands Opportunities|publisher=U.S. Commercial Service|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the [[oil sands]] is the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive [[liquid crystal display]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html Interactive display system]—US Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263; [http://www2.smarttech.com/st/en-US/About+Us/News+Room/Media+Releases/2002+Media+Releases.htm?guid=%7BB3BD6857-5D25-4EC7-A741-C0232368F5FE%7D U.S. Patent for Touch Sensitive Technology]—SMART Technologies&lt;/ref&gt; With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

=== Agriculture and forestry ===
[[File:Warner Elevator Row.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Warner elevator row]], the last surviving elevator row in Alberta, currently unprotected.]]
[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of [[cattle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 Alberta Livestock Inspections—August 2006]—Alberta Government, Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|mutton]] are also raised.

[[File:Peace Country grain fields.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Grain fields in the Peace Country]]

[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other [[cereal|grains]] are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] canola also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.

The vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in Alberta}}

[[File:Stephen Avenue.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Stephen Avenue]], Calgary.]]
Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as [[West Edmonton Mall]], [[Calgary Stampede]], outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the [[Commonwealth Games]] and [[Olympic Games]], as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like [[Elk Island National Park]], [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], and the [[Columbia Icefield]].

According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geography &amp; Climate:Encourage Canadian Immigration&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akcanada.com/lic_alberta.cfm|title=Living in Canada : Alberta|publisher=AKCanada|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta tourism relies heavily on [[Southern Ontario]] tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and many international countries.

Alberta's Rocky Mountains include well known tourist destinations Banff National Park and [[Jasper National Park]]. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic [[Icefields Parkway]]. Banff is located {{convert|128|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Calgary on [[Alberta Highway 1|Highway 1]], and Jasper is located {{convert|366|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Edmonton on [[Yellowhead Highway]]. Five of Canada's fourteen [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage site]]s are located within the province: [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks]], [[Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park]], Wood Buffalo National Park, [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] and [[Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump]].

[[File:Lake Louise 17092005.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]] in the [[Canadian Rockies]].]]
About 1.2 million people visit the of [[Calgary Stampede]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Landmark Stampede Dates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stampede.coolattractions.com/history.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071116223219/http://www.stampede.coolattractions.com/history.html|archivedate=2007-11-16|title=History of the Stampede|publisher=Calgary Stampede|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a celebration of Canada's own [[Wild West]] and the cattle ranching industry. About 700,000 people enjoy Edmonton's [[Capital Ex]] (formerly Klondike Days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalex.ca/about|title=About|publisher=Northlands|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the [[Yukon]] [[Gold mining|gold field]]s, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous [[Chilkoot Pass]].

Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. Drumheller, &quot;Dinosaur Capital of The World&quot;, offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years. The Canadian Badlands has much to offer in the way of attractions, cultural events, celebrations, accommodations and service.

Located in east-central Alberta is [[Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions]], a popular tourist attraction operated out of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]]. It boasts one of the few operable steam trains in the world, offering trips through the rolling prairie scenery. Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.

Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to [[skiing|ski]] and [[hiking|hike]]; Alberta boasts several world-class [[ski resort]]s such as [[Sunshine Village]], [[Lake Louise Mountain Resort|Lake Louise]], [[Marmot Basin]], [[Mount Norquay ski resort|Norquay]] and [[Nakiska]]. Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive [[trophy|trophies]] and [[tall tales]] from their experiences in Alberta's wilderness.

=== Taxation ===
The province's revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for [[infrastructure]] projects (9.8%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Budget 2009, Building On Our Strength&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alberta.ca/budget2008/#|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080503001735/http://alberta.ca/budget2008/#|archivedate=2008-05-03|title=Budget 2009, Building On Our Strength|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] of 5%.) It is also the only Canadian province to have a [[flat tax|single rate of taxation]] for personal income taxes which is 10% of taxable income.&lt;ref name=&quot;What are the income tax rates in Canada for 2009?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html|title=What are the income tax rates in Canada for 2009?|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alberta tax system maintains a [[progressive taxation|progressive flavour]] by allowing residents to earn $16,161 before becoming subject to provincial taxation in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities, students, and the aged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberta Tax and Credits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/prvncl/09-eng.html|title=Alberta Tax and Credits|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.

Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution.  The privatization increased outlets from 304 stores to 1,726; 1,300 jobs to 4,000 jobs; and 3,325 products to 16,495 products.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Right Way to Sell Booze in New Brunswick&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Right Way to Sell Booze in New Brunswick|url=http://www.taxpayer.com/atlantic/right-way-sell-booze-new-brunswick|publisher=Taxpayer|accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax revenue also increased from $400 million to $700 million.

[[File:DavidThompsonHighway.JPG|right|thumb|220px|[[Alberta Highway 11|David Thompson Highway]] outside of [[Banff National Park]].]]
Alberta has over {{convert|180000|km|0|abbr=on}} of [[highway]]s and roads, of which nearly {{convert|50000|km|0|abbr=on}} are paved. The main north-south [[wikt:corridor|corridor]] is [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]], which begins south of [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] at the [[Carway, Alberta|Carway]] border crossing and is part of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]]. [[Alberta Highway 4|Highway 4]], which effectively extends [[Interstate 15]] into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the [[Coutts, Alberta|Coutts]] border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway 3]] joins Lethbridge to [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]] and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton.

North of Edmonton, the highway continues to [[Athabasca, Alberta|Athabasca]], then northwesterly along the south shore of [[Lesser Slave Lake]] into [[High Prairie, Alberta|High Prairie]], north to [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]], west to [[Fairview, Alberta (town)|Fairview]] and finally south to [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], where it ends at an interchange with [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]]. The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the [[Queen Elizabeth II Highway]] to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005.  Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: [[Alberta Highway 22|Highway 22]], west of Highway 2, known as ''Cowboy Trail'', and [[Alberta Highway 21|Highway 21]], east of Highway 2. Highway 43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the [[Peace River Country]]; [[Alberta Highway 63|Highway 63]] travels northeast to [[Fort McMurray, Alberta|Fort McMurray]], the location of the [[Athabasca Tar Sands|Athabasca Oil Sands]].

Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the [[Yellowhead Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 16|Highway 16]]), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and [[Jasper National Park]] into [[British Columbia]]. One of the most scenic drives is along the [[Icefields Parkway]], which runs for {{convert|228|km|0|abbr=on}} between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.

Another major corridor through central Alberta is [[Alberta Highway 11|Highway 11]] (also known as the [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] Highway), which runs east from the [[Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta|Saskatchewan River Crossing]] in Banff National Park through [[Rocky Mountain House]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], connecting with [[Alberta Highway 12|Highway 12]] {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]]. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and [[freeway]]s are often called ''trails''. For example, Highway 2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called [[Deerfoot Trail]] as it passes through Calgary but becomes [[Calgary Trail]] (for southbound traffic) and [[Gateway Boulevard]] (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban [[expressway]]s ''trails'' and naming many of them after prominent [[First Nations]] individuals and tribes, such as [[Crowchild Trail]], Deerfoot Trail, and [[Stoney Trail]].

Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial [[public transit]] systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate [[light rail transit]] (LRT) systems. [[Edmonton LRT]], which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside of it, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary [[C-Train]] has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.

Alberta is well-connected by air, with [[international airport]]s in both Calgary and Edmonton. [[Calgary International Airport]] and [[Edmonton International Airport]] are the fourth and fifth [[Canada's busiest airport|busiest in Canada]] respectively. Calgary's [[airport]] is a hub for [[WestJet|WestJet Airlines]] and a regional hub for [[Air Canada]]. Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in [[Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary Airport Authority&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yyc.com/|title=Calgary Airport Authority|publisher=Calgary Airport Authority|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyeia.com/|title=EIA|publisher=Edmonton International Airport|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over {{convert|9000|km|0|abbr=on}} of operating mainline railway, and many tourists see Alberta aboard [[Via Rail]] or [[Rocky Mountaineer]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] companies operate railway [[freight]] across the province.

== Health care ==
{{See also|Health care in Canada}}
[[File:Alberta Children's Hospital 3+4.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Alberta Children's Hospital]]]]

As with all Canadian provinces, Alberta provides for all citizens and residents through a [[publicly funded health care]] system. Alberta became Canada's second province (after [[Saskatchewan]]) to adopt a [[Tommy Douglas]]-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern [[Medicare (Canada)|medicare]] system.

Alberta's health care budget is currently $13.2 billion during the 2008–2009 fiscal year (approximately 36% of all government spending), making it the best funded health care system per-capita in Canada. Every hour more than $1.5 million is spent on health care in the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Care Funding Allocations 2009–2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.alberta.ca/about/health-funding-allocations.html|title=Health Care Funding Allocations 2009–2010|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:University Hospital Complex University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[University of Alberta Hospital]] complex.]]
A highly educated population and burgeoning economy have made Alberta a national leader in health education, research, and resources. Many notable facilities include the [[Foothills Medical Centre]], the [[Peter Lougheed Centre]], [[Rockyview General Hospital]], [[Alberta Children's Hospital]], Grace Women's Health Centre, The University of Calgary Medical Centre (UCMC), [[Tom Baker Cancer Centre]] and [[Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta]], in Calgary; In Edmonton, the [[University of Alberta Hospital]],  the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital (Edmonton)|Royal Alexandra Hospital]], the [[Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute]], the Lois Hole Hospital for Women, the [[Stollery Children's Hospital]], the Alberta Diabetes Institute, the [[Cross Cancer Institute]], and the Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research in [[Edmonton]]. Currently under construction in [[Edmonton]] is the new $909 million [[Edmonton Clinic]], which will provide a similar research, education, and care environment as the [[Mayo Clinic]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmonton Clinic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmontonclinic.ca/|title=Edmonton Clinic|publisher=Alberta Health Services; University of Alberta|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health Care]] in Alberta is administered by the unified [[Alberta Health Services|Alberta Health Services Board]]. Prior to July 1, 2008, Alberta was divided into nine [[Health regions of Canada|health regions]]: [[Aspen Regional Health Authority]]: [[Calgary Health Region]], [[Capital Health]] (Edmonton), [[Chinook Health]], [[David Thompson Regional Health Authority]], [[East Central Health]], [[Northern Lights Health Region]], [[Palliser Health Region]] and [[Peace Country Health Region]].

The [[Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society]], a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|nonprofit organization]], provides an [[air ambulance]] service to all but the most remote areas of Alberta, and some adjoining areas of British Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;STARS; About Us&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stars.ca/bins/content_page.asp?cid=2|title=STARS; About Us|publisher=STARS|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government ==
{{Main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}{{See also|List of Alberta Premiers|List of Alberta general elections}}

[[File:Edmonton leg.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Alberta Legislature Building|Alberta's Legislative Building]] in [[Edmonton]].]]
The government of Alberta is organized as a [[parliamentary]] [[democracy]] with a unicameral legislature.  Its [[unicameral]] legislature—the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]]—consists of eighty-three members.

Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.  Municipalities where the same body act as both local government and school board are formally referred to as &quot;counties&quot; in Alberta.

As Canada's [[head of state]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor [[Donald Ethell]].  Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a [[figurehead]] whose actions are restricted by custom and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]].  The government is therefore headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The current premier is [[Ed Stelmach]] who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on December 2, 2006.  Stelmach was sworn in as the 13th [[Premier of Alberta]] on December 15, 2006.

The Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and he draws all the members of his Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly.

The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of Alberta.

Alberta's elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces. Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (&quot;Conservatives&quot; or &quot;Tories&quot;), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]. A fourth party, the strongly conservative [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta. In fact, only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.

Alberta has had occasional surges in [[Alberta separatism|separatist sentiment]]. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums. There are several groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province.

In the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 provincial election]], held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the [[Alberta Liberal Party]] was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and two [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] members were elected.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008 Alberta Election Results&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|title=2008 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Alberta}}
[[File:SAIT Heart Building 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Heritage Hall at [[SAIT Polytechnic]].]]
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).

=== Elementary schools ===
There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] electorate, and one ([[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]) has a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.

For many years the [[Government of Alberta|provincial government]] has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K–12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K–12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K–12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.

[[Public school (government funded)|Public]] and separate school boards, [[charter school]]s, and [[private school]]s all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies.  Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.

=== Universities ===
{{Main|Higher education in Alberta}}
[[File:Saint Josephs College University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg‎|thumb|230px|right|St. Joseph’s College at the [[University of Alberta]].]]

The [[University of Alberta]], established in Edmonton in 1908, is Alberta's oldest and largest university. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. There is also [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]], both of which are located in their title cities.

In early September 2009, [[Mount Royal University]] became Calgary's second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made [[Grant MacEwan University]] Edmonton's second public university. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Service Centres&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aet.alberta.ca/technology/actionplan/servicecentres.aspx|title=Service Centres|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, mostly [[List of colleges in Alberta#Private Colleges|Christian Universities]], bringing the total number of universities to twelve, plus a [[DeVry University]] in Calgary, the only location in Canada. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier [[Ralph Klein]] made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Advocacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.su.ualberta.ca/su/student_government/advocacy/|title=Advocacy|publisher=University of Alberta Students Unions|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, no plan has been released by the government of Alberta.

[[File:StampedeRodeo2002.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The [[Calgary Stampede]].]]
Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton. The [[Edmonton Fringe Festival]] is the world's  second largest after [[Edinburgh]]'s. Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events including folk music festivals. With a large number of summer and winter events, Edmonton prides itself as being the &quot;Festival City&quot;. The city's &quot;heritage days&quot; festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups. Edmonton's [[Churchill Square (Edmonton)|Churchill Square]] is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton &amp; [[The Works Art &amp; Design Festival]] throughout the summer months.

&lt;!-- [[File:AGA on Churchill Square.jpg|190px|right|thumb|The [[Art Gallery of Alberta]].]] --&gt;
The City of Calgary is also famous for its [[Calgary Stampede|Stampede]], dubbed &quot;The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.&quot; The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as [[calf roping]] and [[bull riding]]. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts.

The [[Banff Centre]] hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international [[Banff Mountain Film Festival|Mountain Film Festival]]. These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the [[Francis Winspear Centre for Music]]. Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Hockey League]] teams. [[Association football|Soccer]], [[rugby union]] and [[lacrosse]] are also played professionally in Alberta.

==Paleontology==
[[File:Pachyrhinosaurus skull.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' skull. Large quantities of this genus are preserved in the [[Wapiti Formation]].]]
Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of [[Late Cretaceous]] dinosaur fossils in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; [[Taxa]] are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even [[Bone bed|mass graves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; At least 38 dinosaur [[type specimens]] are known from the [[Canadian province|province]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; The [[Foremost Formation]], [[Oldman Formation]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]s collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur bearing strata in Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; The stratigraphy of the [[Judith River Group]] has a confusing history due partly to the use of the [[Montana]]-Alberta border as an artificial division between equivalent strata.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; The modern Judith River Group stratigraphy was not finalized until 1993 when Eberth and Hamblin divided the Oldman Formation in two to create the new Dinosaur Park Formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; The resulting paleontological confusion was resolved by [[Phil Currie]] who relocated old [[quarries]] dinosaurs had been found in and determined their distribution within the modern [[stratigraphic]] framework.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt;

Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely through-out Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; The [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent [[Scollard Formation]] outcrops.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; In the [[Drumheller Valley]] and [[Edmonton]] regions there are exposed [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation|Horseshoe Canyon]] [[facies]]. Other [[Geologic formation|formations]] have been recorded as well, like the [[Milk River Formation|Milk River]] and Foremost Formations.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from [[microvertebrate]] fossil sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the [[Belly River Group]] and [[St. Mary River Formation]]s of the southwest and the northwestern [[Wapiti Formation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; The Wapiti Formations contains two ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; The [[Bearpaw Formation]] represents strata deposited during a [[marine transgression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot; /&gt; Dinosaurs are known from this Formation, but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older [[sediments]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta-paleo&quot;&gt;Ryan, M.

[[Image:World map with arctic circle.svg|thumb|350px|World map showing the Arctic Circle in red.]]
[[Image:Arctic circle.svg|thumb|350px|Map of the [[Arctic]] with the Arctic Circle in blue.]]

The '''Arctic Circle''' is one of the five major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] that mark maps of the [[Earth]]. For Epoch 2011, it is the parallel of [[latitude]] that runs {{Circle of latitude|Polar|Convert}} north of the [[Equator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=1157795&amp;site_id=1#import ''Trópico en movimiento'' (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The region north of this circle is known as the [[Arctic]], and the zone just to the south is called the [[Temperateness|Northern Temperate Zone]]. The equivalent [[polar circle]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is called the [[Antarctic Circle]].

The Arctic Circle marks the southern extremity of the [[midnight sun|polar day]] (24-hour sunlit day, often referred to as the &quot;midnight sun&quot;) and [[polar night]] (24-hour sunless night). North of the Arctic Circle, the [[sun]] is above the [[horizon]] for 24 continuous [[hour]]s at least once per [[year]] and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year. On the Arctic Circle those events occur, in principle, exactly once per year, at the June and December [[solstice]]s, respectively.

In fact, because of [[atmospheric refraction]] and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the [[summer solstice|northern summer solstice]] up to about 50[[Minute|′]] ({{convert|90|km|abbr=on}}) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the [[winter solstice|northern winter solstice]], part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ north of the Arctic Circle. That is true at sea level; those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions, there is often no direct view of the horizon.

The position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed, but directly depends on the Earth's [[axial tilt]], which fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000 year period,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communique.se/polcirkel/arctic.html Arctic Circle]&lt;/ref&gt; notably due to [[tidal force]]s resulting from the [[orbit of the Moon]]. The Arctic Circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} per year, see [[circle of latitude#Movement of the Tropical and Polar circles|''Circle of latitude'']] for more information.

==Geography==
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
Relatively few people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the [[Climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]]. The three largest communities above the Arctic Circle are situated in Russia: [[Murmansk]] (population 325,100), [[Norilsk]] (135,000), and [[Vorkuta]] (85,000). [[Tromsø]] (in Norway) has about 62,000 inhabitants. In contrast, the largest North American community north of the circle, [[Barrow, Alaska]], has approximately 4,000 inhabitants. [[Rovaniemi]] (in Finland), which lies slightly south of the line, has a population of approximately 58,000, and is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle. 

The Arctic Circle passes through the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], [[North Asia]], [[Northern America]] and [[Greenland]]. The land on the Arctic Circle is divided among eight countries: [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]] (i.e. [[Alaska]]), [[Canada]], [[Denmark]] (i.e. [[Greenland]]), and [[Iceland]] (where it passes through the small offshore island of [[Grímsey]]).

Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the Arctic Circle passes through:

The '''Actinopterygii''' {{IPA-en|ˌæktɨnɒptəˈrɪdʒi.aɪ|}} or '''ray-finned fishes''' constitute a [[Class (biology)|class]] or sub-class of the [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]]. 

The ray-finned [[fish]]es are so called because they possess [[lepidotrichia]] or &quot;fin rays&quot;, their fins being webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines (&quot;rays&quot;), as opposed to the fleshy, lobed fins that characterize the class [[Sarcopterygii]] which also, however, possess lepidotrichia. These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton (e.g., pelvic and pectoral girdles). 

In terms of numbers, actinopterygians are the dominant class of [[vertebrate]]s, comprising nearly 96% of the 25,000 species of fish. They are ubiquitous throughout [[fresh water]] and [[ocean|marine]] environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams. Extant species can range in size from ''[[Paedocypris]]'', at {{convert|8|mm|in}}, to the massive [[Ocean Sunfish]], at {{convert|2300|kg|lb}}, and the long-bodied [[Oarfish]], to at least {{convert|11|m|ft}}.

==Fossil record==
[[Image:Hypsospondylus.JPG|thumb|left|''Hypsospondylus'' fossil]] 
The earliest known fossil Actinopterygiian is ''[[Andreolepis hedei]]'', dating back 420 million years ([[Late Silurian]]). This [[microvertebrate]] has been uncovered in [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=34968&amp;is_real_user=1 Palaeobase]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Traditionally three grades of actinopterygians have been recognised: the '''[[Chondrostei]]''', '''[[Holostei]]''', and '''[[Teleostei]]'''. Some morphological evidence suggests that the second is [[paraphyletic]] and should be abandoned; however, recent work based on more complete sampling of fossil taxa, and also an analysis of DNA sequence data from the complete mitochondrial genome, supports its recognition. Nearly all living bony fishes are [[teleost]]s.

A listing of the different groups is given below, down to the level of orders, arranged in what has been suggested to represent the evolutionary sequence down to the level of order based primarily on the long history of morphological studies. This classification, like any other [[taxonomy]] based on [[phylogenetic]] research is in a state of flux. Recent morphological and molecular has shown that several of these ordinal and higher-level groupings represent [[evolutionary grade]]s rather than [[clade]]s. Examples of demonstrably [[paraphyletic]] groups include the [[Paracanthopterygii]], [[Scorpaeniformes]], and [[Perciformes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = G. D. Johnson and E. O.

For this achievement, Einstein is often regarded as the father of [[modern physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] &quot;for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the [[photoelectric effect]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921 |accessdate=6 March 2007 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bLXMl1V0 |archivedate=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was pivotal in establishing [[quantum theory]] within physics.

Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that [[Newtonian mechanics]] was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of [[classical mechanics]] with the laws of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led to the development of his [[special theory of relativity]]. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to [[gravitational fields]], and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the [[general theory of relativity]]. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], which led to his explanations of [[particle|particle theory]] and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the [[universe]] as a whole.&lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein.html &quot;Einstein Biography&quot;] Nobelprize.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was visiting the United States when [[Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]]. He settled in the U.S., becoming a citizen in 1940. On the eve of [[World War II]], he helped alert [[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] that Germany might be developing an atomic weapon, and recommended that the U.S. begin similar research. Later, together with [[Bertrand Russell]], Einstein signed the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]], which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein taught physics at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey, until his death in 1955.

Einstein published [[List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein|more than 300 scientific papers]] along with over 150 non-scientific works.&lt;ref name=Nobel/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Arthur Schilpp, editor 1951 730–746&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=Paul Arthur Schilpp, editor |year=1951 |title=Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist, Volume II |publisher=Harper and Brothers Publishers (Harper Torchbook edition) |location=New York |pages=730–746}}His non-scientific works include: ''About Zionism: Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein'' (1930), &quot;Why War?&quot; (1933, co-authored by [[Sigmund Freud]]), ''The World As I See It'' (1934), ''Out of My Later Years'' (1950), and a book on science for the general reader, ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'' (1938, co-authored by [[Leopold Infeld]]).&lt;/ref&gt; His great intelligence and originality have made the word &quot;Einstein&quot; synonymous with [[genius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Einstein WordNet for Einstein].&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Einstein was born in [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] in the German Empire on 14&amp;nbsp;March 1879.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html |title=Albert Einstein&amp;nbsp;– Biography |accessdate=7 March 2007 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Hermann Einstein]], a salesman and engineer. His mother was [[Pauline Koch|Pauline Einstein (née Koch)]]. In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where his father and his uncle founded ''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein &amp; Cie'', a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

The Einsteins were non-observant [[Jew]]s. Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] from the age of five for three years. Later, at the age of eight, Einstein was transferred to the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]] where he received advanced primary and secondary school education till he left Germany seven years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stachel2002&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=John J.

His father once showed him a pocket compass; Einstein realized that there must be something causing the needle to move, despite the apparent &quot;empty space&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=P. A. |last=Schilpp (Ed.) |title=Albert Einstein&amp;nbsp;– Autobiographical Notes |pages=8–9 |publisher=[[Open Court Publishing Company]] |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he grew, Einstein built models and mechanical devices for fun and began to show a talent for mathematics.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; In 1889, Max Talmud (later changed to Max Talmey) introduced the ten-year old Einstein to key texts in science, mathematics and philosophy, including Immanuel Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' (which Einstein called the &quot;holy little geometry book&quot;).&lt;ref name=HarvChemAE&gt;Dudley Herschbach, &quot;Einstein as a Student&quot;, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, page 3, web: [http://www.chem.harvard.edu/herschbach/Einstein_Student.pdf HarvardChem-Einstein-PDF]: Max Talmud visited on Thursdays for six years.&lt;/ref&gt; Talmud was a poor Jewish medical student from Poland. The Jewish community arranged for Talmud to take meals with the Einsteins each week on Thursdays for six years. During this time Talmud wholeheartedly guided Einstein through many secular educational interests.{{#tag:ref|&quot;Albert's intellectual growth was strongly fostered at home. His mother, a talented pianist, ensured the children's musical education. His father regularly read Schiller and Heine aloud to the family. Uncle Jakob challenged Albert with mathematical problems, which he solved with 'a deep feeling of happiness'. Most remarkable was Max Talmud, a poor Jewish medical student from Poland, 'for whom the Jewish community had obtained free meals with the Einstein family'. Talmud came on Thursday nights for about six years, and 'invested his whole person in examining everything that engaged [Albert's] interest'. Talmud had Albert read and discuss many books with him. These included a series of twenty popular science books that convinced Albert 'a lot in the Bible stories could not be true', and a textbook of plane geometry that launched Albert on avid self-study of mathematics, years ahead of the school curriculum. Talmud even had Albert read Kant; as a result Einstein began preaching to his schoolmates about Kant, with 'forcefulness'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.harvard.edu/herschbach/Einstein_Student.pdf Einstein as a Student].

In 1894, his father's company failed: direct current (DC) lost the [[War of Currents]] to [[alternating current]] (AC). In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and then, a few months later, to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict [[rote learning]]. In the spring of 1895, he withdrew to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; During this time, Einstein wrote his first scientific work, &quot;The Investigation of the State of [[aether theories|Aether]] in [[magnetic field|Magnetic Fields]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Mehra |first=Jagdish |contribution=Albert Einstein's first paper |title=The Golden Age of Physics |publisher=World Scientific |year=2001 |url=http://www.worldscibooks.com/phy_etextbook/4454/4454_chap1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=4 March 2007 |isbn=9810249853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein applied directly to the [[ETH|Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule]] (ETH) in [[Zurich]], Switzerland. Lacking the requisite [[Matura]] certificate, he took an entrance examination, which he failed, although he got exceptional marks in mathematics and physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Highfield |first=Roger |last2=Carter |first2=Paul |title=The Private Lives of Albert Einstein |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |year=1993 |location=London |isbn=0-571-17170-2 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Einsteins sent Albert to [[Aarau]], in northern Switzerland to finish secondary school.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; While lodging with the family of Professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. (His sister [[Maja Einstein|Maja]] later married the Wintelers' son, Paul.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21,31,56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aarau, Einstein studied [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s [[electromagnetic theory]]. At age 17, he graduated, and, with his father's approval, renounced his [[German citizenship|citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg]] to avoid [[Conscription in Germany|military service]], and in 1896 he enrolled in the four year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Polytechnic in Zurich. Marie Winteler moved to [[Olsberg, Switzerland]] for a teaching post.

Einstein's future wife, [[Mileva Marić]], also enrolled at the Polytechnic that same year, the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900 Einstein was awarded the Zurich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions.&lt;ref&gt;''Albert Einstein Collected Papers'', vol. 1, 1987, doc. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his celebrated 1905 papers,&lt;ref&gt;Troemel-Ploetz, D., &quot;Mileva Einstein-Marić: The Woman Who Did Einstein's Mathematics&quot;, ''Women's Studies Int.

===Marriages and children===
{{main|Einstein family}}
In early 1902, Einstein and Mileva Marić had a daughter they named [[Lieserl Einstein|Lieserl]] in their correspondence, who was born in [[Novi Sad]] where Marić's parents lived.&lt;ref&gt;This conclusion is from Einstein's correspondence with Marić. Lieserl is first mentioned in a letter from Einstein to Marić (who was staying with her family in or near Novi Sad at the time of Lieserl's birth) dated 4 February 1902 (''Collected papers'' Vol. 1, document 134).&lt;/ref&gt; Her full name is not known, and her fate is uncertain after 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Fölsing (1998). Albert Einstein: A Biography. Penguin Group. ISBN 0140237194; see section I, II,&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, the couple's first son, [[Hans Albert Einstein]], was born in [[Bern]], Switzerland. Their second son, [[Eduard Einstein|Eduard]], was born in Zurich in July 1910. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin, while his wife remained in Zurich with their sons. Marić and Einstein divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.

Einstein [[cousin marriage|married]] [[Elsa Einstein|Elsa Löwenthal]] (née Einstein) on 2 June 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. She was his first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated permanently to the United States. In 1935, Elsa Einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems and died in December 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Highfield216&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Highfield|Carter|1993|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent office===

[[File:einsteinhaus4.jpg|alt=Attached stone dwelling with drapery visible in the windows. It is over a first story restaurant.|thumb|right|upright|[[Einsteinhaus|Einstein's home]] in Bern]]
After graduating, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post, but a former classmate's father helped him secure a job in Bern, at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property|Federal Office for Intellectual Property]], the patent office, as an assistant [[patent examiner|examiner]].&lt;ref&gt;Now the {{Citation|title=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property |url=http://www.ipi.ch/E/institut/i1.shtm|accessdate= 16 October 2006 }}. See also their {{Citation |title=FAQ about Einstein and the Institute|url=http://www.ipi.ch/E/institut/i1094.shtm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He evaluated [[patent application]]s for electromagnetic devices. In 1903, Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he &quot;fully mastered machine technology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Galison, &quot;Einstein's Clocks: The Question of Time&quot; ''Critical Inquiry'' 26, no. 2 (Winter 2000): 355–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the [[thought experiment]]s that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Gallison, Question of Time.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a few friends he met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group, self-mockingly named &quot;The [[Olympia Academy]]&quot;, which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Their readings included the works of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], and [[David Hume]], which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.

===Academic career===
[[File:Albert Einstein (Nobel).png|thumb|left|Einstein's official 1921 portrait after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics.]]
In 1901, Einstein had a paper on the [[capillary action|capillary forces]] of a straw published in the prestigious ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Einstein was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] by the [[University of Zurich]]. His dissertation was entitled &quot;A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Einstein|1905b}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, which has been called Einstein's ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' or &quot;miracle year&quot;, he published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]], on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of matter and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world.

By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist, and he was appointed lecturer at the [[University of Bern]]. The following year, he quit the patent office and the lectureship to take the position of physics [[Docent#Germany and Switzerland|docent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uzh.ch/about/portrait/history.html |title=Universität Zürich: Geschichte |publisher=Uzh.ch |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Zurich. He became a full professor at [[Charles University in Prague|Karl-Ferdinand University in Prague]] in 1911. In 1914, he returned to Germany after being appointed director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]] (1914–1932)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kant&quot;&gt;Kant, Horst. &quot;Albert Einstein and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]] in Berlin&quot;. in Renn, Jürgen. &quot;Albert Einstein&amp;nbsp;– Chief Engineer of the Universe: One Hundred Authors for Einstein.&quot; Ed. Renn, Jürgen. ''Wiley-VCH''. 2005. pp. 166–169. ISBN = 3527405747&lt;/ref&gt; and a professor at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], although with a special clause in his contract that freed him from most teaching obligations. He became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1916, Einstein was appointed president of the [[German Physical Society]] (1916–1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 1911, he had calculated that, based on his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity. That prediction was claimed confirmed by observations made by a British expedition led by Sir [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Arthur Eddington]] during the [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]]. International media reports of this made Einstein world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' printed a banner headline that read: &quot;Revolution in Science&amp;nbsp;– New Theory of the Universe&amp;nbsp;– Newtonian Ideas Overthrown&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eddington&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last = Andrzej |first = Stasiak |year = 2003 |title = Myths in science |journal = EMBO reports |volume = 4 |issue = 3 |page = 236|doi =10.1038/sj.embor.embor779 |url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v4/n3/full/embor779.html |accessdate = 31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Much later, questions were raised whether the measurements were accurate enough to support Einstein's theory.)

In 1921, Einstein was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. Because relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, it was officially bestowed for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. He also received the [[Copley Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]] in 1925.

===Travels abroad===

Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by the Mayor, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher [[Viscount Haldane]] in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at Kings College.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman and Dukas (1972), pp. 145–148; Fölsing (1997), pp. 499–508.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, he traveled throughout Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour. His travels included [[Singapore]], [[Ceylon]], and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. His first lecture in [[Tokyo]] lasted four hours, after which he met the emperor and empress at the [[Imperial Palace]] where thousands came to watch. Einstein later gave his impressions of the Japanese in a letter to his sons:&lt;ref name=Isaacson2/&gt;{{rp|307}} &quot;Of all the people I have met, I like the Japanese most, as they are modest, intelligent, considerate, and have a feel for art.&quot;&lt;ref name=Isaacson2&gt;Isaacson, Walter. ''Einstein: His Life and Universe'', Simon &amp; Schuster (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|308}}

On his return voyage, he also visited Palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. &quot;He was greeted with great British pomp, as if he were a head of state rather than a theoretical physicist&quot;, writes Isaacson. This included a cannon salute upon his arrival at the residence of the British high commissioner, [[Sir Herbert Samuel]]. During one reception given to him, the building was &quot;stormed by throngs who wanted to hear him&quot;. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed his happiness over the event:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I consider this the greatest day of my life. Before, I have always found something to regret in the Jewish soul, and that is the forgetfulness of its own people. Today, I have been made happy by the sight of the Jewish people learning to recognize themselves and to make themselves recognized as a force in the world.&lt;ref name=Isaacson/&gt;{{rp|308}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Emigration from Germany===
[[File:Einstein-cartoon1.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Einstein takes up the sword,&quot;&lt;br&gt;Cartoon of Einstein who has shed his &quot;pacifism&quot; wings (circa 1933)]]
In 1933, Einstein decided to emigrate to the United States due to the rise to power of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] under Germany's new chancellor, [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief |title=In Brief |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting American universities in April, 1933, he learned that the new German government had passed a law barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. A month later, the [[Nazi book burnings]] occurred, with Einstein's works being among those burnt, and Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaimed, &quot;Jewish intellectualism is dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=Isaacson&gt;Isaacson, Walter. ''Einstein: His Life and Universe'', Simon &amp; Schuster (2007) pp. 407–410&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein also learned that his name was on a list of assassination targets, with a &quot;$5,000 bounty on his head&quot;. One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, &quot;not yet hanged&quot;.&lt;ref name=Isaacson/&gt;

Einstein was undertaking his third two-month visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] when Hitler came to power in Germany. On his return to Europe in March 1933 he resided in Belgium for some months, before temporarily moving to England.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, B. (1972), pp. 165–171; Fölsing, A. (1997), pp. 666–677.&lt;/ref&gt;

He took up a position at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey,&lt;ref name=princeton&gt;{{cite web
  | title =In Brief (Albert Einstein)

an affiliation that lasted until his death in 1955. There, he tried to develop a [[unified field theory]] and to refute the accepted interpretation of [[quantum physics]], both unsuccessfully. He and [[Kurt Gödel]], another Institute member, became close friends. They would take long walks together discussing their work. His last assistant was [[Bruria Kaufman]], who later became a renowned physicist.

Other scientists also fled to America. Among them were Nobel laureates and professors of [[theoretical physics]]. With so many other Jewish scientists now forced by circumstances to live in America, often working side by side, Einstein wrote to a friend, &quot;For me the most beautiful thing is to be in contact with a few fine Jews—a few millennia of a civilized past do mean something after all.&quot; In another letter he writes, &quot;In my whole life I have never felt so Jewish as now.&quot;&lt;ref name=Isaacson/&gt;

====World War II and the Manhattan Project====
In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included Hungarian emigre physicist [[Leo Szilard]] attempted to alert Washington of ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted.&lt;ref name=Pritchard&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/7970619/Obama-could-kill-fossil-fuels-overnight-with-a-nuclear-dash-for-thorium.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium | first=Ambrose | last=Evans-Pritchard | date=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Einstein was persuaded to lend his prestige by writing [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|a letter]], with [[Leo Szilard]], to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], in order to alert him of the possibility that Nazi Germany might be [[German nuclear energy project|developing an atomic bomb]]. At the same time, the letter recommended that the U.S. government should pay attention to and become directly involved with uranium research, and associated chain reaction research. Einstein and Szilard, along with other refugees such as [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]], &quot;regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.&quot;&lt;ref name=Isaacson2/&gt;{{rp|630}} &lt;ref name=Gosling&gt;Gosling, F.G. ''The Manhattan Project: Making the Atomic Bomb'', U.S. Department of Energy, History Division (January, 1999) p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter is believed to be &quot;arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Sarah J.; Moltz, James Clay. [http://books.google.com/books?id=3PN-NEfl_U0C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=Einstein+Roosevelt&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=3LkCTNjODJzykwS-qb3kBA&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Letter%20from%20Einstein%20Roosevelt&amp;f=false ''Nuclear Weapons and Nonproliferation: a Reference Handbook''], ABC-CLIO (2008) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the &quot;race&quot; to develop the bomb, drawing on its &quot;immense material, financial, and scientific resources&quot; to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]]. It became the only country to develop an atomic bomb during World War II.

For Einstein, &quot;war was a disease . . . [and] he called for resistance to war.&quot; But in 1933, after Hitler assumed full power in Germany, &quot;he renounced pacifism altogether . . . In fact, he urged the Western powers to prepare themselves against another German onslaught.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt;{{rp|110}} In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, [[Linus Pauling]], &quot;I made one great mistake in my life&amp;nbsp;— when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made;  but there was some justification&amp;nbsp;— the danger that the Germans would make them...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;regret&quot;&gt;Einstein: The Life and Times'' by Ronald Clark. page 752&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. citizenship====
[[File:Citizen-Einstein.jpg|thumb|right|Accepting U.S. citizenship, 1940]]

Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at Princeton, he expressed his appreciation of the &quot;meritocracy&quot; in American culture when compared to Europe. According to Isaacson, he recognized the &quot;right of individuals to say and think what they pleased&quot;, without social barriers, and as result, the individual was &quot;encouraged&quot; to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education. Einstein writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What makes the new arrival devoted to this country is the democratic trait among the people. No one humbles himself before another person or class. . . American youth has the good fortune not to have its outlook troubled by outworn traditions.&lt;ref name=Isaacson/&gt;{{rp|432}}
&lt;/blockquote/&gt;
[[File:Einstein and ben gurion.jpg|thumb|left|Einstein with [[David Ben Gurion]], 1951]]
As a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] at Princeton who campaigned for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] of African Americans, Einstein corresponded with civil rights activist [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], and in 1946 Einstein called racism America's &quot;worst disease&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Jerome, Rodger Taylor (2006) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=4d79VQdOfFUC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=Einstein+on+Race+and+Racism+america's+worst+disease&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rGkNTP-OB9DY4gaN6f1-&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Einstein on Race and Racism]'' Rutgers University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated, &quot;Race prejudice has unfortunately become an American tradition which is uncritically handed down from one generation to the next.

===Annus Mirabilis papers===
{{Main|Annus Mirabilis papers|Photoelectric effect|Special theory of relativity|Mass–energy equivalence}}
The ''[[Annus mirabilis|Annus Mirabilis]]'' papers are four articles pertaining to the [[photoelectric effect]] (which gave rise to [[quantum theory]]), [[Brownian motion]], the [[special theory of relativity]], and [[E=mc2|E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] that Albert Einstein published in the ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of [[History of physics#Modern physics|modern physics]] and changed views on [[space]], [[time]], and [[matter]]. The four papers are:

===Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics===
{{Main|Statistical mechanics|thermal fluctuations|statistical physics}}
Albert Einstein's first paper&lt;ref name=PubList&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans-Josef Kuepper |url=http://www.einstein-website.de/z_physics/wisspub-e.html |title=List of Scientific Publications of Albert Einstein |publisher=Einstein-website.de |date= |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted in 1900 to ''Annalen der Physik'' was on [[capillary attraction]]. It was published in 1901 titled ''Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen'', which was translated as &quot;Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena&quot;. Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on [[Brownian motion]]. These published calculations (1905) showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.&lt;ref name=PubList/&gt;

===General principles postulated by Einstein===

He articulated the [[principle of relativity]]. This was understood by [[Hermann Minkowski]] to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the [[principle of equivalence]] and the principle of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of the quantum number.

===Theory of relativity and E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;===

{{Main|History of special relativity}}
Einstein's &quot;Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper&quot; (&quot;On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot;) was received on June 30, 1905 and published September 26 of that same year. It reconciles [[Maxwell's equations]] for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics, by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the [[speed of light]]. This later became known as Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]].

Consequences of this include the [[Spacetime|time-space frame]] of a moving body [[Time dilation|slowing down]] and [[Length contraction|contracting]] (in the direction of motion) relative to the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]&amp;nbsp;– one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time&amp;nbsp;– was superfluous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Einstein|1905d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper on ''[[mass–energy equivalence]]'' Einstein produced ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from his special relativity equations. &lt;ref name=Stachel&gt;{{Cite book| last =Stachel| first =John J.| title =Einstein from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;

===Photons and energy quanta===

{{Main|Photon|Quanta}}
In a 1905 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Einstein | first = Albert | title = Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 17 | pages = 132–148 | year = 1905 | url = http://www.zbp.univie.ac.at/dokumente/einstein1.pdf | accessdate = 27 June 2009 |bibcode = 1905AnP...322..132E |doi = 10.1002/andp.19053220607 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein postulated that [[light]] itself consists of localized particles (''[[quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the [[photoelectric effect]], and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].

Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Einstein|1905a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantized atomic vibrations===

{{Main|Einstein solid}}
In 1907 Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator.  In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently – a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be different, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html Celebrating Einstein

===Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables===

{{Main|Old quantum theory}}
Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].

Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics. The law that the action variable is quantized was a basic principle of the quantum theory as it was known between 1900 and 1925.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Wave-particle duality===
[[File:Einstein 1911 Solvay.jpg|alt=Upper body shot of man in suit, high white collar and bow tie.|thumb|upright|130px|Einstein at the [[Solvay Conference]] in 1911]]

{{Main|Wave-particle duality}}
Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a ''[[privatdozent]]'' at the [[University of Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Pais |first = Abraham |author-link = Abraham Pais |year = 1982 |title = Subtle is the Lord. The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 019853907X |page = 522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In &quot;über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung&quot; (&quot;[[s:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]&quot;), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's [[energy]] [[quanta]] must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave-particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]].

===Theory of critical opalescence===
{{Main|Critical opalescence}}
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Raleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levenson&quot;&gt;Levenson, Thomas. &quot;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/ Einstein's Big Idea]&quot;. ''[[Public Broadcasting Service]].'' 2005. Retrieved on 25 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.
===Zero-point energy===

{{Main|Zero-point energy}}
Einstein's physical intuition led him to note that Planck's oscillator energies had an incorrect zero point. He modified Planck's hypothesis by stating that the lowest energy state of an oscillator is equal to {{frac|1|2}}''hf'', to half the energy spacing between levels. This argument, which was made in 1913 in collaboration with [[Otto Stern]], was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms.

===General relativity and the Equivalence Principle===
{{Main|History of general relativity}}
{{See also|Principle of equivalence|Theory of relativity}}
[[Image:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|150px|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]’s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]].]]
General relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.

As Albert Einstein later said, the reason for the development of [[general relativity]] was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-lecture.html Nobel lecture] in 1921&lt;/ref&gt; So in 1908 he published an article on acceleration under [[special relativity]]. In that article, he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply.  This argument is called the [[Equivalence principle]].  In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of [[gravitational time dilation]].  In 1911, Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article, in which additional effects such as the [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]] by massive bodies were predicted.

===Hole argument and Entwurf theory===
{{Main|Hole argument}}
While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

In June, 1913 the Entwurf (&quot;draft&quot;) theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. Simultaneously less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, after more than two years of intensive work Einstein abandoned the theory in November, 1915 after realizing that the hole argument was mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;van Dongen, Jeroen (2010) ''Einstein's Unification'' Cambridge University Press, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
{{Main|Cosmology}}
In 1917, Einstein applied the General theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole. He wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging, but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity. To fix this, Einstein modified the general theory by introducing a new notion, the [[cosmological constant]]. With a positive cosmological constant, the universe could be an [[Einstein static universe|eternal static sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Einstein|1917a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein believed a spherical static universe is philosophically preferred, because it would obey Mach's principle. He had shown that general relativity incorporates Mach's principle to a certain extent in [[frame dragging]] by [[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic fields]], but he knew that Mach's idea would not work if space goes on forever. In a closed universe, he believed that Mach's principle would hold.

Mach's principle has generated much controversy over the years.

[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|right|thumb|150px|Einstein in his office at the [[University of Berlin]].]]

===Modern quantum theory===

{{Main|Schrödinger equation}}
In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Einstein|1917b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.
Einstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.

===Bose–Einstein statistics===

{{Main|Bose–Einstein condensation}}
In 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Einstein|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]–[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm|title=Cornell and Wieman Share 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics|date=9 October 2001|accessdate=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.&lt;ref name=Instituut-Lorentz/&gt;

===Energy momentum pseudotensor===

{{Main|Stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor}}
General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.

Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.

The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and others.

===Unified field theory===

{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}
Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his &quot;[[unified field theory]]&quot; in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article entitled &quot;On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Einstein|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.

===Wormholes===

{{Main|Wormhole}}
Einstein collaborated with others to produce a model of a [[wormhole]]. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper &quot;Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?&quot;. These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.

If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.

===Einstein–Cartan theory===

{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}
In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.

===Equations of motion===

{{Main|Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations}}
The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law &amp;nbsp;– the [[Einstein equations]] which describe how space curves, the [[geodesic equation]] which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.

Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.

This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.

===Other investigations===
Below is a list of other investigations conducted by Einstein and their result.
* In the special relativity paper (in 1905), Einstein noted that, given a specific definition of the word &quot;force&quot; (a definition which he later agreed was not advantageous), and if we choose to maintain (by convention) the equation mass x acceleration = force, then one arrives at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m/(1 - v^2/c^2)&lt;/math&gt; as the expression for the [[transverse mass]] of a fast moving particle. This differs from the accepted expression today, because, as noted in the footnotes to Einstein's paper added in the 1913 reprint, &quot;it is more to the point to define force in such a way that the laws of energy and momentum assume the simplest form&quot;, as was done, for example, by Max Planck in 1906, who gave the now familiar expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; for the transverse mass. As Miller points out, this is equivalent to the transverse mass predictions of both Einstein and Lorentz. Einstein had commented already in the 1905 paper that &quot;With a different definition of force and acceleration, we should naturally obtain other expressions for the masses. This shows that in comparing different theories... we must proceed very cautiously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Miller, Arthur I. |year=1981 |title= Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity. Emergence (1905) and early interpretation (1905–1911)|location= Reading |publisher=Addison–Wesley |isbn=0-201-04679-2 |pages=325–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Einstein published (in 1922) a qualitative theory of superconductivity based on the vague idea of electrons shared in orbits. This paper predated modern quantum mechanics, and today is regarded as being incorrect. The current theory of low temperature superconductivity was only worked out in 1957, thirty years after the establishing of modern quantum mechanics. However, even today, superconductivity is not well understood, and alternative theories continue to be put forward, especially to account for high-temperature superconductors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* After introducing the concept of gravitational waves in 1917, Einstein subsequently entertained doubts about whether they could be physically realized. In 1937 he published a paper saying that the focusing properties of geodesics in general relativity would lead to an instability which causes plane gravitational waves to collapse in on themselves. While this is true to a certain extent in some limits, because gravitational instabilities can lead to a concentration of energy density into black holes, for plane waves of the type Einstein and Rosen considered in their paper, the instabilities are under control. Einstein retracted this position a short time later.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Einstein denied several times that black holes could form. In 1939 he published a paper that argues that a star collapsing would spin faster and faster, spinning at the speed of light with infinite energy well before the point where it is about to collapse into a black hole. This paper received no citations, and the conclusions are well understood to be wrong. Einstein's argument itself is inconclusive, since he only shows that stable spinning objects have to spin faster and faster to stay stable before the point where they collapse. But it is well understood today (and was understood well by some even then) that collapse cannot happen through stationary states the way Einstein imagined. Nevertheless, the extent to which the models of black holes in classical general relativity correspond to physical reality remains unclear, and in particular the implications of the central singularity implicit in these models are still not understood. Efforts to conclusively prove the existence of event horizons have still not been successful.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Closely related to his rejection of black holes, Einstein believed that the exclusion of singularities might restrict the class of solutions of the field equations so as to force solutions compatible with quantum mechanics, but no such theory has ever been found.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* In the early days of quantum mechanics, Einstein tried to show that the uncertainty principle was not valid, but by 1927 he had become convinced that it was valid.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* In the [[EPR paradox|EPR paper]], Einstein argued that quantum mechanics cannot be a complete realistic and local representation of phenomena, given specific definitions of &quot;realism&quot;, &quot;locality&quot;, and &quot;completeness&quot;. The modern consensus is that Einstein's concept of realism is too restrictive.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Einstein himself considered the introduction of the cosmological term in his 1917 paper founding cosmology as a &quot;blunder&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Karen |last=Wright |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/sep/the-masters-mistakes/article_view?b_start:int=1&amp;-C= |title=The Master's Mistakes |publisher=Discover Magazine |date=30 September 2004 |accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of general relativity predicted an expanding or contracting universe, but Einstein wanted a universe which is an unchanging three dimensional sphere, like the surface of a three dimensional ball in four dimensions. He wanted this for philosophical reasons, so as to incorporate Mach's principle in a reasonable way. He stabilized his solution by introducing a [[cosmological constant]], and when the universe was shown to be expanding, he retracted the constant as a blunder. This is not really much of a blunder&amp;nbsp;– the cosmological constant is necessary within general relativity as it is currently understood, and it is widely believed to have a nonzero value today.
* Einstein did not immediately appreciate the value of Minkowski's four-dimensional formulation of special relativity, although within a few years he had adopted it within his theory of gravitation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Finding it too formal, Einstein believed that Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] was incorrect. He changed his mind when Schrödinger and others demonstrated that the formulation in terms of the [[Schrödinger equation]], based on Einstein's [[wave-particle duality]] was equivalent to Heisenberg's matrices.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Collaboration with other scientists===

In addition to long time collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.

====Einstein-de Haas experiment====
{{Main|Einstein-de Haas effect}}
Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.

====Schrödinger gas model====
Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose–Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.

This formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of a [[semiclassical]]{{dn}} [[ideal gas]]. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Moore |first=Walter |year=1989 |title=Schrödinger: Life and Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-43767-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Einstein refrigerator====
{{Main|Einstein refrigerator}}
In 1926, Einstein and his former student [[Leó Szilárd]] co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. This [[absorption refrigerator]] was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goettling&quot;&gt;Goettling, Gary. [http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/sum98/einsrefr.html Einstein's refrigerator] ''Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine.'' 1998. Retrieved on 21 November 2005. [[Leó Szilárd]], a Hungarian physicist who later worked on the Manhattan Project, is credited with the discovery of the [[chain reaction]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 1930, {{US patent|1781541}} was awarded to Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, as the most promising of their patents were quickly bought up by the Swedish company [[Electrolux]] to protect its refrigeration technology from competition.&lt;ref&gt;In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of [[Oxford University]] was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's efficiency to be quadrupled.{{Citation | last = Alok | first = Jha | title = Einstein fridge design can help global cooling | publisher = The Guardian | date = 21 September 2008 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange | accessdate = 22 February 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bohr versus Einstein===
{{Main|Bohr–Einstein debates}}
[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed. A dark-haired Bohr is talking while Einstein looks sceptical.|right|thumb|150px|upright|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], 1925]] The '''Bohr–Einstein debates''' were a series of public disputes about [[quantum mechanics]] between [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Niels Bohr]] who were  two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name='Bohr1949'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm | title = Discussions with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics | accessdate = 2010-08-30 | last = Bohr N | work = [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/index.htm The Value of Knowledge: A Miniature Library of Philosophy] | publisher = [[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}  From Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist (1949), publ.

A reprint of this book was published by Edition Erbrich in 1982, ISBN 388682005X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Einstein|1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox===
{{Main|EPR paradox}}
In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.

He then used a hypothesis of [[local realism]] to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.

This principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which had been promulgated in 1964.

==Political and religious views==
{{Main|Albert Einstein's political views|Albert Einstein's religious views}}
[[File:Einsteinwiezmann.PNG|alt=Casual group shot of four men and two women standing on a brick pavement.|thumb|Albert Einstein, seen here with his wife [[Elsa Einstein]] and Zionist leaders, including future President of Israel [[Chaim Weizmann]], his wife [[Vera Weizmann|Dr. Vera Weizmann]], [[Menahem Ussishkin]], and Ben-Zion Mossinson on arrival in New York City in 1921.]]

Albert Einstein's political views emerged publicly in the middle of the 20th century due to his fame and reputation for genius.  Einstein offered to and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. ([[Albert Einstein's political views|see main article]])

Einstein's views on religious belief have been collected from interviews and original writings. These views covered theological determinism, agnosticism, humanism along with ethical culture, opting for Spinoza's god over belief in a [[personal god]], [[religious belief]], [[enlightenment]] and [[liberation]], [[Jews]], [[Christianity]], [[Jesus]], [[Pope Pius XII]], and [[the Catholic Church]]. ([[Albert Einstein's religious views|see main article]])

==Non-scientific legacy==
While travelling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to [[The Hebrew University]]. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEFD9153FF931A25754C0A960948260 |title=Obituary |publisher=New York Times |date=1986-07-12 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the [[BBC]] that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title =Letters Reveal Einstein Love Life |journal =[[BBC News]] |publisher =BBC |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5168002.stm |accessdate =14 March 2007 | date=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein bequeathed the royalties from use of his [[personality rights|image]] to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. [[Corbis]], successor to [[The Roger Richman Agency]], licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Roger Richman Agency |chapter =Albert Einstein Licensing |year =2007 |chapter-url =http://www.albert-einstein.net/index2.html |accessdate =25 March 2007 }}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}; {{wayback|http://www.albert-einstein.net/index2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://einstein.biz/|title=Einstein|publisher=Corbis Rights Representation|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Albert Einstein in popular culture}}
In the period before World War II, Einstein was so well-known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain &quot;that theory&quot;. He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers &quot;Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The New Yorker April 1939 pg 69 [http://www.newyorker.com/search/query?queryType=nonparsed&amp;query=Einstein+&amp;bylquery=Maloney&amp;month1=01&amp;day1=14&amp;year1=1939&amp;month2=01&amp;day2=14&amp;year2=1939&amp;page=&amp;sort=&amp;submit.x=10&amp;submit.y=5 Disguise]&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cindymctee.com/einsteins_dream.html] ''Einstein's Dream'' for orchestra by [[Cindy McTee]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a favorite model for depictions of [[mad scientist]]s and [[absent-minded professor]]s; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was &quot;a cartoonist's dream come true&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;slqbwn&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last =Golden |first =Frederic |title =Person of the Century: Albert Einstein|magazine =Time |date =3 January 2000 |url =http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/albert_einstein5a.html |accessdate =25 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[political history]] of modern Afghanistan begins in the 18th century with the rise of the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], when the [[Hotaki dynasty]] rose to power at [[Kandahar]] in 1709 followed by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]]'s conquest in 1747.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last-Afghan-empire&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/21392/Last-Afghan-empire |title=Last Afghan empire |accessdate=2010-08-22 |work=[[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Dupree]], [[Nancy Hatch Dupree]] and others |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=D.

Since the late 1970s, Afghanistan has experienced a continuous state of [[Afghan civil war|war]], including major occupations in the forms of the 1979 [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]], a [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|Pakistani military intervention in support of the Taliban]] in the late 1990s and the [[Operation Enduring Freedom|October 2001 US-led invasion]] that overthrew the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Afghanistan}}
The name ''Afghānistān'', [[Persian language|Persian]]: افغانستان {{IPA-fa|avɣɒnestɒn|}},&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, William and Jaromira Rakušan. Source Book for Linguistics. 3rd ed. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; means the ''&quot;[[-stan|Land of Afghans]]&quot;'', originating from the word ''[[Afghan (name)|Afghan]]''.

===Origin of the name===
{{Main|Afghan (name)}}
The first part of the [[Afghan (name)|name ''&quot;Afghan&quot;'']] designates the [[Pashtun people]] since ancient times, the founders and the largest [[Ethnic groups in Afghanistan|ethnic group of the country]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghan&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ch. M. Kieffer |url=http://www.iranica.com/articles/afgan-in-current-political-usage-any-citizen-of-afghanistan-whatever-his-ethnic-tribal-or-religious-affiliation |title=Afghan |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |edition=Encyclopædia Iranica Online |publisher=Columbia University |date=December 15, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name is mentioned in the form of ''&quot;Abgan&quot;'' in the 3rd century CE&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica-Abgan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/129450/History?anchor=ref261360|title=History of Afghanistan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as ''&quot;Avagana&quot;'' in the 6th century CE.

The [[Encyclopædia Iranica]] states:{{quote|''From a more limited, ethnological point of view, &quot;Af&lt;u&gt;gh&lt;/u&gt;ān&quot; is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Paštō-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Paštūn. The equation [of] Afghan [and] Paštūn has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Paštūn tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically. The term &quot;Af&lt;u&gt;gh&lt;/u&gt;ān&quot; has probably designated the Paštūn since ancient times. Under the form Avagānā, this ethnic group is first mentioned by the Indian astronomer [[Varahamihira|Varāha Mihira]] in the beginning of the 6th century CE in his [[Bṛhat Saṃhitā|Brihat-samhita]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghan&quot;/&gt;}}

A people called ''&quot;Afghans&quot;'' are mentioned several times in a 10th century [[travel book|geography book]], [[Hudud al-'alam]]. [[Al-Biruni]] referred to them in the 11th century as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the [[Indus River]], which would be the [[Sulaiman Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EofI&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morgenstierne|first=G.|title=AF&lt;u&gt;GH&lt;/u&gt;ĀN|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|edition=CD-ROM Edition v. 1.0|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]], a famous [[Morocco|Moroccan]] travelling scholar visiting the region in 1333, writes:
{{quote|''We travelled on to [[Kabul]], formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called ''Afghans''.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;/&gt;}}

[[Firishta|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah]] (Ferishta) explains extensively about Afghans in the 16th century. For example, he writes:
{{quote|''The men of Kábul and [[Khilji dynasty|Khilj]] also went home; and whenever they were ques­tioned about the Musulmáns of the Kohistán (the mountains), and how matters stood there, they said, &quot;Don't call it Kohistán, but Afghánistán; for there is nothing there but Afgháns and dis­turbances.&quot; Thus it is clear that for this reason the people of the country call their home in [[Pashto language|their own language]] Afghánistán, and themselves Afgháns.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Firishta&quot;/&gt;}}
[[File:Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.jpg|130px|thumb|Afghan soldiers of the [[Durrani Empire]]. The [[name of Afghanistan|name ''&quot;Afghaunistan&quot;'']] is printed on this 1847 [[lithography|Lithograph]] by James Rattray.]]

By the 17th century AD, it seems that some Pashtuns themselves were using the term as an ethnonym - a fact that is supported by traditional [[Pashto literature]], for example, in the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]:{{quote|''Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashtun and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtuns, Pashtuns are Afghans!''&lt;ref&gt;''extract from &quot;Passion of the Afghan&quot;'' by [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]; translated by C.

The last part of the name, ''[[-stan|-stān]]'' is a Persian suffix for &quot;place&quot;, prominent in many languages of the region.

Ali, ''&quot;Afghanistan: The War of Independence, 1919&quot;'', Kabul [s.n.], 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; and was confirmed as such in the nation's 1923 [[Constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghan-web.com/history/const/const1923.html Afghanistan's Constitution of 1923] under ''[[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]]'' (English translation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan's highest point is [[Nowshak]], at 7,485&amp;nbsp;m (24,557&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. The [[Climate of Afghanistan|climate]] varies by region and tends to change quite rapidly. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. The [[endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Sistan Basin]] is one of the driest regions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/sistan.pdf|format=PDF|title=History of Environmental Change in the Sistan Basin 1976–2005|accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation has a continental climate with very harsh winters in the [[Hazarajat|central highlands]], the glaciated northeast (around [[Nuristan]]) and the [[Wakhan Corridor]], where the average temperature in January is below {{convert|−15|°C}}, and hot summers in the low-lying areas of Sistan Basin of the southwest, the [[Jalalabad]] basin of the east, and the [[Afghan Turkestan|Turkistan]] plains along the [[Amu River]] of the north, where temperatures average over {{convert|35|°C}} in July. The country is frequently subject to minor [[earthquake]]s, mainly in the northeast of [[Hindu Kush]] mountain areas. Some 125 villages were damaged and 4,000 people killed by the May 31, 1998, earthquake.

At {{convert|249984|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}}, Afghanistan is the world's 41st largest country (after [[Burma]]). It shares borders with Pakistan in the East, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north, and China in the far east. The country does not face any water shortage because it receives huge amounts of snow during winter. Once that melts, the water runs into rivers, lakes, and streams, but most of its national water flows to neighboring states. The state needs around $2 billion to rehabilitate its irrigation systems so that the water is properly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2010/0615/Afghanistan-s-woeful-water-management-delights-neighbors |title=Afghanistan's woeful water management delights neighbors |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation's natural resources include [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[iron ore]] in the Southeast; precious and [[semi-precious stones]] (such as [[lapis]], [[emerald]], and [[azure]]) in the Northeast; and potentially significant [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves in the North.

The region has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them [[Ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. In certain stages, the land was conquered and incorporated within large empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]]; the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]]; the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]]; the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Muslim Arab Empire]]; the [[Sassanids|Sassanid Empire]], and a number of others. Many kingdoms have also risen to power in what is now Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] and [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]] dynasties that marked the political beginning of the modern state of Afghanistan.

[[Babur]], a descendant of both Timur and [[Genghis Khan]], arrived from [[Central Asia]] and captured Kabul from the [[Arghun Dynasty]], and from there he began to seize control of the eastern [[Afghan]] territories. He remained in [[Kabulistan|Kabul]] until 1526 when he and his army invaded [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] in India to replace the Afghan [[Lodi dynasty]] with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. From the 16th century to the early 18th century, the region of Afghanistan was contended by 3 major powers: The [[Khanate of Bukhara]] ruled the north, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] the west and the remaining larger area was ruled by [[Delhi Sultanate]] of India.

[[Mirwais Hotak]], an influential Afghan tribal leader of the [[Ghilzai]] tribe, gathered supporters and successfully rebelled against the Persian Safavids in the early 18th century. He overthrew and killed [[George XI of Kartli|Gurgin Khan]], the [[Georgians|Georgian]] governor of Kandahar, and made the Afghan region independent from Persian rule. By 1713, Mirwais had decisively defeated two larger Persian-Georgian armies, one was led by [[Kaikhosro of Kartli|Khusraw Khán]] (nephew of Gurgin) and the other by Rustam Khán. The armies were sent by [[Soltan Hosein]], the Shah in [[Isfahan]] (now Iran), to re-take control of the Kandahar region. Mirwais died of a natural cause in 1715 and his brother [[Abdul Aziz Hotak|Abdul Aziz]] took over until he was killed by his nephew [[Mahmud Hotaki|Mahmud]]. In 1722, Mahmud led an Afghan army to the Persian capital of Isfahan, sacked the city after the [[Battle of Gulnabad]] and proclaimed himself [[Safavid dynasty|King of Persia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Browne&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D90001014%26ct%3D29|title=A Literary History of Persia, Volume 4: Modern Times (1500–1924), Chapter IV.

In 1738, [[Nader Shah]] and his [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid forces]] captured Kandahar from Shah [[Hussain Hotaki]], at which point the incarcerated 16 year old [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]] was freed and made the commander of Nader Shah's four thousand [[Durrani|Abdali]] Pashtuns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durrani-dynasty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/21396/The-Durrani-dynasty?anchor=ref306642|title=The Durrani dynasty |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=2010-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Kandahar they set out to conquer India, passing through Ghazni, Kabul, [[Lahore]] and ultimately plundering [[Delhi]] after the [[Battle of Karnal]].

In October 1772, Ahmad Shah died of a natural cause and was buried at a site now adjacent to the [[Mosque of the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Timur Shah Durrani]], who transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul. After his death in 1793, the Durrani kingdom was passed down to his son [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]] followed by [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]], [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shuja Shah]] and others.

After Afghan [[Vizier]] [[Fateh Khan]] was defeated by the Sikhs at the [[Battle of Attock]], he fought off an attempt by [[Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar|Ali Shah]], the ruler of Persia, to capture the Afghan province of Herat. He was joined by his brother, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]], and rogue Sikh [[Sardar]] Jai Singh Attarwalia. Once they had captured the city, Fateh Khan attempted to remove the ruler [[Mahmud Shah Durrani]] – a relation of his superior – and rule in his stead. In the attempt to take the city from its Afghan ruler, Dost Mohammad Khan's men forcibly took jewels from a princess and [[Shahzada Kamran Durrani|Kamran Durrani]], Mahmud Shah's son, used this as a pretext to remove Fateh Khan from power, and had him tortured and executed. While in power, however, Fateh Khan had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the Afghan Empire. After his death, they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves. During this turbulent period, Kabul had many temporary rulers until Fateh Khan's brother, Dost Mohammad Khan, captured Kabul in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Afghanistan: A Military History from Alexander the Great to the War against the Taliban |last=Tanner |first=Stephen |year=2009 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0306818264 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J3pUS_-uD-oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barakzai dynasty and European influence====
{{See|European influence in Afghanistan|Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war}}
[[File:Remnants of an army2.jpg|thumb|left|[[First Anglo-Afghan War]] (1839–42). [[William Brydon]] was the sole survivor of a group of 3,600 soldiers of the [[British Raj|British]] [[44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot|44th Regiment of Foot]] and 12,400 [[camp follower]]s, who were attacked between [[Kabul]] and [[Jalalabad]] while heading to what is now [[Pakistan]].]]

[[File:Zaher Shah Kennedy.jpg|thumb|King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] and wife with US President [[John F. Kennedy]] and sister [[Eunice Shriver|Eunice]] in the [[United States]]]]
During the 19th century, following the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] and the ascension of the [[Barakzai dynasty]], Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to [[British India]]. Ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the 1893 [[Durand Line]], an action which would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India (later the new state of Pakistan). The United Kingdom exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until the reign of King [[Amanullah Khan]] in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained independence over its foreign affairs after the signing of the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]].

King Amanullah moved to end his country's traditional isolation in the years following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]. He established [[Foreign relations of Afghanistan|diplomatic relations with major states]] and, following a 1927-28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's first constitution (declared through a [[Loya Jirga]]), which made elementary education compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Education in Afghanistan&quot;, published in ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', volume VIII – pp. 237–241...[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EPS/people/Shorish-Education_in_Afghanistan.htm UIUC.edu]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[Muslim]] [[veil]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Habibullah Kalakani in October 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a Kabul student.

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. In 1953, he was replaced by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]], nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports and other vital infrastructure. By the late 1960s, many Western travelers were using these as part of the [[hippie trail]]. In 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law, Daoud Khan, launched a bloodless coup and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]] while Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit. Daoud Khan tried to implement some much needed reforms especially in the economic sector.

====Saur revolution and Soviet war====
{{Main|Saur Revolution|Soviet war in Afghanistan}}
[[Image:Day after Saur revolution in Kabul (773).jpg|thumb|Outside the Palace Gate (Arg) in [[Kabul]], the day after [[Saur Revolution]] on April 28, 1978.]]
In 1978, a prominent member of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA), [[Mir Akbar Khyber]], was allegedly killed by the Daoud government. Leaders of the PDPA feared that Daoud was planning to dismantle them because many were being arrested. [[Hafizullah Amin]] along with other PDPA members managed to remain at large and organised an uprising. The PDPA, led by [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]], [[Babrak Karmal]] and Hafizullah Amin, overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was [[Assassination|assassinated]] along with his family during the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]]. Taraki was declared President, [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and [[General Secretary]] of the PDPA. Once in power, the PDPA implemented a socialist agenda. It moved to carry out an ill-conceived [[land reform]], which was misunderstood by virtually all Afghans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofnations.net/asia/afghanistan.html |title=History of Afghanistan |publisher=Historyofnations.net |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also imprisoned, tortured or murdered thousands of members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment, and the intelligentsia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They also prohibited [[usury]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0028) |title=Afghanistan |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a number of statements on [[women's rights]], by declaring equality of the sexes&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; and introducing women to political life. [[Anahita Ratebzad]] was one of several female Marxist leaders and a member of the Revolutionary Council.

As part of its [[Cold War]] strategy, the [[White House]] in the [[United States]] began recruiting, financing and arming [[Mujahideen]] fighters during [[Operation Cyclone]] in 1979, which was aimed to defeat the Soviets. President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s National Security Advisor, [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], warned at the time that this might prompt a Soviet intervention. In March 1979, Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister, retaining the position of [[field marshal]] and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the army until September 14 when he was killed.

To bolster the [[Parcham]] faction, the Soviet Union decided to intervene on December 24, 1979, when the [[Red Army]] invaded its southern neighbor. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion, which was backed by another one hundred thousand [[Military of Afghanistan|Afghan military]] men and supporters of the Parcham faction. In the meantime, Hafizullah Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal. In response to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] in the U.S. increased arming and funding of the Mujahideen who began a guerilla war thanks in large part to the efforts of [[Charles Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Gust Avrakotos]].

The U.S. handled most of its support through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]. [[Saudi Arabia]] was also providing financial support. Leaders such as [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] received only minor aid compared to Hekmatyar and some of the other parties, although Massoud was named the &quot;Afghan who won the cold war&quot; by the Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2001 |url =http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2911290068493351924# |title = Charlie Rose, March 2001, citing Wall Street Journal around 40:00 ff.| publisher = [[Charlie Rose]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.&lt;/ref&gt; and many more to the [[European Union]]. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989. Their withdrawal from Afghanistan was seen as an ideological victory in America, which had backed some Mujahideen factions through three U.S. presidential administrations to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]]. The [[USSR]] continued to support President [[Mohammad Najibullah]] (former head of the Afghan secret service, ''[[KHAD]]'') until 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia:Afghanistan:History&quot;&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0856490.html Afghanistan: History], ''Columbia Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989-1992)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992-1996)}}
After the fall of the [[communist]] [[Najibullah]]-regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The Peshawar Accords created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an [[interim government]] for a transitional period. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:
{{blockquote|The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the [[Soviet]]-backed Najibullah government.

Southern Afghanistan was under the control of neither foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. In 1994, the [[Taliban]] (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the [[tyranny]] of the local governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994–1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp.25–6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mullah Omar]] started his movement with fewer than 50 armed [[madrassah]] students in his hometown of Kandahar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;/&gt; When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (5)&quot;/&gt; In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.

[[File:Afghan parliament in 2006.jpg|thumb|[[National Assembly of Afghanistan]] in 2006]]
The [[Politics of Afghanistan|government of Afghanistan]] is an [[Islamic republic]] consisting of three branches, [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary|judicial]]. The nation is currently led by the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] with [[Hamid Karzai]] as the President and [[Afghan Transitional Administration|leader]] since late 2001. The [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|National Assembly]] is the legislature, a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] body comprising of two chambers, the [[House of the People (Afghanistan)|House of the People]] and the [[House of Elders]]. The [[Afghan Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] is led by [[Chief Justice of Afghanistan|Chief Justice]] [[Abdul Salam Azimi]], a former university professor who had been a legal advisor to the president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/E78CB0C74F5E7142872571C90048D8BD?OpenDocument E-Ariana.com], New Supreme Court Could Mark Genuine Departure – 2006-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]] than the previous one, which was dominated by fundamentalist religious figures such as Chief Justice [[Faisal Ahmad Shinwari]] who issued several controversial rulings, including seeking to place a limit on the [[Women's rights in Afghanistan|rights of women]].

According to [[Transparency International]]'s corruption perceptions index 2010 results, Afghanistan was ranked as the third most-corrupt country in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;TI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2010 Results |publisher=[[Transparency International]] |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|government ministries]] are believed to be rife with corruption, while President Karzai vowed to tackle the problem in late 2009 by stating that &quot;individuals who are involved in corruption will have no place in the government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.maktoob.com/20090000393686/Karzai_vows_to_tackle_corruption/Article.htm |title=Karzai vows to tackle corruption |publisher=Business.maktoob.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A January 2010 report published by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] revealed that bribery consumes an amount equal to 23 percent of the GDP of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2010/January/corruption-widespread-in-afghanistan-unodc-survey-says.html |title=UNODC.org |publisher=UNODC.org |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections and parties===
{{Main|Elections in Afghanistan|List of political parties in Afghanistan}}
The [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 Afghan presidential election]] was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout and widespread electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghan commission orders first ballots invalidated&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald |first=Charlotte |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3xqZSi2U_mgENDm3TK0-yqI7I_g |title=Afghan commission orders first ballots invalidated |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped]&lt;/ref&gt; The vote, along with elections for 420 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provincial council]] seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mixed Turnout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/08/mil-090820-rferl02.htm |title=Mixed Turnout, Violence Seen On Afghan Election Day, As Vote Count Begins |last=Siddique |first=Abubakar |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=24 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger [[Abdullah Abdullah|Abdullah]] was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he is not participating in the November 7 run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met. The next day, officials of the election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President for another 5-year term.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], among the elected officials were former mujahideen, [[Islamic fundamentalists]], warlords, communists, [[reformists]], and several Taliban associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/rawagallery.php?mghash=dc96d38caecd6694eb17fc894bb73212&amp;mggal=2 |title=RAWA Photo Gallery: They are Responsible for Afghanistan's Tragedy |publisher=RAWA |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, Afghanistan reached to the 30th nation in terms of female representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification |publisher=Ipu.org |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary election]] was held in September 2010, but due to disputes and investigation of fraud, the sworn in ceremony took place in late January 2011.

==Political divisions==
{{Main|Provinces of Afghanistan|Districts of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is administratively divided into [[Provinces of Afghanistan|34 provinces]] (''[[Wilayah|wilayats]]''), with each [[province]] having a [[capital (politics)|capital]] and a [[List of current governors of Afghanistan|governor]] in office. The provinces are further divided into about [[Districts of Afghanistan|398 smaller provincial districts]], each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each provincial district is represented by a sub-governor, usually called a district governor.

The [[List of current governors of Afghanistan|provincial governors]] as well as the district governors are voted into office during the nation's presidential election, which takes place every five years. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. The provincial [[Chief of Police]] is appointed by the [[Ministry of Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Interior]] in Kabul and works together with the provincial governor on [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] for all the districts within the province.

There is an exception in the capital city of Kabul where the [[Mayor]] is selected directly by the President, and is completely independent from the [[List of governors of Kabul|Governor of Kabul]].

The following is a list of all the 34 [[provinces of Afghanistan]] in [[alphabetical order]] and on the right is a map showing where each province is located:

The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] is responsible for managing the [[foreign relations of Afghanistan]]. The nation has maintained good [[Afghanistan – United States relations|relations with the United States]] and other members of [[NATO]] since at least the 1920s. Afghanistan joined the [[United Nations]] on November 19, 1946, and has been a member since. In 2002, the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] was established to help rebuild the country.

Afghanistan is an impoverished and [[least developed country]], one of the world's poorest. In 2010, the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] [[exchange rate]] stood at $16.63 billion and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] was $1,000.&lt;ref name=CIA-GDP-PPP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2004.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af |title=GDP - per capita (PPP): $1,000 (2010 est.)|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its unemployment rate is 35%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2129.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af |title=35% (2008 est.)|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and roughly 36% of its citizens live below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2046.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af |title=36% (FY08/09) |work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 42 percent of the population live on less than $1 a day, according to USAID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83417|title=Afghanistan: Food still unaffordable for millions|work=|publisher=[[IRIN]]|date=March 12, 2009|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the infusion of multi-billion dollars in international assistance and investments, as well as remittances from expats, the economy has steadily improved, growing at approximately 12 percent per year during the past six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov//en/Page.CountryOverview.aspx |title=USAID/Afghanistan Strategy |work=|publisher=USAID|accessdate=2010-10-20}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also due to improvements in [[Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation &amp; Livestock (Afghanistan)|agricultural production]], which is the backbone of the nation's economy since over 75% of its citizens are involved in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/Program.19c.aspx |title=Objective: Accelerating market-led growth in agriculture|work=|publisher=USAID|accessdate=2010-10-20}}{{dead link|url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/Program.19c.aspx|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Afghan pomegranate processing.jpg|thumb|Workers processing [[pomegranate production in Afghanistan|pomegranate]]s (''anaar''), which Afghanistan is famous for in Asia.]]

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million [[Afghan diaspora|Afghan expatriates]], who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. The [[Afghan rug]]s have become a popular product again and this gives the large number of rug weavers in the country a chance to earn more income. While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and [[non-governmental organization]]s.

The [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Finance]] is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. Since 2003, over 16 new banks have opened in the country, including [[Afghanistan International Bank]], [[Kabul Bank]], [[Azizi Bank]], [[Pashtany Bank]], [[Standard Chartered Bank]], [[First Micro Finance Bank]], and others. [[Da Afghanistan Bank]] serves as the [[central bank]] of the nation and the [[Afghan afghani|&quot;Afghani&quot;]] (AFN) is the [[national currency]], with an exchange rate of 50 Afghanis to 1 US dollar.

Afghanistan is a member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], [[Economic Cooperation Organization|ECO]] and the [[Economy of the OIC|OIC]]. It is known for producing some of the finest [[pomegranate]]s, [[grapes]], [[apricot]]s, [[melon]]s, and several other fresh and [[Dried fruit|dry fruits]], including [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49291 Exporting Afghanistan], by P.J.

===Energy and mining===
{{Main|Mining in Afghanistan}}
According to recent U.S. Geological surveys that were funded by the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry]], Afghanistan may be possessing up to {{convert|36|Tcuft|km3}} of [[natural gas]], {{convert|3.6|Goilbbl|m3}} of [[petroleum]] and up to {{convert|1325|Moilbbl|m3}} of [[natural gas liquids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet&quot;&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav090306.shtml ''Afghanistan’s Energy Future and its Potential Implications''], Eurasianet.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent reports show that the country has huge amounts of gold, copper, coal, [[iron ore]] and other [[minerals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA-natural-resources&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2111.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af |title=Natural resources: Afghanistan |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mom.gov.af/uploads/files/English/USGS%20Report/8.0-chemical-sedimentry-FINAL.pdf |title=8.0 Chemical-sedimentary deposits |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-11-14}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/AfghanMinerals/docs/Gold_A4.pdf#search='gold%20and%20copper%20discovered%20in%20afghanistan' |title=Minerals in Afghanistan |publisher=[[British Geological Survey]] |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uranium&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wise-uranium.org/uissr05.html#OPER |title=Uranium Mining Issues: 2005 Review |publisher=Wise Uranium Project |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] officials along with geologists from the United States announced the discovery of $1–3 trillion worth untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt; Afghan officials assert that &quot;this will become the backbone of the Afghan economy&quot; and a memo from the Pentagon stated that Afghanistan could become the &quot;Saudi Arabia of [[lithium]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/afghanistan-minerals-lithium.html |title=Afghanistan: The Saudi Arabia of Lithium? |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-06-14 |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=204154 |title=Afghanistan is suddenly wealthy: US finds $1 trillion in mineral deposits |publisher=Ksdk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/afghanistans-resources-could-make-it-the-richest-mining-region-on-earth-2000507.html |title=Afghanistan's resources could make it the richest mining region on earth |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date= 2010-06-15|accessdate=2010-11-14 |location=London |first=Kim |last=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article7149696.ece|location=London|work=The Times|title=Taleban zones mineral riches may rival Saudi Arabia says Pentagon|first1=Jeremy|last1=Page|first2=Michael|last2=Evans|date=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is preparing deals to extract its copper and iron reserves, which could earn billions of dollars in [[royalties]] and taxes every year for the next 100 years.

===Transport and communications===
{{Main|Transport in Afghanistan|Communications in Afghanistan}}
[[File:Ariana Afghan A310-300 F-GEMO.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ariana Afghan Airlines]]]]
[[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] is the national carrier, with domestic flights between Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif. International flights include to [[Dubai]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Istanbul]] and a number of other Asian destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyariana.com/schedules.php# |title=Ariana |publisher=Flyariana.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also limited domestic and international flight services available from the locally owned [[Kam Air]], [[Pamir Airways]] and [[Safi Airways]].

The country has limited [[Rail transport in Afghanistan|rail service]] with Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the north. There are two other railway projects currently in progress with neighboring nations, one is between Herat and Iran while another is to connect with [[Pakistan Railways]]. Citizens who travel far distances use bus services. Newer automobiles have recently become more widely available after the rebuilding of roads and highways. Vehicles are imported from the [[United Arab Emirates]] through Pakistan and Iran. [[Postage stamps and postal history of Afghanistan|Postal]] and package delivery services such as [[FedEx]], [[DHL]] and others are found in major cities and towns.

Telecommunication services in the country are provided by [[Afghan Wireless]], [[Etisalat]], [[Roshan (telco)|Roshan]], [[MTN Group]] and [[Afghan Telecom]]. In 2006, the [[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Communications]] signed a $64.5 million agreement with [[ZTE]] for the establishment of a countrywide [[optical fiber cable]] network. As of 2009, the country has 129,300 [[landline|fixed telephone lines]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2150.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af CIA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; about 12 million [[mobile phone]] subscribers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2151.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af CIA.Gov]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1 million [[internet]] users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2153.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af CIA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
{{Main|Media of Afghanistan}}
The [[Media of Afghanistan|Afghan media]] began in the early 20th century, with the first newspaper being published in 1906. By the 1920s, [[Radio Kabul]] was broadcasting local radio services. [[Afghanistan National Television]] was launched in 1974 but was closed in 1996 when the media was tightly controlled by the Taliban.&lt;ref name=dart&gt;Dartnell, M. Y. ''Insurgency Online: Web Activism and Global Conflict.'' University of Toronto Press, 2006. ISBN 978-0-8020-8553-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, press restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified. [[Freedom of expression]] and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and [[censorship]] is banned, though [[defamation|defaming]] individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of Islam is prohibited. In 2008, [[Reporters Without Borders]] listed the media environment as 156 out of 173, with 1st being most free. 400 publications are now registered, at least 15 local [[List of television channels in Afghanistan|Afghan television channels]] and 60 radio stations.&lt;ref name=fh&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&amp;year=2008 Afghanistan Press Report 2008], ''Freedom House''.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign radio stations, such as [[Voice of America]] and [[BBC World Service]], also broadcast into the country.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demography of Afghanistan|Afghan refugees}}
As of July 2010, the population of Afghanistan is around 28,395,716,&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA-pop&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2119.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af|title=Population of Afghanistan |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |year=2010|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is unknown if the 3 million [[Afghan refugees]] living in [[Afghans in Pakistan|Pakistan]] and [[Afghans in Iran|Iran]] are included or not. A 2009 UN estimate shows that the Afghan population was 28,150,000&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1 |version=2008 revision|format=PDF|publisher=United Nations |work=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2009–2010 nationwide [[statistical survey]] conducted by the [[Central Statistics Office (Afghanistan)|Central Statistics Office]] (CSO) of Afghanistan has put it at 26 million but not counting some parts of the country due to insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&amp;id=99681 |title=CSO census puts population at 26 million |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |work=Rahmatullah Afghan |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=August 4, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A partial [[census]] conducted in 1979 showed roughly 15.5 million people living in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;IIOT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/Afghanistan-Chapter2.pdf |title=Chapter 2.

According to the [[Population Reference Bureau]], the Afghan population is estimated to increase to 82 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Countries/Afghanistan.aspx |title=Afghanistan – Population Reference Bureau |publisher=[[Population Reference Bureau]] |date= |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only city in Afghanistan with over two million residents is its capital, Kabul. The other major cities in the country are, in order of population size, [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Mazar-e Sharif]], [[Jalalabad]], [[Ghazni]], [[Kunduz]], [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah]]. Urban areas are experiencing rapid population growth following the return of over 5 million Afghan expats from Pakistan and Iran.

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Afghanistan}}
[[File:US Army ethnolinguistic map of Afghanistan -- circa 2001-09.jpg|thumb|[[Ethnolinguistics|Ethnolinguistic]] groups of Afghanistan]]
Afghanistan is a [[multiethnic society]]. The population of the country is divided into a wide variety of [[ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the nation in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various [[ethnic group]]s are unvailable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3717092.stm Afghan poll's ethnic battleground]  2004-10-06. BBC&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] states:{{quote|''No national census has been conducted in Afghanistan since a partial count in 1979, and years of war and population dislocation have made an accurate ethnic count impossible. Current population estimates are therefore rough approximations, which show that Pashtuns comprise somewhat less than two-fifths of the population. The two largest Pashtun tribal groups are the Durrani and Ghilzay. Tajiks are likely to account for some one-fourth of Afghans and Hazara nearly one-fifth. Uzbeks and Chahar Aimaks each account for slightly more than 5 percent of the population and Turkmen an even smaller portion.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |title=(Ethnic groups) |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The percentage numbers in the chart at the bottom are from recent national [[opinion poll]]s aimed at knowing how Afghan citizens feel about the 2001–present US-led war, the current political situation, as well as the economic and social issues affecting their daily lives. One was conducted in 2010 by the [[The Asia Foundation|Asia Foundation]] (with technical assistance by the ''Afghan Center for Socio-economic and Opinion Research'') and the other between 2004 to 2009 by a combined effort of the broadcasting companies ABC News, [[BBC]], and [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;survey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/Afghanistanin2010survey.pdf|format=PDF|title=Afghanistan in 2010: A Survey of the Afghan People |page=221|quote=''D-9.* Which ethnic group do you belong to?

The 2010 Asia Foundation [[sampling (statistics)|survey]] involved 6,467 randomly selected Afghan citizens from across all of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.

===Culture===
{{Main|Culture of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Tribal and religious leaders in southern Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|upright|Men wearing their traditional [[Pashtun dress|Afghan dress]] in [[Kandahar]].]]
The [[Culture of Afghanistan|Afghan culture]] has been around for over two [[millennium]]s, tracing record to at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire in 500 BCE.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Barbara Robson, Juliene Lipson, Farid Younos, Mariam Mehdi. {{cite web |url=http://www.cal.org/co/afghan/ahist.html |title=The Afghans - Their History and Culture |publisher=[[Center for Applied Linguistics]]|location=United States|date=June 30, 2002|accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |work=|publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |date = August 2008|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly a [[nomad]]ic and [[tribal society]], with different regions of the country having their own tradition, reflecting the multi-cultural and multi-lingual character of the nation. In the southern and eastern region, as well as western Pakistan which was historically part of Afghanistan, the people live according to the [[Pashtun culture]] by following [[Pashtunwali]], which is an [[ancient]] [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] that is still preserved.&lt;ref&gt;US Library of Congress: Afghanistan - [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037) Ethnic Groups (''Pashtun'')]&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining of the country is culturally [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkic]]. Some non-Pashtuns who live in close proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali&lt;ref name=&quot;Banting&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan: The land |last1=Banting|first1=Erinn |authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2003|publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |location=|isbn=0778793354|page=4|page=32|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KRt0HfYFZGsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=place%20of%20Afghans&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a process called [[Pashtunization]] (or ''Afghanization'') while some Pashtuns have been [[Persianization|Persianized]].

Afghans display pride in their culture, nation, ancestry, and above all, their religion and independence. Like other highlanders, they are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote&quot;&gt;Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) &quot;The Afghan Wars 1839–1919&quot;, Sellmount Staplehurst.&lt;/ref&gt; As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. Tony Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote&quot; /&gt; There are an estimated 60 major [[Pashtun tribes]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445546/Pashtun Pashtun (people)]&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Afghan [[nomad]]s are estimated at about 2-3 million.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76794 Afghanistan: Kuchi nomads seek a better deal]&quot;.

The nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars.&lt;ref&gt;G.V. Brandolini. ''Afghanistan [[cultural heritage]]''. Orizzonte terra, [[Bergamo]]. 2007. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The two famous [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as [[idolatry|idolatrous]]. Other famous sites include the cities of [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], Ghazni and Balkh. The [[Minaret of Jam]], in the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] valley, is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]]. A cloak reputedly worn by Islam's Prophet [[Muhammad]] is stored inside the famous [[Mosque of the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed]] in Kandahar City.

Although literacy level is low, classic [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Pashto literature and poetry|Pashto poetry]] play an important role in the Afghan culture. [[Poetry of Afghanistan|Poetry]] has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include [[Rumi]], [[Rabi'a Balkhi]], [[Sanai]], [[Jami]], [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Khalilullah Khalili]], and [[Parwin Pazhwak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/cpoets.html Classical Dari and Pashto Poets]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Soviet war in the 1980s, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern [[Music of Afghanistan|Afghan music]], especially during the [[Nowruz]] (New Year) and [[Afghan Independence Day|National Independence Day]] celebrations. Most Afghans are accustomed to watching [[Bollywood]] films and listening to its [[filmi]] hit songs.

Majority of the Afghans enjoy [[associated football|football]] (soccer) while [[cricket]] is the second popular [[sport in Afghanistan]]. [[Buzkashi]] is a traditional sport, mainly among the northern Afghans. It is similar to [[polo]] and played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a [[goat]] carcass. [[Afghan hound]]s (a type of running dog) also originated in Afghanistan.

===Health and education===
{{Main|Health in Afghanistan|Education in Afghanistan}}
[[File:Regional Medical Hospital in Paktia.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside a regional medical hospital in the [[Paktia Province]]]]
According to the [[Human Development Index]], Afghanistan is the second least developed country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |title=UNDP.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every half hour, an average of one woman dies from [[pregnancy]]-related complications, another dies of [[tuberculosis]] and 14 children die, largely from preventable causes. Before the start of the wars in 1978, the nation had an improving health system and a semi-modernized [[health care system]] in cities like Kabul. Ibn Sina Hospital and Ali Abad Hospital in Kabul were two of the leading [[health care]] institutions in Central Asia at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=Tan Ee Lyn |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSISL1059520080506 |title=Afghan medical college struggles to rise from the ashes |publisher=Reuters |date= 2008-05-06|accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Soviet invasion and the civil war that followed, the health care system was limited only to urban areas and was eventually destroyed. The Taliban government made some improvements in the late 1990s, but health care was not available for women during their six year rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot; /&gt; Afghanistan has one of the highest incidences of people with [[disability|disabilities]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=26520 Afghanistan: People living with disabilities call for integration]&quot;.

[[IRIN]] Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation's health care system began to improve dramatically since 2002, which is due to international support on the [[vaccination]] of children, training of medical staff. According to USAID, [[infant mortality]] rate has dropped by 33 percent and approximately 64 percent of the total population now has access to some form of [[health care]]. Most Afghans live within one hour travel to a health facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAID-Afghanistan-Strategy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov//en/Page.CountryOverview.aspx |title=USAID/Afghanistan Strategy |work=|publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID)|accessdate=2010-10-20}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hospitals and clinics have been built in the country over the last decade, with the most advanced treatments being available in Kabul. The [[French Medical Institute for Children]] and [[Indira Gandhi Childrens Hospital]] in Kabul are the leading [[children's hospital]]s in Afghanistan. The [[Jinnah Hospital]] in Kabul is also under construction at the moment, which is funded by the [[Government of Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanembassyjp.com/en/news/?an=64 |title=Jinnah Hospital to be constructed in Kabul |work=Paktribune|publisher=Embassy of Afghanistan, Tokyo|date=March 7, 2007|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of well-equipped regional hospitals across the country that were built by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] and are run by the [[Afghan National Army]].

[[File:Kabul Medical University in 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kabul Medical University]]]]

One of the oldest schools in the country is the [[Habibia High School]] in Kabul. It was established by King [[Habibullah Khan]] in 1903 and helped educate students from the nation's elite class. In the 1920s, the German-funded [[Amani High School]] opened in Kabul, and about a decade later two French [[lycée]]s (secondary schools) began, the [[Agence pour l'enseignement français à l'étranger|AEFE]] and the [[Lycée Esteqlal]]. During the same period the [[Kabul University]] opened its doors for classes. Education was improving in the country by the late 1950s, during the rule of King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]]. However, after the [[Saur Revolution]] in 1978 until recent years, the education system of Afghanistan fell apart due to the wars. It was revived in the early months of 2002 after the US removed the Taliban and the [[Karzai administration]] came to power.

As of 2009 more than five million male and female students were enrolled in schools throughout the country. However, there are still significant obstacles to education in Afghanistan, stemming from lack of funding, unsafe school buildings and cultural norms. Furthermore, there is a great lack of qualified teachers, especially in rural areas. A lack of women teachers is another issue that concerns some Afghan parents, especially in more conservative areas. Some parents will not allow their daughters to be taught by men.&lt;ref name=&quot;asmp&quot;&gt;Mojumdar, Aunohita: &quot;Afghan Schools' Money Problems&quot;, BBC News, 2007. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6533379.stm News.BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNICEF]] estimates that more than 80 percent of females and around 50 percent of males lack access to education centers. According to the [[United Nations]], 700 schools have been closed in the country because of poor security.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-tc-nw-afghan-schools-0107jan08,0,457737.story |title=ChicagoTirbune.com |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy of the entire population is estimated at 34%. Female literacy is 10%.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune.com&quot;/&gt; The [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Afghan ministry of education]], assisted by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID), is in the process of expanding education in the country by building more new schools and providing modern technologies.

Following the start of the U.S. mission in late 2001, [[Kabul University]] was reopened to both male and female students. In 2006, the [[American University of Afghanistan]] also opened its doors, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. The university accepts students from Afghanistan and the neighboring countries. Many other universities were inaugurated across the country in recent years, such as [[Kandahar University]] in the south, [[Herat University]] in the northwest, [[Balkh University]] in the north, [[Nangarhar University]] and [[Khost University]] in the eastern zones, and others. The [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]] has been set up to train and educate Afghan soldiers.

===Law enforcement===
{{Main|Afghan National Police}}
[[File:Afghan police commander marching.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) [[honor guard]]s]]
Afghanistan currently has more than 90,000 [[Afghan National Police|national police]] officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 160,000. The [[Afghan National Police]] and [[Afghan Border Police]] are under the [[Ministry of Interior (Afghanistan)|Afghan Interior Ministry]], which is today headed by [[Bismillah Khan Mohammadi]]. Although they are being trained by [[NATO]] countries and through the [[Afghanistan Police Program]], there are still many problems with the force. A large percent of Afghan police officers are illiterate and are widely accused of demanding bribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121559123&amp;ps=cprs For U.S., Vast Challenge To Expand Afghan Forces : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 17 percent of them test positive for illegal drugs. In some areas of the country, crimes have gone uninvestigated because of insufficient police or lack of equipment. In 2009, President Karzai created two anti-corruption units within the nation's Interior Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; 16 November 2009 |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-11-16-voa7-70423472.html |title=Afghanistan to Form Major Anti-Corruption Unit &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; English |publisher=.voanews.com |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Interior Minister [[Hanif Atmar]] told reporters that security officials from the U.S. ([[FBI]]), Britain ([[Scotland Yard]]) and the European Union will train prosecutors in the unit.

[[Helmand]], [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], and [[Oruzgan Province|Oruzgan]] are the most dangerous provinces in Afghanistan due to its distance from Kabul as well as the drug trade that flourishes there. The [[Afghan Border Police]] are responsible for protecting the nation's borders, especially the [[Durand Line]] border, which is often used by criminals and terrorists. Every year [[List of Afghan security forces fatality reports in Afghanistan|many Afghan police officers are killed in the line of duty]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Albania (toponym)}}
''Albania'' is the [[Medieval Latin]] name of the country which is called ''Shqipëri'' by its people. In [[Medieval Greek]], the country's name is ''Albania'' ({{Lang-el|Ἀλβανία}}) besides variants ''Albanitia'', ''Arbanitia''.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name may be derived from the [[Illyrian]] tribe of the Albani recorded by [[Ptolemy]], the geographer and astronomer from [[Alexandria]] who drafted a map in 150&amp;nbsp;AD&lt;ref&gt;Madrugearu A, Gordon M. The wars of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].

The name may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called Albanon and Arbanon, although it is not certain this was the same place.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, ISBN 978-0-631-19807-9, page 279,&quot;We cannot be certain that the Arbanon of Anna Comnena is the same as Albanopolis of the Albani, a place located on the map of Ptolemy (3.12)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''History'' written in 1079–1080, [[Byzantine]] historian [[Michael Attaliates]] was the first to refer to ''Albanoi'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the Duke of [[Dyrrachium]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elsei. ''The Albanian lexicon of Dion Von Kirkman who had an unfortunate case of the el sweaty dos bollocks.Earliest reference to the existence of the Albanian language'', pp. 113–122.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], the Albanians called their country ''Arbër'' or ''Arbën'' and referred to themselves as [[Arbëresh]] or ''Arbnesh''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinocacozza.it/ Pinocacozza.it] {{it icon}}{{sq icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-arberesh.eu/ Radio-Arberesh.eu] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 16th century the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria'' and ''Arbëresh''. While the two terms are [[folk etymology|popularly]] interpreted as &quot;Land of the Eagles&quot; and &quot;Children of the Eagles&quot;, they derive from the adverb ''shqip'', which means &quot;understanding each-other&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kristo Frasheri.

Under the [[Ottoman Empire]] Albania was referred to officially as ''Arnavutluk'' and its inhabitants as [[Arnauts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Arnaut Arnaut] at the Free Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The word is considered to be a [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from the word [[Arvanite]], which was the [[Medieval Greek]] name for the [[Albanians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Akademia e Shkencave e RPSH.

==History==
{{History of Albania}}{{Main|History of Albania}}
The '''History of Albania''' emerges from the [[Prehistoric Balkans|prehistoric stage]] from the 4th century BC, with early records of [[Illyria]] in [[Greco-Roman historiography]]. The modern territory of Albania has no counterpart in antiquity, comprising parts of the Roman provinces of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] (southern [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]), [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] (particularly [[Epirus Nova]]), and [[Moesia Superior]]. The territory remained under Roman ([[Albania under the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) control until the [[Slavic migrations]] of the 7th century, and was integrated into the [[Albania under the Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the 9th century.

The territorial nucleus of the Albanian state forms in the Middle Ages, as the [[Principality of Arbër]] and the [[Kingdom of Albania]]. The   [[Origins of the Albanians|first records]] of the [[Albanian people]] as a distinct ethnicity also date to this period. In 15th century there was a [[League of Lezhë|series of confrontation]] between Albanians led by [[Scanderbeg]] and the advancing [[Ottoman Empire]]. Soon after the death of Scanderbeg the organized resistance ceased and the country became part of Ottoman Empire. It remained under Ottoman control as part of the [[Rumelia]] province until 1912, when the first independent Albanian state was [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|declared]]. The formation of an [[National Renaissance of Albania|Albanian national consciousness]] dates to the latter 19th century and is part of the larger phenomenon of [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]].
A short-lived [[Principality of Albania|monarchy]] (1914–1925) was succeeded by an even shorter-lived first [[Albanian Republic]] (1925–1928), to be replaced by another [[Albanian Kingdom|monarchy]] (1928–1939), which was [[Albania under Italy|annexed]] by [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]] during World War II. After the collapse of the Axis powers, Albania became a communist state, the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]], which was dominated by [[Enver Hoxha]] (d. 1985). Hoxha's political heir [[Ramiz Alia]] oversaw the disintegration of the &quot;[[Hoxhaist]]&quot; state during the wider collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the later 1980s.

The communist regime collapsed in 1990, and the [[Republic of Albania]] was founded in 1991. The old communist party was routed in the elections of March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest. An economical crises spread in the late 1996 following the failure of some [[Ponzi scheme|Ponzi schemes]] operating in the country, peaking in the 1997 in an [[1997 rebellion in Albania|armed rebellion]], that led to another [[Albanian diaspora|mass emigration of Albanians]], mostly to [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanian communities in Greece|Greece]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]] and to North America.

In 1999 the country was affected by [[1999_NATO_bombing_of_the_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia|Kosovo War]], when a great number of Albanians from Kosovo found refuge in Albania.

Albania became a full member of [[NATO]] in 2009. The country is [[Accession of Albania to the European Union|applying]] to join the [[European Union]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Counties of Albania|Districts of Albania|Municipalities of Albania}}

Albania is divided into 12 administrative counties ({{lang-sq|qark or prefekturë}}). These counties include 36 districts ({{lang-sq|rreth}}) and 373 municipalities ({{lang-sq|bashki or komunë}}). 72 municipalities have city status ({{lang-sq|qytet}}). There are overall 2980 villages/communities ({{lang-sq|fshat}}) in all Albania. Each district has its council which is composed of a number of municipalities. The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.al/english/images/pdf/qeverisja_vendore.pdf |title=On the Organization and Functioning of the Local Government, Republic of Albania, 2000 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5sskA8M0G |archivedate = 2010-09-20|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Government, politics and armed forces==
{{Main|Politics of Albania}}
{{Politics of Albania}}

The Albanian republic is a parliamentary democracy established under a constitution renewed in 1998. Elections are now held every four years to a unicameral 140-seat chamber, the People's Assembly. In June 2002, a compromise candidate, [[Alfred Moisiu]], former [[Army General]], was elected to succeed President [[Rexhep Meidani]]. Parliamentary elections in July 2005 brought [[Sali Berisha]], an ex-Albanian communist party member, as leader of the Democratic Party, back to power. The actual president [[Bamir Topi]] was elected by Parliament in July 2007.

The Euro-Atlantic integration of Albania has been the ultimate goal of the post-communist governments. Albania's [[European Union|EU]] membership bid has been set as a priority by the European Commission.

Albania, along with Croatia, joined NATO on 1 April 2009 becoming the 27th and 28th members of the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7977332.stm | accessdate = 2 April 2009 | work=BBC News | title=Nato welcomes Albania and Croatia | date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The workforce of Albania has continued to migrate to Greece, Italy, Germany, other parts of Europe, and North America. However, the migration flux is slowly decreasing, as more and more opportunities are emerging in Albania itself as its economy steadily develops.

===Executive branch===
The head of state in Albania is the [[List of Presidents of Albania|President]] of the Republic. The President is elected to a 5-year term by the [[Assembly of Albania|Assembly of the Republic of Albania]] by secret ballot, requiring a 50%+1 majority of the votes of all deputies. The next election will run in 2012. The current President of the Republic is Bamir Topi.

The President has the power to guarantee observation of the constitution and all laws, act as commander in chief of the armed forces, exercise the duties of the [[Assembly of Albania|Assembly of the Republic of Albania]] when the Assembly is not in session, and appoint the Chairman of the Council of Ministers ([[prime minister]]).

Executive power rests with the Council of Ministers (cabinet). The Chairman of the Council (prime minister) is appointed by the president; ministers are nominated by the president on the basis of the prime minister's recommendation. The People's Assembly must give final approval of the composition of the Council. The Council is responsible for carrying out both foreign and domestic policies. It directs and controls the activities of the ministries and other state organs.

===Legislative branch===
The [[Assembly of Albania|Assembly of the Republic of Albania]] (''Kuvendi i Republikës së Shqipërisë'') is the lawmaking body in Albania. There are 140 deputies in the Assembly, which are elected through a [[party-list proportional representation]] system. The President of the Assembly (or Speaker) has two deputies and chairs the Assembly. There are 15 permanent commissions, or committees. Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years.

The Assembly has the power to decide the direction of domestic and foreign policy; approve or amend the constitution; declare war on another state; ratify or annul international treaties; elect the President of the Republic, the Supreme Court and the Attorney General and his or her deputies; and control the activity of state radio and television, state news agency and other official information media.

===Armed forces===
{{Main|Military of Albania|}}

The [[Military of Albania|Albanian Armed Forces]] (''Forcat e Armatosura të Shqipërisë'') first formed after independence in 1912. Albania reduced the number of active troops from a 1988 number of 65,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1935630.stm | work=BBC News | title=Albania sells off its military hardware | date=17 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a 2009 number of 14,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/08/21/feature-03 |title=Albania to abolish conscription by 2010 |publisher=SETimes.com |date=21 August 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a small fleet of aircraft and sea vessels. In the 1990s, the country scrapped enormous amounts of obsolete hardware, such as tanks and [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM systems]] from the United States.

Today, it consists of the General Staff Headquarters, the [[Albanian Land Forces]], [[Albanian Air Force]], [[Albanian Naval Defense Forces]], the [[Albanian Logistic Brigade]] and the [[Albanian Training and Doctrine Command]]. Increasing the military budget was one of the most important conditions for [[NATO]] integration. Military spending accounted for about 2.7% of GDP in 2008. Since February 2008, Albania participates officially in NATO's [[Operation Active Endeavor]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/issues/active_endeavour/index.html |title=NATO.int |publisher=NATO.int |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a NATO membership invitation on 3 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albania membership Nato|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/issues/nato_albania/evolution.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albania became a full member of NATO on 1 April 2009.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Albania}}
[[File:Albania space.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Satellite image of Albania]]
[[File:Ksamil Islets.jpg|thumb|[[Ksamil]] islets.]]

Albania has a total area of 28,748 square [[kilometers]]. It lies between latitudes [[39th parallel north|39°]] and  [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[19th meridian east|19°]] and [[21st meridian east|21° E]] (a small area lies east of 21°). Albania's coastline length is {{convert|476|km|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Albania pdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=R. Eftimi |url=http://aguas.igme.es/igme/publica/tiac-02/ALBANIA-I.pdf|title=SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON SEAWATER-FRESHWATER RELATIONSHIP IN ALBANIAN COASTAL AREA|publisher=ITA Consult}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|240}} and extends along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]]s. The lowlands of the west face the Adriatic Sea. The 70% of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often inaccessible from the outside. The highest mountain is [[Mount Korab|Korab]] situated in the [[district of Dibër]], reaching up to {{convert|2753|m|ft|abbr=off|lk=off}}. The climate on the coast is typically [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] with mild, wet winters and warm, sunny, and rather dry summers.

Inland conditions vary depending on altitude but the higher areas above 1,500&amp;nbsp;m/5,000&amp;nbsp;ft are rather cold and frequently snowy in winter; here cold conditions with lying snow may linger into spring. Besides the capital city of [[Tirana]], which has 800,000 inhabitants, the principal cities are [[Durrës]], [[Korçë]], [[Elbasan]], [[Shkodër]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Vlorë]] and [[Kukës]]. In Albanian grammar, a word can have indefinite and definite forms, and this also applies to city names: both ''Tiranë'' and ''Tirana'', ''Shkodër'' and ''Shkodra'' are used.

The three largest and deepest tectonic lakes of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] are partly located in Albania. [[Lake Shkodër]] in the country's northwest has a surface which can vary between {{convert|370|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|lk=off}} and 530&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, out of which one third belongs to Albania and rest to Montenegro. The Albanian shoreline of the lake is {{convert|57|km|0|abbr=on}}. [[Ohrid Lake]] is situated in the country's southeast and is shared between Albania and Republic of Macedonia. It has a maximal depth of 289&amp;nbsp;meters and a variety of unique flora and fauna can be found there, including &quot;living fossils&quot; and many endemic species. Because of its natural and historical value, Ohrid Lake is under the protection of [[UNESCO]]. There is also Butrinti Lake which is a small tectonic lake. It is located in the national park of Butrint.

[[File:Krujë3.jpg|thumb|Mountains in central Albania]]

===Climate===
{{See also|Climate of Albania}}

With its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions for so small an area. The coastal lowlands have typically Mediterranean weather; the highlands have a Mediterranean continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.

The lowlands have mild winters, averaging about {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Summer temperatures average {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} higher throughout the year. The difference is greater than {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.

Inland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Balkan]]s. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and [[river valley]]s are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.

[[File:Albania pasture.jpg|thumb|left|Albanian landscape]]

Average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.

When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter. Because the season's lower temperatures damage olive trees and citrus fruits, groves and orchards are restricted to sheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas with high average winter temperatures.

Lowland rainfall averages from {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually, with the higher levels in the north. Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter.

Rainfall in the upland mountain ranges is heavier. Adequate records are not available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are probably about {{convert|1800|mm|in|1|sp=us}} and are as high as {{convert|2550|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in some northern areas. The western Albanian Alps (valley of Boga) are among the wettest areas in Europe, receiving some {{convert|3100|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} of rain annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Current date/time is Fri Aug 27, 2010 10:12&amp;nbsp;pm |url=http://qendrim.forumotion.net/gjeografia-f61/tiparet-e-pergjithshme-te-klimes-t3725.htm |title=Qendrim.forumotion.net |publisher=Qendrim.forumotion.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area.

The higher inland mountains receive less precipitation than the intermediate uplands. Terrain differences cause wide local variations, but the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area.

In 2009 an expedition from University of Colorado, discovered four small glaciers in the 'Cursed' mountains in North Albania. The glaciers are at the relatively low level of 2,000&amp;nbsp;meters - almost unique for such a southerly latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instaar.metapress.com/content/273213h3t4370272/ |title=Twenty-first Century Glaciers and Climate in the Prokletije Mountains, Albania Journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research Publisher Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado ISSN 1523-0430 (Print) 1938-4246 (Online) Issue Volume 41, Number 4 / November 2009 DOI 10.1657/1938-4246-41.4.455 Pages 455-459 Online Date: November 30, 2009 |publisher=Instaar.metapress.com |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-08-27}} {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a small country, Albania is distinguished for its rich biological diversity. The variation of geomorphology, climate and terrain create favorable conditions for a number of endemic and [[sub-endemic]] species with 27 endemic and 160 subendemic vascular plants present in the country. The total number of plants is over 3250 species, approximately 30% of the entire flora species found in Europe.

Over a third of the territory of Albania&amp;nbsp;– about 10,000 square kilometers (2.5 million acres)&amp;nbsp;– is forested and the country is very rich in flora. About 3,000 different species of plants grow in Albania, many of which are used for medicinal purposes. [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Albania belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Adriatic and [[East Mediterranean]] provinces of the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]]. Coastal regions and lowlands have typical Mediterranean [[macchia]] vegetation, whereas [[oak]] forests and vegetation are found on higher altitudes. Vast forests of [[European Black Pine|black pine]], [[beech]] and [[fir]] are found on higher mountains and alpine [[grasslands]] grow at altitudes above 1800&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbd.int&quot;&gt;http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/al/al-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Albania can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Illyrian deciduous forests]], [[Pindus Mountains mixed forests]] and [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric Alpine]] mixed forests. The forests are home to a wide range of mammals, including [[wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[wild boar]]s and [[chamois]]. [[Lynx]], [[wildcat]]s, [[pine marten]]s and [[European Polecat|polecats]] are rare, but survive in some parts of the country.

There are around 760 vertebrate species found so far in Albania. Among these there are over 350 bird species, 330 freshwater and marine fish and 80 mammal species. There are some 91 globally threatened species found within the country, among which the [[Dalmatian pelican]], [[Pygmy cormorant]], and the [[European sea sturgeon]]. Rocky coastal regions in the south provide good habitats for the endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]].

Some of the most significant bird species found in the country include the [[golden eagle]]&amp;nbsp;– known as the national symbol of Albania&lt;ref name=&quot;Streissguth&quot;/&gt; &amp;nbsp;– [[vulture]] species, [[capercaillie]] and numerous [[waterfowl]]. The Albanian forests still maintain significant communities of large mammals such as the [[brown bear]], [[gray wolf]], [[chamois]] and [[wild boar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbd.int&quot;/&gt; The north and eastern mountains of the country are home to the last remaining [[Balkan Lynx]] – a critically endangered population of the [[Eurasian lynx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catsg.org/balkanlynx/20_blx-compendium/index.htm |title=The Balkan Lynx Conservation Compendium |publisher=Catsg.org |date= |accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and technology==
{{Main|Science and technology in Albania}}

Expenditure for scientific research and Development in Albania does not exceed 0.18% of GDP, which marks the lowest level in Europe. Economic competitiveness and exports are low, with the economy still heavily skewed towards low technology. From 1993 human resources in sciences and technology have drastically decreased. Various surveys show that during 1991-2005, approximately 50% of the professors and research scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have emigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfid&quot;&gt;[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?OutputID=177440 Research for Development] Highly Skilled Migration from Albania&lt;/ref&gt;

However in 2009 the government approved the &quot;National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsdc.gov.al/dsdc/pub/national_strategy_of_science_technology_and_innovation_final_draft_381_1.pdf |title=Strategy of Science, Technology and Innovation 2009–2015 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the period 2009–2015. It aims to triple public spending on research and development (R&amp;D) to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D from foreign sources, including via the [[European Union]]'s Framework Programmes for Research, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others.

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Albania}}

===Highways===


Currently there are three main four lane highways in Albania: the highway connecting the city of Durrës with Tirana, that connecting Durrës with [[Lushnje]] and the [[Albania-Kosovo Highway]].

The [[Albania-Kosovo Highway]] links [[Kosovo]] to Albania's Adriatic coast: the Albanian side was completed in June 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wynne |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/transport/albania-motorway-making-the-first-move/5203302.article# |title=Albania highway: Making the first move &amp;#124; Features &amp;#124; New Civil Engineer |publisher=Nce.co.uk |date= |accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now it takes only two hours and a half to go from the Kosovo border to [[Durrës]]. Overall the highway will be around {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} when it reaches [[Pristina]]. The project was the biggest and most expensive infrastructure project ever undertaken in Albania. The cost of the highway appears to have breached €800 million, although the exact cost for the total highway has yet to be confirmed by the government.

Two additional highways will be built in Albania in the near future: [[Pan-European corridors|Corridor VIII]], which will link Albania with the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and the north-south highway, which corresponds to the Albanian side of the [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway]], a larger regional highway connecting [[Croatia]] with Greece along the [[Adriatic]] and [[Ionian]] coasts. When all three corridors are completed Albania will have an estimated 759&amp;nbsp;kilometers of highway linking it with all its neighboring countries, Kosovo, Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Greece.

===Aviation===
[[File:Terminal jashte.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]]]]

The civil air transport in Albania marked its beginnings in November 1924, when the Republic of Albania signed a Governmental Agreement with German Air Company [[Lufthansa]]. On the basis of a ten-year concession agreement, the Albanian Airlines Company [[Adria Aero Lloyd]] was established.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In the spring of 1925, the first domestic flights from [[Tirana]] to [[Shkoder]] and [[Vlora]] began.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In August 1927, the office of Civil Aviation of Air Traffic Ministry of Italy purchased Adria Aero Lloyd. The company, now in Italian hands, expanded its flights to other cities, such as [[Elbasan]], [[Korça]], [[Kukësi]], [[Peshkopia]] and [[Gjirokastra]], and opened up international lines to Rome, [[Milan]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Sofia]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Podgorica]].

The construction of a more modern airport in [[Lapraka]] started in 1934 and was completed by the end of 1935. This new airport, which was later officially named &quot;Airport of Tirana&quot;, was constructed in conformity with optimal technological parameters of that time, with a reinforced concrete runway of 1200 {{convert|400|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, and complemented with technical equipment and appropriate buildings.

During 1955–1957, the [[Tirana International Airport|Rinasi Airport]] was constructed for military purposes. Later, its administration was shifted to the Ministry of Transport. On 25 January 1957 the State-owned Enterprise of International Air Transport ([[Albtransport]]) established its headquarters in Tirana. [[Aeroflot]], [[Jat]], [[Malev]], [[Tarom]] and [[Interflug]] were the air companies that started to have flights with Albania until 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tirana International Airport Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tirana-airport.com/?RoseToken=169180229114147161160144183148154169229193083155156151160214184090168180231crc339 | title=History of the Airport | accessdate=2011-01-15 | publisher=Tirana International Airport Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1960–1978, several airlines ceased to operate in Albania due to the impact of the politics, resulting in a decrease of influx of flights and passengers. In 1977 Albania's government signed an agreement with Greece to open the country's first air links with non-communist Europe. As a result, [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic Airways]] was the first non-communist airline to commercially fly into Albania after [[World War II]]. By 1991 Albania had air links with many major European cities, including Paris, Rome, [[Zurich]], [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]], but no regular domestic air service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tirana International Airport Website&quot;/&gt;

A French-Albanian joint venture [[Ada Air]], was launched in Albania as the first private airline, in 1991. The company offered flights in a thirty-six-passenger airplane four days a week between Tirana and [[Bari]], Italy and a charter service for domestic and international destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tirana International Airport Website&quot;/&gt;

From 1989 to 1991, because of political changes in the [[Eastern European]] countries, Albania adhered to the International Civil Aviation Organization ([[ICAO]]), opened its air space to international flights, and had its duties of Air Traffic Control defined. As a result of these developments, conditions were created to separate the activities of air traffic control from Albtransport. Instead, the [[National Agency of Air Traffic]] (NATA) was established as an independent enterprise. In addition, during these years, governmental agreements of civil air transport were established with countries such as [[Bulgaria]], Germany, [[Slovenia]], Italy, Russia, Austria, the UK and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. The Directory General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) was established on 3 February 1991, to cope with the development required by the time.

As of 2007 Albania has one [[international airport]]: [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]]. The airport is linked to 29 destinations by 14 airlines. It has seen a dramatic rise in terms of passenger numbers and aircraft movements since the early 1990s. The data for 2009 is 1.3 million passengers served and an average of 44 landings and takeoffs per day.

===Railways===
{{Main|Rail transport in Albania|Hekurudha Shqiptarë}}

The [[railway]]s in Albania are administered by the national railway company ''[[Hekurudha Shqiptare]]'' (HSH) (which means ''Albanian Railways''). It operates a {{RailGauge|1435}} gauge (standard gauge) rail system in Albania. All trains are hauled by [[Czech Republic|Czech]]-built [[ČKD]] diesel-electric [[locomotive]]s.

The railway system was extensively promoted by the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime of [[Enver Hoxha]], during which time the use of private transport was effectively prohibited. Since the collapse of the former regime, there has been a considerable increase in [[car]] ownership and [[bus]] usage. Whilst some of the country's roads are still in a very poor condition, there have been other developments (such as the construction of a [[motorway]] between Tirana and Durrës) which have taken much traffic away from the railways.

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in [[Byzantine]] sources of the late-11th century. At this point, they are already fully Christianised.  Christianity was later overtaken by [[Islam]]. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1940s and 1950s, under the state policy of obliterating all organised religion from Albanian territories.

The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely [[anti-religious|banned religion]] to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first [[state atheism|atheist state]]. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch) are found throughout the country whereas [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] are concentrated in the south and [[Roman Catholics]] are found in the north of the country. No reliable data are available on active participation in formal religious services, and estimates range from 25% to 40%.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Religious Freedom Report 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |title=Albania: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who travelled round Europe, in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism, being arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British &amp; Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century.  The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh http://www.vush.org/ was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denomincations.  VUSh organises marches in Tirana recently one against blood feuds in 2010.  Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania.  The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation which was printed in 1990.

There are about 4,000 active [[Jehovah's witnesses]] in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Jehovah's Witnesses Worldwide Status Report|url=http://www.watchtower.org/e/statistics/worldwide_report_statistics.htm|accessdate=27 September 2009|publisher=Watch Tower}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among other religious organizations making inroads into this nation is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS or 'Mormons'). LDS involvement in Albania began with humanitarian aid during the 1990s. The first missionaries were sent in 1992 with the Albania Tirana Mission being opened in 1996. As of 2008, there were nearly 2,000 members of the LDS church in Albania, spread throughout ten branches with two purpose-built Chapels and one Family History Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LDS Newsroom-Country Profile-Albania|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/albania|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Music of Albania}}
Albanian folk music falls into three sylistic groups, with other important [[music area]]s around [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]]; the major groupings are the [[Gheg]]s of the north and southern Labs and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosks]]. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the &quot;rugged and heroic&quot; tone of the north and the &quot;relaxed&quot; form of the south.

These disparate styles are unified by &quot;the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of [[oral history]]&quot;, as well as certain characteristics like the use of obscure rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.&lt;ref&gt;Arbatsky, Yuri, cited in Koco with the footnote ''Translated and published by Filip Fishta in Shkolla Kombëtare (The National School; No.1, May 1939), 19, and quoted from his Preface to [[Pjetër Dungu]]'s Lyra Shqiptare (see note 2).''&lt;/ref&gt; The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by [[Pjetër Dungu]] in 1940.

Albanian folk songs can be divided into major groups, the heroic epics of the north, and the sweetly melodic [[lullaby|lullabies]], love songs, [[wedding music]], [[work song]]s and other kinds of song. The music of various festivals and holidays is also an important part of Albanian folk song, especially those that celebrate St. Lazarus Day, which inaugurates the springtime. Lullabies and [[vajtim]]s are very important kinds of Albanian folk song, and are generally performed by solo women.&lt;ref name=&quot;koco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Albanian Music|work=Eno Koco at the University of Leeds|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/ek/|accessdate=28 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albanian language and literature===

{{Main|Albanian language|Albanian literature|List of Albanian writers}}

Albanian was proven to be an [[Indo-European language]] in 1854 by the German [[Comparative linguistics|philologist]] [[Franz Bopp]]. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture By J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams Edition: illustrated Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997 ISBN 978-1-884964-98-5, 9781884964985 (''&quot;Although there are some lexical items that appear to be shared between Romanian (and by extension Dacian) and Albanian, by far the strongest connections can be argued between Albanian and Illyrian.&quot;'' page 11)
Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World By Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Contributor Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Edition: illustrated Published by Elsevier, 2008 ISBN 978-0-08-087774-7, 9780080877747 (''&quot;Albanian constitutes a single branch of the Indo-European family of languages. It is often held to be related to Illyrian, a poorly attested language spoken in the Western Balkans in classical times&quot;'' page 22)&lt;/ref&gt; while others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=txh|title=The Thracian language|publisher=The Linguist List|accessdate=27 January 2008|quote=An ancient language of Southern Balkans, belonging to the Satem group of Indo-European. This language is the most likely ancestor of modern Albanian (which is also a Satem language), though the evidence is scanty. 1st Millennium BC&amp;nbsp;– 500&amp;nbsp;AD.}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that it derives from [[Dacian language|Daco]]-[[Thracian language|Thracian]]. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see [[Thraco-Illyrian]].)

Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of [[isogloss]]es with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long ''o'' has fallen to ''a'', much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative ''jos'' and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives.

The cultural resistance was first of all expressed through the elaboration of the [[Albanian language]] in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] confessional region in the North, but also of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] in the South. The [[Protestant]] reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language what [[Martin Luther|Luther]] did for German.

[[File:Meshari.jpg|thumb|left|Excerpt from ''[[Meshari]]'' by [[Gjon Buzuku]]]]

''[[Meshari]]'' (The Missal) by [[Gjon Buzuku]], published by him in 1555, is considered to date as the first literary work of written Albanian. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be a result of an earlier tradition of writing Albanian, a tradition that is not known. But there are some fragmented evidence, dating earlier than Buzuku, which indicate that Albanian was written at least since 14th century AD.

The first known evidence dates from 1332&amp;nbsp;AD and deals with the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who in a report in Latin writes that Albanians use Latin letters in their books although their language is quite different from Latin. Of special importance in supporting this are: a baptizing formula (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') of 1462, written in Albanian within a text in Latin by the [[Bishop]] of [[Durrës]], [[Pal Engjëlli]]; a glossary with Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th century fragment from the [[Bible]] from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but in Greek letters.
[[File:Tirana Museum 1988.jpg|thumb|right|The [[National Historical Museum (Albania)|National Museum of Albania]] features exhibits from [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] times to World War II.]]

Albanian writings of these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who, in his book ''Rrethimi i Shkodrës'' (The Siege of Shkodër) (1504), confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'').

During the 16th to 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] ''E mbësuame krishterë'' (Christian Teachings) (1592) by [[Lekë Matrënga]], ''Doktrina e krishterë'' (The Christian Doctrine) (1618) and ''Rituale romanum'' (1621) by [[Pjetër Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and [[poetry]], an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjetër Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The most famous Albanian writer is probably [[Ismail Kadare]].

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Albania}}

Before the rise of Communist regime, Albania's illiteracy rate was as high as 85%. Schools were scarce between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. When the Communist regime gained control in 1944, it gave high priority to the wiping out of illiteracy. Strict regulations were introduced, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. Since then the country's literacy rate has improved remarkably.&lt;ref&gt;Zickel, Iwaskiw, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%, the [[male]] [[literacy rate]] is 99.2% and [[female]] literacy rate is 98.3%.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The [[University of Tirana]] is the oldest university in Albania, founded in October 1957.

==Sport==
[[Association Football|Football]] is the most popular Sport in Albania, both at a participatory and spectator level. The Sport is governed by the [[Football Association of Albania]] ({{lang-sq|Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit}}, F.SH.F.), created in 1930, member of [[FIFA]] and a founding member of [[UEFA]]. Other played Sports include [[Basketball]], [[Volleyball]], [[Rugby union]], and [[Gymnastics]].

==Entertainment==
{{Main|RTSH}}
{{See also|Television in Albania}}{{See also|List of radio stations in Albania}}
Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania, founded in [[1938]] in [[Tirana]]. RTSH runs three [[television]] stations named ''Televizioni Shqiptar'' (TVSH, TVSH 2, and TVSH Sat), and three radio stations, using the name ''Radio Tirana'' in addition to 4 regional radio stations. The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via [[medium wave]] (AM) and [[short wave]] (SW).&lt;ref&gt;[http://picasaweb.google.es/ec2adn/RadioTiranaBroadcastingSchedules/photo#5187887711939456834 Radio Tirana's Broadcasting Schedule as of 2007 - RadioTirana.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The international service has used the theme from the song &quot;Keputa një gjethe dafine&quot; as its [[signature tune]]. The international television service [[satellite|via satellite]] was launched since [[1993]] and aims at [[Albanian language|Albanian]] communities in [[Kosovo]], [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and northern [[Greece]], plus the Albanian [[diaspora]] in the rest of [[Europe]]. RTSH has a past of being heavily influenced by the ruling party in its reporting, that being left or right winged.

According the National Council of Radio and Television (KKRT), Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations.
Last years Albania has organized several shows as a part of worldwide series like [[Dancing with the Stars]], [[Big Brother Albania]] and [[Albanians Got Talent]].

==Health==
Health care has been in a steep decline after the collapse of socialism in the country, but a process of modernization has been taking place since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;hospitals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e80089.pdf |title=Albania-prel.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the first decade of the 21st century, there were 51 hospitals in the country, including a military hospital and specialist facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;hospitals&quot;/&gt; Albania has successfully removed diseases such as [[malaria]].

Life expectancy is estimated at 77.43 years, ranking 51st worldwide, and outperforming a number of European Union countries, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html?countryName=Albania&amp;countryCode=al&amp;regionCode=eu&amp;rank=51#al CIA&amp;nbsp;– The World Factbook], Life Expectancy ranks&lt;/ref&gt; The most common causes of death are circulatory disease followed by cancerous illnesses. [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] completed a survey in April 2009, detailing various health statistics in Albania, including [[Male Circumcision]], [[Abortion]] and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albania DHS Surveys&quot;&gt;[http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/metadata.cfm?surv_id=327&amp;ctry_id=72&amp;SrvyTp=ctry&amp;cn=Albania Albania DHS Surveys] .&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty of Medicine of the [[University of Tirana]] is the main medical school in the country. There are also nursing schools in other cities. [[Newsweek]] ranked Albania 57 out of 100 Best Countries in the World in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2010/the-world-s-best-countries.html |title=The World's Best Countries |publisher=Newsweek |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2010-08-27| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5s2FdnYG4 | archivedate = 2010-08-16| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Albanian cuisine}}

The cuisine of Albania&amp;nbsp;– as with most [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkans|Balkan]] nations&amp;nbsp;– is strongly influenced by its long history. At different times, the territory which is now Albania has been claimed or occupied by Greece, Italy and the [[Ottoman Turk]]s and each group has left its mark on Albanian cuisine. The main meal of the [[Albanians]] is lunch, and it is usually accompanied by a [[salad]] of fresh [[vegetables]], such as [[tomato]]es, [[cucumber]]s, green [[bell pepper|peppers]] and [[olive]]s with [[olive oil]], [[vinegar]] and [[salt]]. Lunch also includes a main dish of vegetables and meat. Seafood specialties are also common in the coastal areas of [[Durrës]], [[Vlorë]] and [[Sarandë]]. In high altitude areas smoked meat and pickling is very common.

'''Allah''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;الله&lt;/big&gt;}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh}}'', {{IPA-ar|ʔalˤːɑːh|IPA|Ar-allah.ogg}}) is a word for '''[[God]]''' used in the context of Islam.

[[Cognates]] of the name &quot;Allāh&quot; exist in other [[Semitic languages]], including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Columbia Encyclopaedia says: Derived from an old Semitic root referring to the Divine and used in the Canaanite ''[[El]]'', the Mesopotamian ''[[ilu]]'', and the biblical ''[[Elohim]]'' and ''[[Eloah]]'', the word Allah is used by all Arabic-speaking Muslims, Christians, Jews, and other monotheists.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biblical Hebrew]] mostly uses the plural form (but functional singular) ''[[Elohim]]''. The corresponding [[Aramaic]] form is ''{{Unicode|ʼĔlāhā}}'' ܐܠܗܐ in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and ''{{Unicode|ʼAlâhâ}}'' ܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ  in [[Syriac language|Syriac]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cal&quot;&gt;[http://cal1.cn.huc.edu The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon] - Entry for ''{{Unicode|ʼlh}}''&lt;/ref&gt;. In the [[Sikh]] scriptures, [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the term ''Allah'', Punjabi (Gurmukhi): ਅਲਹੁ is used 46 times respectively.

The name was previously used by [[Arabian mythology|pagan]] [[Mecca]]ns as a reference to the [[creator deity]], possibly the supreme deity in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;L. Gardet, &quot;Allah&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= prayer |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages= 274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concepts associated with the term ''Allah'' (as a deity) differ among religious traditions. In pre-Islamic Arabia amongst pagan Arabs, ''Allah'' was not considered the sole divinity, having associates and companions, sons and daughters–a concept which [[Islam]] thoroughly and resolutely did away with. In Islam, the name Allah is the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name. All other divine names are believed to refer back to Allah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tao-Islam&quot;&gt;

==Usage in Arabic==
===Pre-Islamic Arabia===
In pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah was used by Meccans as a reference to the creator-god, possibly the supreme deity.&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an {{cite quran|13|16|style=nosup|expand=no}} ; {{cite quran|29|61-63|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|31|25|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|39|38|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Allah in Stone in Rohtas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Allah at [[Rohtas Fort]] Pakistan]]
Allah was not considered the sole divinity; however, Allah was considered the creator of the world and the giver of rain. The notion of the term may have been vague in the Meccan religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;/&gt; Allah was associated with companions, whom pre-Islamic Arabs considered as subordinate deities. Meccans held that a kind of [[kinship]] existed between Allah and the [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an {{cite quran|37|158|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt; Allah was thought to have had sons&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an ({{cite quran|6|100|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt; and that the local deities of [[al-‘Uzzá|al-ʻUzzá]], [[Manāt]] and [[al-Lāt]] were His daughters.&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an ({{cite quran|53|19-22|style=nosup|expand=no}} ; {{cite quran|16|57|style=nosup|expand=no}} ; {{cite quran|37|149|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt; The Meccans possibly associated angels with Allah.&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an ({{cite quran|53|26-27|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GodEoQ&quot;/&gt; Allah was invoked in times of distress.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodEoQ&quot;&gt;Gerhard Böwering, ''God and his Attributes'', Encyclopedia of the Qur'an&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Qur'an {{cite quran|6|109|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|10|22|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|16|38|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|29|65|style=nosup|expand=no}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abd Allah ibn Abd al Muttalib|Muhammad's father's]] name was {{Unicode|‘Abdallāh}} meaning the “servant of Allāh.” or &quot;the slave of Allāh&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GodEoQ&quot;/&gt;

===Islam===
{{main|God in Islam}}
{{see also|Names of God in the Qur'an}}
[[File:Allahmedal.jpg|thumb|Medallion showing 'Allah' in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]], Turkey.]]
According to Islamic belief, Allah is the proper name of God,&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;&gt;Böwering, Gerhard, ''God and His Attributes'', Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān, Brill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and humble submission to His Will, Divine Ordinances and Commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; &quot;He is the only God, creator of the universe, and the judge of humankind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, ''Allah''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt; &quot;He is unique (''wahid'') and inherently one (''ahad''), all-merciful and omnipotent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; The Qur'an declares &quot;the reality of Allah, His inaccessible mystery, His various names, and His actions on behalf of His creatures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Dcp7323-Edirne-Eski Camii Allah.jpg|thumb|150px|Allah script outside [[Eski Cami]] (The Old Mosque) in [[Edirne]], [[Turkey]].]]
In Islamic tradition, there are [[99 Names of God]] (''al-asma al-husna'' lit. meaning: &quot;The best names&quot;) each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of Allah.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bentley |first=David |coauthors= |title=The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book |publisher=William Carey Library |year=1999 |month=September |isbn=978-0-87808-299-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tao-Islam&quot;/&gt; Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are &quot;the Merciful&quot; (''[[Rahman (name)|al-rahman]]'') and &quot;the Compassionate&quot; (''al-rahim'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;/&gt;

Most Muslims use the untranslated Arabic phrase &quot;[[Insha'Allah|insha' Allah]]&quot; (meaning &quot;God willing&quot;) after references to future events.&lt;ref&gt;Gary S. Gregg, ''The Middle East: A Cultural Psychology'', Oxford University Press, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of &quot;[[bismillah]]&quot;(meaning &quot;In the name of God&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, ''Islamic Society in Practice'', University Press of Florida, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

There are certain phrases in praise of God that are favored by Muslims, including &quot;[[Subhan'allah|Subhan-Allah]]&quot; (Holiness be to God), &quot;[[Alhamdulillah]]&quot; (Praise be to God), &quot;[[Shahada|La-il-la-ha-illa-Allah]]&quot; (There is no deity but God) and &quot;[[Takbir|Allāhu Akbar]]&quot; (God is great) as a devotional exercise of remembering God ([[zikr]]).&lt;ref&gt;M. Mukarram Ahmed, Muzaffar Husain Syed, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'',Anmol Publications PVT. LTD, p.144&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Sufi]] practice known as ''zikr Allah'' (lit. remembrance of God), the Sufi repeats and contemplates on the name ''Allah'' or other divine names while controlling his or her breath.&lt;ref&gt;Carl W. Ernst, Bruce B. Lawrence,'' Sufi Martyrs of Love: The Chishti Order in South Asia and Beyond'', Macmillan, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{Who|date=December 2008}} have suggested that Muhammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians in order to establish a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;/&gt; According to Böwering, in contrast with Pre-Islamic Arabian [[polytheism]], God in Islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between God and jinn.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;/&gt; Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.&lt;ref&gt;Allah, ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Francis Edwards Peters]], &quot;The [[Qur'an]] insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that [[Muhammad]] and his followers worship the same God as the Jews ({{cite quran|29|46|style=nosup|expand=no}}). The Koran's Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with [[Abraham]]&quot;. Peters states that the Qur'an portrays Allah as both more powerful and more remote than Yahweh, and as a universal deity, unlike Yahweh who closely follows [[Israel]]ites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters1&quot;&gt;F.E. Peters, ''Islam'', p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Arabic-speakers of all Abrahamic faiths, including Christians and Jews, use the word &quot;Allah&quot; to mean &quot;God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;/&gt; The Christian Arabs of today have no other word for 'God' than 'Allah'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt; (Even the Arabic-descended [[Maltese language]] of [[Malta]], whose population is almost entirely [[Roman Catholic]], uses ''Alla'' for 'God'.) Arab Christians for example use terms ''Allāh al-ʼab'' (الله الأب) meaning [[God the Father]], ''Allāh al-ibn'' (الله الابن) mean [[Son of God|God the Son]], and ''{{Unicode|Allāh al-rūḥ al-quds}}'' (الله الروح القدس) meaning [[Holy Spirit|God the Holy Spirit]] (See [[God in Christianity]] for the Christian concept of God).

[[Arab Christian]]s have used two forms of invocations that were [[affix]]ed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim ''basm-Allah'', and also created their own Trinitized ''basm-Allah'' as early as the eight century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; The Muslim ''basm-Allah'' reads: &quot;In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.&quot; The Trinitized ''basm-Allah'' reads: &quot;In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God.&quot; The [[Syria]]c, [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] invocations do not have the words &quot;One God&quot; at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] aspect of Trinitian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;Thomas E. Burman, ''Religious Polemic and the Intellectual History of the Mozarabs'', [[Brill Publishers|Brill]], 1994, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marshall Hodgson]], it seems that in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made pilgrimage to the Kaaba, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall G. S. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization'', [[University of Chicago Press]], p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

==As a loanword==
===English and other European languages===
{{Islam}}
The history of the word &quot;Allāh&quot; in [[English language|English]] was probably influenced by the study of [[comparative religion]] in 19th century; for example, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Muhammad (1934), [[Tor Andræ]] always used the term Allah, though he allows that this 'conception of God' seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies.
By this time Christians were also becoming accustomed to retaining the Hebrew term &quot;[[YHWH]]&quot; untranslated{{Dubious|date=January 2011}} (it was previously translated as 'the Lord').&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt45&quot;&gt;William Montgomery Watt, ''Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue'', [[Routledge]], 1983, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages which may not commonly use the term ''Allah'' to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long [[Al-Andalus|Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula]], the word ojalá in the [[Spanish language]] and oxalá in the [[Portuguese language]] exist today, borrowed from [[Arabic]] (Arabic: إن شاء الله). This word literally means &quot;God willing&quot; (in the sense of &quot;I hope so&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Islam in Luce López Baralt, ''Spanish Literature: From the Middle Ages to the Present'', Brill, 1992, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Muslims leave the name &quot;Allāh&quot; untranslated in English.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''The Monotheists: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Conflict and Competition'', [[Princeton University Press]], p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysian and Indonesian language===
Christians in Indonesia and Malaysia also use ''Allah'' to refer to God in the [[Malaysian language]] and [[Indonesian Language]] (both languages forms of the [[Malay language]] which is referred to as ''Bahasa Melayu'').

Mainstream Bible translations  in both languages use ''Allah'' as the translation of Hebrew [[Elohim]] (translated in English Bibles as &quot;God&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://alkitab.sabda.org/verse.php?book=Mat&amp;chapter=22&amp;verse=32&amp;search=allah&amp;scope=all&amp;exact=off Usage of the word &quot;Allah&quot; from Matthew 22:32 in Indonesian bible versions (paralel view) as old as 1733]&lt;/ref&gt; This goes back to early translation work by [[Francis Xavier]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society Sneddon, James M.; University of New South Wales Press; 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of Christianity in India from the Commencement of the Christian Era: Hough, James; Adamant Media Corporation; 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The first dictionary of Dutch-Malay by [[Albert Cornelius Ruyl|A.C. Ruyl]], Justus Heurnius, and Caspar Wiltens in [[1650]] recorded &quot;Allah&quot; as the translation of the Dutch word &quot;Godt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.id/books?id=3GcTAAAAQAAJ&amp;v=onepage&amp;q=allah&amp;f=false Justus Heurnius, Albert Ruyl, Caspar Wiltens. &quot;Vocabularium ofte Woordenboeck nae ordre van den alphabeth, in 't Duytsch en Maleys&quot;. 1650:65]&lt;/ref&gt; Ruyl also translated [[Matthew]] in 1612 to Malay language (first Bible translation to non-European language, only a year after [[King James Version]] was published&lt;ref&gt;Barton, John (2002-12). The Biblical World, Oxford, UK: Routledge. ISBN 978-0-415-27574-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; North, Eric McCoy; Eugene Albert Nida ((2nd Edition) 1972). The Book of a Thousand Tongues, London: United Bible Societies.&lt;/ref&gt;), which was printed in the Netherlands in 1629. Then he translated [[Mark]] which was published in 1638. &lt;ref&gt;{{Id icon}} [http://sejarah.sabda.org/sejarah/bio_ruyl.htm Biography of Ruyl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/514364/Albert-Cornelius-Ruyl Encyclopedia Brittanica: Albert Cornelius Ruyl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government of Malaysia]] in 2007 outlawed usage of the term ''Allah'' in any other but Muslim contexts, but the High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional.  While ''Allah'' had been used for the Christian God in Malay for more than four centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of ''Allah'' by the Roman Catholic newspaper ''[[The Herald (Malaysian Catholic Weekly)|The Herald]]''. The government has in turn appealed the court ruling, and the High Court has suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal is heard.

===In other scripts and languages===
* ''Allah'' in other languages with Arabic script is spelled in the same way. This includes [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] among others.
* {{lang-bn|আল্লাহ}} ''Allah''
* [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: ''Allah''
* [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 阿拉 ''Ālā'', 安拉 ''Ānlā''; 真主 ''Zhēnzhǔ'' (semantic translation)
* {{lang-el|Αλλάχ ''Allách''}}, Θεός ''Theós'' (God)
* Hebrew: אללה ''Allah''
* [[Hindi]]: अल्लाह ''Allāh''
* [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: アラー ''Arā'', アッラー ''Arrā'', アッラーフ ''Arrāfu''
* {{lang-mt|Alla}}
* [[Korean language|Korean]]: 알라 ''Alla''
* [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Allah'', also archaic ''Allach'' or ''Ałłach''
* [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], {{lang-bg|Алла}}́х ''Allakh''
* [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], {{lang-mk|Alah}}, ''Алах ''
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Alá''
* [[Thai language|Thai]]: อัลลอฮ์ ''Anláw''
* Punjabi ([[Gurmukhi script|Gurmukhi]]): ਅੱਲਾਹ ''Allāh'' (archaic ਅਲਹੁ in Sikh scripture)

==Typography==
The word ''Allāh'' is always written without an [[aleph|alif]] to spell the ''ā'' vowel. This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using alif to spell ''ā''. However, in vocalized spelling, a small diacritic ''alif'' is added on top of the ''[[shadda]]h'' to indicate the pronunciation.

One exception may be in the pre-Islamic [[History of the Arabic alphabet#Pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions|Zabad inscription]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Zebed Inscription: A Pre-Islamic Trilingual Inscription In Greek, Syriac &amp; Arabic From 512 CE
| url=http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Inscriptions/zebed.html

| date=March 17, 2005
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; where it ends with an ambiguous sign that may be a lone-standing ''h'' with a lengthened start, or may be a non-standard conjoined ''l-h'':-
* {{lang|ar| الاه }}: This reading would be ''Allāh'' spelled phonetically with ''alif'' for the ''ā''.
* {{lang|ar| الاله }}: This reading would be ''Al-ʼilāh'' = &quot;the god&quot; (an older form, without contraction), by older spelling practice without ''alif'' for ''ā''.

===Unicode===
[[Unicode]] has a codepoint reserved for ''Allāh'', {{lang|ar|ﷲ}} = U+FDF2.
This character according to the official Unicode specification is a ligature of ''alif-lām-lām-shadda-(superscript alif)-hā'' ({{script|Arab|اللّٰه}} U+0627 U+0644 U+0644 U+0651 U+0670 U+0647).
[[File:Allah.svg|thumb|right|200px|An example of ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh}}'' written in simple [[Arabic calligraphy]].]]
There is, however some confusion arising from the fact that Arabic typography usually features a ''{{transl|ar|llāh}}'' glyph without the preceding alif, which only occurs phrase-initially (or with {{transl|ar|DIN|''[[hamza]]tu l-waṣl''}} {{script|Arab|آ}} in Qur'anic orthography). Consequently, the majority of [[Arabic Unicode]] fonts do not conform with the specification and have a glyph without the alif at this position (e.g. those provided by [http://www.linotype.com/2517/arabicfonts.html Linotype], the great majority of those licensed to or developed by [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/FontPortal.aspx?PID=8 Microsoft], those of [http://www.arabeyes.org Arabeyes.org], [[SIL]]'s [http://scripts.sil.org/ArabicFonts Lateef] and the fonts of [http://www.crulp.org CRULP] developed in Pakistan),
while others have the prescribed form with alif (e.g. [http://scripts.sil.org/ArabicFonts SIL's Scheherazade], [http://www.tdc.org/news/2006Results/AdobeArabic.html Adobe Arabic] distributed with the Middle-Eastern version
of the [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html Adobe Reader 7], [[Arial Unicode MS]], and [http://sakkal.com/type/typesetting.html Arabic Typesetting], distributed with [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx VOLT] and with [http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/language/proofingtools.mspx Microsoft Office Proofing Tools 2003]).

The calligraphic variant of the word used as the [[Coat of arms of Iran]] is encoded in Unicode, in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] range, at codepoint U+262B ({{unicode|☫}}).

Retrieved 7 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the ancient Iranian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]]. In the [[Avesta]], Frawardin [[Yasht]] (&quot;Hymn to the Guardian Angels&quot;), there is a mention of ''âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide'', which literally translates from [[Avestan language|Avestan]] as ''&quot;we worship the [[Fravashi]] of the holy Atare-pata&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt13sbe.htm|title=Frawardin Yasht (&quot;Hymn to the Guardian Angels&quot;) – translated by James Darmesteter (From Sacred Books of the East, American Edition, 1898)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atropates]] ruled over the region of [[Atropatene]] (present-day [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]). The name &quot;Atropates&quot; itself is the Greek transliteration of an Old-Iranian, probably Median, compounded name with the meaning &quot;Protected by the (Holy) Fire&quot;. The Greek name is mentioned by [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Strabo]], and it is continued as ''ādurbādagān'' in the [[Middle Persian]] geographical text Shahrestānihā i Erānshahr.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Touraj Daryaee, Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is translatable as both &quot;the treasury&quot; and &quot;the treasurer&quot; of fire in [[Persian language|Modern Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;In dictionaries: [[F.

===Antiquity===
[[File:Petroglyphs of Qobustan.jpg|thumb|[[Petroglyphs]] in [[Gobustan State Reserve|Gobustan]] dating back to 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC indicating a thriving culture. It is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] considered to be of &quot;outstanding universal value&quot;]]
The earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates to the late [[Stone Age]] and is related to the [[Guruchay culture]] of the [[Azykh Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsocialscience.org/uploads/c_GlobalSSH%20-%20Azerbaijan%20institutional%20report%20FINAL.pdf National report on institutional landscape and research policy Social Sciences and Humanities in Azerbaijan].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Upper Paleolithic]] and late [[Bronze Age]] cultures are attested in the caves of [[Tağılar]], [[Damcılı]], [[Zar, Azerbaijan|Zar]], Yataq-yeri and in the [[necropolis]]es of Leylatepe and Saraytepe.

Early Iranian settlements included the [[Scythia]]ns in the ninth century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress Azerbaijan&quot;&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/aztoc.html Azerbaijan], ''US Library of Congress Country Studies''. Retrieved 7 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Scythians]], Iranian [[Medes]] came to dominate the area to the south of the [[Aras River|Aras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;/&gt; The Medes forged a vast empire between 900–700&amp;nbsp;BC, which was integrated into the [[Achaemenids]] Empire around 550&amp;nbsp;BC. The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Chaumont, &quot;ALBANIA&quot; in Encyclopaedia Iranica.  The Sasanian period. In about A.D. 252-53 Šāpūr I made himself lord of Great Armenia, which was turned into a Sasanian province; Iberia and Albania were also soon conquered and annexed.&lt;/ref&gt; Later it became part of [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Macedon|Empire]] and its successor, the [[Seleucid Empire]]. [[Caucasian Albania]]ns, the original inhabitants of the area, established an independent kingdom around the fourth century BC. During this period, [[Zoroastrianism]] spread in the Caucasus and [[Atropatene]]. Ancient Azerbaijanis spoke the [[Ancient Azari language]].

===Feudal era===
[[File:Maidentt.jpg|thumb|The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] in [[Old Baku]] is a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in the 11th–12th century.]]
The [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] turned Caucasian Albania into a [[vassal state]] in AD 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted [[Christianity]] as the state religion in the fourth century. Despite numerous conquests by the Sassanids and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Albania remained an entity in the region until the ninth century. The Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sassanids and Byzantines from the region and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince [[Javanshir]], was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid]]s, [[Sajids]], [[Shaddadid]]s, [[Rawadid]]s and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes from [[Central Asia]]. The first of these Turkic dynasties was the [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]], which entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1030.

The [[turkification]] of the Azeris was not completed until the late 19th century. The old Iranic speakers were to be found solely in tiny isolated recesses of the mountains or other remote areas (such as Harzand, Galin Guya, Shahrud villages in Khalkhal and Anarjan). This [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking population is still known as Azeris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The new Central Asia |last=Roy |first=Olivier |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-eMcn6Ik1v0C&amp;pg=PA7 |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=I.B. Tauris |location= |isbn=978-1-84511-552-4 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally, the possessions of the subsequent [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq Empire]] were ruled by [[Atabegs of Azerbaijan|atabegs]], who were technically vassals of the Seljuq sultans, being sometimes de facto rulers themselves. Under the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], local poets such as [[Nezami|Nizami Ganjavi]] and [[Khaqani|Khagani Shirvani]] gave rise to a blossoming of [[Persian literature]] on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan. The next ruling state of the [[Jalayirids]] was short-lived and fell under the conquests of [[Timur]].

The local dynasty of [[Shirvanshah]]s became a vassal state of [[Timurid dynasty|Timur's Empire]] and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death two independent and rival states emerged: [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]].

After the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] during [[World War I]], Azerbaijan, together with [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] became part of the short-lived [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. When the republic dissolved in May 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence as the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR). The ADR was the first modern [[parliamentary republic]] in the Muslim World.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Swietochowski.

ISBN 978-1-86064-822-9, 9781860648229.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh&quot; /&gt; In this accomplishment, Azerbaijan also preceded the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of [[Baku State University]], which was the first modern-type university founded in Muslim East.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazemzadeh&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kazemzadeh | first = Firuz  | title = The Struggle for Transcaucasia: 1917–1921 | publisher = The New York Philosophical Library | year= 1951 | location = | isbn = 978-0-8305-0076-5 | pages = 124, 222, 229, 269–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack the much-needed Baku. [[Vladimir Lenin]] said that the invasion was justified as [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] could not survive without Baku's [[petroleum|oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Горянин | first = Александр | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Очень черное золото| work = | publisher = GlobalRus| date = August 28, 2003| url = http://www.globalrus.ru/print_this/134413/| doi = | accessdate = August 28, 2003}}{{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Горянин | first = Александр | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =История города Баку.

Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in [[Karabakh]], Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Pope, &quot;Sons of the conquerors: the rise of the Turkic world&quot;, New York: The Overlook Press, 2006, p. 116, ISBN 978-1-58567-804-4&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the [[Treaty of Kars]]. The previously independent Naxicivan SSR would also become autonomous ASSR within Azerbaijan by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] and Turkey agreed to return [[Gyumri]] (then known as Alexandropol).

During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union, with most of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the [[petroleum industry|oil industry]] of Azerbaijan was awarded orders and medals.
[[Operation Edelweiss]] carried out by the German [[Wehrmacht]] targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy ([[petroleum]]) dynamo of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Swietochowski, Tadeusz(1995) ''Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945.

Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani government]] has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan. But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]]. Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory.

Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecology.html |title=Ecological problems in Azerbaijan |publisher=Enrin.grida.no |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over half of Azerbaijan's land mass consists of mountain ridges, crests, [[yaila]]s, and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400–1000&amp;nbsp;meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120&amp;nbsp;meters, and others from 0 – 50&amp;nbsp;meters and up ([[Qobustan, Absheron]]). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consist of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about −28&amp;nbsp;meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466&amp;nbsp;meters (Bazardüzü peak).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecologicalzones.html |title=Orography of Azerbaijan |publisher=Enrin.grida.no |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Climate of Azerbaijan}}
The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold [[arctic]] [[air mass]]es of [[Scandinavia]]n [[anticyclone]], temperate of [[Siberia]]n anticyclone, and [[Central Asia]]n anticyclone.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLIM&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Azerbaijan – Climate| work = | publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| date = | url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Climate/_climate_e.html| doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLIM&quot;/&gt; The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] rates.

9 out of 11 existing [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]] are present in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=&quot;KL&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Climate| work = Water Resources of the Azerbaijan Republic| publisher = Institute of Hydrometeorology, Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources | date = | url = http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html| doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the absolute minimum temperature (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt; {{convert|-33|°C|°F|1|disp=s}} &lt;/span&gt;) and the absolute maximum temperature (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt; {{convert|46|°C|°F|1|disp=s}} &lt;/span&gt;) were observed in [[Julfa Rayon|Julfa]] and [[Ordubad Rayon|Ordubad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KL&quot;/&gt; The maximum annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls in [[Lankaran]] (1,600 to 1,800&amp;nbsp;mm) and the minimum in Absheron (200 to 350&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name=&quot;KL&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Water bodies of Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Lake Khalakhi.jpg|thumb|Lake Khalakhi in the foothills of [[Zaqatala Rayon|Zaqatala]].]]
Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems.

There are 8,359 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Of them 8,188 rivers are less than 25&amp;nbsp;kilometers in length. Only 24 rivers are over 100&amp;nbsp;kilometers long. The [[Kura River|Kura]] and [[Aras River|Aras]] are the most popular rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the [[Kura-Aras Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur-Devechi and Lenkeran lowlands.

From the [[water supply]] point, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;m³/year of water per km².&lt;ref name=&quot;KL&quot;/&gt; All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].

[[File:Quba 452.jpg|thumb|Mountainous countryside of [[Quba Rayon|Quba]].]]
The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in 17th century. Unlike fauna, the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of animals, but also the number of individual species.

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan. The national animal Azerbaijan is the [[Karabakh horse]], a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.o-loshadkah.ru/karabah/ |title=Карабахская порода лошадей |publisher= O-loshadkah.ru |date= |accessdate=}}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. 

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of [[higher plants]]. Due the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Planting/_planting_e.html |title=Azerbaijan - Flora |publisher=Heydar Aliyev Foundation|accessdate=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 67% of the species growing in the whole [[Caucasus]] can be found in Azerbaijan.

The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] on 12 November 1995. According to the Article 23 of Constitution, the [[National symbol|state symbols]] of the Azerbaijan Republic are the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|flag]], the [[Coat of arms of Azerbaijan|coat of arms]] and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan|national anthem]]. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.

The government of Azerbaijan is based on the [[separation of powers]] among the [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The [[New Azerbaijan Party|Yeni Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat. European observers [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Campaign irregularities|found numerous irregularities]] in the run up to the election and [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Election|on election day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Monitors criticise Azeri elections | work = | publisher = [[Al Jazeera]]| date = | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html| doi = | accessdate = November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive power is held by the [[President of Azerbaijan|President]], who is elected for a 5-year term by [[direct election]]s. The president is authorized to form the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], an inferior executive body, subordinated to him. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]], his Deputies and Ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to [[veto]] its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the Constitutional Court, [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]] and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The President nominates the judges in these courts.

The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.

Although Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as &quot;not free&quot; (on border with &quot;partly free&quot;) in [[Freedom House]]'s [[Freedom in the World (report)|Freedom in the World]] 2009 survey.&lt;ref name=&quot;frh&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Combined Average Ratings: Independent Countries 2009 | work = | publisher = FreedomHouse.org| year =2009 | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=475&amp;year=2009| doi = | accessdate = 2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries so far and holds membership in 38 international organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCO&quot;/&gt; It holds observer status in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and [[World Trade Organization]] and is a correspondent at the [[International Telecommunication Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FCO&quot;/&gt; On 9 May 2006 Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established [[Human Rights Council]] by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The term of office began on 19 June 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Un.org&quot;/&gt;

Foreign policy priorities of Azerbaijan include: first of all, the restoration of its territorial integrity; elimination of the consequences of the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh and [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno Karabakh|seven other regions of Azerbaijan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Selim Özertem | first = Hasan | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Independence of Kosovo and the Nagorno-Karabakh Issue | work = | publisher = TurkishWeekly | date = | url = http://www.turkishweekly.net/columnist/2886/independence-of-kosovo-and-the-nagorno-karabakh-issue.html| doi = | accessdate = April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; development of good-neighborly and mutually advantageous relations with neighboring countries; promotion of security and stability in the region; integration into European and Transatlantic security and cooperation structures; and promotion of transregional economic, energy and transportation projects.

The Azerbaijani Government, in late 2007, stated that the long-standing dispute over the Armenian-occupied territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is almost certain to spark a new war if it remains unresolved. The Government is in the process of increasing its military budget. Furthermore, economic sanctions by Turkey to the west and by Azerbaijan itself to the east have combined to greatly erode Armenia's economy, leading to steep increases in prices for basic commodities and a great decline in the Armenian state revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenia opposes Turkish-Azeri railway|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?ots591=4888caa0-b3db-1461-98b9-e20e7b9c13d4&amp;lng=en&amp;id=52072|publisher=ISN Zurich|accessdate=July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism. The country is contributing to peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Azerbaijan is an active member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] program. It also maintains good relations with the [[European Union]] and could potentially one day apply for membership.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan}}
Azerbaijan is divided into 10 economic regions; 66 [[Raion|rayons]] (''rayonlar'', singular ''rayon'') and 77 cities (''şəhərlər'', singular ''şəhər'') of which 11 are under the direct authority of the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azstat.org/statinfo/demoqraphic/en/001_1.shtml |title=The State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Administrative and territorial units of Azerbaijan Republic |publisher=Azstat.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Azerbaijan includes the [[Autonomous Republic]] (''muxtar respublika'') of [[Nakhchivan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; The [[President of Azerbaijan]] appoints the governors of these units, while the government of Nakhchivan is elected and approved by the parliament of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.

Pushed up by spending and demand growth, the 2007 [[First quarter of a calendar year|Q1]] [[inflation]] rate reached 16.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;INF&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Azerbaijan's Q1 inflation rate 16.6%, National Bank Chief says | work = | publisher = Today.az| date = | url = http://www.un-az.org/undp/bulnews48/e3.php| format =| doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominal incomes and monthly wages climbed 29% and 25% respectively against this figure, but price increases in non-oil industry encouraged inflation in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;INF&quot;/&gt; Azerbaijan shows some signs of the so-called &quot;[[Dutch disease]]&quot; because of the fast growing energy sector, which causes inflation and makes non-energy exports more expensive.

In the early years of this century the chronically high inflation was brought under control and this led to the launch of a new currency, the [[Azerbaijani manat|new Azerbaijani manat]], on January 1, 2006, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehdizade|first=Sevinj|title=Azerbaijan's New Manats: Design and Transition to a New Currency|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai143_folder/143_articles/143_manat.html|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ismayilov|first=Rovshan|title=Azerbaijan's Manat Makeover: Good Times Ahead?|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/business/articles/eav030106.shtml|publisher=Eurasianet.org|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as one of the top 10 reformers by the [[World Bank]]'s [[Doing Business Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/Features/Feature-2008-21.aspx |title=Top 10 reformers from Doing Business 2009 |accessdate=2008-09-28 |author=World Bank Group |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Azerbaijan led the world as the top reformer in 2007/08, with improvements on seven out of 10 indicators of regulatory reform. Azerbaijan started operating a one-stop shop in January 2008 that halved the time, cost and number of procedures to start a business. Business registrations increased by 40% in the first six months. Azerbaijan also eliminated the minimum loan cutoff of $1,100, more than doubling the number of borrowers covered by the credit registry. Also, taxpayers can now file forms and pay their taxes online. Azerbaijan’s extensive reforms moved it far up the ranks, from 97 to 33 in the overall ease of doing business.}}

Azerbaijan is also ranked 57th in the [[Global Competitiveness Report]] for 2010–2011, which is above other CIS countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2010-11.pdf |title=World Economic Forum - The Global Competitiveness Report 2010-2011 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking===
[[File:Azeri Square.JPG|thumb|left|The Central Bank building in downtown Baku.]]
The [[Economic growth|GDP growth rates]] observed in Azerbaijan during last years made the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world. But the banking sector of Azerbaijan has yet to tap the vast growth potential that should be achievable due to the continuation of the high economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ bank report&quot; /&gt; For this reason the banking sector remains small in relation to the size of the [[Economy of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani economy]]. Although in the more [[advanced countries]] banking sectors made further visible progress in the catch-up process, the Azerbaijani banking market being in an earlier stage of development, also successes in pushing forward market-oriented reform and the [[privatization]] process.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ bank report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-best-of-both-worlds.com/support-files/azerbaijan-banking-sector-2007.pdf |title=Azerbaijan Banking System: An Overview July 2007 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate= July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Still the banking system is considered an important element of financial system of Azerbaijan.  An advanced two-stepped banking system, which is based on market principles, (the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the first step, in the second one commercial banks and other non-bank credit organizations) functions in the republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ bank&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Azerbaijan – General Information | work = | publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| date = | url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Economy/_BankSystem/_bankSystem_e.html| doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 2002 important stage of [[restructuring]] of banking system started to be carried out. Taking into consideration entry of big oil revenues in the country, as a logical result of successful oil strategy, and in this base, as the banks were ready to an effective transfer of their financial resources to the strategic goals, development strategy was made for 2002-2005. Far-reaching reforms of the banking sector are conducted in the country. The main challenges are due to the slow privatization rate of the state banks, a weak financial market and a lack of bank transparency. However, the reforms have started showing positive resu lts and competition among the leading banks is increasing.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ bank&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =GlobalRating / AzeriRating looks at the state of and development trends in the banking sector in Azerbaijan: | work = | publisher = RusRating | date = | url = http://www.rusrating.ru/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=410&amp;Itemid=31| doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By April 1, 2010, 47 banks, 631 bank branches function in Azerbaijan. One of banks was founded with participation of state capital, 23 of foreign capital. To the same date, 98 non-bank credit organizations operate in the republic along with banks. Growth of real money incomes of population, development of trust in bank system, improving the legal bases of protection of interests of creditors and depositors, in particular launch of ‘Deposits Insurance Fund’ were the criteria characterizing rapid growth of deposits of population. As of April 1, 2010, [[bank deposit]]s of population were equal to 2,4 billion AZN. 33,3% of them were long-term deposits (higher than a year). Along with population, bank deposits of corporative customers increase dynamically. By April 1, 2010, bank deposits of corporative customers is 2,1 bn AZN.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ bank&quot; /&gt; Dynamic development of volume of special and involved funds of the banks has created effective conditions for enlargement of active operations. As of April 1, 2010, the volume of bank assets is 12 bn AZN. Crediting plays special role in structure of bank assets. As of April 1, 2010, bank credits to customers is 8.5 bn AZN, which makes 70.5% of bank assets. Special weight of private sector in structure of credit investments is higher than 82% (7 bn AZN).&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ bank&quot; /&gt;

[[Livestock]], [[dairy product]]s, and [[wine]] and [[spirits]] are also important farm products.

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Shahdag Winter Complex 3.jpg|thumb|right|Shahdag Winter Complex in [[Qusar|Qusar Rayon]].]]
Tourism is an important part of the [[economy of Azerbaijan]]. The country's large abundance of natural and cultural attractions make it an attractive destination of visitors. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s, yet, the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] during the 1990s crippled the tourist industry and damaged the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/162100/|title=Власти Азербайджана обеспокоены состоянием исторических памятников в Нагорном Карабахе|date=November 18, 2009|publisher=''Kavkaz-Uzel''|accessdate=November 18, 2009}} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until [[2000–2009|2000s]] that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/388501.html Azərbaycan Qarabağın turizm imkanlarını təbliğ edir ] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baku Boom Has Yet to Hit Regions&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav081307.shtml|title=Azerbaijan: Baku Boom Has Yet to Hit Regions
|date=August 12, 2007|publisher=''EurAsianet''|accessdate=August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Azerbaijan]] has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination a top priority. It is a national strategy to make tourism a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.az/?menu=1&amp;submenu=12&amp;lang=eng |title=Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan: Goals |publisher=Tourism.az |date=2004-02-06 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities are regulated by the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan]].

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Azerbaijan|Rail transport in Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Baku 9821.JPG|thumb|A vessel on the [[Caspian Sea]].]]
The convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the [[Silk Road]] and the South-North corridor, highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country’s economy. The transport sector in the country includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport.

Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials. The [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]] (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than {{convert|1774|km}} through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to 50&amp;nbsp;million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets.  The [[South Caucasus Pipeline]], also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the [[Shah Deniz gas field]].  Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296&amp;nbsp;billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored [[Silk Road]] Project.

In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions. In the same year, the country became a member of the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cracowrent.pl/uploads/pliki/CP_Vienna_convention.pdf|title= List of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Road Traffic |publisher = UN Economic Commission for Europe|author= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest priority being; upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country, as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.

In 2012, the construction of [[Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway]] expected to provide transportation between [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] through connecting the railways of the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Kazakhstan]] in the east with Turkey's [[Marmaray]] to the European railway system in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baku-Tbilisi-Kars Line, International|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/baku-tbilisi-kars/|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian gauge|Broad gauge]] railways in 2010 stretched for {{convert|2918|km|0|abbr=on}} and [[electrified railway]]s numbered {{convert|1278|km|0|abbr=on}}. By 2010, there were 35 airports and one [[heliport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

==Science and technology==
{{main|Communications in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan National Aerospace Agency}}

The economy of Azerbaijan has been markedly stronger in recent years and, not surprisingly, the country has been making progress in developing its telecoms sector. Nonetheless, it still faces problems. These include poor infrastructure and an immature telecom regulatory regime. The Ministry of Communications &amp; Information Technologies (MCIT), as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom, is both a policy-maker and regulator.

Public pay phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks. Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration. As of 2009, there were 1,397,000 main [[telephone line]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2150rank.html CIA.gov], CIA World Factbook Telephones - main lines in use, Azerbaijan 1,397,000 main lines&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,485,000 internet users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html CIA.gov], CIA World Factbook Internet users, Azerbaijan Internet users: 1,485,000.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three [[GSM]]: Azerfon ([[Nar Mobile]]), [[Bakcell]] and [[Azercell]] [[mobile network operator]]s and one [[CDMA]].

In the 21st century a number of prominent Azerbaijani [[geodynamics]] and [[geotectonics]] scientists, inspired by the fundamental works of [[Elchin Khalilov]] and others, designed hundreds of [[earthquake]] prediction stations and earthquake-resistant buildings that now constitute the bulk of The Republican Center of Seismic Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani scientist invents earthquake-resistant building|url=http://www.news.az/articles/society/33169|publisher=news.az|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Station for the Forecasting of Earthquakes ATROPATENA-AZ3, Baku, Azerbaijan|url=http://seismonet.org/page.html?id_node=190|publisher=Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Азербайджанский ученый изобрел метод оповещения о землетрясении|url=http://www.blackseanews.net/read/14548|publisher=Black Sea News|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000s, the wave of a new oil and gas boom, helped to improve the situation in the Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors, and the government launched a campaign aimed into [[modernization]] and [[innovation]]. Government estimates say, in the future, profits from the [[information technology]] and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan aims for hi-tech state|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/11/26/azerbaijan-aims-for-hi-tech-state/|publisher=[[Euronews]]|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Azerbaijani language}}
[[File:Azerilanguage.png|thumb|Map showing locations of Azerbaijani speakers.]]
The official language is Azerbaijani, which belongs to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[language family]], spoken in southwestern Asia, primarily in Azerbaijan and [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]]. Azerbaijani is member of the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] branch of the Turkic languages and is closely related to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Qashqai language|Qashqai]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]. The Azerbaijani language is divided into two varieties, North Azerbaijani&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 639-3]] azj [[silcode:azj|&quot;Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: azj&quot; SIL International]]&lt;/ref&gt;  and South Azerbaijani,&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 639-3]] azb [[silcode:azb|&quot;Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: azb&quot; SIL International]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a large number of dialects.

Although [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] (also called ''Azeri'') is the most widely spoken language in the country and is spoken by about a quarter of the population of Iran, there are [[Languages of Azerbaijan|13 other languages]] spoken natively in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=AZ |title=Ethnologue report for Azerbaijan |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these languages are very small communities, others are more vital.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, John M., editor. 2002 (vol 1.), 2003 (vol. 2).

The northern variety of the language is written with a [[Azerbaijani alphabet|modified Latin alphabet]] today, but was earlier written in the Perso-Arabic alphabet (until 1929), in the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] (1929–1939), and in the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] (1939–1991).&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, Lynley. 2008.

''International Journal of the Sociology of Language'' 192:105–116.&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in alphabet have been largely molded by religious and political forces.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Azerbaijan}}
A relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ study&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/azerbaijan/23.htm |title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study, Education, Health, and Welfare |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from [[Perso-Arabic script]] to [[Roman alphabet|Roman]] in the 1920s and from Roman to [[Cyrillic]] in the 1930s. According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ study&quot; /&gt; According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]] Report 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan is 99.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Human Development Report 2009 | work = | publisher = United Nations Development Programme 2009| date = | url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf| doi = | accessdate = 2009|format=PDF |archiveurl =  |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since independence, one of the first laws that Azerbaijan's Parliament passed to disassociate itself from the Soviet Union was to adopt a [[Azerbaijani alphabet|modified-Latin alphabet]] to replace Cyrillic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/44_folder/44_articles/44_education.html |title=Education in Azerbaijan, The Challenges of Transition |date= |accessdate= Winter 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than that the Azerbaijani system has undergone little structural change. Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content. In addition to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of [[preschool]]s, general [[secondary schools]], and [[vocational schools]], including specialized secondary schools and technical schools. Education through the eighth grade is compulsory.

The culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences. Today, [[Western world|Western]] influences, including [[globalization|globalized]] [[consumer]] culture, are strong. National traditions are well preserved in the country. Some of the main elements of the Azerbaijani culture are: music, literature, folk dances and art, cuisine, architecture, cinematography and [[Novruz in Azerbaijan|Novruz Bayram]]. The latter is the traditional celebration of the ancient [[New Year]]. Novruz is a family holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=What exactly is Novruz Bayram|periodical=Azerbaijan Today|last=Waters|first=Zena|issue=12|accessdate=2009-03-22|url=http://www.azerbaijantoday.az/ARCHIVE/12/life1.html|month=April–May|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan folk consists of Azerbaijanis, the representative part of society, as well as of nations and ethnic groups, compactly living in various areas of the country. Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the [[Chokha]] and [[Papakhi]]. There are radio broadcasts in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Lezgin language|Lezgin]] and [[Talysh language|Talysh]] languages, which are financed from the state budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIN&quot;/&gt; Some local radio stations in [[Balakən|Balakan]] and [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]] organize broadcasts in [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MIN&quot;/&gt; In Baku several newspapers are published in Russian, Kurdish (''Dengi Kurd''), Lezgin (''Samur'') and Talysh languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIN&quot;/&gt; Jewish society &quot;Sokhnut&quot; publishes the newspaper ''Aziz''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIN&quot;/&gt;

[[Mugham]], [[meykhana]] and ashik art are one of the many musical traditions of Azerbaijan. [[Mugham]] is usually a suite with [[poetry]] and instrumental interludes. When performing Mugam, the singers have to transform their emotions into singing and music.

In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in [[cinematography]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mishon&quot; /&gt; Therefore It's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in [[Baku]] – at the turn of the 19th century, this bay town on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinemainazerbaijan&quot;&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html Celebrating 100 Years in Film, not 80] by Aydin Kazimzade.

This also influenced the creation of [[Azerbaijani animation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ocaz&quot; /&gt;

In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming August 2 professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;mishon&quot; /&gt;

There are 3 state-owned television channels: [[AzTV]], [[Idman Azerbaijan TV|Idman TV]] and [[Medeniyyet TV]]. One public channel, [[İctimai Television|Ictimai TV]] and 7 private channels: [[ANS TV]], [[Space TV]], [[Lider TV]], [[Azad Azerbaijan TV]], [[Xazar TV]], [[Azad Azerbaijan International Televiziyası|Azerbaijan International]] and [[MTV Azerbaijan]].

===Folk art===
{{Main|Azerbaijani folk art}}
Azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is [[decorative art|decorative]] and [[applied art]]. This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.

The [[Azerbaijani rug|Azerbaijani carpet]] is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan’s many carpet-making regions. In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00389 |title=The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=134436 |title=Azerbaijani carpet entered UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage |publisher=En.apa.az |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. The true scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of [[Latif Kerimov]], a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura | work = | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | date = | url = http://portal.unesco.org/es/ev.php-URL_ID=31108&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html| doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Azerbaijani cuisine}}
The traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes. Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table. Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the [[Caspian Sea]], local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens. Saffron-rice [[plov]] is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and [[black tea]] is the national beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Akhmedov| first = IA| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Азербайджанская кухня | work = | publisher = Издательство &quot;Ишыг&quot;| date = | url = http://www.azeri.ru/az/cuisine/azerbaydjanskaya_kuhnya| doi = | accessdate = }}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acclaimed [[Book of Dede Korkut]] consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meeker&quot;&gt;Michael E. Meeker, “The Dede Korkut Ethic”, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug., 1992), 395-417. excerpt: The Book of Dede Korkut is an early record of oral Turkic folktales in Anatolia, and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves “Turcoman” rather than “Oghuz,” had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.&lt;/ref&gt; was not written earlier than the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kafadar&quot;&gt;Cemal Kafadar(1995), “in Between Two Worlds: Construction of the Ottoman states”, University of California Press, 1995. Excerpt: &quot;It was not earlier than the fifteenth century. Based on the fact that the author is buttering up both the Akkoyunlu and Ottoman rulers, it has been suggested that the composition belongs to someone living in the undefined border region lands between the two states during the reign of Uzun Hassan (1466-78). G. Lewis on the hand dates the composition “fairly early in the 15th century at least”.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IranicaOguzKhan&quot;&gt;İlker Evrım Bınbaş,Encyclopaedia Iranica, &quot;Oguz Khan Narratives&quot; [http://www.iranica.com/articles/oguz-khan-narratives Encyclopædia Iranica | Articles], accessed October, 2010.  &quot;The Ketāb-e Dede Qorqut, which is a collection of twelve stories reflecting the oral traditions of the Turkmens in the 15th-century eastern Anatolia, is also called Oḡuz-nāma&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a collection of 12 stories reflecting the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads.&lt;ref name=&quot;IranicaOguzKhan&quot;/&gt;  Since the author is buttering up both the Akkoyunlu and Ottoman rulers, it has been suggested that the composition belongs to someone living between the Akkoyunlu and Ottoman empires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kafadar&quot;/&gt; The 16th century poet, Muhammed Fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical ''Qazals'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Azeri language|Azeri]]. Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include ''The Divan of Ghazals'' and ''The Qasidas''. In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of [[Ashik]] ({{lang-az|Aşıq}}) poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of Khatāī ({{lang-ar|خطائی}} for ''sinner'') [[Shah Ismail I]] wrote about 1400 verses in Azeri,&lt;ref name=&quot;minorsky1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Vladimir |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1942 |month= |title=The Poetry of Shah Ismail |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=10 |issue=4 |page=1053 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were later published as his ''Divan''. A unique literary style known as ''qoshma'' ({{lang-az|qoşma}} for ''improvization'') was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah [[Tahmasp I]].

In the span of the 17th century and 18th century, Fizuli's unique genres as well [[Ashik]]  poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as [[Qovsi of Tabriz]], [[Abbas II of Persia|Shah Abbas Sani]], [[Agha Mesih Shirvani]], [[Nishat]], [[Molla Vali Vidadi]], [[Molla Panah Vagif]], [[Amani (poet)|Amani]], [[Zafar (poet)|Zafar]] and others. Along with [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Turkmens]] and [[Uzbeks]], [[Azeris]] also celebrate the [[Epic of Koroglu]] (from {{lang-az|kor oğlu}} for ''blind man's son''), a legendary folk hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;samuel&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Tantra and Popular Religion in Tibet |last=Samuel |first=Geoffrey |authorlink= |coauthors=Gregor, Hamish; Stutchbury, Elisabeth |year=1994 |publisher=International Academy of Indian Culture and Aditya Prakashan |location= |isbn=978-81-85689-68-5 |page=60 |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=n74KAAAAYAAJ&amp;ei=rqeOR8PfLIa8iQHa1NSYBw&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several documented versions of Koroglu epic remain at the Institute for Manuscripts of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;caferoglu&quot;/&gt;

Modern literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iran it is based on the Tabrizi one. The first newspaper in Azerbaijani, ''[[Akinchi]]'' was published in 1875. In mid-19th century it was taught in the schools of [[Baku]], [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]], [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Tbilisi]], and [[Yerevan]]. Since 1845, it has also been taught in the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] in [[Russia]].

[[File:Firtina face.jpg|left|thumb|[[Khazar Lankaran]] fans during a football match.]]
Sport in Azerbaijan has ancient roots, and even now, both traditional and modern sports are still practiced. [[Freestyle wrestling]] has been traditionally regarded as Azerbaijan's [[national sport]], however today, the most popular sports in Azerbaijan are [[association football|football]] and [[chess]]. The [[Azerbaijan national football team|national football team]] of Azerbaijan demonstrates relatively low performance in the international arena compared to the nation football clubs. It is mainly because of the foreign footballers playing in the clubs. However, the newly opened [[Azerbaijan Football Academy]] in February 2009 is a huge step in the development of the youth football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.football-plus.az/view_post.php?id=163 Azərbaycanda ilk futbol akademiyası istifadəyə verildi]{{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most successful Azerbaijani football clubs are [[Neftchi Baku]], [[FK Baku]], [[Inter Baku]], [[FK Qarabağ|FK Karabakh]] and [[Khazar Lankaran]].
On March 19, 2010, Azerbaijan won the bid to host the [[2012 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/media/newsid=1183198.html#fifa+executive+committee+approves+special+funding+chile+haiti |publisher= FIFA.com |title=FIFA Executive Committee approves special funding for Chile and Haiti |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amateur astronomy''', also called '''backyard astronomy''' and '''stargazing''', is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the night sky (and the day sky too, for [[sunspots]], [[eclipses]], etc.), and the plethora of objects found in it, mainly with portable telescopes and binoculars. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets.

== Overview ==

The typical amateur astronomer is one who does not depend on the field of astronomy as a primary source of [[income]] or support, and does not have a [[professional degree]] or advanced academic training in the subject.  Many amateurs are beginners or [[hobby]]ists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and often assist and work alongside professional astronomers.

Amateur astronomy is usually associated with viewing the [[night sky]] when most celestial objects and events are visible, but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as [[sunspot]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.  Amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes, but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable [[optical telescope|telescopes]] and [[binoculars]].

People have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework, without any formal method of funding.  It is only within about the past century, however, that amateur astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from professional astronomy, and other related activities.

== Amateur astronomy objectives ==

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and [[phenomenon|phenomena]].  Common targets of amateur astronomers include the [[Moon]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, [[comet]]s, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep sky object]]s such as [[star cluster]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], and [[nebula]]e.  Many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.  One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky.  Astrophotography has become more popular for amateurs in recent times, as relatively sophisticated equipment, such as high quality [[CCD camera]]s, has become more affordable.

Most amateurs work at [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]], but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum.  An early pioneer of [[radio astronomy]] was [[Grote Reber]], an  amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built [[radio telescope]] in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of [[radio frequency|radio wavelength]] emissions from space by [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]].  Non-visual amateur astronomy includes the use of [[infrared filter]]s on conventional telescopes, and also the use of [[radio telescope]]s.  Some amateur astronomers use home-made radio telescopes, while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomy research but have since been made available for use by amateurs.  The [[One-Mile Telescope]] is one such example.

== Common tools ==

Amateur astronomers use a range of instruments to study the [[sky]], depending on a combination of their interests and resources.  Methods include simply looking at the night sky with the [[naked eye]], using [[binoculars]], and using a variety of [[optical telescope]]s of varying power and quality, as well as additional sophisticated equipment, such as [[camera]]s, to study light from the sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the [[spectrum]].  Commercial telescopes are available new and used, but in some places it is also common for amateur astronomers to build (or commission the building of) their own [[customization|custom]] telescope.  Some people even focus on [[amateur telescope making]] as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy.

Although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time, relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks.  Binoculars, for instance, although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes, also tend to provide a wider [[field of view]], which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky.

Amateur astronomers also use [[star charts]] that, depending on experience and intentions, may range from simple [[planisphere]]s through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky.  A range of [[astronomy software]] is available and used by amateur astronomers, including software that generates maps of the sky, software to assist with astrophotography, observation scheduling software, and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena.

Amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations, which usually takes the form of an [[astronomical observing log|observing log]].  Observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when, as well as describing the details that were seen.  Sketching is sometimes used within logs, and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times.

The Internet is an essential tool of amateur astronomers. Almost all astronomy clubs, even those with very few members, have a web site. The popularity of CCD imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment. Much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups. Discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists. A great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy, the buying and selling of equipment, occurs online. Many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions using tools such as the [[Clear Sky Chart]].

== Common techniques ==
While a number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye, sometimes with the aid of a star chart, many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them. Many methods are used in amateur astronomy, but most are variations of a few specific techniques.

=== Star hopping ===
{{Main|Star hopping}}
'''Star hopping''' is a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope.  It involves the use of maps (or memory) to locate known [[landmark]] stars, and &quot;hopping&quot; between them, often with the aid of a [[finderscope]].  Because of its [[simplicity]], star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked-eye stars.

More advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include [[telescope mount]]s with ''setting circles'', which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest, and ''GOTO telescopes'', which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand (having first been [[calibration|calibrated]]).

=== Setting circles ===
{{Main|Setting circles}}
'''Setting circles''' are [[angular measurement]] scales that can be placed on the two main [[rotation axis|rotation axes]] of some telescopes.  Since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles, any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an &quot;analog setting circle&quot; (ASC).  By knowing the [[coordinate]]s of an object (usually given in [[equatorial coordinates]]), the telescope user can use the setting circle to align the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its [[eyepiece]].  A computerized setting circle is called a &quot;digital setting circle&quot; (DSC).  Although digital setting circles can be used to display a telescope's [[right ascension|RA]] and [[declination|Dec]] coordinates, they are not simply a digital [[read-out]] of what can be seen on the telescope's analog setting circles.  As with go-to telescopes, digital setting circle computers (commercial names include Argo Navis, Sky Commander, and NGC Max) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions.

To find an object, such as globular cluster [[NGC 6712]], one does not need to look up the RA and Dec coordinates in a book, and then move the telescope to those numerical readings.  Rather, the object is chosen from the database and arrow markers appear in the display which indicate the direction to move the telescope.  The telescope is moved until the distance value reaches zero.  When both the RA and Dec axes are thus &quot;zeroed out&quot;, the object should be in the eyepiece. The user therefore does not have to go back and forth from some other database (such as a book or laptop) to match the desired object's listed coordinates to the coordinates on the telescope.  However, many DSCs, and also go-to systems, can work in conjunction with laptop sky programs.

Computerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession. Traditional printed sources are subtitled by the ''epoch'' year, which refers to the positions of celestial objects at a given time to the nearest year (e.g., [[J2005]], [[J2007]]).  Most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years (e.g., [[J1900]], [[J1950]], [[J2000]]).  Computerized sources, on the other hand, are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the &quot;epoch of date&quot; to the exact instant of observation.

===GoTo telescopes===
{{Main|GoTo (telescopes)}}
'''GOTO telescopes''' have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced.  With these computer-driven telescopes, the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically.  They have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on [[research]].  For example, GOTO telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping, allowing more time for studying of the object.  GOTO also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth telescope mounts, allowing them to produce an over all less expensive product. GOTO telescopes usulally have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurte tracking and positioning. However, several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built in GPS, decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observaing session.

===Remote Control telescopes===
With the development of fast Internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and CCD cameras 'Remote Telescope' astronomy is now a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging. This enables anyone to control a telescope a large distance away in a dark location. The observers can image through the telescopes using CCD cameras. The digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the Internet. An example of a digital remote telescope operation for public use via the Internet is the [[Bareket observatory|The Bareket Observatory]].

=== Imaging techniques ===
Amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including [[film]] and [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[astrophotography]]. Because CCD imagers are linear, [[image processing]] may be used to subtract away the effects of light pollution, which has increased the popularity of astrophotography in urban areas{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

== Scientific research ==

[[Scientific method|Scientific research]] is most often not the ''main'' goal for many amateur astronomers, unlike professional astronomy.  Work of scientific merit is possible, however, and many amateurs successfully contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers.  Astronomy is sometimes promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data.  To recognize this, the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] annually gives [[Amateur Achievement Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific|Amateur Achievement Awards]] for significant contributions to astronomy by amateurs.

The majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection.  In particular, this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers.  Several organizations, such as the [http://cbastro.org Center for Backyard Astrophysics], exist to help coordinate these contributions.

Amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of [[variable star]]s and [[supernovae]], helping to track [[asteroid]]s, and observing [[occultation]]s to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the [[Moon]] as seen from Earth. With more advanced equipment, but still cheap in comparison to professional setups, amateur astronomers can measure the light spectrum emitted from astronomical objects, which can yield high-quality scientific data if the measurements are performed with due care.  A relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked phenomena (e.g., [[Kreutz Sungrazers]]) in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by Earth and space based observatories, much of which is available over the Internet.

In the past and present, amateur astronomers have played a major role in discovering new [[comet]]s.  Recently however, funding of projects such as the [[LINEAR|Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] and [[Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]] projects has meant that ''most'' comets are now discovered by automated systems, long before it is possible for amateurs to see them.

== Societies ==

There is a large number of amateur [[astronomical society|astronomical societies]] around the world that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy, whether they be people who are actively interested in observing or &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; who may simply be interested in the topic.  Societies range widely in their goals, depending on a variety of factors such as geographic spread, local circumstances, size, and membership.  For instance, a local society in the middle of a large city may have regular meetings with speakers, focusing less on observing the night sky if the membership is less able to observe due to factors such as [[light pollution]].

It is common for local societies to hold regular meetings, which may include activities such as [[star party|star parties]] or presentations.  Societies are also a meeting point for people with particular interests, such as [[amateur telescope making]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury.

Aikido is performed by blending with the motion of the attacker and redirecting the force of the attack rather than opposing it head-on. This requires very little physical strength, as the ''[[List of aikidoka|aikidōka]]'' (aikido practitioner) &quot;leads&quot; the attacker's [[momentum]] using entering and turning movements. The techniques are completed with various [[throw (grappling)|throws]] or [[joint locks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aikido&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aikido can be categorized under the general umbrella of [[grappling]] arts.

Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of [[Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu]], but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the [[Oomoto|Ōmoto-kyō]] religion. Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term ''aiki-jūjutsu''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pranin-Aikijujutsu&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending on when they studied with him. Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques learned from Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.

==Etymology and basic philosophy==
[[File:Aikido Kanji.png|thumb|80px|&quot;Aikido&quot; written with &quot;[[Qi|ki]]&quot; in its  [[Kyūjitai|old character form]] ]]

The word &quot;aikido&quot; is formed of three [[kanji]]:
* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:合|合]]}} - ''ai'' - joining, unifying, combining, fit
* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:気|気]]}} - ''ki'' - spirit, energy, mood, morale
* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:道|道]]}} - ''dō'' - way, path

The term 'aiki' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of Budo. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.
合 is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being 合同 (combined/united), 合成 (composition), 結合 (unite/combine/join together), 連合 (union/alliance/association), 統合 (combine/unify), and 合意 (mutual agreement). There is also  an idea of [[reciprocity]], 知り合う (to get to know one another), 話し合い (talk/discussion/negotiation), and 待ち合わせる (meet by appointment).

気 is often used to express a feeling, as in 気がする('I feel', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), 気持ち (feeling/sensation), and 気分(mood/morale). It also is used to mean energy or force, as in 電気(electricity) and 磁気 (magnetism).

The term {{transl|ja|dō}} connects the practice of aikido with the philosophical concept of ''[[Tao]]'', which can be found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, and in the more peaceful arts such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shodō}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kadō}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chadō or sadō}}).

Therefore, from a purely linguistic point of view, we could say Aikido is 'Way of combining forces'. The term {{transl|ja|[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]}} refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.
This then is very similar to the principles expressed by [[Jigoro Kano]], founder of [[Judo]].

==History==
[[File:Morihei-Ueshiba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Morihei Ueshiba]], founder of aikido.]]Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|植芝 盛平}} {{transl|ja|''Ueshiba Morihei''}}, 14 December 1883–26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''[[Ōsensei]]''}} (&quot;Great Teacher&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but also an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation. During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the [[Aiki]] that Ueshiba studied into a wide variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aikido&quot;/&gt;

===Initial development===
[[File:Takeda Sokaku.jpg|thumb|right|Takeda Sokaku]]
Ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWH&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core martial art from which aikido derives is [[Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu|Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu]], which Ueshiba studied directly with [[Takeda Sokaku]], the reviver of that art. Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied [[Tenjin Shinyo Ryu|Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū]] with Tozawa Tokusaburō in [[Tokyo]] in 1901, [[Yagyū Shingan-ryū|Gotōha Yagyū Shingan-ryū]] under Nakai Masakatsu in [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]] from 1903 to 1908, and [[judo]] with Kiyoichi Takagi ({{lang|ja|高木 喜代子}} {{transl|ja|''Takagi Kiyoichi''}}, 1894–1972) in [[Tanabe]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=723
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of Daitō-ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido. Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the [[spear]] ({{transl|ja|''[[yari]]''}}), short [[staff (stick)|staff]] ({{transl|ja|''[[jō]]''}}), and perhaps the {{Nihongo|[[bayonet]]|銃剣|jūken}}. However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ({{transl|ja|''[[kenjutsu]]''}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt;

Ueshiba moved to [[Hokkaidō]] in 1912, and began studying under Takeda Sokaku in 1915. His official association with Daitō-ryū continued until 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWH&quot;/&gt; However, during the latter part of that period, Ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from Takeda and the Daitō-ryū. At that time Ueshiba was referring to his martial art as '''&quot;Aiki Budō&quot;'''. It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name &quot;aikido&quot;, but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aikido&quot;/&gt;

===Religious influences===
[[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|right|Onisaburo Deguchi]]
After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|Ōmoto-kyō]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

| first = Stanley
| title = Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi
| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido
| date =
| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73
}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist. As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students. Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.&lt;ref name=&quot;Styles&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===International dissemination===
Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] with a visit to [[France]] where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mochizuki&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by [[Tadashi Abe]] in 1952 who came as the official [[Aikikai Hombu]] representative, remaining in France for seven years. [[Kenji Tomiki]] toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the [[United States]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Styles&quot;/&gt; Later in that year, [[Koichi Tohei]] was sent by Aikikai Hombu to [[Hawaii]], for a full year, where he set up several [[dojo]]. This was followed up by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The [[United Kingdom]] followed in 1955; [[Italy]] in 1964; and [[Germany]] 1965. Designated &quot;Official Delegate for Europe and Africa&quot; by Morihei Ueshiba, [[Masamichi Noro]] arrived in France in September 1961. [[Seiichi Sugano]] was appointed to introduce aikido to [[Australia]] in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo available throughout the world. Aikido was exhibited in [[Hollywood films]] by [[Steven Seagal]] in the 1990s.

===Proliferation of independent organizations===
{{see|Aikido styles}}
{{see also|List of aikidoka|l1=List of aikidōka}}

The largest aikido organisation is the [[Aikikai Foundation]] which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Styles&quot;/&gt;

The earliest independent styles to emerge were [[Yoseikan Aikido]], begun by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] in 1931,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mochizuki&quot;/&gt; [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido founded by [[Gozo Shioda]] in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shodokan Aikido]], founded by [[Kenji Tomiki]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACE&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-9647083-2-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.&lt;ref name=&quot;Styles&quot;/&gt;

After Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]] , who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization which governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenkyūkai'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

| first = Stanley
| title = Tohei, Koichi
| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido
| year = 2006
| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]], and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the &quot;[[Iwama style]]&quot;, and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups; one remaining with the Aikikai and the other forming the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].

Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|本部道場|honbu dōjō}} in Japan, and have an international breadth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Styles&quot;/&gt;

==Training==
In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and [[conditioning]], as well as specific techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFL&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| first = Gaku

| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of [[throw (grappling)|throws]], the first thing most students learn is how to safely fall or roll.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFL&quot;/&gt; The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and [[grappling hold#Pinning hold|pins]]. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and in certain styles, techniques with weapons.

===Fitness===
[[File:Aïkido-shihoo nage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Uke (martial arts)|Ukemi]] (受け身) are very important for safe practice]]
Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[endurance]], with less emphasis on [[strength training]]. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.&lt;ref name =&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt;

Certain [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic fitness activities]], such as [[weight training]], emphasize contracting movements. In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, and power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to [[yoga]] or [[pilates]]. For example, many dojos begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|準備体操|junbi taisō}}, which may include [[stretching]] and [[Uke (martial arts)|ukemi]] (break falls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles of ''uke'' and ''nage''===
Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the 取り ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or ''shite'' {{lang|ja|仕手}} (depending on aikido style), also referred to as {{lang|ja|投げ}} ''nage'' (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.&lt;ref name=&quot;afl2&quot;/&gt;

Both halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''nage'', are considered essential to aikido training.&lt;ref name=&quot;afl2&quot;/&gt; Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. ''Nage'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''nage'' places them. This &quot;receiving&quot; of the technique is called ''ukemi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;afl2&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| last = Homma | first = Gaku
| title = Aikido for Life
| publisher = North Atlantic Books
| year = 1990 | pages = 20–30
| location = Berkeley, California
| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''nage'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|返し技|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''nage''.

{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|受身}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment - it is an active rather than a passive receiving of Aikido. The fall itself is part of Aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, what would otherwise be a devastating strike or throw and return to a vertical position in one fluid movement. Thus the concept of a &quot;breakfall&quot;, common to other martial arts, is out of place in Aikido, as a fall in Aikido is not broken, but chosen by the receiver.

===Initial attacks===
Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack; therefore, to practice aikido with their partner, students must learn to deliver various types of attacks. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, &quot;honest&quot; attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt;

Many of the {{Nihongo|strikes|打ち|uchi}} of aikido are often said to resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicates its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt; Other techniques, which appear to explicitly be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are also practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic strikes include:
* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|正面打ち|shōmen'uchi}} a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].
* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|横面打ち|yokomen'uchi}} a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.
* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|胸突き|mune-tsuki}} a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]]. Same as {{Nihongo|&quot;middle-level thrust&quot;|中段突き|chūdan-tsuki}}, and {{Nihongo|&quot;direct thrust&quot;|直突き|[[choku-tsuki]]}}.
* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|顔面突き|ganmen-tsuki}} a punch to the [[face]]. Same as {{Nihongo|&quot;upper-level thrust&quot;|上段突き|jōdan-tsuki}}.

Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]]; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt; The following are examples of some basic grabs:
* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|片手取り|katate-dori}} one hand grabs one wrist.
* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|諸手取り|morote-dori}} both hands grab one wrist. Same as {{Nihongo|&quot;single hand double-handed grab&quot;|片手両手取り|katateryōte-dori}}
* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|両手取り|ryōte-dori}} both hands grab both wrists. Same as {{Nihongo|&quot;double single-handed grab&quot;|両片手取り|ryōkatate-dori}}.
* {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|肩取り|kata-dori}} a shoulder grab. &quot;Both-shoulders-grab&quot; is {{Nihongo|''ryōkata-dori''|両肩取り}}. It is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab face strike'''|肩取り面打ち|kata-dori men-uchi}}.
* {{Nihongo|'''Chest grab'''|胸取り|mune-dori or muna-dori}} grabbing the (clothing of the) chest. Same as {{Nihongo|&quot;collar grab&quot;|襟取り|eri-dori}}.

===Basic techniques===
[[File:aikido ikkyo.png|right|thumb|Diagram of ''ikkyō'', or &quot;first technique&quot;. ''Yonkyō'' has a similar mechanism of action, although the upper hand grips the forearm rather than the elbow.]]
The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* {{Nihongo|'''Second technique'''|二教|nikyō}} a [[Wristlock#Pronating wristlock|pronating wristlock]] that torques the arm and applies painful nerve pressure. (There is an [[Wristlock#Adductive wristlock|adductive wristlock]] or Z-lock in ''ura'' version.)
* {{Nihongo|'''Third technique'''|三教|sankyō}} a [[Wristlock#Rotational wristlock|rotational wristlock]] that directs upward-spiraling tension throughout the arm, elbow and shoulder.
* {{Nihongo|'''Fourth technique'''|四教|yonkyō}} a shoulder control similar to ''ikkyō'', but with both hands gripping the forearm. The knuckles (from the palm side) are applied to the recipient's [[radial nerve]] against the [[periosteum]] of the forearm bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

* {{Nihongo|'''Fifth technique'''|五教|gokyō}} visually similar to ''ikkyō'', but with an inverted grip of the wrist, [[medial rotation]] of the arm and shoulder, and downward pressure on the elbow. Common in [[knife]] and other weapon take-aways.
* {{Nihongo|'''Four-direction throw'''|四方投げ|shihōnage}} The hand is folded back past the shoulder, locking the shoulder joint.
* {{Nihongo|'''Forearm return'''|小手返し|kotegaeshi}} a [[Wristlock#Supinating wristlock|supinating]] wristlock-throw that stretches the [[extensor digitorum]].

* {{Nihongo|'''Entering throw'''|入身投げ|iriminage}} throws in which ''nage'' moves through the space occupied by ''uke''. The classic form superficially resembles a &quot;clothesline&quot; technique.
* {{Nihongo|'''Heaven-and-earth throw'''|天地投げ|tenchinage}} beginning with ''ryōte-dori''; moving forward, ''nage'' sweeps one hand low (&quot;earth&quot;) and the other high (&quot;heaven&quot;), which unbalances ''uke'' so that he or she easily topples over.
* {{Nihongo|'''Hip throw'''|腰投げ|koshinage}} aikido's version of the [[throw (grappling)#Hip throws|hip throw]]. ''Nage'' drops his or her hips lower than those of ''uke'', then flips ''uke'' over the resultant [[Lever|fulcrum]].
* {{Nihongo|'''Figure-ten throw'''|十字投げ|jūjinage}} or {{Nihongo|'''figure-ten entanglement'''|十字絡み|jūjigarami}} a throw that locks the arms against each other (The [[kanji]] for &quot;10&quot; is a cross-shape: 十).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Aikido makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend with ''uke''. For example, an &quot;entering&quot; (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|&quot;turning&quot;|転換|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, an {{Nihongo|&quot;inside&quot;|内|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|&quot;outside&quot;|外|soto}} technique takes place to his side; a {{Nihongo|&quot;front&quot;|表|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|&quot;rear&quot;|裏|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''nage'' are sitting are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''nage'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dynamic&quot;/&gt;

Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations. For instance, ''ikkyō'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula &quot;attack-technique(-modifier)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;term&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ''katate-dori ikkyō'' refers to any ''ikkyō'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikkyō omote'', referring to any forward-moving ''ikkyō'' technique from that grab.

''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|当て身}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against &quot;[[pressure point|vital points]]&quot; meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|Gōzō Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shugyo&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques. A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration. The target may also become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.&lt;ref name=&quot;dynamic&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Many sayings about ''atemi'' are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Weapons===
[[File:PRehse002-cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Disarming an attacker using a {{Nihongo|&quot;sword taking&quot;|太刀取り|tachi-dori}} technique.]]

Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff (''[[jō]]''), wooden sword (''[[bokken]]''), and knife (''[[tantō]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some schools also incorporate firearm-disarming techniques. Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are sometimes taught, to integrate armed and unarmed aspects, although some schools of aikido do not train with weapons at all. Others, such as the [[Iwama style]] of [[Morihiro Saito]], usually spend substantial time with ''bokken'' and ''jō'', practised under the names ''[[aiki-ken]]'', and ''[[aiki-jō]]'', respectively. The founder developed much of empty handed aikido from traditional sword and spear movements, so the practice of these movements is generally for the purpose of giving insight into the origin of techniques and movements, as well as vital practice of these basic building blocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOS&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Multiple attackers and ''randori''===
[[File:Embukai01.jpg|left|thumb|Technique performed against two attackers.]] &lt;!-- this image is above related paragraph to improve page rendering --&gt;

One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called ''taninzudori'', or ''taninzugake''. Freestyle (''[[randori]]'', or ''jiyūwaza'') practice with multiple attackers is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks.&lt;ref name=&quot;best&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Randori'' exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;best&quot;/&gt; Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in ''randori'' training. For instance, an ''ura'' technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.&lt;ref name =&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt;

In [[Shodokan Aikido]], ''randori'' differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will. In this respect it resembles judo ''randori''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACE&quot;/&gt;

===Injuries===
In applying a technique during training, it is the responsibility of ''nage'' to prevent injury to ''uke'' by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in ''ukemi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;afl2&quot;/&gt; Injuries (especially those to the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of ''nage'' misjudging the ability of ''uke'' to receive the throw or pin.&lt;ref name =&quot;Aikinjuries&quot;&gt;Aikido and injuries: special report by [[Fumiaki Shishida]] Aiki News 1989;80 (April); partial English translation of article re-printed in Aikido Journal [http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Aikinjuries2&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that while the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other, the differences in overall rates of injury were much less pronounced. Soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido, and a few deaths from repetitive &quot;''shihōnage''&quot; in a [[Senpai and kōhai|Japanese-style]] [[hazing]] context have been reported.&lt;ref name =&quot;Aikinjuries&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Aikinjuries2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Criticisms==
The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training. The attacks initiated by ''uke'' (and which ''nage'' must defend against) have been criticized as being &quot;weak,&quot; &quot;sloppy,&quot; and &quot;little more than caricatures of an attack.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pranin-aikido today&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Weak attacks from ''uke'' cause a conditioned response from ''nage'', and result in underdevelopment of the strength and conditioning needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pranin-aikido today&quot;/&gt; To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. [[Shodokan Aikido]] addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACE&quot;/&gt; Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defence or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another criticism is that after the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid 1950s, he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by ''nage'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''nage'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the practice of weapons, were all deemphasized or eliminated from practice. Lack of training in these areas is thought to lead to an overall loss of effectiveness by some aikido practitioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pranin-status quo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, there are some who criticize aikido practitioners for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba. The premise of this criticism is that &quot;O-Sensei’s aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shibata-Dilemma&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Shibata

| accessdate = 2007-12-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional [[jujutsu]] or ''[[kenjutsu]]'' are diverging from what Ueshiba taught. Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that &quot;[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality was the fundamentals [''sic''] of the paradigm that he demonstrated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shibata-Dilemma&quot;/&gt;

==Ki==
[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|float|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[Tōyō kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:気|気]]}}.]]

The study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is a critical component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;mental&quot; training, as it encompasses both. The original ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' was {{lang|ja|氣}}, and is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice; the &quot;nourishing vapors&quot; contained within are ''ki''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = Literati Tradition
| url = http://www.literati-tradition.com/qi_breath.html
| accessdate = 2007-02-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character for ''ki'' is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|&quot;health&quot;|元気|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|&quot;shyness&quot;|内気|uchiki}}. ''Ki'' is most often understood as unified physical and mental intention, however in traditional martial arts it is often discussed as &quot;life energy&quot;. [[Gōzō Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the &quot;hard styles,&quot; largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before [[World War II]], and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shugyo&quot;/&gt; In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This was his [[Takemusu]] Aiki and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'' with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Uniforms and ranking==
[[File:Folding hakama.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A [[hakama]] must be folded after practice]]
Aikido practitioners (commonly called ''aikidōka'' outside of Japan) generally progress by promotion through a series of &quot;grades&quot; (''[[kyū]]''), followed by a series of &quot;degrees&quot; (''[[dan (rank)|dan]]''), pursuant to formal testing procedures. Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish lower and higher grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt; Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a ''dan'' rank unless they are 16 or older.

{| class=wikitable align=left

|-
| ''dan'' || [[File:Ceinture noire.png|55px]] || black || ''yūdansha''
|}

The uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikidōgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick (&quot;[[judo]]-style&quot;), and thin (&quot;[[karate]]-style&quot;) cotton tops are used.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt; Aikido-specific tops are also available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.

Most aikido systems also add a pair of wide pleated black or [[indigo]] trousers called a ''[[hakama]]''. In many styles, its use is reserved for practitioners with (''dan'') ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners or female practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Art-portrait-collage 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Clockwise from upper left: A [[self-portrait]] from [[Vincent van Gogh]], an African [[Chokwe]]-statue, detail from the ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]] and a Japanese [[Shisa|Shisa lion]].]]
'''Art''' is the product or process of deliberately arranging items (often with [[symbol]]ic significance) in a way that influences and affects one or more of the [[senses]], [[emotions]], and [[intellect]]. 
It encompasses a diverse range of human activities, creations, and modes of expression, including [[music]], [[literature]], [[film]], [[photography]], [[sculpture]], and [[paintings]]. The meaning of art is explored in a branch of [[philosophy]] known as [[aesthetics]], and even disciplines such as [[history]] and [[psychology]] analyze its relationship with humans and generations.

Traditionally, the term ''art'' was used to refer to any skill or mastery. This conception changed during the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period, when art came to be seen as &quot;a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=2008-11-18 |year=2005 |work=The Gombrich Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, art is made with the intention of stimulating thoughts and emotions.

== Evaluation ==

Philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Moral realism|realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, op. cit. Essay VI. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt; An object may be characterized by the intentions, or lack thereof, of its creator, regardless of its apparent purpose. A cup, which ostensibly can be used as a container, may be considered art if intended solely as an ornament, while a painting may be deemed craft if mass-produced.

The nature of art has been described by Wollheim as &quot;one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p.1, 2nd edn, 1980, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521297060&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name=Levinson5&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford university Press, 2003, p5. ISBN 0-1992-7945-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford university Press, 2003, p16. ISBN 0-1992-7945-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]]. Art as ''mimesis'' or representation has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], &quot;The Origin of the Work of Art&quot;, in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perenniel, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], &quot;Cézanne's Doubt&quot; in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Encyclopædia Britannica#Optical disc, online, and mobile versions|Britannica Online]] defines ''art'' as &quot;the use of skill and imagination in the creation of aesthetic objects, environments, or experiences that can be shared with others.&quot; By this definition of the word, artistic works have existed for almost as long as [[human]]kind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James &quot;Art History and Images That Are Not Art&quot;, ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (Dec. 1995), with previous bibliography. &quot;Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value&quot;. 553&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] said in 1970, &quot;It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The first and broadest sense of ''art'' is the one that has remained closest to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;craft.&quot; A few examples where this meaning proves very broad include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''[[Medicine|medical]] arts'', and ''[[military]] arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|240px|20th-century [[Rwanda]]n bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

The second and more recent sense of the word ''art'' is as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art''. Fine art means that a skill is being used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the ''finer'' things. Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it will be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and [[design]] are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, &quot;The Boundaries of Art&quot;, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of [[beauty]] (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

Art can describe several things: a study of creative skill, a process of using the creative skill, a product of the creative skill, or the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines (''arts'') that produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and echo or reflect a message, mood, or symbolism for the viewer to interpret (art as experience). Artworks can be defined by purposeful, creative interpretations of limitless concepts or ideas in order to communicate something to another person. Artworks can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. It is also an expression of an idea and it can take many different forms and serve many different purposes. Although the application of scientific knowledge to derive a new scientific theory involves skill and results in the &quot;creation&quot; of something new, this represents science only and is not categorized as art.

==History==
{{Main|History of art}}
[[File:VenusWillendorf.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Venus of Willendorf]], ''[[circa]]'' 24,000–22,000 [[Before Present|BP]].]]

Sculptures, [[cave paintings]], rock paintings, and [[petroglyphs]] from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The oldest art objects in the world—a series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Tim. &quot;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/artsandhumanities/story/0,12241,1193237,00.html World's Oldest Jewellery Found in Cave]&quot;. ''Guardian Unlimited'', April 16, 2004. Retrieved on January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:lascaux2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Cave painting]] of a horse from the [[Lascaux]] caves, ''c.'' 16,000 BP.]]

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of Biblical and nonmaterial truths, and used styles that showed the higher unseen glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.

[[File:Kairouan Mosque Stitched Panorama.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (also called the Mosque of Uqba) is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques; dated in its present state from the 9th century, it is the ancestor and model of all the mosques in the western Islamic lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.fr/books?id=IaM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=oleg+grabar+kairouan+mosque&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=oleg%20grabar%20kairouan%20mosque&amp;f=false John Stothoff Badeau and John Richard Hayes, ''The Genius of Arab civilization: source of Renaissance''. Taylor &amp; Francis. 1983. p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] is located in the city of [[Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]].]]

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on geometric patterns, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]]. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang Dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming Dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.

[[File:Ma Lin 003.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Song Dynasty]] artist Ma Lin, c. 1250. 24,8 × 25,2 cm.]]

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or [[Jacques Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.

The history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[Impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as Pablo Picasso being influenced by [[African art|African sculpture]]. Japanese woodblock prints (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, the west has had huge impacts on Eastern art in the 19th and 20th centuries, with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence on artistic styles.

Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with irony. Furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than regional cultures.

Art tends to facilitate intuitive rather than rational understanding, and is usually consciously created with this intention. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[Fine art]] intentionally serves no other purpose. {{Dubious|date=January 2010}} As a result of this impetus, works of art are elusive, refractive to attempts at classification, because they can be appreciated in more than one way, and are often susceptible to many different interpretations. In the case of [[Géricault]]'s ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'', special knowledge concerning the shipwreck that the painting depicts is not a prerequisite to appreciating it, but allows the appreciation of Géricault's political intentions in the piece. Even art that superficially depicts a mundane event or object, may invite reflection upon elevated themes.

Traditionally, the highest achievements of art demonstrate a high level of ability or fluency within a medium. This characteristic might be considered a point of contention, since many modern artists (most notably, conceptual artists) do not themselves create the works they conceive, or do not even create the work in a conventional, demonstrative sense. Art has a transformative capacity: it confers particularly appealing or aesthetically satisfying structures or forms upon an original set of unrelated, passive constituents.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==
{{Main|The arts}}
[[File:MonaLisa sfumato.jpeg|thumb|left|Detail of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Mona Lisa]], showing the painting technique of ''[[sfumato]]''.]]
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, each related to its technique, or [[Media (arts)|medium]], such as [[decorative art]]s, [[plastic arts]], [[performing arts]], or [[literature]]. Unlike scientific fields, art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique [http://www.rchoetzlein.com/quanta/theory/theory-new-media.htm]. An artistic [[recording medium|medium]] is the substance or material the artistic work is made from, and may also refer to the technique used. For example, paint is a medium used in painting, and paper is a medium used in drawing.

An '''''art form''''' is the specific ''shape'', or quality an artistic expression takes. The media used often influence the form. For example, the [[shape|form]] of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions, and respond to gravity. The constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its '''''formal qualities'''''. To give another example, the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture, color, and brush texture. The formal qualities of video games are non-linearity, interactivity and virtual presence.
The ''form'' of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media, and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way what so ever.

A '''''genre''''' is a set of conventions and styles within a particular medium. For instance, well recognized genres in film are [[Western (genre)|western]], [[horror (genre)|horror]] and [[romantic comedy film|romantic comedy]]. Genres in music include [[death metal]] and [[trip hop]]. Genres in painting include [[still life]] and [[Landscape art|pastoral landscape]]. A particular work of art may bend or combine genres but each genre has a recognizable group of conventions, clichés and tropes. (One note: the word ''genre'' has a second older meaning within painting; ''[[genre painting]]'' was a phrase used in the 17th to 19th centuries to refer specifically to paintings of scenes of everyday life and can still be used in this way.)

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]] by [[Hokusai]] (Japanese, 1760–1849), colored woodcut print.]]
[[Image:Cognition-Libido.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[R. Gopakumar]]: ''Cognition-Libido'' (Digital Print on Canvas, Limited Edition, 1/7) In the permanent collection of the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction]]]]

The '''''style''''' of an artwork, artist, or movement is the distinctive method and form followed by the respective art. Any loose brushy, dripped or poured abstract painting is called ''expressionistic''. Often a style is linked with a particular historical period, set of ideas, and particular artistic movement. So [[Jackson Pollock]] is called an [[Abstract Expressionist]].

Because a particular style may have specific cultural meanings, it is important to be sensitive to differences in technique. [[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s (1923–1997) paintings are not [[Pointillism|pointillist]], despite his uses of dots, because they are not aligned with the original proponents of Pointillism. Lichtenstein used [[Ben-Day dots]]: they are evenly spaced and create flat areas of color. Dots of this type, used in halftone printing, were originally used in comic strips and newspapers to reproduce color. Lichtenstein thus uses the dots as a style to question the &quot;high&quot; art of painting with the &quot;low&quot; art of comics – to comment on class distinctions in culture. Lichtenstein is thus associated with the American Pop art movement (1960s). Pointillism is a technique in late Impressionism (1880s), developed especially by the artist [[Georges Seurat]], that employs dots that are spaced in a way to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to paint images that were closer to the way people really see color. Both artists use dots, but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist.

These are all ways of beginning to define a work of art, to narrow it down. &quot;Imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks. How would you proceed with your task? One way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object, image video, or event. The decision to cast a sculpture in bronze, for instance, inevitably effects its meaning; the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate, even if everything else about the artwork remains the same. Next, you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes, colors, textures, and lines. These, in turn, are organized into various patterns and compositional structures. In your interpretation, you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork. [But in the end] the meaning of most artworks... is not exhausted by a discussion of materials, techniques, and form. Most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980, page 4. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skill and craft===

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art], Signs – International Journal of Semiotics 3, pp.1–28, 2010. ISSN: 1902-8822&lt;/ref&gt;
There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the epithet &quot;art&quot;, particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability or an originality in stylistic approach such as in the plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.

A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s &quot;Fountain&quot; is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects (&quot;ready-made&quot;) and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the [[mass media]]. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal holllow log tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia.]]
{{Off-topic|Art_(disambiguation)|date=November 2010}}
Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as &quot;that meal was a work of art&quot; (the cook is an artist), or &quot;the art of deception&quot;, (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity.

Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, &quot;good&quot; art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of [[3rd of May]] 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''.

Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. [[Artist]]s express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Graham | first1 = Gordon | title = Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of art==
[[File:Transition 1880.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Navajo rug]] made ''c.'' 1880.]]
[[File:B Escorial 93v.jpg|thumb|[[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]] [[Commentary on the Apocalypse|Beatus]] [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]; Spain, late 10th century.]]
Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is &quot;vague&quot;, but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Levi-Strauss).

===Non-motivated functions of art===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. Aristotle said, &quot;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. The Poetics, Republic&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.
# ''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].'' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry.&quot; -Aristotle &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. The Poetics, Republic. Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient greeks often speak of the arts collectively. http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Experience of the mysterious.'' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.&quot; -Albert Einstein &lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. The World as I See It. http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Expression of the imagination.'' Art provide a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are maleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else – something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken.&quot; -Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, Critique of Aesthetic Judgement (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Universal communication.'' Art allows the individual to express things toward the world as a whole.{{Whom?|date=January 2010}} Earth artists often create art in remote locations that will never be experienced by another person. The practice of placing a [[cairn]], or pile of stones at the top of a mountain, is an example. (Note: This need not suggest a particular view of God, or religion.) Art created in this way is a form of communication between the individual and the world as a whole. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
# ''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.'' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'.&quot; -Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, &quot;Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context&quot;: (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions of art===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) to sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.
# ''Communication.'' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication.&quot; -Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Art as entertainment''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.
# ''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.'' One of the defining functions of early twentieth century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life.&quot; -André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, Surrealist Manifesto (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Art for psychological and healing purposes.'' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.
# ''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.'' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|700px|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome.]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# ''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.'' Art is often utilized as a form of [[propaganda]], and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], Mythologies&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

==Controversial art==
[[File:Théodore Géricault, Le Radeau de la Méduse.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', c. 1820]]
{{Further|[[Art and politics]]}}

[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was a social commentary on a current event, unprecedented at the time. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world. [[John Singer Sargent]]'s ''[[Portrait of Madame X|Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam X)]]'' (1884), caused a huge uproar over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation.

In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.

==Art theories==
In the nineteenth century, artists were primarily concerned with ideas of ''truth'' and ''[[beauty]]''. The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth.&quot; [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. [[Modern Painters]], Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, Essay VI. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; N.Y.,1999. ISBN 0-415-06700-6&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article &quot;Modernist Painting&quot; defines modern art as &quot;the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Frascina&quot;&gt;Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of
painting – the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment — were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = &quot;Frascina&quot; /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T. J. Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art.

Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the [[movies]], superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon, &quot;2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art&quot;, New York Times, Magazine Section, December 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, &quot;the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life&quot; are &quot;so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art&quot; (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the [[Daily Mail]] criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing &quot;For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all&quot; they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. &quot;Contemporary Art and the Home&quot;. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. ISBN 1-8597-3661-0&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that &quot;the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis ''[http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm Tribal Art]'' in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur. &quot;Artifact and Art.&quot; In Art/Artifact, edited by Susan Vogel. New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-art]] is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art;&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; it is term  associated with [[Dada]]ism and attributed to [[Marcel Duchamp]] just before World War I,&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=571 &quot;Glossary: Anti-art&quot;], [[Tate]].

==Art, class, and value==
[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', later copied all over Europe.]]
Art is sometimes perceived as belonging exclusively to higher social classes. In this context, art is seen as an upper-class activity associated with wealth, the ability to purchase art, and the leisure required to pursue or enjoy it. The [[Palace of Versailles]] and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in [[St. Petersburg]] illustrate this view: such vast collections of art are the preserve of the rich, of governments and wealthy organizations.

''Fine'' and expensive goods have been popular markers of status in many cultures, and they continue to be so today. There has been a cultural push in the other direction since at least 1793, when the Louvre, which had been a private palace of the Kings of France, was opened to the public as an art museum during the [[French Revolution]]. Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978 : ''Everyone an artist — On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism''.]]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is &quot;necessary to present something more than mere objects&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys|journal=ArtForum|date=December 1969|first=Willoughby|last=Sharp|coauthors=|volume=8|issue=4|page=45|id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. &quot;Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality, page 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mia | last=Fineman | coauthors= | title=YouTube for ArtistsThe best places to find video art online. | date=2007-03-21 | publisher= | url =http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ | work =Slate | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. &quot;With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980, page 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agnostida''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[arthropod]] which first developed near the end of the [[Cambrian|Early Cambrian]] period and thrived during the Middle Cambrian. They are present in the lower Cambrian fossil record along with trilobites from the [[Redlichiida]], [[Corynexochida]], and [[Ptychopariida]] orders. The last agnostids went [[extinct]] in the Late [[Ordovician]].

==Systematics==
The Agnostida are divided into two suborders&amp;nbsp;— [[Agnostina]] and [[Eodiscina]]&amp;nbsp;— that are then divided into a number of [[family (biology)|families]]. As a group, agnostids are isopygous, meaning that their [[pygidium]] is similar in size and shape to their [[cephalon (arthropod anatomy)|cephalon]]. Most agnostid species were eyeless.

The systematic position of the order Agnostida within the class Trilobita remains uncertain, and there has been continuing debate whether they are trilobites or a [[stem group]]. The challenge to the status has focused on the Agnostina partly because [[juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] of one genus have been found with legs greatly different from those of adult trilobites,&lt;ref&gt;MÜLLER, K. J. &amp; WALOSSEK, D. (1987): Morphology, ontogeny, and life habit of Agnostus pisiformis from the Upper Cambrian of Sweden . Fossils and Strata, 19, 1-124.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting they are not members of the [[lamellipedia]]n [[clade]], of which trilobites are a part. Instead, the limbs of agnostids closely resemble those of stem group crustaceans, although they lack the [[proximal endite]], which defines that group. They are likely the [[sister taxon]] to the crustacean stem lineage, and, as such, part of the clade [[Crustaceomorpha]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, J. &amp; Hou, X.G. (2005). Early Palaeozoic non-lemellipedian arthropods. In S. Koenemann &amp; A. J. Ronald (Eds.), Crustacea and Arthropod Relationships (Volume , pp. 75-93). Taylor and Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have suggested, based on a [[cladistic]] analyses of [[dorsal]] [[exoskeleton|exoskeletal]] features, that Eodiscina and Agnostida are closely united, and that the Eodiscina descended from the trilobite order [[Ptychopariida]].&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, T. J. &amp; Fortey, R.A. (2005). Comparative morphology and relationships of the Agnostida. In S. Koenemann &amp; R. A. Jenner (Eds.), Crustacea and Arthropod Relationships (Volume , pp. 95-136). Taylor and Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Scientists have long debated whether the agnostids lived a [[pelagic]] or a [[benthic]] lifestyle. Their lack of eyes, a morphology not well-suited for swimming, and their fossils found in association with other benthic trilobites all suggest a benthic (bottom-dwelling) mode of life. They are likely to have lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on [[detritus]] that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom. In contrast, their wide geographic dispersion in the [[fossil record]] is uncharacteristic of benthic animals, suggesting a pelagic existence. The thoracic segment appears to form a hinge between the head and pygidium allowing for a bivalved [[ostracod]]an-type lifestyle. Furthermore, the orientation of the thoracic appendages appears ill suited for benthic living.

They are sometimes preserved within the voids of other organisms, for instance within empty [[hyolith]] conchs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Abortion''' is the termination of a [[pregnancy (mammals)|pregnancy]] by the removal or expulsion of a [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] from the [[uterus]], resulting in or caused by its death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KiRHpRl7TjsC&amp;pg=PA173 |title=Gynaecology for Lawyers |author=Dutt T, Matthews MP |volume=14 |series-title=Medico-legal practitioner series |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-85941-215-2}} &lt;/ref&gt; An abortion can occur spontaneously due to [[complication (medicine)|complications]] during pregnancy or can be induced in humans and other species. In the context of human pregnancies, an abortion induced to preserve the health of the [[gravidity|gravida]] (pregnant female) is termed a ''therapeutic abortion'', while an abortion induced for any other reason is termed an ''elective abortion''. The term ''abortion'' most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a [[pregnancy|human pregnancy]], while spontaneous abortions are usually termed [[miscarriage]]s. &lt;!--Annotation: This paragraph serves to disambiguate abortion terminology and and types--&gt;

Abortion has a long [[history of abortion|history]] and has been induced by various methods including herbal [[abortifacient]]s, the use of sharpened tools, [[physical trauma]], and other [[traditional medicine|traditional methods]]. Contemporary medicine utilizes medications and surgical procedures to induce abortion. The [[abortion law|legality]], prevalence, cultural status, and religious status of abortion vary substantially around the world. In many parts of the world there is prominent and divisive [[Abortion debate|public controversy]] over the [[ethical aspects of abortion|ethical]] and legal issues of abortion. Abortion and abortion-related issues feature prominently in the national politics in many nations, often involving the opposing [[pro-life]] and [[pro-choice]] worldwide social movements ([[Pro-choice#Term controversy|both self-named]]). Incidence of abortion has declined worldwide as access to [[family planning]] education and contraceptive services has increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldtrends&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sedgh G, Henshaw SK, Singh S, Bankole A, Drescher J |title=Legal abortion worldwide: incidence and recent trends |journal=Int Fam Plan Perspect |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=106–16 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17938093 |doi=10.1363/ifpp.33.106.07 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3310607.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Annotation: This paragraph covers related issues and current events.--&gt;

==Types==
===Induced===

More than one third of the approximately 205 million pregnancies that occur each year worldwide are unintended and about 20% of them end in induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/rhl/fertility/abortion/CD006714_chengl_com/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways. The manner selected often depends upon the [[gestational age]] of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses.&lt;ref&gt;Menikoff, Jerry. [http://books.google.com/books?id=2jXOYv3X8zsC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=size+fetus+abortion+technique&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=MymmSayEFJaQyATt6JiUDg Law and Bioethics], p. 78 (Georgetown University Press 2001): &quot;As the fetus grows in size, however, the vacuum aspiration method becomes increasingly difficult to use.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor-patient preference. Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a [[Therapeutic Abortion|therapeutic abortion]] when it is performed to:
* save the life of the pregnant woman;&lt;ref name=&quot;roche1&quot;&gt;Roche, Natalie E. (2004). [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3311.htm Therapeutic Abortion]. Retrieved 2006-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
* preserve the woman's physical or mental health;&lt;ref name=&quot;roche1&quot;/&gt;
* terminate pregnancy that would result in a child born with a [[congenital disorder]] that would be fatal or associated with significant [[morbidity]];&lt;ref name=&quot;roche1&quot;/&gt; or
* [[selective reduction|selectively reduce]] the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;roche1&quot;/&gt;
An abortion is referred to as ''elective'' when it is performed at the request of the woman &quot;for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Britannica'', (2007), Vol 26, p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spontaneous===
{{Main|Miscarriage}}
Spontaneous abortion (also known as miscarriage) is the expulsion of an embryo or fetus due to accidental trauma or natural causes before approximately the 22nd [[gestational age|week of gestation]]; the definition by gestational age varies by country.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHOmiscarriage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Symptoms/Vaginal_bleeding_early_S7_S16.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth – A guide for midwives and doctors |last=Department of Reproductive Health and Research |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-04-07}} NB: This definition is subject to regional differences, see [[Intrauterine fetal death|miscarriage]].&lt;/ref&gt; Most miscarriages are due to incorrect replication of chromosomes; they can also be caused by environmental factors. A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a [[live birth|live-born]] infant is known as a &quot;[[premature birth]]&quot;. When a fetus dies [[in utero]] after about 22 weeks, or during [[childbirth|delivery]], it is usually termed &quot;[[stillbirth|stillborn]]&quot;. Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.

Between 10% and 50% of pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name=BBCmiscarriage&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2176898.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Miscarriage |date=2002-08-06 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy, in most cases, they occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman is not even aware that she was pregnant. One study testing hormones for [[ovulation]] and pregnancy found that 61.9% of [[conceptus]]es were lost prior to 12 weeks, and 91.7% of these losses occurred subclinically, without the knowledge of the once pregnant woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7117572&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmonds DK, Lindsay KS, Miller JF, Williamson E, Wood PJ |title=Early embryonic mortality in women |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=447–453 |year=1982 |pmid=7117572 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:Abortionmethods.png|thumb|350px|right|[[Gestational age]] may determine which abortion methods are practiced.]]

===Medical===
{{Main|Medical abortion}}

&quot;Medical abortions&quot; are non-surgical abortions that use pharmaceutical drugs, categorically called [[abortifacient]]s. In 2005, medical abortions constituted 13% of all abortions in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jones R. K. et al.|title=Abortion in the United States: incidence and access to services, 2005|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=40|issue=1 |pages=6–16|year=2008|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4000608.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 the figure increased to 17%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/11/AR2011011107331.html&lt;/ref&gt; Combined regimens include [[methotrexate]] or [[mifepristone]], followed by a [[prostaglandin]] (either [[misoprostol]] or [[gemeprost]]: misoprostol is used in the U.S.; gemeprost is used in the UK and Sweden.) When used within 49 days gestation, approximately 92% of women undergoing medical abortion with a combined regimen completed it without surgical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Spitz, I.M|title=Early pregnancy termination with mifepristone and misoprostol in the United States|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=1998|volume=338|issue=18|pmid=9562577|doi=10.1056/NEJM199804303381801|page=1241|last2=Bardin|first2=CW|last3=Benton|first3=L|last4=Robbins|first4=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misoprostol can be used alone, but has a lower efficacy rate than combined regimens. In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.

===Surgical===
[[File:Vacuum-aspiration (single).svg|thumb|A vacuum aspiration abortion at eight weeks gestational age (six weeks after fertilization).&lt;br /&gt;'''1:''' Amniotic sac&lt;br /&gt;'''2:''' Embryo&lt;br /&gt;'''3:''' Uterine lining&lt;br /&gt;'''4:''' Speculum&lt;br /&gt;'''5:''' Vacurette&lt;br /&gt;'''6:''' Attached to a suction pump]]
In the first 12 weeks, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or vacuum abortion is the most common method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Healthwise |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 |title=Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion |year=2004 |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manual [[vacuum aspiration]]'' (MVA) abortion consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]], [[placenta]] and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while ''electric [[vacuum aspiration]]'' (EVA) abortion uses an electric pump. These techniques are comparable, and differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, how early in pregnancy they can be used, and whether cervical dilation is necessary. MVA, also known as &quot;mini-suction&quot; and &quot;[[menstrual extraction]]&quot;, can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. Surgical techniques are sometimes referred to as 'Suction (or surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy' (STOP). From the 15th week until approximately the 26th, [[dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E) is used. D&amp;E consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.

''[[Dilation and curettage]]'' (D&amp;C), the second most common method of surgical abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. ''[[Curettage]]'' refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called ''sharp curettage,'' only when MVA is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[World Health Organization]] |chapter=Dilatation and curettage |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-92-4-154587-7 |oclc=181845530 |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the second [[wiktionary:trimester|trimester]]. Premature delivery can be induced with [[prostaglandin]]; this can be coupled with injecting the [[amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]] with hypertonic solutions containing [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[urea]]. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called &quot;[[partial-birth abortion]],&quot; which has been [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|federally banned]] in the United States. A [[hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;encarta&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McGee |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn McGee |coauthors=[[Jon F.

The [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] has recommended that an injection be used to stop the fetal heart during the first phase of the surgical abortion procedure to ensure that the fetus is not born alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Nuffield Council on Bioethics |chapter=Dilemmas in Current Practice: The Fetus | chapterurl=http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/sites/default/files/files/CCD%20Chapter%204%20Dilemmas%20in%20current%20practice%20the%20fetus.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-31 |title=Critical Case Decisions in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine: Ethical Issues |publisher=Nuffield Council on Bioethics |date=June 22, 2007 |isbn=978-1-904384-14-4 |oclc=85782378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen. The degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Education for Choice.

===Mental health===

==Incidence==
There are two commonly used methods of measuring incidence of abortion:
* Abortion rate - number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age
* Abortion ratio - number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (excluding miscarriages and stillbirths)

The number of abortions performed worldwide has decreased between 1995 and 2003 from 45.6&amp;nbsp;million to 41.6&amp;nbsp;million, which means a decrease in abortion rate from 35 to 29 per 1000 women. The greatest decrease has occurred in the developed world with a drop from 39 to 26 per 1000 women in comparison to the developing world, which had a decrease from 34 to 29 per 1000 women. Out of a total of about 42 million abortions 22 million occurred safely and 20 million unsafely.&lt;ref name=OBGY09/&gt;

On average, the frequency of abortions is similar in developing countries (where abortion is generally restricted) to the frequency in developed countries (where abortion is generally much less restricted).&lt;ref name=IJGO10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shah I, Ahman E |title=Unsafe abortion: global and regional incidence, trends, consequences, and challenges |journal=[[J Obstet Gynaecol Can]] |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1149–58 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=20085681 |doi= |quote=However, a woman’s chance of having an abortion is similar whether she lives in a developed or a developing region: in 2003 the rates were 26 abortions per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 in developed areas and 29 per 1000 in developing areas.

If the 215 million women with unmet need used modern family planning methods....[that] would result in about 22 million fewer unplanned births; 25 million fewer abortions; and seven million fewer miscarriages....If women’s contraceptive needs were addressed (and assuming no changes in abortion laws)...the number of unsafe abortions would decline by 73% from 20 million to 5.5 million.&quot;  A few of the findings in that report were subsequently changed, and are available at: &quot;[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-AIU-summary.pdf Facts on Investing in Family Planning and Maternal and Newborn Health]&quot; (Guttmacher Institute 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of induced abortion varies regionally.  Some countries, such as Belgium (11.2 out of 100 known pregnancies) and the Netherlands (10.6 per 100), had a comparatively low ratio of induced abortion. Others like Russia (62.6 out of 100), Romania (63 out of 100)&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|National Institute of Statistics]], [http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/pdf/ro/cap2.pdf Romanian Statistical Yearbook, page 29], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and Vietnam (43.7 out of 100) had a high ratio (data for last three countries of unknown completeness). The estimated world ratio was 26%, the world rate - 35 per 1000 women.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, Stanley K., Singh, Susheela, and Haas, Taylor. (1999).

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, from data collected in those areas of the United States that sufficiently reported gestational age, it was found that 88.2% of abortions were conducted at or prior to 12 weeks, 10.4% from 13 to 20 weeks, and 1.4% at or after 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by &quot;[[curettage]]&quot; ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[Dilation and curettage]], [[Dilation and evacuation]]), 7.7% by &quot;[[medical abortion|medical]]&quot; means ([[mifepristone]]), 0.4% by &quot;[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]&quot; (saline or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1.0% by &quot;other&quot; (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc2003&quot;&gt;Strauss, L.T., Gamble, S.B., Parker, W.Y, Cook, D.A., Zane, S.B., and Hamdan, S.

[[File:AGIAbortionReasonsBarChart.png|thumb|A bar chart depicting selected data from the 1998 [[Alan Guttmacher Institute|AGI]] [[meta-study]] on the reasons women stated for having an abortion.]]

A 1998 study from 27 countries on the reasons women seek to terminate their pregnancies concluded that the most common reason women cited for having an abortion was to postpone childbearing to a more suitable time or to focus energies and resources on existing children.  The most commonly reported reasons were socioeconomic factors such as being unable to afford a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising a child or  the loss of income while she is caring for the child,  lack of support from the father,  inability to afford additional children, desire to provide schooling for existing children, disruption of education,  relationship problems with a husband or partner, the perception that she is too young,  and unemployment. &lt;ref name=&quot;bankole98&quot;&gt;Bankole, Akinrinola, Singh, Susheela, and Haas, Taylor.

Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the stigmatization of disabled people, preference for children of a specific sex, disapproval of single motherhood, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward [[population control]] (such as China's [[one-child policy]]). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]].

===Unsafe abortion===

Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly when access to legal abortion is restricted.  About one in eight pregnancy-related deaths worldwide are associated with unsafe abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Gaynor.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines an unsafe abortion as being &quot;a procedure ... carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whounsafe&quot;&gt;World Health Organization.

Unsafe abortion remains a public health concern due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], hemorrhage, and damage to internal organs.

The legality of abortion is one of the main determinants of its safety.

However, the procedure remained relatively rare until the late 1960s. In late 1960s and early 1970s, due to a confluence of factors, the number of abortions exploded worldwide.

{{Main|Abortion debate}}
{{See also|Religion and abortion}}
In the [[history of abortion]], induced abortion has been the source of considerable debate, controversy, and activism. An individual's position on the complex ethical, moral, philosophical, biological, and legal issues is often related to his or her [[value system]]. The main positions are one that argues in favor of access to abortion and one argues against access to abortion. Opinions of abortion may be described as being a combination of beliefs on its morality, and beliefs on the responsibility, ethical scope, and proper extent of governmental authorities in public policy. [[religion|Religious ethics]] also has an influence upon both personal opinion and the greater debate over abortion (see [[religion and abortion]]).

Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. In the United States, those in favor of greater legal restrictions on, or even complete prohibition of abortion, most often describe themselves as pro-life while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as pro-choice. Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a human being with a [[right to life|right to live]] making abortion tantamount to murder. The latter position argues that a woman has certain [[reproductive rights]], especially the choice whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion.

Debate also focuses on whether the pregnant woman should have to notify and/or have the consent of others in distinct cases: a [[minor (law)|minor]], her parents; a legally married or [[common-law marriage|common-law]] wife, her husband; or, for any case, [[Paternal rights and abortion|the biological father]]. In a 2003 Gallup poll in the United States, 79% of male and 67% of female respondents were in favor of legalized mandatory spousal notification; overall support was 72% with 26% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.

The earliest secular laws regulating abortion reflect a concern with class and caste purity and preservation of male prerogatives. Abortion as such was not outlawed, but wives who procured abortions without their husband's knowledge could be severely punished, as could slaves who induced abortions in highborn women. Generally, abortions prior to [[quickening]] were treated as minor crimes, if at all.

The new philosophies of the [[Axial Age]], which began discussing the nature and value of human life in abstract terms, had little impact on existing abortion laws. Even the Christian [[ecclesiastical courts]] of the Middle Ages imposed penance and no corporal punishment for abortion, and retained the pre- and post-quickening distinction from the ancient philosophies.

The Soviet Union, with legislation in 1920, and [[Iceland]], with legislation in 1935, were two of the first countries to generally allow abortion. The second half of the 20th century saw the liberalization of abortion laws in other countries as well.  The ''[[Abortion Act 1967]]'' allowed abortion for limited reasons in the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland). In the 1973 case, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] struck down state laws banning abortion, ruling that such laws violated an implied [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]], similarly, in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'', discarded its criminal code regarding abortion in 1988, after ruling that such restrictions violated the security of person guaranteed to women under the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|18821017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada later struck down provincial regulations of abortion in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)]].'' By contrast, [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|abortion in Ireland]] was affected by the addition of an [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|amendment]] to the Irish [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] in 1983 by popular referendum, recognizing &quot;the right to life of the unborn&quot;.

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The right to life, the right to liberty, the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive rights|reproductive health]] are major issues of human rights that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require that certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be obtained, often, but not always, using a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality:
* In the United States, some states impose a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their minor daughter requests an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalfamilyplanningperspectives.org/pubs/MandatoryCounseling.pdf|title=The Impact of State Mandatory Counseling and Waiting Period Laws on Abortion: A Literature Review|format=PDF|publisher=[[Guttmacher Institute]]|author=Theodore J.
