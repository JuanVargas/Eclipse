'''Chuck-a-luck''', also known as '''birdcage''', is a [[gambling|game of chance]] played with three [[dice]]. It is derived from [[grand hazard]], and both can be considered a variant of [[sic bo]], a popular [[casino game]], although chuck-a-luck is more of a [[carnival game]] than a true casino game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for [[Charitable organization|charity]].

==Rules==
Chuck-a-luck is played with three standard [[dice]] that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an [[hourglass]] that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and that pivots about its centre. The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom.

Wagers are placed based on possible combinations that can appear on the three dice.  The possible wagers are usually fewer than the wagers that are possible in [[sic bo]] and, in that sense, chuck-a-luck can be considered to be a simpler game.

The wagers, and their associated odds, that are typically available are set out in the table below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Type
!Wager
!Odds
|-
|Single Dice Bet
|A specific number will appear
|1 die, 1 to 1; 2 dice, 2 to 1; 3 dice, 10 to 1 (sometimes 3 to 1)
|-
|Any Triple (sometimes offered)
|Any of the triples (all three dice show the same number) will appear
|30 to 1
|-
|Big (sometimes offered)
|The total score will be 11 (sometimes 12) or higher with the exception of a triple
|1 to 1
|-
|Small (sometimes offered)
|The total score will be 10 (sometimes 9) or lower with the exception of a triple
|1 to 1
|-
|Field (sometimes offered)
|The total score will be outside the range of 8 to 12 (inclusive)
|1 to 1
|}

==House Advantage or Edge==
{{Expert-subject|Gambling|section|date=February 2009}}
Chuck-a-luck is an unequal [[gambling|game of chance]]. That is, on average, even if the dice are not [[dice|loaded]], the players are expected to lose more than they win.  The casino's advantage ([[house advantage]] or house edge) is greater than most other [[casino games]] and can be much greater.

For example, there are 216 (6 x 6 x 6) possible outcomes for a single throw of three dice. For a specific number:

* there are 75 possible outcomes, where one die only will match the number;
* there are 15 possible outcomes, where two dice only will match; and
* there is one possible outcome, where all three dice will match.

At odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 10 to 1 respectively for each of these types of outcome, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:

1 - [(75/216) * 2 + (15/216) * 3 + (1/216) * 11] = 4.6%

At worse odds of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 3 to 1, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:

1 - [(75/216) * 2 + (15/216) * 3 + (1/216) * 4] = 7.9%

==Variants==
* A version of the [[Big Six wheel]] is loosely based on chuck-a-luck, with various combinations of three dice appearing in 54 slots on a spinning wheel. Because of the distribution of the combinations, the house advantage or edge for this wheel is greater than for chuck-a-luck.
* Chuck-a-luck is essentially identical to the traditional Vietnamese game [[Bau cua ca cop]].
* The games C 3; Chuck A Luck and C 9; Chuck A Luck use the numbers 1-3 and 1-9 (respectively) as the computer does not know how many faces a die has.

'''Chipmunks''' are small striped [[squirrel]]s native to [[North America]] and [[Asia]]. They are usually classed either as a single [[genus]] with three [[subgenera]], or as three [[genus|genera]].

==Etymology and taxonomy==
Chipmunks are usually classified either as a single genus, ''Tamias'', or as three genera: ''Tamias'', containing the [[eastern chipmunk]]; ''[[Eutamias]]'', containing the [[Siberian chipmunk]]; and ''[[Neotamias]]'', containing the 23 remaining, mostly western, species. These classifications are arbitrary, and most taxonomies{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks in a single genus. However, studies of [[mitochondrial DNA]] show that each of the three chipmunk groups is about as distinct genetically as genera such as ''[[Marmot]]a'' and ''[[Spermophilus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nmnhgoph.si.edu/msw/ | title = Mammal Species of the World (MSW) | accessdate = 2007-06-27 | author = Wilson, D.

''Tamias'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for &quot;storer,&quot; a reference to the animals' habit of collecting and storing food for winter use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = John O. Whitaker, Jr. | coauthors = Robert Elman | title = The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals | edition = 2nd edition | year = 1980 | publisher= [[Knopf]] | location=New York | isbn= 0-394-50762-2 | page= 370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common name originally may have been spelled &quot;chitmunk&quot; (from the [[Ottawa language|Odawa]] word ''jidmoonh'', meaning &quot;red squirrel&quot;; ''c.f.'' [[Anishinaabe language#Anishinaabemowin|Ojibwe]], ''ajidamoo''). The earliest form cited in the Oxford English Dictionary (from 1842) is &quot;chipmonk&quot;, but &quot;chipmunk&quot; appears in several books from the 1820s and 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22chipmunk%22&amp;tbs=bks:1,cdr:1,cd_min:1800,cd_max:1834&amp;lr=lang_en Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Other early forms include &quot;chipmuck&quot; and &quot;chipminck&quot;, and in the 1830s they were also referred to as &quot;chip squirrels,&quot; possibly in reference to the sound they make. They are also called &quot;striped squirrels&quot;, &quot;chippers&quot;, &quot;munks&quot;, &quot;timber tigers&quot;, or &quot;ground squirrels&quot;, though the name &quot;ground squirrel&quot; usually refers to other squirrels, such as those of the genus ''[[Spermophilus]]''.

==Diet==
Chipmunks have an [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet consisting of grain, nuts, fruit, berries, birds' eggs, small frogs, fungi, worms, insects and on occasions small mammals like young mice.&lt;ref name=hazard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/chipmunk.htm Eastern Chipmunk - Tamias striatus - NatureWorks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of autumn, many species of chipmunk begin to stockpile these goods in their burrows, for winter. Other species make multiple small caches of food. These two kinds of behavior are called [[Hoarding (animal behaviour)|larder hoarding and scatter hoarding]]. Larder hoarders usually live in their nests until spring. Cheek pouches allow chipmunks to carry multiple food items to their burrows for either storage or consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvdnr.gov/Wildlife/Magazine/Archive/04Fall/Eastern_Chipmunk.shtm West Virginia Wildlife Magazine: Wildlife Diversity Notebook. Eastern chipmunk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and life history==
Eastern chipmunks mate in early spring and again in early summer, producing litters of four or five young twice each year.&lt;ref name=hazard&gt;{{cite book | last = Hazard | first = Evan B.  | title = The Mammals of Minnesota | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | year = 1982 | pages =  52–54 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sjoQK1bedB0C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=eastern+chipmunk+mate&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U1yqjlcK_T-9SF3IsdkkDH1eEg8EQ#PPA54,M1 | isbn  = 0-8166-0952-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Western chipmunks only breed once a year. The young emerge from the burrow after about six weeks and strike out on their own within the next two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schwartz | first = Charles Walsh  | coauthors = Elizabeth Reeder Schwartz, Jerry J. Conley | title = The Wild Mammals of Missouri | publisher = University of Missouri Press | year = 2001 | pages =  135–140 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEWl0ZM6DfUC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=eastern+chipmunk+young&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U3WVj2tyvQ4y2C_v8_vo1Hn_iX16A#PPA140,M1 | isbn  = 0-8262-1359-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These small mammals fulfill several important functions in [[forest]] [[ecosystem]]s. Their activities harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role in [[seedling]] establishment. They consume many different kinds of [[fungi]], including those involved in [[Mycorrhiza|symbiotic mycorrhizal associations]] with trees, and are an important [[dispersal vector|vector for dispersal]] of the spores of subterranean [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarps]] (truffles) which have co-evolved with these and other [[wikt:mycophagous|mycophagous]] mammals and thus lost the ability to disperse their spores through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Apostol | first = Dean  | coauthors = Marcia Sinclair | title = Restoring the Pacific Northwest: The Art and Science of Ecological Restoration in Cascadia | publisher = Island Press | year = 2006 | page =  112 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CsGyhzFBjyAC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=chipmunk+sporocarps&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U3TWxhcMo2rXFWT8kRvbXqIh6Sc2g | isbn  = 1-55963-078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chipmunks play an important role as prey for various predatory mammals and birds, but are also opportunistic predators themselves, particularly with regard to bird eggs and [[nestling]]s. In [[Oregon]], [[Mountain Bluebird]]s (''Siala currucoides'') have been observed energetically mobbing chipmunks that they see near their nest trees.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Chipmunks construct expansive [[burrow]]s which can be more than 3.5 m in length with several well-concealed entrances. The sleeping quarters are kept extremely clean as shells and feces are stored in refuse tunnels.

'''Computer music''' is a term that was originally used within academia to describe a field of study relating to the applications of [[computing technology]] in music composition; particularly that stemming from the [[Western art music]] tradition. It includes the theory and application of new and existing technologies in music, such as [[sound synthesis]], [[digital signal processing]], [[sound design]], sonic diffusion, [[acoustics]], and [[psychoacoustics]]. The field of computer music can trace its roots back to the origin of [[electronic music]], and the very first experiments and innovations with electronic instruments at the turn of the 20th century. More recently, with the advent of [[personal computing]], and the growth of [[home recording]], the term computer music is now sometimes used to describe any [[music]] that has been created using computing technology.

==History==
{{See also|Computer music programming languages}}
Much of the work on computer music has drawn on the relationship between [[music theory]] and [[mathematics]].
The world's first computer to play music was [[CSIRAC]] which was designed and built by [[Trevor Pearcey]] and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the [[Colonel Bogey March]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Doornbusch | first = Paul| title = The Music of CSIRAC | journal = Melbourne School of Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering| url = http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/music/introduction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which no known recordings exist.
However, [[CSIRAC]] played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice which is current computer-music practice.

The oldest known recordings of computer generated music were played by the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] computer, a commercial version of the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine|Baby]] Machine from the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in the autumn of 1951. The music program was written by [[Christopher Strachey]]. During a session recorded by the [[BBC]], the machine managed to work its way through &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;, &quot;God Save the King&quot; and part of &quot;In the Mood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Fildes| first = Jonathan| title = 'Oldest' computer music unveiled | journal = News.bbc.co.uk| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7458479.stm| accessdate = 2008-06-17 | work=BBC News | date=June 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two further major 1950s developments were the origins of digital sound synthesis by computer, and of algorithmic composition programs beyond rote playback. [[Max Mathews]] at Bell Laboratories developed the influential [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC I]] program and its descendents, further popularising computer music through a 1962 article in Science. Amongst other pioneers, the musical chemists [[Lejaren Hiller]] and Leonard Isaacson worked on a series of algorithmic composition experiments from 1956-9, manifested in the 1957 premiere of the ''Illiac Suite'' for string quartet.&lt;ref&gt;Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson, ''Experimental Music: Composition with an Electronic Computer'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1959; reprinted Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1979),{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}. ISBN 0313221588.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early computer-music programs typically did not run in [[Real-time computing|real time]]. Programs would run for hours or days, on multi-million-dollar computers, to generate a few minutes of music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[John Chowning]]'s work on [[FM synthesis]] from the 1960s to the 1970s, and the advent of inexpensive digital chips and microcomputers opened the door to real-time generation of computer music. By the early 1990s, the performance of microprocessor-based computers reached the point that real-time generation of computer music using more general programs and algorithms became possible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Advances==
Advances in computing power and software for manipulation of digital media have dramatically affected the way computer music is generated and performed. Current-generation micro-computers are powerful enough to perform very sophisticated audio synthesis using a wide variety of algorithms and approaches. Computer music systems and approaches are now ubiquitous, and so firmly embedded in the process of creating music that we hardly give them a second thought: computer-based synthesizers, digital mixers,  and effects units have become so commonplace that use of digital rather than analog technology to create and record music is the norm, rather than the exception.

==Research==
Despite the ubiquity of computer music in contemporary culture, there is considerable activity in the field of computer music, as researchers continue to pursue new and interesting computer-based synthesis, composition, and performance approaches.Throughout the world there are many organizations and institutions dedicated to the area of computer and electronic music study and research, including the [[International Computer Music Association|ICMA]] (International Computer Music Association), [[IRCAM]], GRAME, [[SEAMUS]] (Society for Electro Acoustic Music in the United States),  [[CEC]] (Canadian Electroacoustic Community), and a great number of institutions of higher learning around the world.

==Computer-generated music==
Computer-generated music is music [[musical composition|composed]] by, or with the extensive aid of, a computer. Although any music which uses computers in its composition or realisation is computer-generated to some extent, the use of computers is now so widespread (in the editing of pop songs, for instance) that the phrase computer-generated music is generally used to mean a kind of music which could not have been created ''without'' the use of computers.

We can distinguish two groups of computer-generated music: music in which a computer generated the score, which could be performed by humans, and music which is both composed and performed by computers. There is a large genre of music that is organized, synthesized, and created on computers.

===Computer-generated scores for performance by human players===
Many systems for generating musical scores actually existed well before the time of computers. One of these was [[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]] ''(Musical dice game''; 18th century), a system which used throws of the dice to randomly select measures from a large collection of small phrases. When patched together, these phrases combined to create musical pieces which could be performed by human players. Although these works were not actually composed with a computer in the modern sense, it uses a rudimentary form of the random combinatorial techniques sometimes used in computer-generated composition.

The world's first digital computer music was generated in Australia by programmer Geoff Hill on the [[CSIRAC]] computer which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard, although it was only used to play standard tunes of the day. Subsequently, one of the first composers to write music with a computer was [[Iannis Xenakis]]. He wrote programs in the [[FORTRAN]] language that generated numeric data that he transcribed into scores to be played by traditional [[musical instrument]]s. An example is ''ST/48'' of 1962. Although Xenakis could well have composed this music by hand, the intensity of the calculations needed to transform probabilistic mathematics into musical notation was best left to the number-crunching power of the computer.

Computers have also been used in an attempt to imitate the music of great composers of the past, such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. A present exponent of this technique is [[David Cope]]. He wrote computer programs that analyse works of other composers to produce new works in a similar style. He has used this program to great effect with composers such as Bach and Mozart (his program ''Experiments in Musical Intelligence'' is famous for creating &quot;Mozart's 42nd Symphony&quot;), and also within his own pieces, combining his own creations with that of the computer.

===Music composed and performed by computers===
{{See also|Generative music|Evolutionary music|Genetic algorithm}}
Later, composers such as [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]] had computers generate the sounds of the composition as well as the score. Koenig produced [[algorithmic composition]] programs which were a generalisation of his own [[serial composition]] practice.  This is not exactly similar to Xenakis' work as he used mathematical abstractions and examined how far he could explore these musically.  Koenig's software translated the calculation of mathematical equations into codes which represented musical notation.  This could be converted into musical notation by hand and then performed by human players. His programs Project 1 and Project 2 are examples of this kind of software. Later, he extended the same kind of principles into the realm of synthesis, enabling the computer to produce the sound directly. SSP is an example of a program which performs this kind of function. All of these programs were produced by Koenig at the [[Institute of Sonology]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht, Holland]] in the 1970s.

Procedures such as those used by Koenig and Xenakis are still in use today. Since the invention of the [[MIDI]] system in the early 1980s, for example, some people have worked on programs which map MIDI notes to an algorithm and then can either output sounds or music through the computer's [[sound card]] or write an [[audio file format|audio file]] for other programs to play.

Some of these simple programs are based on [[fractal geometry]], and can map midi notes to specific [[fractal]]s, or fractal equations. Although such programs are widely available and are sometimes seen as clever toys for the non-musician, some professional musicians have given them attention also. The resulting 'music' can be more like noise, or can sound quite familiar and pleasant. As with much algorithmic music, and [[algorithmic art]] in general, more depends on the way in which the parameters are mapped to aspects of these equations than on the equations themselves. Thus, for example, the same equation can be made to produce both a lyrical and melodic piece of music in the style of the mid-nineteenth century, and a fantastically dissonant [[cacophony]] more reminiscent of the avant-garde music of the 1950s and 1960s.

Other programs can map mathematical formulae and constants to produce sequences of notes. In this manner, an [[irrational number]] can give an infinite sequence of notes where each note is a digit in the decimal expression of that number. This sequence can in turn be a composition in itself, or simply the basis for further elaboration.

Operations such as these, and even more elaborate operations can also be performed in computer music programming languages such as  [[Max/MSP]], [[SuperCollider]], [[Csound]], [[Pure Data]] (Pd), [[Keykit]], and [[ChucK]]. These programs now easily run on most personal computers, and are often capable of more complex functions than those which would have necessitated the most powerful mainframe computers several decades ago.

There exist programs that generate &quot;human-sounding&quot; melodies by using a vast database of phrases. One example is [[Band-in-a-Box]], which is capable of creating [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[Rock music|rock]] instrumental solos with almost no user interaction. Another is [[Impro-Visor]], which uses a [[stochastic context-free grammar]] to generate phrases and complete solos.

Another 'cybernetic' approach to computer composition uses specialized hardware to detect external stimuli which are then mapped by the computer to realize the performance.  Examples of this style of computer music can be found in the middle-80's work of [[David Rokeby]] (Very Nervous System) where audience/performer motions are 'translated' to MIDI segments. Computer controlled music is also found in the performance pieces by the Canadian composer [[Udo Kasemets]] such as the Marce(ntennia)l Circus C(ag)elebrating Duchamp (1987), a realization of the [[Marcel Duchamp]] process piece ''Erratum Musical'' using an electric model train to collect a hopper-car of stones to be deposited on a drum wired to an Analog:Digital converter, mapping the stone impacts to a score display (performed in Toronto by pianist [[Gordon Monahan]] during the 1987 Duchamp Centennial), or his installations and performance works (e.g. Spectrascapes) based on his Geo(sono)scope (1986) 15x4-channel computer-controlled audio mixer. In these latter works, the computer generates sound-scapes from tape-loop sound samples, live shortwave or sine-wave generators.

===Computer-Aided Algorithmic Composition===
[[Image:GenSystemVenn.png|thumb|right|Diagram illustrating the position of CAAC in relation to other [[Generative music]] Systems]]Computer-Aided Algorithmic Composition (CAAC, pronounced &quot;sea-ack&quot;) is the implementation and use of [[algorithmic composition]] techniques in software. This label is derived from the combination of two labels, each too vague for continued use. The label ''computer-aided composition'' lacks the specificity of using generative algorithms. Music produced with notation or sequencing software could easily be considered computer-aided composition. The label ''algorithmic composition'' is likewise too broad, particularly in that it does not specify the use of a computer. The term [[computer-aided]], rather than computer-assisted, is used in the same manner as [[Computer-Aided Design]].

==Video-Driven Soundtrack Composer==
A new concept insofar as the music generated is driven by an associated video. This process has been developed by Tunepresto and is available as a commercial product, [[Abaltat Muse]], for users to create their own music based on their video pictures or slideshows. The process involves an analysis of the color saturation in the pictures, together with the calculation of the duration of the footage. The user then chooses a style of music and a soundtrack is created using the video analysis information combined with the rules of the chosen musical style. The music generated is [[royalty-free music|royalty-free]] since the user is the originator of the music.

==Machine Improvisation==
{{See also|Machine learning|Machine listening|Artificial intelligence|Neural networks}}
Machine Improvisation uses computer algorithms to create [[improvisation]] on existing music materials. This is usually done by sophisticated recombination of musical phrases extracted from existing music, either live or pre-recorded. In order to achieve credible improvisation in particular style, machine improvisation uses [[machine learning]] and [[pattern matching]] algorithms to analyze existing musical examples. The resulting patterns are then used to create new variations &quot;in the style&quot; of the original music, developing a notion of stylistic reinjection.
This is different from other improvisation methods with computers that use [[algorithmic composition]] to generate new music without performing analysis of existing music examples.

===Statistical style modeling===
Style modeling implies building a computational representation of the musical surface that captures important stylistic features from data.  Statistical approaches are used to capture the redundancies in terms of pattern dictionaries or repetitions, which are later recombined to generate new musical data. Style mixing can be realized by analysis of a database containing multiple musical examples in different styles.  Machine Improvisation builds upon a long musical tradition of statistical modeling that began with Hiller and Isaacson's ''Illiac Suite for String Quartet'' (1957) and Xenakis' uses of [[Markov chains]] and [[stochastic processes]].  Modern methods include the use of [[lossless data compression]] for incremental parsing,  [[prediction suffix tree]] and [[string searching]] by factor oracle algorithm (basically a ''factor oracle'' is a ﬁnite state automaton constructed in linear time and space in an incremental fashion&lt;ref&gt;Allauzen C., Crochemore M., Raﬃnot M., ''Factor oracle: a new structure for pattern matching; Proceedings of SOFSEM’99; Theory and Practice of Informatics.'' J. Pavelka, G. Tel and M. Bar- 
tosek ed., Milovy, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1725, pp 291-306, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 
1999. ISBN 3-540-66694-X.&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Uses of Machine Improvisation===
Machine Improvisation encourages musical creativity by providing automatic modeling and transformation structures for existing music. This creates a natural interface with the musician without need for coding musical algorithms. In live performance, the system re-injects  the musician's material in several different ways, allowing a semantics-level representation of the session and a smart recombination and transformation of this material in real-time. In offline version, Machine Improvisation can be used to achieve style mixing, an approach inspired by Vannevar Bush's [[memex]] imaginary machine.

===Implementations===
Matlab implementation of the Factor Oracle machine improvisation can be found as part of [[Computer Audition]] toolbox.

OMax is a software environment developed in IRCAM. OMax uses [[OpenMusic]] and Max. It is based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by Gerard Assayag and Shlomo Dubnov and on researches on improvisation with the computer by G. Assayag, M. Chemillier and G. Bloch (aka the'' OMax Brothers'') in the Ircam Music Representations group.

==Live coding==
{{Main|Live coding}}
Live coding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1017/S135577180300030X}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes known as 'interactive programming', 'on-the-fly programming',&lt;ref&gt;Wang G. &amp; Cook P. (2004) [http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/publications/on-the-fly_nime2004.pdf &quot;On-the-fly Programming: Using Code as an Expressive Musical Instrument&quot;], In ''Proceedings of the 2004 International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)'' (New York: NIME, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 'just in time programming') is the name given to the process of writing [[software]] in realtime as part of a [[performance]]. Historically, similar techniques were used to produce early [[computer art]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, but recently it has been explored as a more rigorous alternative to laptop musicians who, live coders often feel, lack the charisma and pizzazz of [[musicians]] performing live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/0749446032000156919 | author = Collins, N. | year = 2003 | title = Generative Music and Laptop Performance | url =  | journal = Contemporary Music Review | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 67–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, this practice stages a more general approach: one of interactive programming, of writing (parts of) programs while they are interpreted. Traditionally most computer music programs have tended toward the old write/compile/run model which evolved when computers were much less powerful. This approach has locked out code-level innovation by people whose programming skills are more modest. Some programs have gradually integrated real-time controllers and gesturing (for example, [[MIDI]]-driven software synthesis and parameter control). Until recently, however, the musician/composer rarely had the capability of real-time modification of program code itself. This legacy distinction is somewhat erased by languages such as [[ChucK]], [[SuperCollider]], and [[Impromptu (programming environment)|Impromptu]].

[[TOPLAP]], an ad-hoc conglomerate of artists interested in live coding was formed in 2004, and promotes the use, proliferation and exploration of a range of software, languages and techniques to implement live coding. This is a parallel and collaborative effort e.g. with research at the [[Princeton Sound Lab]], the  [[University of Cologne]], and the Computational Arts Research Group at [[Queensland University of Technology]].

{{Other uses}}
A '''concept''' (substantive term: '''conception''') is a [[cognitive]] unit of ''[[meaning]]''—an [[abstraction|abstract]] [[idea]] or a mental [[symbol]] sometimes defined as a &quot;unit of knowledge,&quot; built from other units which act as a concept's [[characteristics]]. A concept is typically associated with a corresponding [[representation]] in a [[language]] or [[symbology]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} such as a single meaning of a [[Terminology|term]].

There are prevailing [[philosophical theory|theories]] in [[contemporary philosophy]] which attempt to [[explain]] the nature of concepts. The [[representational theory of mind]] proposes that concepts are [[mental representation]]s, while the [[semantic]] theory of concepts (originating with [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s distinction between [[concept and object]]) holds that they are [[abstract objects]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?'', Eric Margolis and Stephen Laurence&lt;/ref&gt; [[Idea]]s are taken to be concepts, although abstract concepts do not necessarily appear to the mind as images as some ideas do.&lt;ref&gt;Cambribdge Dictionary of Philosophy, ed. Audi&lt;/ref&gt; Many philosophers consider concepts to be a fundamental [[ontological]] category of [[being]].

The meaning of &quot;concept&quot; is explored in mainstream [[information science]],&lt;ref&gt;Stock, W.G. (2010). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.21382/abstract Concepts and semantic relations in information science]. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 61(10), 1951-1969.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (2009). Concept Theory. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60(8), 1519–1536 &lt;/ref&gt; [[cognitive science]], [[metaphysics]], and [[philosophy of mind]]. The term &quot;concept&quot; is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''conceptum'' - &quot;something conceived&quot;),{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but what is today termed &quot;the classical theory of concepts&quot; is the theory of [[Aristotle]] on the definition of terms.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Origin and acquisition of concepts==
===''A posteriori'' abstractions===
[[John Locke]]'s description of a ''general idea'' corresponds to a description of a concept. According to Locke, a general idea is created by abstracting, drawing away, or removing the uncommon characteristic or characteristics from several particular ideas. The remaining common characteristic is that which is similar to all of the different individuals. For example, the abstract general idea or concept that is designated by the word &quot;red&quot; is that characteristic which is common to apples, cherries, and blood. The abstract general idea or concept that is signified by the word &quot;dog&quot; is the collection of those characteristics which are common to Airedales, Collies, and Chihuahuas.

In the same tradition as Locke, [[John Stuart Mill]] stated that general conceptions are formed through abstraction. A general conception is the common element among the many images of members of a class. &quot;...[W]hen we form a set of phenomena into a class, that is, when we compare them with one another to ascertain in what they agree, some general conception is implied in this mental operation&quot; (''[[A System of Logic]]'', Book IV, Ch. II). Mill did not believe that concepts exist in the mind before the act of abstraction. &quot;It is not a law of our intellect, that, in comparing things with each other and taking note of their agreement, we merely recognize as realized in the outward world something that we already had in our minds. The conception originally found its way to us as the ''result'' of such a comparison. It was obtained (in metaphysical phrase) by ''abstraction'' from individual things&quot; (''Ibid.'').

For [[Schopenhauer]], empirical concepts &quot;...are mere abstractions from what is known through intuitive [[perception]], and they have arisen from our arbitrarily thinking away or dropping of some qualities and our retention of others.&quot; (''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, &quot;Sketch of a History of the [[Ideal]] and the [[Reality|Real]]&quot;). In his ''[[On the Will in Nature]]'', &quot;Physiology and Pathology,&quot; Schopenhauer said that a concept is &quot;drawn off from previous images ... by putting off their differences. This concept is then no longer intuitively perceptible, but is denoted and fixed merely by words.&quot; [[Nietzsche]], who was heavily influenced by Schopenhauer, wrote: &quot;Every concept originates through our equating what is unequal. No leaf ever wholly equals another, and the concept 'leaf' is formed through an arbitrary abstraction from these individual differences, through forgetting the distinctions...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On Truth and Lie in an Extra–Moral Sense,&quot; ''The Portable Nietzsche'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast to the above philosophers, [[Immanuel Kant]] held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result of abstraction &quot;a posteriori concepts&quot; (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''[[a posteriori]]'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1).

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

Kant's description of the making of a concept has been paraphrased as &quot;...to conceive is essentially to think in abstraction what is common to a plurality of possible instances...&quot; (H.J. Paton, ''Kant's Metaphysics of Experience'', I, 250). In his discussion of Kant, Christopher Janaway wrote: &quot;...generic concepts are formed by abstraction from more than one species.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Janaway, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', Ch. 3, p. 112, Oxford, 2003, ISBN 0-19-825003-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A priori'' concepts===
{{Main|Category (Kant)}}
Kant declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are 12 categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''a posteriori'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]].

==Conceptual structure==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
It seems intuitively obvious that concepts must have some kind of structure. Up until recently, the dominant view of conceptual structure was a containment model, associated with the classical view of concepts. According to this model, a concept is endowed with certain necessary and sufficient conditions in their description which unequivocally determine an extension. The containment model allows for no degrees; a thing is either in, or out, of the concept's extension. By contrast, the inferential model understands conceptual structure to be determined in a graded manner, according to the tendency of the concept to be used in certain kinds of inferences. As a result, concepts do not have a kind of structure that is in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions; all conditions are contingent (Margolis:5).

However, some theorists claim that primitive concepts lack any structure at all. For instance, [[Jerry Fodor]] presents his Asymmetric Dependence Theory as a way of showing how a primitive concept's content is determined by a reliable relationship between the information in mental contents and the world. These sorts of claims are referred to as &quot;atomistic&quot;, because the primitive concept is treated as if it were a genuine atom.

==One possible and likely structure==

Concepts are formed by people's (or other) minds while reflecting upon their environment, subject to their sensory organs/sensors and the way such minds are in contact with their immediate and distant environment. The location of concepts is therefore assumed to be within the mind of such an organism/mechanism, more specifically in their head or equivalent place deemed to be the organ used for thinking (system of nerves or equivalent). However Concepts can be expressed in language and externalised by writing or other means such as Wikipedia. Others hold different views, such as [[Karl Jung]], who holds that concepts may be attributed to space other than within the inside boundaries of any body or mass or material formation of living creatures. In fact some people even assume that inanimate object also have such property as &quot;a concept&quot; within their own solid structure.

==The dual nature of concepts==

Clearly, the location of concepts is not decided for good yet, but it looks certain that they are related to the external world or the environment, of which of course such a living and &quot;thinking&quot; creature is a part of. Thus a concept is started from outside, in the relation of conception, hence the subject is subjected to an object and has a concept of that object in a black box usually referred to as the mind. Such a content of the mind is then related to the original object that is reflected in and by the mind (for short) and it is also given another form to enable the creature to communicate about his/her/its experience of that object. In case of humans, it is usually a symbol or sign, maybe that of a language which is then also related to the external object and the internal concept in the triangle of meaning (which is the same as the [[triangle of reference]]). Do not forget that as we speak of existence as inseparable from space and time, such a relationship is established in time, meaning that whoever has a concept of whatever object with whichever name will have the three inputs synchronized. And should he be not alone at that location, he/she etc. will also check that what/whom he sees as existing is real, &quot;objective&quot;, and not &quot;subjective&quot; (prone to various errors) through a dialog with the members of his/her race or community.

==Conceptual content==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Content as pragmatic role===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Embodied content===
In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with [[Concept#William James's truth|Jamesian pragmatism]] (above), the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.

==Philosophical implications==
===Concepts and metaphilosophy===
A long and well-established tradition philosophy posits that philosophy itself is nothing more than [[conceptual analysis]]. This view has its proponents in contemporary literature as well as historical. According to [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]]'s ''What Is Philosophy?'' (1991), philosophy is the activity of creating concepts. This creative activity differs from previous definitions of philosophy as simple [[reasoning]], [[communication]] or [[contemplation]] of [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]. Concepts are specific to philosophy: science creates &quot;[[Function (biology)|functions]]&quot;, and art &quot;sensations&quot;. A concept is always ''signed'': thus, [[Descartes]]' [[Cogito ergo sum|''Cogito'']] or [[Kant]]'s &quot;[[transcendence (philosophy)#&quot;Transcendence&quot; in Modern Philosophy|transcendental]]&quot;. It is a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]], not universal, and connects itself with others concepts, on a &quot;[[plane of immanence]]&quot; traced by a particular philosophy. Concepts can jump from one plane of immanence to another, combining with other concepts and therefore engaging in a &quot;becoming-[[Other]].&quot;

===Concepts in epistemology===
{{details|List of concepts in science}}
Concepts are vital to the development of scientific knowledge. For example, it would be difficult to imagine physics without concepts like: [[energy]], [[force]], or [[acceleration]]. Concepts help to integrate apparently unrelated [[observations]] and [[phenomena]] into viable hypotheses and theories, the basic ingredients of science. The [[concept map]] is a tool that is used to help researchers visualize the inter-relationships between various concepts.

===Ontology of concepts===
Although the mainstream literature in cognitive science regards the concept as a kind of mental particular, it has been suggested by some theorists that concepts are real things (Margolis:8). In most radical form, the realist about concepts attempts to show that the supposedly mental processes are not mental at all; rather, they are abstract entities, which are just as real as any mundane object.

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of appearance or existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

==Concepts in Empirical Investigations==
Concepts, as abstract units of meaning, play a key role in the development and testing of theories. For example, a simple relational [[hypothesis]] can be viewed as either a conceptual hypothesis (where the abstract concepts form the meaning) or an operationalized hypothesis, which is situated in the real world by rules of interpretation. For example, take the simple hypothesis Education increases Income. The abstract notion of education and income (concepts) could have many meanings. A conceptual [[hypothesis]] cannot be tested. They need to be converted into operational hypothesis or the abstract meaning of education must be derived or operationalized to something in the real world that can be measured. Education could be measured by “years of school completed” or “highest degree completed” etc. Income could be measured by “hourly rate of pay” or “yearly salary” etc. The system of concepts or [[conceptual framework]] can take on many levels of complexity. When the [[conceptual framework]] is very complex and incorporates causality or explanation they are generally referred to as a theory. Noted philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] says this more eloquently “An adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory: The hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena. Frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory; but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived.”&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, IL: The [[University of Chicago Press]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between the [[conceptual framework]] and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested (interpreted framework). “The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretative connections, the network can function as a scientific theory”.&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell described joining the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) during college as one of the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had &quot;found himself.&quot; [[Officer cadet|Cadet]] Powell joined the [[Pershing Rifles]], the ROTC fraternal organization and [[Military Drill Team|drill team]] begun by General [[John Pershing]].

Powell was a [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] during the [[Vietnam War]], serving as a [[South Vietnamese Army]] adviser from 1962 to 1963. While on patrol in a [[Viet Cong]]-held area, he was wounded by stepping on a [[punji stake]].&lt;ref name=Kearny_p179&gt;{{Cite book

He was charged with investigating a detailed letter by Tom Glen (a soldier from the [[11th Light Infantry Brigade]]), which backed up rumored allegations of the [[My Lai Massacre]]. Powell wrote: &quot;In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the [[Vietnamese people]] are excellent.&quot; Later, Powell's assessment would be described as [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]]ing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004 Powell said to [[Larry King]], &quot;I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

Powell served a [[White House fellowship]], a highly selective and prestigious position, under President [[Richard Nixon]] from 1972 to 1973.

In his autobiography, ''My American Journey'', Powell named several officers he served under that inspired and mentored him. As a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] serving in South Korea, Powell was very close to General [[Henry &quot;Gunfighter&quot; Emerson]]. Powell said he regarded Emerson as one of the most caring officers he ever met. Emerson was reputedly eccentric; he insisted his troops train only at night and made them repeatedly watch the television film ''[[Brian's Song]]'' to promote racial harmony. Powell always professed, however, that what set Emerson apart, was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare.

In the early 1980s, Powell served at [[Fort Carson, Colorado]]. After he left Fort Carson, Powell became senior military assistant to [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Caspar Weinberger]], whom he assisted during the [[Invasion of Grenada|1983 invasion of Grenada]] and the [[1986 Bombing of Libya|1986 airstrike on Libya]].

In 1986, he took over the command of V Corps in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], from [[Robert Lewis &quot;Sam&quot; Wetzel]]. Following the [[Iran Contra]] scandal, Powell became [[Ronald Reagan]]'s National Security Advisor, serving from 1987 to 1989. In April 1989, Powell was promoted to General and briefly served as the Commander in Chief, Forces Command, headquartered at [[Fort McPherson, Georgia]]. Later that year, President George H.W. Bush selected him as Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/inauguration/transition/powell.html |title=Online NewsHour: Colin Powell |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, he oversaw 28 crises, including the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] in 1989 to remove General [[Manuel Noriega]] from power and [[Operation Desert Storm]] in the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. During these events, Powell earned his nickname, &quot;the reluctant warrior.&quot; He rarely advocated military intervention as the first solution to an [[international crisis]], and instead usually prescribed [[diplomacy]] and [[containment]].

In his autobiography, Powell said he is haunted by the nightmare of the Vietnam War and felt that the leadership was very ineffective. Powell served a tour in Vietnam as a military adviser, and was mildly injured when he stepped on a bamboo &quot;[[punji stick]]&quot;. The large infection made it difficult for him to walk, and caused his foot to swell for a short time, shortening his first tour. It was also during his Vietnam service, his second tour, that Powell was decorated for bravery. He single-handedly rescued several men from a burning [[helicopter]], one of them being Maj. Gen. Charles Gettys, the commander of the [[Americal Division]].
[[File:DA-SD-05-00599.jpg|thumb|upright|General Colin Powell, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, waves from his motorcade during the Persian Gulf War Welcome Home Parade in New York City.]]

Additionally, Powell has been critical of other instances of [[U.S. foreign policy]] in the past, such as its support for the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]]. From two separate interviews in 2003, Powell stated in one about the 1973 event &quot;I can't justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time. It was a different time. There was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world. Communism was a threat to the [[democracy|democracies]] in this part of the world. It was a threat to the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/news/2003/02/dos022003.html |title=Remarks at the 2003 Groundhog Job Shadow Day Program, Secretary Colin L.

As a [[military strategist]], Powell has advocated an approach to military conflicts that maximizes the potential for success and minimizes casualties. A component of this approach is the use of overwhelming force, which he applied to Operation Desert Storm in 1991. His approach has been dubbed the &quot;[[Powell Doctrine]]&quot;.

==Potential candidate==
Powell's experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both American political parties. Many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations.

In 1997 Powell founded [[America's Promise]] with the objective of helping children from all [[socioeconomic]] sectors.

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential Election]] Powell campaigned for Senator [[John McCain]] and later Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]] after the latter secured the Republican [[presidential nomination|nomination]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Bush eventually won, and Powell was appointed Secretary of State.

==Secretary of State==

As [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the Bush administration, Powell was perceived as moderate. Powell was unanimously voted in by the [[United States Senate]]. Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in 30 years.
&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost_Kessler_20040714 &gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=

On [[September 11, 2001]], Powell was in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], meeting with President [[Alejandro Toledo]] and [[US Ambassador]] John Hamilton, and attending the special session of the [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|OAS General Assembly]] that subsequently adopted the [[Inter-American Democratic Charter]]. After the [[9/11 terrorist attacks|terrorist attacks]], Powell's job became of critical importance in managing America's relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the [[War on Terrorism]].

Powell came under fire for his role in [[Rationale for the Iraq War|building the case]] for the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. In a press statement on February 24, 2001 he had said that [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against Iraq had prevented the development of any [[weapons of mass destruction]] by [[Saddam Hussein]]. As was the case in the days leading up to the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Saddam, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Saddam. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks, an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] in front of the [[9/11 Commission]]. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a [[Unilateralism|unilateral approach]]. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.

[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|Colin Powell holding a [[2001 anthrax attack|model vial of anthrax]] while giving a presentation to the [[United Nations Security Council]]]]

Powell's chief role was to [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war|garner international support]] for a multi-national [[coalition]] to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell [[United_Nations_Security_Council_and_the_Iraq_War#Colin_Powell.27s_presentation|addressed a plenary session]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on February 5, 2003 to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that &quot;there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more.&quot;&lt;ref name=UNSC_Powell_20030205&gt;

Most observers praised Powell's oratorical skills. However, [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' reported soon afterwards that a [[Iraq Dossier|UK intelligence dossier]] that Powell had referred to as a &quot;fine paper&quot; during his presentation had been based on old material and [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] an essay by American graduate student [[Ibrahim al-Marashi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/529|title=U.S. Scholar Uncredited in Iraq Report|last=Lawless|first=Jill|date=February 7, 2003|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN_20030207&gt;

A 2004 report by the [[Iraq Survey Group]] concluded that the evidence that Powell offered to support the allegation that the Iraqi government possessed [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) was inaccurate.

A Senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the [[yellowcake forgery]].&lt;ref name=LAT_Miller_20040715&gt;

Because Powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]]. At times, infighting among the Powell-led State Department, the Rumsfeld-led Defense Department, and Cheney's office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues, such as what actions to take regarding [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].

Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that &quot;what one person knew, everyone else knew.&quot;

Powell announced his resignation as Secretary of State on November 15, 2004. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', he had been asked to resign by the president's chief of staff, [[Andrew Card]].&lt;ref name=DeYoung2006/&gt; Powell announced that he would stay on until the end of Bush's first term or until his replacement's confirmation by Congress. The following day, Bush nominated National Security Advisor [[Condoleezza Rice]] as Powell's successor. News of Powell's leaving the Administration spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the world&amp;nbsp;— some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the Bush administration, but others hoping for Powell's successor to wield more influence within the cabinet.

In mid-November, Powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that [[Iran]] was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system.&lt;ref name=NYT_Sciolino_20041118&gt;

Blumenthal added that &quot;The foreign relations committee has discovered that Bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to 10 intercepts by the [[National Security Agency]].

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the [[White House]] of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. In September 2006, Powell sided with more moderate Senate Republicans in supporting more rights for detainees and opposing President Bush's [[terrorism]] bill. He backed Senators [[John Warner]], [[John McCain]] and [[Lindsey Graham]] in their statement that U.S. military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the U.S. in the name of fighting terrorism.

Powell has been the recipient of mild criticism for his role with ''Get Motivated'' which has been called a &quot;get-rich-quick-without-much-effort, feel-good schemology.&quot;&lt;ref name=AmericanSatellite_Wilken_20080907&gt;{{cite web

Powell, in honor of [[Martin Luther King Day]], dropped the ceremonial first puck at a [[New York Islanders]] [[hockey]] game at [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum|Nassau Coliseum]] on January 21, 2008.

Recently, Powell has encouraged young people to continue to use new technologies to their advantage in the future. In a speech at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] to a room of young professionals, he said, &quot;That's your generation...a generation that is hard-wired digital, a generation that understands the power of the information revolution and how it is transforming the world. A generation that you represent, and you're coming together to share; to debate; to decide; to connect with each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=CSIS_20080708&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 20, 2008

In 2008, Powell served as a spokesperson for [[National Mentoring Month]], a campaign held each January to recruit volunteer mentors for at-risk youth.&lt;ref name=mentor2008&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

Soon after [[Barack Obama]]'s [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], Powell began being mentioned as a possible [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]] member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2008/11/11/al-gore-colin-powell-caroline-kennedy-in-obamas-administration.html |title=Al Gore, Colin Powell, Caroline Kennedy in Obama's Administration? - Washington Whispers |publisher=usnews.com |date=November 11, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not nominated.

In September 2009, Powell advised President Obama against surging US forces in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Powell advised against Afghan surge,&quot; Politico (9/27/2009). http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/0909/Powell_advised_against_Afghan_surge.html&lt;/ref&gt; The president announced the surge the following December.

==Political views==
A moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Powell is well known for his willingness to support [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] or centrist causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;[http://www.ontheissues.org/Colin_Powell.htm Colin Powell's biography from] [http://www.issues2000.org/default.htm 'On The Issues'].&lt;/ref&gt; He is [[pro-choice]] regarding [[abortion]], and in favor of &quot;reasonable&quot; [[gun control]].&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;/&gt; He stated in his autobiography that he supports [[affirmative action]] that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving persons because of racial issues. Powell was also instrumental in the 1993 implementation of the military's [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy,&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;/&gt; though he later supported its repeal as proposed by [[Robert Gates]] and Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] in January 2010, saying &quot;circumstances had changed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Colin Powell shifts stance on 'don't ask, don't tell' policy |author=DeYoung, Karen |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/03/AR2010020302292.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnam War had a profound effect on Powell's views of the proper use of military force. These views are described in detail in the autobiography ''My American Journey''. The [[Powell Doctrine]], as the views became known, was a central component of US policy in the [[Gulf War]] (the first U.S. war in Iraq) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] (the overthrow of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]] following the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]]). The hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation, and the use of overwhelming military force.

Powell was the subject of controversy in 2004 when, in a conversation with [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]], he reportedly referred to [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] within the Bush administration as &quot;fucking crazies.&quot;&lt;ref name=Guardian_Blumenthal_20041118&gt;

In a September 2006 letter to Sen. [[John McCain]], General Powell expressed opposition to President Bush's push for [[military tribunals]] of those formerly and currently classified as [[enemy combatants]]. Specifically, he objected to the effort in Congress to &quot;redefine Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention.&quot; He also asserted: &quot;The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sen. McCain Releases Letter from Gen. Colin Powell,&quot; Washington Post (September 14, 2006). http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/09/14/GR2006091400728.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===View of the U.S. war in Iraq===
While Powell was wary of a military solution, he supported the decision to invade Iraq after the administration concluded the diplomatic track had failed. After his departure from the State Department, Powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for the war.

At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in [[Colorado]],&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.aifestival.org/ Official website: Aspen Ideas Festival ]&lt;/ref&gt; Powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush &quot;the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers.&quot; During this discussion, he insisted that the US appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: &quot;I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 interview on [[CNN]], Powell reiterated his support for the 2003 decision to invade Iraq in the context of his endorsement of [[Barack Obama]], stating: &quot;My role has been very, very straightforward. I wanted to avoid a war. The president [Bush] agreed with me. We tried to do that. We couldn't get it through the U.N. and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I've never blinked from that. I've never said I didn't support a decision to go to war.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;edition.cnn.com&quot;&gt;&quot;Powell: Support for Obama doesn't mean Iraq war wrong,&quot; CNN (October 19, 2008). http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/19/powell.transcript/&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell's position on the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] has been less clear. In December 2006, he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the US had enough troops to carry it out successfully. He stated: &quot;I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James M. Klatell, &quot;Powell: We Are Losing In Iraq,&quot; CBS (December 17, 2006). http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/17/ftn/main2274583.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Following his endorsement of [[Barack Obama]] in October 2008, however, Powell praised [[David Petraeus|General David Petraeus]] and US troops, as well as the Iraqi government, concluding that &quot;it's starting to turn around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;edition.cnn.com&quot;/&gt; By mid-2009, he had concluded a surge of US forces in Iraq should have come sooner, perhaps in late 2003.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Powell says Iraq surge should have come earlier,&quot; Seattle Times (July 5, 2009). http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2009420450_apuspowell.html&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, Powell consistently argued that Iraqi political progress was essential, not just military force.

===Role in presidential election of 2008===

He also added that he was &quot;troubled&quot; by the &quot;false intimations that Obama was [[Muslim]].&quot; Powell stated that &quot;[Obama] is a Christian&amp;nbsp;— he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America.&quot; Powell then referenced [[Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan]], a [[List of North American Muslims|Muslim American]] soldier in the [[U.S. Army]] who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, &quot;Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me.&quot;&lt;ref name=obamaendorse&gt;{{Cite news

*The Coat of Arms of Colin Powell was granted by the [[Lord Lyon]] in [[Edinburgh]] on February 4, 2004. Technically the grant was to Powell's father (a British subject) to be passed on by descent. Scotland's [[King of Arms]] is traditionally responsible for granting arms to Commonwealth citizens of Scottish descent. Blazoned as:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Azure, two swords in saltire points downwards between four mullets Argent, on a chief of the Second a lion passant Gules. On a wreath of the Liveries is set for Crest the head of an American bald-headed eagle erased Proper. And in an escrol over the same this motto, &quot;DEVOTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE.&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;The swords and stars refer to the former general's career, as does the crest, which is the badge of the 101st Airborne (which he served as a brigade commander in the mid-1970s). The lion may be an allusion to Scotland. The shield can be shown surrounded by the insignia of an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Honorable [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB), an award the General received after the first Gulf War.
*In 2005 Powell received the [[Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award]] for his contributions to Africa.

'''Chlorophyll''' (also '''chlorophyl''')  is a green [[pigment]] found in almost all [[plant]]s, [[alga]]e, and [[cyanobacteria]]. Its name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words χλωρος, ''chloros'' (&quot;green&quot;) and φύλλον, ''phyllon'' (&quot;leaf&quot;). Chlorophyll is an extremely important biomolecule, critical in [[photosynthesis]], which allows plants to obtain [[energy]] from light. Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], followed by the red portion. However, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum; hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues.&lt;ref&gt;

==Chlorophyll and photosynthesis==
Chlorophyll is vital for [[photosynthesis]], which allows plants to obtain energy from light.

Chlorophyll molecules are specifically arranged in and around [[photosystem]]s that are embedded in the [[thylakoid]] membranes of [[chloroplast]]s. In these complexes, chlorophyll serves two primary functions. The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy by [[resonance energy transfer]] to a specific chlorophyll pair in the [[reaction center]] of the photosystems.

The two currently accepted photosystem units are [[Photosystem II]] and [[Photosystem I]], which have their own distinct reaction center chlorophylls, named P680 and P700, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; These pigments are named after the wavelength (in [[nanometer]]s) of their red-peak absorption maximum. The identity, function and spectral properties of the types of chlorophyll in each photosystem are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them. Once extracted from the protein into a solvent (such as [[acetone]] or [[methanol]]),&lt;ref name=Marker1972&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; these chlorophyll pigments can be separated in a simple [[paper chromatography]] experiment and, based on the number of polar groups between [[chlorophyll a]] and [[chlorophyll b]], will chemically separate out on the paper.

The function of the reaction center chlorophyll is to use the energy absorbed by and transferred to it from the other chlorophyll pigments in the photosystems to undergo a charge separation, a specific [[redox]] reaction in which the chlorophyll donates an [[electron]] into a series of molecular intermediates called an [[electron transport chain]]. The charged reaction center chlorophyll (P680&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron. In Photosystem II, the electron that reduces P680&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, and is the source for practically all the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II; thus the P700&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of Photosystem I is usually reduced, via many intermediates in the thylakoid membrane, by electrons ultimately from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylakoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can vary.

The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to shuttle H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the thylakoid membrane, setting up a [[chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] potential used mainly to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] chemical energy; and those electrons ultimately reduce NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to [[NADPH]], a universal [[redox|reductant]] used to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into sugars as well as for other biosynthetic reductions.

Reaction center chlorophyll–protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without other chlorophyll pigments, but the absorption cross section (the likelihood of absorbing a photon under a given light intensity) is small. Thus, the remaining chlorophylls in the photosystem and antenna pigment protein complexes associated with the photosystems all cooperatively absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center. Besides chlorophyll ''a'', there are other pigments, called [[accessory pigment]]s, which occur in these pigment–protein antenna complexes.

A green sea slug, ''[[Elysia chlorotica]]'', has been found to use the chlorophyll it has eaten to perform photosynthesis for itself. This process is known as [[kleptoplasty]], and no other animal has been found to have this ability.

===Why green and not black===
[[File:Black Pearl Plant.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Black plants can absorb more radiation, and yet most plants are green]]
It is as yet unclear exactly why plants (or rather, their light absorbing molecule, chlorophyll) have mostly evolved to be green. Green plants reflect mostly green and near-green light to viewers rather than absorbing it. Other parts of the system of [[photosynthesis]] still allow green plants to use the green light spectrum (e.g. through a light-trapping [[leaf]] structure, [[carotenoids]], etc). The point is that green plants are still not utilizing a large part of the visible spectrum as easily as they could. A black plant can absorb more radiation, and this could be very useful - issues of managing this extra heat and radiation notwithstanding (e.g. some plants must close their openings, called [[stoma]], on hot days to avoid losing too much water). More precisely, the question becomes why the only light absorbing molecule used for power in plants is green and not simply black. 

Biologist John Berman offers that evolution is [[Argument from poor design|not an engineer]], and so it is often subject to various limitations that an engineer is not. Even ''if'' black were better, evolution's limitations can prevent species from climbing to the absolute highest peak on the [[fitness landscape]]. Berman says that evolving pigments that work nearly as well as chlorophyll, or that successfully modify it, could be very difficult. In fact, all higher plants ([[Embryophyte]]s) are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor that is a sort of [[green algae]] - with the idea being that chlorophyll evolved only once.
&lt;ref name=JohnBerman&gt;[http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/answers/viewtopic.php?id=3837 askabiologist.org/uk, Jonathan Max Berman, &quot;Why did plants evolve green, not black?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, Berman points out that species of [[archae]] do use another light absorbing molecule, [[Retinal]], to extract energy from sunlight's green spectrum.&lt;ref name=Schafer&gt;{{

This could have left open a &quot;niche&quot; for green organisms which would absorb the other wavelengths of sunlight. This is just a possibility, however, and Berman says scientists are still not convinced of any one explanation.&lt;ref name=JohnBerman/&gt;

==Chemical structure==
[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the chlorophyll a molecule]]
Chlorophyll is a [[chlorin]] pigment, which is structurally similar to and produced through the same metabolic pathway as other [[porphyrin]] pigments such as [[heme]].  At the center of the chlorin ring is a [[magnesium]] [[ion]]. For the structures depicted in this article, some of the [[ligand]]s attached to the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center are omitted for clarity. The chlorin ring can have several different side chains, usually including a long [[phytol]] chain.  There are a few different forms that occur naturally, but the most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll ''a''.  The general structure of chlorophyll ''a'' was elucidated by [[Hans Fischer]] in 1940, and by 1960, when most of the stereochemistry of chlorophyll ''a'' was known, [[Robert Burns Woodward]] published a total synthesis of the molecule as then known.&lt;ref&gt;

When leaves degreen in the process of [[plant senescence]], chlorophyll is converted to a group of colourless [[tetrapyrrole]]s known as '''nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites''' (NCC's) with the general structure:

The spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified ''in vivo'' depending on specific pigment-protein interactions.]]
Measurement of the absorption of light is complicated by the solvent used to extract it from plant material, which affects the values obtained,
*In [[diethyl ether]], chlorophyll ''a'' has approximate absorbance maxima of 430&amp;nbsp;nm and 662&amp;nbsp;nm, while chlorophyll ''b'' has approximate maxima of 453&amp;nbsp;nm and 642&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=March 2011}}
*The absorption peaks of chlorophyll ''a'' are at 665&amp;nbsp;nm and 465&amp;nbsp;nm. Chlorophyll ''a'' [[fluorescence|fluoresces]] at 673&amp;nbsp;nm (maximum) and 726&amp;nbsp;nm.

By measuring [[chlorophyll fluorescence]], plant [[ecophysiology]] can be investigated. [[Chlorophyll fluorescence#Chlorophyll fluorometers|Chlorophyll fluorometers]] are used by plant researchers to assess plant stress.

==Biosynthesis==
{{See|Protochlorophyllide}}
In plants, chlorophyll may be synthesized from [[succinyl-CoA]] and [[glycine]], although the immediate precursor to chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'' is [[protochlorophyllide]]. In [[Angiosperm]] plants, the last step, conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll, is light-dependent and such plants are pale ([[etiolation|etiolated]]) if grown in the darkness. [[Non-vascular plant]]s and green algae have an additional light-independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness as well.

Chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a [[photosensitizer]], forming highly toxic [[free radicals]]. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide; so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;

{{See|Chlorosis}}
Chlorosis is a condition in which [[leaf|leaves]] produce insufficient chlorophyll, turning them yellow. Chlorosis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|iron]]--called iron chlorosis—or by a shortage of [[Magnesium deficiency|magnesium]] or [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen]].  Soil pH sometimes plays a role in nutrient-caused chlorosis; many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pH levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this.&lt;ref&gt;

==Measuring chlorophyll==
The chlorophyll content of leaves can be non-destructively measured using hand-held, battery-powered meters.&lt;ref name=CCM200&gt;http://www.adc.co.uk/Products/CCM-200_plus_Chlorophyll_Content_Meter&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chlorophyll fluorescence.tif|thumb|alt=The absorption spectrum of chlorophyll, showing the transmittance wavelength (nm) that is measured by a Chlorophyll Content Meter to calculate the relative chlorophyll content|The absorption spectrum of chlorophyll, showing the transmittance band measured by a CCM200 Chlorophyll Meter to calculate the relative chlorophyll content]]Chlorophyll Content meters measure the optical absorption of a leaf to estimate it's chlorophyll content. Chlorophyll molecules absorb in the blue and red bands, but not the green and infra-red bands. Chlorophyll content meters measure the amount of absorption at the red band to estimate the amount of chlorophyll present in the leaf. To compensate for varying leaf thickness, Chlorophyll Meters also measure absorption at the infrared band which is not significantly affected by chlorophyll. For instance, the [http://www.adc.co.uk/Products/CCM-200_plus_Chlorophyll_Content_Meter/ CCM200plus Chlorophyll Meter] measures the transmittance at 653&amp;nbsp;nm (in the red band) and transmittance at 931&amp;nbsp;nm (in the infrared band). The percentage of transmittance at 931&amp;nbsp;nm, relative to the percentage of transmittance at 653&amp;nbsp;nm, estimates the relative chlorophyll content of the leaf. 

The measurements made by these devices are simple, quick and relatively inexpensive. They now, typically, have large data storage capacity, averaging and graphical displays.&lt;ref name=CCM200/&gt;

==Culinary use==
Chlorophyll is registered as a food additive (colorant), and its [[E number]] is '''E140'''. Chefs use chlorophyll to color a variety of foods and beverages green, such as pasta and [[absinthe]].&lt;ref name=Adams2004&gt;

[[Image:CarrotDiversityLg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Carotene''' is responsible for the orange colour of the [[carrot]]s and many other fruits and vegetables.]]

The term '''carotene''' (also '''carotin''', from the Latin ''carota'', or carrot&lt;ref&gt;Mosby’s Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book 1994, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;) is used for several related hydrocarbon substances having the formula C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, which are synthesized by plants but cannot be made by animals. Carotene is an [[orange (color)|orange]] [[photosynthetic pigment]] important for [[photosynthesis]]. Carotenes are all coloured to the human eye. They are responsible for the orange colour of the [[carrot]], for which this class of chemicals is named, and for the colours of many other fruits and vegetables (for example, [[sweet potatoes]] and orange [[cantaloupe]] melon). Carotenes are also responsible for the orange (but not all of the yellow) colours in dry foliage. They also (in lower concentrations) impart the yellow colouration to milk-fat and butter. Omnivorous animal species which are relatively poor converters of coloured dietary carotenoids to colourless retinoids have yellowed-coloured body fat, as a result of the carotenoid retention from the vegetable portion of their diet. The typical yellow-coloured fat of humans and chickens is a result of fat storage of carotenes from their diets.

Carotenes contribute to photosynthesis by transmitting the light energy they absorb from [[chlorophyll]]. They also protect plant tissues by helping to absorb the energy from [[singlet oxygen]], an excited form of the oxygen molecule O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is formed during photosynthesis.

[[Beta-Carotene|β-Carotene]] is composed of two [[retinol|retinyl]] groups, and is broken down in the [[mucosa]] of the human [[small intestine]] by [[β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase]] to [[retinal]], a form of [[vitamin A]]. β-Carotene can be stored in the [[liver]] and body fat and converted to retinal as needed, thus making it a form of [[vitamin A]] for humans and some other mammals. The carotenes α-carotene and γ-carotene, due to their single retinyl group (beta-[[ionone]] ring), also have some vitamin A activity (though less than β-carotene), as does the [[xanthophyll]] carotenoid β-[[cryptoxanthin]]. All other carotenoids, including [[lycopene]], have no beta-ring and thus '''no''' vitamin A activity (although they may have antioxidant activity and thus biological activity in other ways).

Animal species differ greatly in their ability to convert retinyl (beta-[[ionone]]) containing carotenoids to retinals. Carnivores in general are poor converters of dietary ionine-containg carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as cats and ferets lack [[β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase]] and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinals at all (resulting in carotenes '''not''' being a form of vitamin A for these species).

==Molecular structure==
Chemically, carotenes are polyunsaturated hydrocarbons containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule, variable numbers of hydrogen atoms, and no other elements. Some carotenes are terminated by hydrocarbon rings, on one or both ends of the molecule. All are coloured to the human eye, due to extensive systems of [[conjugated double bond]]s. Structurally carotenes are [[tetraterpene]]s, synthesized biochemically from eight [[isoprene]] units.

Carotenes are found in plants in two primary forms designated by characters from the [[Greek alphabet]]: [[alpha-Carotene|alpha-carotene]] (α-carotene) and [[beta-Carotene|beta-carotene]] (β-carotene). Gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta (γ, δ, ε, and ζ-carotene) also exist. Since they are hydrocarbons, and therefore contain no oxygen, carotenes are fat-soluble and insoluble in water (in contrast with other [[carotenoids]], the [[xanthophyll]]s, which contain oxygen and thus are less chemically hydrophobic).

Absorption from these foods is enhanced if eaten with fats, as carotenes are fat soluble, and if the food is cooked for a few minutes until the plant [[cell wall]] splits and the colour is released into any liquid. 6 μg of dietary β-carotene supplies the equivalent of 1 μg of retinol, or 1 RE (Retinol Equivalent).  This is equivalent to 3⅓ [[International unit|IU]] of vitamin A.

==The multiple forms==
{{Ref improve section|date=October 2009}}
[[File:Alpha-carotene.svg|thumb|200px|α-carotene]]
[[File:Beta-Carotin.svg|thumb|200px|β-carotene]]

[[File:Delta-carotene.svg|thumb|200px|δ-carotene]]
The two primary [[isomer]]s of carotene, α-carotene and β-carotene, differ in the position of a [[double bond]] (and thus a hydrogen) in the cyclic group at one end (left in the diagram here).

[[beta-Carotene|β-Carotene]] is the more common form and can be found in [[yellow]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], and [[green]] leafy [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s. As a [[rule of thumb]], the greater the intensity of the orange colour of the fruit or vegetable, the more β-carotene it contains.

Carotene protects plant cells against the destructive effects of ultraviolet light. β-Carotene is an [[anti-oxidant]].

==β-Carotene and cancer==
It has been shown in trials that the ingestion of β-carotene at about 30&amp;nbsp;mg/day (10 times the [[Reference Daily Intake]]) increases the rate of lung cancer and prostate cancer in [[smoker]]s and people with a history of [[asbestos]] exposure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

An article on the [[American Cancer Society]] says that [[The Cancer Research Campaign]] has called for warning labels on β-carotene supplements to caution smokers that such supplements may increase the risk of lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Warning_Labels_on_Beta_Carotene_Called_For.asp |title=British Cancer Organization Calls for Warning Labels on Beta-Carotene |date=2000-07-31 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061204074724/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Warning_Labels_on_Beta_Carotene_Called_For.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] published an article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group |title=The effect of vitamin E and beta carotene on the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers in male smokers |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=330 |issue=15 |pages=1029–35 |year=1994 |pmid=8127329 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199404143301501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994 about a trial which examined the relationship between daily supplementation of β-carotene and [[vitamin E]] (alpha-tocopherol) and the incidence of lung cancer. The study was done using supplements and researchers were aware of the epidemiological correlation between carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables and lower lung cancer rates. The research concluded that no reduction in lung cancer was found in the participants using these supplements, and furthermore, these supplements may, in fact, have harmful effects.

The results indicated an increased risk of lung cancer for the participants who consumed the β-carotene supplement and who had lung irritation from [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] or [[asbestos]] exposure, causing the trial to be stopped early.&lt;ref name=fn1 /&gt;

A review of all randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] published in [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] in 2007 found that β-carotene ''increased'' mortality by something between 1 and 8% (Relative Risk 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.08).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Gluud LL, Simonetti RG, Gluud C |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/8/842|journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842}}

==α-carotene and risk of death==
Higher dietary intake and blood serum levels of [[alpha-carotene]] are associated with significantly lower risk of death. (See [[alpha-carotene]] for details and refs.)

==Carotenemia==
{{Main|Carotenodermia}}
Carotenemia or hypercarotenemia is excess carotene, but unlike excess vitamin A, carotene is non-toxic. Although hypercarotenemia is not particularly dangerous, it can lead to an oranging of the skin (carotenodermia), but not the [[conjunctiva]] of eyes (thus easily distinguishing it visually from [[jaundice]]). It is most commonly associated with consumption of an abundance of [[carrot]]s, but it also can be a [[medical sign]] of more dangerous conditions.

==Production==
Most of the world's synthetic supply of carotene comes from a manufacturing complex located in [[Freeport, Texas]] and owned by [[DSM (company)|DSM]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The other major supplier [[BASF]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} also uses a chemical process to produce β-carotene. Together these suppliers account for about 85% of the β-carotene on the market.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In Spain [[Vitatene]] produces natural β-carotene from fungus [[Blakeslea trispora]], as does DSM but at much lower amount when compared to its synthetic β-carotene operation. In Australia, organic β-carotene is produced by [[Aquacarotene Limited]] from dried marine algae ''[[Dunaliella salina]]'' grown in harvesting ponds situated in [[Karratha, Western Australia]]. Cognis Australia Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of the Germany-based company [[Cognis]], is also producing β-carotene from microalgae grown in two sites in Australia that are the world’s largest algae farms. In [[Portugal]], the [[industrial biotechnology]] company [[Biotrend]] is producing natural all-''trans''-β-carotene from a non genetically modified bacteria of the ''[[Sphingomonas]]'' genus isolated from soil.

Carotenes are also found in palm oil, corn, and in the milk of dairy cows,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} causing cow's milk to be light yellow, depending on the feed of the cattle, and the amount of fat in the milk (high-fat milks, such as those produced by [[Guernsey]] cows, tend to be more yellow because their fat content causes them to contain more carotene).

Carotenes are also found in some species of termites, where they apparently have been picked up from the diet of the insects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Total synthesis===
There are currently two commonly used methods of [[total synthesis]] of β-carotene. The first was developed by the Badische Anilin- &amp; Soda-Fabrik ([[BASF]]) and is based on the [[Wittig reaction]] with Wittig himself as patent holder:&lt;ref name=&quot;β-Carotin-1&quot;&gt;Wittig G.; Pommer H.: ''DBP 954247, '''1956'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;β-Carotin-2&quot;&gt;Wittig G.; Pommer H.: ''Chem. Abstr. '''1959''', ''53'', 2279&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:Wittig-9.svg|Carotene synthesis by Wittig|500px]]

The second is a [[Grignard reaction]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} elaborated by [[Hoffman-La Roche]] from the original synthesis of Inhoffen et al.  They are both symmetrical; the BASF synthesis is C20 + C20 , and the Hoffman-La Roche synthesis is C19 + C2 + C19.

==Nomenclature==
Carotenes are [[carotenoids]] containing no oxygen. Carotenoids containing some oxygen are known as [[xanthophyll]]s.

The two ends of the β-carotene molecule are structurally identical, and are called '''β-rings'''. Specifically, the group of nine carbon atoms at each end form a β-ring.

The α-carotene molecule has a β-ring at one end; the other end is called an '''ε-ring'''. There is no such thing as an &quot;α-ring&quot;.

These and similar names for the ends of the carotenoid molecules form the basis of a systematic naming scheme, according to which:
* α-carotene is '''β,ε-carotene''';
* β-carotene is '''β,β-carotene''';
* γ-carotene (with one β ring and one uncyclized end that is labelled ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'') is '''β,ψ-carotene''';
* δ-carotene (with one ε ring and one uncyclized end) is '''ε,ψ-carotene''';
* ε-carotene is '''ε,ε-carotene'''
* [[lycopene]] is '''ψ,ψ-carotene'''

ζ-carotene is the [[biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of neurosporene, which is the precursor of lycopene, which, in turn, is the precursor of the carotenes α through ε.

'''Cyclic adenosine monophosphate''' ('''cAMP''', '''cyclic AMP''' or 3'-5'-cyclic [[adenosine monophosphate]]) is a [[second messenger]] important in many biological processes. cAMP is derived from [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) and used for intracellular [[signal transduction]] in many different organisms, conveying the [[cAMP-dependent pathway]].

==History==
[[Earl Sutherland]] of [[Vanderbilt University]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1971 &quot;for his discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the action of hormones,&quot; especially epinephrine, via second messengers (such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic AMP).

==Synthesis and decomposition==
cAMP is synthesised from ATP by [[adenylyl cyclase]] located on the inner side of the plasma membrane. Adenylyl cyclase is activated by a range of signaling molecules through the activation of adenylyl cyclase stimulatory G ([[Gs alpha subunit|G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;]])-protein-coupled receptors and inhibited by agonists of adenylyl cyclase inhibitory G (G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)-protein-coupled receptors. Liver adenylyl cyclase responds more strongly to glucagon, and muscle adenylyl cyclase responds more strongly to adrenaline.

cAMP decomposition into [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] is catalyzed by the enzyme [[phosphodiesterase]].

==Functions==
cAMP is a second messenger, used for intracellular signal transduction, such as transferring the effects of [[hormone]]s like [[glucagon]] and [[adrenaline]], which cannot pass through the cell membrane. It is involved in the activation of [[protein kinase]]s and regulates the effects of adrenaline and glucagon. It also regulates the passage of [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] through [[ion channels]].

===In humans===
{{Main|function of cAMP-dependent protein kinase}}


cAMP and its associated kinases function in several biochemical processes, including the regulation of [[glycogen]], [[sugar]], and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]].

In humans, cyclic AMP works by activating protein kinase A (PKA, [[cAMP-dependent protein kinase]]). PKA is normally inactive as a tetrameric [[holoenzyme]], consisting of two [[catalysis|catalytic]] and two regulatory units (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with the regulatory units blocking the catalytic centers of the catalytic units. Cyclic AMP binds to specific locations on the regulatory units of the protein kinase, and causes dissociation between the regulatory and catalytic subunits, thus activating the catalytic units and enabling them to phosphorylate substrate proteins.

The active subunits catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues of protein substrates. The phosphorylated proteins may act directly on the cell's ion channels, or may become activated or inhibited enzymes. Protein kinase A can also phosphorylate specific proteins that bind to promoter regions of DNA, causing increased expression of specific genes. Not all protein kinases respond to cAMP. Several classes of protein kinases, including protein kinase C, are not cAMP-dependent.

Further effects mainly depend on [[function of cAMP-dependent protein kinase|cAMP-dependent protein kinase]], which vary based on the type of cell.

Still, there are some minor PKA-independent functions of cAMP, e.g., activation of [[calcium channel]]s, providing a minor pathway by which [[growth hormone-releasing hormone]] causes a release of [[growth hormone]].&lt;ref name=GeneGlobe&gt;[https://www1.qiagen.com/GeneGlobe/PathwayView.aspx?pathwayID=199 GeneGlobe -&gt; GHRH Signaling] Retrieved on May 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the view that the majority of the effects of cAMP are controlled by PKA is an outdated one. In 1998 a family of cAMP-sensitive proteins with guanine exchange factor (GEF) activity was discovered. These are termed Exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac) and the family comprises [[RAPGEF3|Epac1]] and [[RAPGEF4|Epac2]]. The mechanism of activation is similar to that of PKA: the GEF domain is usually masked by the N-terminal region containing the cAMP binding domain. When cAMP binds, the domain dissociates and exposes the now-active GEF domain, allowing Epac to activate small Ras-like GTPase proteins, such as [[Rap1]].

===In non-humans===
==== Role of cAMP in bacteria ====
In [[bacteria]], the level of cAMP varies depending on the medium used for growth.  In particular, cAMP is low when glucose is the carbon source.  This occurs through inhibition of the cAMP-producing enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, as a side-effect of glucose transport into the cell.  The transcription factor [[cAMP receptor protein]] (CRP) also called CAP (catabolite gene activator protein) forms a complex with cAMP and thereby is activated to bind to DNA.  CRP-cAMP increases expression of a large number of genes, including some encoding [[enzyme]]s that can supply energy independent of glucose.

cAMP, for example, is involved in the positive regulation of the [[lac operon]]. In an environment of a low glucose concentration, cAMP accumulates and binds to the allosteric site on CRP ([[cAMP receptor protein]]), a transcription activator protein. The protein assumes its active shape and binds to a specific site upstream of the lac promoter, making it easier for RNA polymerase to bind to the adjacent promoter to start transcription of the lac operon, increasing the rate of lac operon transcription. With a high glucose concentration, the cAMP concentration decreases, and the CRP disengages from the lac operon.

==== Role of cAMP in some slime moulds ====
{{See also|Fungal behavior}}
In the species ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium discoideum]]'', the [[chemotaxis|chemotactic]] movement of cells is organized by periodic waves of cAMP that propagate through the cell. The waves are the result of a regulated production and secretion of extracellular cAMP and a spontaneous biological oscillator that initiates the waves at centers of territories.

==Pathology==
=== Role of cAMP in human carcinoma ===
Some research has suggested that a deregulation of cAMP pathways and an aberrant activation of cAMP-controlled genes is linked to the growth of some cancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/64/4/1338 American Association for Cancer Research (cAMP-responsive Genes and Tumor Progression)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/19/9483 American Association for Cancer Research (cAMP Dysregulation and Melonoma)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/2/1/201 American Association for Cancer Research (cAMP-binding Proteins' Presence in Tumors)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of cAMP in prefrontal cortex disorders ===
Recent research suggests that cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the [[prefrontal cortex]] through its regulation of ion channels called [[hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels]] (HCN). When cAMP stimulates the HCN, the channels open, closing the brain cell to communication and thus interfering with the function of the [[prefrontal cortex]]. This research, especially the degradation of higher cognitive function in [[ADHD]] when a person ages, is of interest to researchers studying the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070420143324.htm ScienceDaily ::Brain Networks Strengthened By Closing Ion Channels, Research Could Lead To ADHD Treatment ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cimabue''' (before 1251 – 1302), also known as '''Bencivieni di Pepo''' or in modern Italian, '''Benvenuto di Giuseppe''',  was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] and creator of [[mosaic]]s fom [[Florence]]. 

Cimabue is generally regarded as the last great Italian painter working in the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The art of this period comprised scenes and forms that appeared relatively flat and highly stylized. Cimabue was a pioneer in the move towards naturalism, as his figures were depicted with rather  more life-like proportions and shading. Even though he was a pioneer in that move, his  ''Maestà'' paintings shows Medieval techniques and characteristics. 

He was the master of [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], considered the first great artist of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Cimabue 025.jpg|right|thumb|150px|''Crucifix'', 1287-1288, Panel, 448 x 390 cm &lt;br&gt; [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica di Santa Croce]], Florence.]]
Owing to little surviving documentation, not much is known about Cimabue's life. He was born in Florence and died in [[Pisa]].  His career was described in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''.  Although it is one of the few early records about him, its accuracy is uncertain. According to British art historians Hugh Honour and John Fleming:

{{bquote|His name is, in fact, little more than a convenient label for a closely related group of panel and wall paintings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;page 303, A World History of Art, by Hugh Honour and John Fleming, first published in the UK by Papermac in 1982, ISBN 0333 37185 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Works ==
Judging this by the commissions that he received, Cimabue appears to have been a highly-regarded artist in his day. He was influenced by [[Dietisalvi di Speme]]. While he was at work in Florence, [[Duccio]] was the major artist, and perhaps his rival, in nearby [[Siena]]. Cimabue was commissioned to paint two very large frescoes for the [[Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi]]. They are on the walls of the [[transepts]]: a ''[[Crucifixion]]'' and a ''[[Deposition from the Cross|Deposition]]''.  Unfortunately these works are now dim shadows of their original appearance. During occupancy of the building by invading French troops, straw caught fire, severely damaging the frescoes. The white paint was partially composed of silver, which oxidised and turned black, leaving the faces and much of the drapery of the figures in negative. 
[[Image:San Francesco Cimabue.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Madonna of St. Francis.]]
Another damaged work is the great [[Crucifix]] of [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Santa Croce]] at Florence. It was the major work of art lost in the flood in Florence in 1966. Much of the paint from the body and face washed away.

Among Cimabue's few surviving works are the ''Madonna of Santa Trinita'', once in the church of [[Santa Trinita]], and now housed, with [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'' and [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Ognissanti Madonna]]'', in the [[Uffizi Gallery]]. 

In the Lower Church of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]] in [[Assisi]] is an extremely important [[fresco]], depicting [[The Madonna]] and Christ Child enthroned with angels and Saint Francis. It is claimed to be a work of Cimabue's old age.

Two additional, very fine paintings are attributed to Cimabue. ''The Flagellation of Christ'' was purchased by [[New York City|New York]]'s  [[Frick Collection]] in 1950 and was long considered to be of uncertain authorship, possibly Duccio's. But in 2000, the [[National Gallery in London]] acquired ''The Virgin and Child Enthroned with Two Angels'' with many similarities (size, materials, red borders, incised margins, etc.) to ''Flagellation''. The two pictures are now thought to be parts of a single work, a [[diptych]] or [[triptych]] [[altarpiece]], and their attribution to Cimabue is fairly secure. The pair are believed to date from 1280. The ''Virgin and Child'' was on loan to the Frick for a few months in late 2006, so the two works could be viewed side-by-side. The ''Flagellation'' painting is one of only two Cimabues permanently in the United States.

A tiny devotional painting of a ''Madonna and Child with SS. Peter and John the Baptist'' at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]] was painted by Cimabue or one of his students around 1290.  It is significant because it shows a cloth of honor that may well be the first patchwork quilt in Western art.

== Legacy ==
History has long regarded Cimabue as the last of an era that was overshadowed by the [[Italian Renaissance]].  In Canto XI of his [[Purgatorio]], [[Dante]] laments Cimabue's quick loss of public interest in the face of Giotto's revolution in art:&lt;ref&gt;Purgatio XI, cited in the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03771a.htm Cenni di Petro Cimabue] article in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
O vanity of human powers,&lt;br/&gt;
how briefly lasts the crowning green of glory,&lt;br/&gt;
unless an age of darkness follows!&lt;br/&gt;
In painting Cimabue thought he held the field&lt;br/&gt;
but now it's Giotto has the cry,&lt;br/&gt;
so that the other's fame is dimmed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Forms of government}}

'''Corporatocracy''', in social theories that focus on conflicts and opposing interests within society, denotes a [[form of government|system of government]] that serves the interest of, and may be run by, [[corporation]]s and involves ties between government and business. Where corporations, [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s, and/or government entities with private components, control the direction and [[governance]] of a country, including carrying out economic planning notwithstanding the 'free market' label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Social Problems|publisher=Cengage Lerning|year=2009|page=256|author8=Linda A. Mooney, David Knox, and Caroline Schacht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

The concept of corporatocracy is that corporations - to a significant extent - have massive power over governments, including those governments nominally elected by the people, and that they exercise such power via corporate monopolies and mergers and by their enormous, concentrated economic power which, by recent economic crises, allows them the luxury of saying &quot;we are too big to fail&quot; and by legal in-the-open mechanisms (lobbyists, campaign contributions to office holders and candidates, threats to leave the state or country for another with less oversight and more subsidies, etc). Oliver Stone captured &quot;Wall Street, you know, you could say..runs the world. Wall Street, the pharmaceutical lobbies, the oil lobbies, they run our government&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/6/21/academy_award_winning_filmmaker_oliver_stone Academy Award-Winning Filmmaker Oliver Stone Tackles Latin America’s Political Upheaval in &quot;South of the Border&quot;, US Financial Crisis in Sequel to Iconic &quot;Wall Street&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
{{Unreferenced|date=April 2011}}
*U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] himself argued against the strengthening corporatocracy in the form of a [[military-industrial complex]] that sets national and international financial, economic, political and military policies due to a [[permanent war economy]].
*In his 2004 book ''[[Confessions of an Economic Hit Man]]'', [[John Perkins (author)|John Perkins]] writes; &quot;corporations, banks, and governments (collectively the corporatocracy)&quot;.
*The concept of a government run by corporations or instances where governments are actually weaker (politically, financially, and militarily) than corporations is a theme often used in both [[political fiction]] and science fiction. In these instances the dominant corporate entity is usually dubbed a &quot;[[megacorporation]]&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Culture of Canada sidebar}}
'''Canadian culture''' is a term that explains the [[art]]istic, [[music]]al, [[Literature|literary]], [[Culinary art|culinary]], [[Politics|political]] and [[social]] elements that are representative of [[Canada]] and [[Canadians]], not only to its own population, but people all over the world. Canada's culture has historically been influenced by [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and traditions, especially [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Culture of France|French]]. Over time, elements of the cultures of Canada's [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] and immigrant populations have become incorporated into mainstream Canadian culture. It has subsequently been influenced by [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] because of its proximity and migration between the two countries.&lt;ref name=Kalman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |title=Profiles of Canada|author=edited by Kenneth G. Pryke, Walter C. Soderlund|publisher=Boulder, Colo. NetLibrary|year= 2000 |isbn= 058527925X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's [[Government of Canada|federal government]] has influenced Canadian culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media, such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) and the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), and promotes many events which it considers to promote Canadian traditions. It has also tried to [[Canadian cultural protectionism|protect Canadian culture]] by setting legal minimums on [[Canadian content]] in many media using bodies like the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Film Board of Canada |authorlink=National Film Board of Canada|url=http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&amp;lg=en |title=Mandate of the National Film Board |year=2005|accessdate=2006-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060421170854/http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&amp;lg=en &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's culture, like that of most any country in the world, is a product of its [[History of Canada|history]], [[Geography of Canada|geography]], and [[Politics of Canada|political system]]. Being a settler nation, Canada has been shaped by waves of migration that have combined to form a unique blend of customs, [[Canadian cuisine|cuisine]], and traditions that have marked the socio-cultural development of the nation.&lt;ref name=Kalman&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gPEItATPByoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Canada+and+its+people#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=Canada: The Culture |first=Bobbie |last=Kalman|publisher=Crabtree Pub|year=2010|pages=4–7 |isbn=9780778792840|accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, several aspects of Canadian culture will be discussed. Though this article attempts to feature a variety of subjects pertinent to the culture of Canada, it is in no way exhaustive, and to gain a much deeper knowledge of Canada and its culture, one must also consult the other articles pertaining to Canada and its peoples.

==Development of Canadian culture==
[[Image:Jackpine.jpeg|thumb|''[[Jack Pine (painting)|The Jack Pine]]'', by [[Tom Thomson]], 1916. Oil on Canvas, in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]]]]
{{See also|History of Canada}}
Canadian [[culture]] is a product of Canada's [[history]] and [[geography]]. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonies]] in the [[Americas]], with the result that themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of Canadian culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;pioneer lit&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] conquest of Canada in 1759 brought a large [[Francophone]] population under British rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation, while the migration of [[United Empire Loyalist]]s from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] brought in strong British and [[United States|American]] influences.

Although not without conflict, Canada's early interactions with [[First Nations]] and [[Inuit]] populations were relatively peaceful, compared to the experience of [[Native Americans in the United States|native peoples]] in the United States. Combined with relatively late [[economic development]] in many regions, this peaceful history has allowed Canadian native peoples to have a relatively strong influence on the national culture while preserving their own identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultural influences&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Bilingualism and multiculturalism===
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada|Spoken languages of Canada|Canadian English|Quebec French}}
[[French Canada]]'s early development was relatively cohesive during the 17th and 18th centuries, and this was preserved by the [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, which allowed Francophone culture to survive and thrive within Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;quebec culture survival&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

|accessdate=2006-11-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]] was designed to meet the growing calls for Canadian autonomy while avoiding the overly-strong decentralization that contributed to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;civil war&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compromises made by [[John A. Macdonald|Macdonald]] and [[George-Étienne Cartier|Cartier]] set Canada on a path to [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;early bilingualism&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
|unused_data=&lt;s&gt;url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/key/SP-BL/hoc-cdc/index.asp?Language&lt;/s&gt;=E&amp;param=1&amp;id=2725

|accessdate=2006-11-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity that later led to both [[multiculturalism]] and tolerance of Native culture and customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;bilingualism to multiculturalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Chinatown-gate.thumb2.jpg|thumb|left|A Chinese gate in downtown [[Montreal]].]]
Multicultural heritage is enshrined in [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In parts of Canada, especially the major cities of [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Toronto]] (for example, in Toronto's [[Kensington Market]] area), multiculturalism itself is the cultural norm and diversity is the force that unites the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;kensington&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], [[cultural identity]] is strong, and many [[francophone|French-speaking Quebecer]] commentators speak of a [[Culture of Quebec|Quebec culture]] as distinguished from [[English Canadian]] culture, but some also see Canada as a collection of several regional, aboriginal, and ethnic subcultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultures&quot;&gt;{{cite web

While [[French Canadian]] culture is the most obvious example, [[Celts|Celtic]] influences have allowed survival of non-English dialects in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]; however, the influence of [[Ulster]] immigrants to Toronto has had the effect of minimizing [[Irish people|Irish]] influences in [[Ontario]]'s culture, and highlighting British influences instead, until the 1980s. Canada's Pacific trade has also brought a large [[Chinese people|Chinese]] influence into [[British Columbia]] and other areas.

Canada's cultural diversity also creates an environment much more accepting of [[LGBT]] people than one finds in many other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;gay&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2006-11-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has always placed emphasis on equality and inclusiveness for all people. For example, in 1995, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[Egan v. Canada]]'' that [[sexual orientation]] should be &quot;read in&quot; to [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], a part of the [[Constitution of Canada]] guaranteeing [[Human rights in Canada|equal rights]] to all Canadians. Following a series of decisions by provincial courts and the Supreme Court of Canada, on July 20, 2005, the [[Civil Marriage Act]] (Bill C-38) received [[Royal Assent]], legalizing [[same-sex marriage in Canada]]. Canada thus became the fourth country to officially sanction [[same-sex marriage]] worldwide, after [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]]. Furthermore, by 2005, sexual orientation was included as a protected status in the human rights laws of the federal government and of all provinces and territories. {{See|LGBT rights in Canada}}

===Aboriginal influences===
{{Main|Aboriginal peoples in Canada#Culture|Inuit culture}}
[[Image:Atrapasuenos.jpg|thumb|Many native icons, such as this [[dreamcatcher]], have been adopted by Canadians as a whole.]]

Aboriginal peoples in Canada interacted with [[Europe]]ans as far back as 1000 AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodcock, part I&quot;&gt;Woodcock, part I&lt;/ref&gt; but prolonged contact came only after Europeans established permanent settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries. European written accounts, though biased, generally noted friendliness on the part of the First Nations,&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodcock, part I&quot;/&gt; some of whom profited in trade with Europeans. Such trade generally strengthened the more organized political entities such as the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

There were, and are, many distinct Aboriginal peoples across Canada, each with its own culture, beliefs, values, language, and history. Much of this legacy remains celebrated artistically, and in other ways, in Canada to this day. Part of the emblem of the Vancouver [[2010 Winter Olympics]] is an [[Inukshuk]], a rock sculpture that is made by stacking stones in the shape of a human figure, that is a part of Inuit culture and the nation's perception of itself. According to the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]].
{{Quote|Canada's ethnic, racial and religious diversity is rapidly increasing. According to the 2001 census, more than 200 ethnic origins are represented in Canada. About 13.5 percent of the population is a member of a visible minority group and that proportion is expected to reach 20 percent by 2016. Immigration now accounts for more than 50 percent of Canada's population growth, with immigrants coming mainly from Asia and the Middle East. It is projected that, after 2025, Canada's population growth will be based solely on immigration.|Judith Larocque, Deputy Minister|&quot;Serving Canada's Multicultural Population: Practical Approaches for Public Servants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturecanada.gc.ca/keyrefsearch.cfm?query=cultures&amp;pr=CHRWALK&amp;prox=page&amp;rorder=500&amp;rprox=500&amp;rdfreq=500&amp;rwfreq=500&amp;rlead=500&amp;sufs=0&amp;order=r&amp;mode=Advanced&amp;cq=&amp;lang=fre&amp;cmd=context&amp;id=47ba840712c Department of Canadian Heritage]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Canadian identity===
{{Main|Canadian identity}}
[[File:Stenciled identity.jpg|thumb|left|The [[maple leaf]] is the symbol most associated with [[Canadian identity]].]]
Primary influences on the ''Canadian identity'' trace back to the arrival, beginning in the early 17th century, of [[France|French]] settlers to [[Acadia]] and [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence River valley]], [[England|English]] settlers to [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and the [[French and Indian War|British conquest]] and settlement of [[New France]] from the early 18th century. First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, from their role in assisting exploration of the continent, the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] and inter-European power struggles to the creation of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people]]. Through their art and culture, First Nations, Inuit and Métis continue to exert influence on Canadian identity.

The question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians stemming from the French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the [[British Empire]], resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power and, finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the military, economic and cultural powerhouse of the United States. With the gradual loosening of political and cultural ties to the [[United Kingdom]], in the 20th century immigrants from European, [[Africa]]n, [[Caribbean]] and [[Asia]]n nationalities have shaped the Canadian identity, a process that continues today with the continuing arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non British or French backgrounds, adding the theme of multiculturalism to the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ralston Saul]], ''Reflections of a Siames Twin: Canada at the End of the 20th Century,'' Toronto: Viking Canada, 1997, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Resnick, ''The European Roots of Canadian Identity'', Peterborough: Broadview Press Ltd, 2005 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy McGregor, ''Canadians: A Portrait of a Country and Its People'', Toronto: Viking Canada, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of nationalities and cultures and constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than a single national myth.&lt;ref&gt;Saul,''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of Canadian identity remains under scrutiny, perhaps more than the identity of the people of any other modern nation.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Andrew Cohen wrote in 2007:
{{Quote|The Canadian Identity, as it has come to be known, is as elusive as the [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]] and [[Ogopogo]]. It has animated--and frustrated--generations of statesmen, historians, writers, artists, philosophers, and the National Film Board...Canada resists easy definition.|Andrew Cohen|The Unfinished Canadian: The People We Are&lt;ref&gt;Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2007, p. 3, ISBN 978-0-7710-2181-7&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In true Canadian fashion, however, even the search for an identity has become itself an object for self-criticism.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, ''Canadians'', at p. 40: &quot;I've often thought myself that Canadians ingeniously use this endless 'search' for identity as a handy excuse to wallow in their own self-righteousness--particularly at those moments when America has put the stuck-up Canadian nose out of joint. It could be construed as a sort of verbal party trick to turn the conversation around to oneself and all the comforting goodness of being Canadian&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian nationalism===
{{Main|Canadian nationalism}}
In general, Canadian nationalists are highly concerned about the protection of Canadian sovereignty and loyalty to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian State]], placing them in the [[Liberal nationalism|civic nationalist]] category. It has likewise often been suggested that anti-Americanism, or at least hostility towards the United States, often plays a prominent role in Canadian nationalist ideologies. When nationalists speak of &quot;independence&quot;, it is widely understood that the actual meaning is &quot;independence from the United States&quot;. Canadian nationalists may in fact promote stronger ties to other nations, and encourage closer integration with the [[European Union]] or the [[United Nations]] as a way of offsetting US influences.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Cultural protectionism in Canada==
{{Main|Canadian cultural protectionism}}
Cultural protectionism in Canada has, since the mid-20th century, taken the form of conscious, interventionist attempts on the part of various Canadian governments to promote Canadian cultural production and limit the effect of foreign, largely American, culture on the domestic audience. Sharing a [[Canada – United States border|large border]] and (for the majority) a common language with the United States, Canada faces a difficult position in regard to American culture, be it direct attempts at the Canadian market or the general diffusion of American culture in the globalized media arena. While Canada tries to maintain its cultural differences, it also must balance this with responsibility in trade arrangements such as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).

==Symbols==

Official symbols of Canada include the [[maple leaf]], [[North American Beaver|beaver]], and the [[Canadian Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/n-10.7/ |title=National Horse of Canada Act |publisher=Canlii.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/o1-eng.cfm |title=The beaver |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/o3-eng.cfm |title=The Maple Leaf |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=2008-11-17 |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many official symbols of the country such as the [[Flag of Canada]] have been changed or modified over the past few decades in order to 'Canadianize' them and de-emphasise or remove references to the United Kingdom. Symbols of the monarchy in Canada continue to be featured in, for example, the [[Arms of Canada]] and armed forces [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship]]. The designation '[[monarchy|Royal]]' remains for institutions as varied as the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]], though with the 1968 unification of the three armed forces into the [[Canadian Forces]], the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ceased to exist. However, certain [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command]] (army) units carry &quot;Royal&quot; titles, [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command]] vessels are still styled &quot;HMCS&quot; and [[Canadian Forces Air Command]] [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] still use a [[Royal Air Force]]-derived badge surmounted by the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth|Queen's Crown]] as their official crests.

==Arts==
{{Main|Canadian art|List of Canadian artists}}
[[Image:Red Maple.jpg|thumb|left|''Red Maple,'' 1914, by [[A. Y. Jackson]] of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]].]]
The arts have flourished in Canada since the 20th century, and especially since the end of [[World War II]] in 1945. Government support has played a vital role in their development enabling visual exposure through publications and periodicals featuring Canadian art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thompsonbooks.com/sites/default/files/ebooks/files/Taking-Sport-Seriously-3-Edition.pdf?title=Taking-Sport-Seriously-3-Edition&amp;ext=pdf |title='Taking Sports Seriously' 3rd Edition Thompson Educational Publishing|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has the establishment of numerous art schools and colleges across the country.

The works of most early Canadian painters followed European trends. During the mid-19th century, [[Cornelius Krieghoff]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] born artist in Quebec, painted scenes of the life of the ''[[habitants]]'' (French-Canadian farmers). At about the same time, the Canadian artist [[Paul Kane]] painted pictures of Indian life in [[western Canada]]. A group of [[landscape art|landscape]] painters called the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] developed the first distinctly Canadian style of painting. All these artists painted large, brilliantly coloured scenes of the Canadian wilderness.

Since the 1930s, Canadian painters have developed a wide range of highly individual styles. [[Emily Carr]] became famous for her paintings of [[totem pole]]s in British Columbia. Other noted painters have included the landscape artist [[David Milne (artist)|David Milne]], the [[Abstract art|abstract]] painters [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] and [[Harold Town]] and multi-media artist [[Michael Snow]].

The abstract art group [[Painters Eleven]], particularly the artists [[William Ronald]] and [[Jack Bush]], also had an important impact on modern art in Canada. Canadian sculpture has been enriched by the [[walrus ivory]] and [[soapstone]] carvings by the [[Inuit art]]ists. These carvings show objects and activities from the daily life of the Inuit.

===Literature===

[[Canadian literature]] is often divided into French and English-language literature, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively, However, collectively this literature has become distinctly Canadian. Canada’s literature, whether written in English or French, often reflects the Canadian perspective on nature, frontier life, and Canada’s position in the world, Canadian identity is closely tied to its literature. Canadian literature is often categorised by [[List of regions of Canada|region or province]]; by the status of the author (for example,, literature of Canadian women, [[Acadians]], Aboriginal peoples, and [[Irish Canadian]]s); and by literary period, such as &quot;Canadian postmoderns&quot; or &quot;Canadian Poets Between the Wars.&quot;

Canadian authors have accumulated numerous international awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertfulford.com/CanadianNovelists.html |title=Robert Fulford's column about the international success of Canadian literature |publisher=Robertfulford.com |date=2001-06-06 |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Michael Ondaatje]] became the first Canadian to win the [[Man Booker Prize]] for ''[[The English Patient]].'' [[Margaret Atwood]] won the Booker in 2000 for ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' and [[Yann Martel]] won it in 2002 for the ''[[Life of Pi]].'' [[Carol Shields]]'s ''[[The Stone Diaries]]'' won the 1995 [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], and the 1994 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]].

[[File:Ojazzfest.JPG|left|200px|thumb|[[Ottawa Jazz Festival]] inside [[Rideau Centre]], 2008]]
The [[Music of Canada]] has reflected the multi-cultural influences that have shaped the country. [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginals]], the French, and the British have all made contributions to the musical heritage of Canada. Since French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] arrived in 1605 and established the first permanent Canadian settlements at [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] and [[Quebec City]] in 1608, the country has produced its own [[List of Canadian composers|composers]], [[List of Canadian musicians|musicians]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willy&quot; &gt;Music in Canada 1600-1800. by Amtmann, Willy.

Canadian music industry has been helped by government regulation designed to protect and encourage the growth of distinct Canadian culture. The Canadian Content (CANCON) regulations require all radio stations in Canada play at least 36% Canadian music. This has enabled Canadian artists to garner success on the airwaves which were once dominated by American and European acts. Due to these regulations, Canadian music has become much more prevalent on the airwaves. Individuals are honoured at The [[Juno Award]]s, recognizing Canadian achievement in popular music. In addition, Canada is home to a number of popular summer-time folk festivals, including the [[Winnipeg Folk Festival]]. Canada has also produced many notable composers, who have contributed in a variety of ways to the [[Western art history|history]] of Western [[classical music]].

===Canadian theatre===
{{Main|Theatre of Canada}}
Canada has a thriving stage theatre scene. Theatre festivals draw many tourists in the summer months, especially the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]], Ontario, and the [[Shaw Festival]] in [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], Ontario. The [[Famous People Players]] are only one of many touring companies that have also developed an international reputation. Canada also boasts the world's second largest [[Fringe theatre|fringe festival]] the [[Edmonton International Fringe Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2009/08/24/edmonton-fringe-record-attendance.html#socialcomments Edmonton Fringe sets box-office record]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 2 major theatre venues in [[Ottawa]], the government-owned and sponsored [[National Arts Centre]] and the privately-owned [[Great Canadian Theatre Company]].

===Film and television===
{{Main|Cinema of Canada|Television in Canada}}
{{See also|Cinema of Quebec}}

The Canadian film market was dominated by the American film industry for decades, although that film industry has since inception seen a prominent role for actors, directors, producers and technicians of Canadian origin. In the 1960s [[Michel Brault]], [[Pierre Perrault]], [[Gilles Groulx]], [[Jean Pierre Lefebvre]], [[Arthur Lamothe]], [[Claude Jutra]] and other filmmakers from Quebec began to challenge Hollywood by making innovative and politically relevant documentary and feature films.

[[File:Stanford Theatre at 482 Queen Street.jpg|220px|right|thumb|[[Standard Theatre (Toronto)|Standard Theatre]], 482 Queen Street West. (Toronto, Canada), 1906]]

Canada has developed a vigorous film industry that has produced a variety of well-known films, actors, and auteurs. In fact, this eclipsing may sometimes be creditable for the bizarre and innovative directions of the works of such auteurs as [[Atom Egoyan]] (''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'', 1997) and [[David Cronenberg]] (''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'', ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'', ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]''). Also, the distinct French-Canadian society permits the work of directors such as [[Denys Arcand]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]]. At the [[76th Academy Awards]] Arcand's ''[[The Barbarian Invasions]]'' became Canada's first film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

A number of [[Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood]] significantly contributed to the creation of the motion picture industry in the early days of the 20th century. Over the years, many Canadians have made enormous contributions to the American entertainment industry, although they are frequently not recognized as Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;* Charles Foster, Stardust and Shadows: Canadians in Early Hollywood, 2000, page27- 34 ISBN 1-55002-348-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's film industry is in full expansion as a site for Hollywood productions. Since the 1980s, Canada, and Vancouver in particular, has become known as [[Hollywood North]]. The American ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' was filmed in Toronto. Canadian producers have been very successful in the field of [[Canadian science fiction television|science fiction]] since the mid-1990s, with such shows as ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|new ''Battlestar Galactica'']], ''[[Smallville]]'', and ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', all filmed in Vancouver. As with its southern counterpart in [[California]], many Canadians are employed in the film industry, and celebrity-spotting is frequent throughout many Canadian cities.

[[File:Office national du film montreal.jpg|thumb|left|NFB headquarters building, [[Montreal]].]]
Canadian television, especially supported by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], is the home of a variety of locally-produced shows. French-language television, like French Canadian film, is buffered from excessive American influence by the fact of language, and likewise supports a host of home-grown productions. The success of French-language domestic television and movies in Canada often exceeds that of its English-language counterpart.

The CRTC's Canadian content regulations dictate that a certain percentage of a domestic broadcaster's transmission time must include content that is produced by Canadians, or covers Canadian subjects. This also applies to [[Cable television in the United States|US cable television]] channels such as [[MTV]] ([[MTV (Canada)]] and the [[Discovery Channel]] ([[Discovery Channel (Canada)]], which have local versions of their channels available on [[Multichannel television in Canada|Canadian cable networks]]. Similarly, [[BBC Canada]], while primarily showing [[BBC]] shows from the United Kingdom, also carries Canadian output.

The [[National Film Board of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.ca/e/index_about.html NFB official site]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is 'a public agency that produces and distributes films and other audiovisual works which reflect Canada to Canadians and the rest of the world'. The agency helped to pioneer the concept of the documentary. Canada has produced many popular documentaries such as ''[[The Corporation]]'', ''[[Nanook of the North]]'', ''[[Final Offer (film)|Final Offer]]'', and ''[[Canada: A People's History]]''. The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) is considered by many to be one of the most prevalent film festivals for Western cinema. It is the première film festival in North America from which the Oscars race begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiff.net/default.aspx |title=Toronto International Film Festival |publisher=Tiff.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian humour==

{{Main|Canadian humour}}
[[File:Festival Juste pour rire de Montréal, Québec.jpg|thumb|right|[[Just for Laughs Festival]] in Montreal, Québec at the [[Théâtre Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis Theatre]].]]
[[Canadian humour]] is an integral part of the Canadian Identity. Canadian comedians such as [[Jim Carrey]], [[John Candy]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Norm Macdonald]], [[Rick Mercer]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Michael Cera]], [[Martin Short]], [[The Kids in the Hall]], [[Tom Green]], [[Phil Hartman]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Leslie Nielsen]] are amongst the most successful in the world. [[Second City Television]], otherwise known as [[SCTV]], is also regarded as a television show which was very influential on the development of comedy television. There are several traditions in Canadian humour in both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Quebec French|French]].&lt;ref name = Scobie&gt;Scobie, Stephen [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003902 &quot;Humorous Writing in English&quot;]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia.'' Retrieved on: April 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Lacombe&gt;Lacombe, Michelle [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003903 &quot;Humorous Writing in French&quot;]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia.'' Retrieved on: April 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While these traditions are distinct and at times very different, there are common themes that relate to Canadians' shared history and [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation in [[North America]] and the [[world]]. Various trends can be noted in Canadian comedy. One thread is the portrayal of a &quot;typical&quot; Canadian family in an on-going radio or television series. Examples include ''[[La famille Plouffe]]'', with its mix of drama, humour, politics and religion and [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] such as ''[[King of Kensington]]'' and ''[[La Petite Vie]]''. Another major thread tends to be political and cultural [[satire]]: television shows such as ''[[CODCO]],'' ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[La Fin du monde est à 7 heures]]'' and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]],'' monologuists such as [[Yvon Deschamps]] and [[Rick Mercer]] and writers, including [[Michel Tremblay]], [[Will Ferguson]] and [[Eric Nicol]] draw their inspiration from Canadian and Québécois society and politics. Another trend revels in absurdity, demonstrated by television series like ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'', ''[[The Tom Green Show]]'' and ''[[The Frantics (comedy)|The Frantics]],'' and musician-comedians such as [[The Arrogant Worms]], [[Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie]] and [[Bowser and Blue]]. Satire is arguably the primary characteristic of Canadian humour, evident in each of these threads, and uniting various genres and regional cultural differences.

[[Humber College]] in Toronto and the École nationale de l'humour in Montreal offer post-secondary programmes in comedy writing and performance. [[Montreal]] is also home to the bilingual (English and French) [[Just for Laughs]] festival and to the [[Just for Laughs Museum]], a bilingual, international museum of comedy.

The sporting culture of Canada is different from that of many other countries. Compared to any other nation, Canadians prefer a unique set of sports that are imported from the United States or home grown — namely football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey. In Canada, football means Canadian football or what is sometimes called [[Gridiron football|gridiron]] around the world.

During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada broke the record for winning the most gold medals for any one country in Winter Olympic history.

Great achievements in Canadian sport are recognized by [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]], while the [[Lou Marsh Trophy]] is awarded annually to Canada's top athlete by a panel of journalists.

{{main|Canadian cuisine}}
Canadian Cuisine varies widely by region to region. Generally, the traditional cuisine of [[English Canada]] is closely related to [[British cuisine|British]] and [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]], while the traditional cuisine of [[French Canada]] has evolved from [[French cuisine]] and the winter provisions of [[Fur traders]].

The basis of both groups is seasonal, Fresh ingredients and preserves. The cuisine includes Baked foods, Wild game, and Gathered foods.

The cuisine of the western provinces is heavily influenced by [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[British cuisine|British]], [[German cuisine|German]], [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]], [[Polish cuisine|Polish]], and [[Scandinavia]]n cuisine. Noteworthy is the cuisne of the [[Doukhobor]]s, Russian-descended Vegetarians. 

The [[Waterloo Region|Waterloo]], [[Ontario]], region has a tradition of [[Mennonite]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] cookery. 

[[Canadian Chinese cuisine]] is widespread across the country, with variation from place to place. The Chinese Buffet, although found in the U.S. and other parts of Canada, had its origins in early [[Gastown]], [[Vancouver]], c.1870 and came out of the practice of the many [[Scandinavians]] working in the woods and mills around the Shantytown getting the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] cook to put out a steam table on a sideboard, so they could ''load up'' and leave room on the dining table (presumably for ''drink''). [[Ginger beef|Ginger Beef]] is a popular Chinese food purportedly originating in [[Western Canada]].

The traditional cuisine of the [[Arctic]] and the Canadian Territories is based on [[Wild game]] and [[Inuit]] and [[First Nations]] cooking methods; conversely [[Bannock (food)|Bannock]], which is popular across [[First Nations]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] communities throughout the continent, is a method for making Pan-Fried [[Bread]] introduced to their culture by Scottish fur traders. The cuisines of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and the [[Maritimes]] derive mainly from [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] cooking, with a preference for Salt-cured [[Fish]], [[Beef]], and [[Pork]]. [[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]] and [[British Columbia]] also maintain strong British cuisine traditions.

[[Poutine]] is a popular dish in the province of [[Quebec]], consisting of [[French Fries|Fries]], [[Cheese curds|Curds]], and [[Gravy]]. Other popular dishes include: [[Pemmican]] (usually eaten by [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]] people), [[Rappie pie|Rappie Pie]] (a Acadian dish from [[Nova Scotia]]), [[Jiggs dinner|Jiggs Dinner]] (A meal from Newfoundland consisting of [[Salt beef|Salt Beef]], [[Cabbage]], [[Papri]] and [[Pease pudding|Pease Pudding]]), [[Nanaimo bars|Nanaimo Bars]] (a dessert from British Columbia), and [[Arctic Char]] (a popular kind of Fish from the [[Arctic]]).

[[Street Food]] is also popular in parts of [[Canada]], especially in [[Montreal]]. Similarly, [[Hot dog stands|Hot Dog stands]] are often found in parts of Canada, but are far more common in [[Ontario]]. [[Ice cream truck|Ice Cream trucks]] are often found in the summer, where you can get Canadian and American brands of [[Ice Cream]] like [[Oreo]], [[Breyers]], [[Cadbury Adams|Cadbury]], [[Reese peanut butter cups|Reese]], and others.

Canada also produces good [[Cheeses]], many successful [[Beer]]s, and is known for its excellent [[Ice wines|Ice Wines]].

[[Saskatoon berries|Saskatoon Berries]], [[Fiddleheads]], [[Wild rice|Wild Rice]], and [[Maple syrup]] are also famous ingredients to Canadian cooking.

Foods from the [[Inuit]] people and [[First Nations]] like [[Whale]], [[Pinniped|Seal]], [[Cod]], and several Inuit dishes are also eaten in Canada, especially in the [[Arctic]], where most of Canada's Inuit people live.

==Outside views==
In 1984, [[Baron Moran]], the British High Commissioner to Canada, stated that, in his opinion, Canadians have limited talents and are &quot;deeply unimpressive.&quot; Said Moran, &quot;Anyone who is even moderately good at what they do - in literature, the theater, skiing of whatever - tends to become a national figure.  And anyone who stands out at all from the crowd tends to be praised to the skies and given the [[Order of Canada]] at once.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;([[Associated Press]]), &quot;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33368539/ns/world_news-europe/ Letters reveal candid views of UK diplomats]&quot;, ''[[WTOP-FM|WTOP]]'', October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 poll ranked Canada as the country with the most positive influence in the world. 28,000 people in 27 countries were asked to rate 12 countries as either having a positive or negative worldwide influence. Canada’s overall influence rating topped the list with 54 per cent of respondents rating it mostly positive and only 14 per cent mostly negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadavisa.com/canada-a-good-influence-on-the-world.html |title=Canada - A Good Influence on the World |publisher=Canadavisa.com |date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] is home to a number of perceptions about Canadian culture, due to the countries' partially-shared heritage and the relatively large number of cultural features common to both the US and Canada.  Many in the United States believe that the typical Canadian is more polite than his or her American counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;http://seacoastnh.com/arts/please031404.html&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and the United States are often inevitably compared as sibling countries, and the perceptions that arise from this oft-held contrast have gone to shape the advertised worldwide identities of both nations: the United States is seen as the rebellious child of the British Crown, forged in the fires of [[American Revolutionary War|violent revolution]]; Canada is the more calm offspring of the United Kingdom known for a more relaxed national demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;http://seacoastnh.com/arts/please031404.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{dablink|Not to be confused with [[Chełm land]]. See also [[Kulmerland (ship)]]}}


'''Kulmerland''' (''Culmerland'', ''Culm land'', {{lang-pl|ziemia chełmińska}}, {{Audio-de|Kulmerland|Kulmerland.ogg}}) is a [[German language|German name]] for the historical region of &quot;Chełmno land&quot; in central [[Poland]] bounded by the [[Vistula]] and [[Drwęca]] rivers. 

Kulmerland is named after the city of [[Chełmno]] (also known as Culm). The largest cities in the region are [[Toruń]], [[Grudziądz]], [[Chełmno]], and [[Chełmża]]. Sometimes it was considered to be part of the neighbouring provinces of [[Masovia]], [[Kuyavia]], [[Greater Poland]], [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], and [[Pomerania]]; it is currently part of the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodship]]. 

It is located on the right bank of the [[Vistula]] river, from the mouth of the [[Drwęca]] river to Chełmno. Where the Vistula river takes a sharp turn northward, the Drwęca forms the eastern border of the region, while its southern and western border is the Vistula river.

==History==

The first historical account of Chełmno and Chełmno land dates back to 1065 when Boleslaw II of Poland granted a tax privilege to an abbey in a nearby Mogilno. The document lists Chełmno (&quot;Culmine&quot;) along with other towns which then belonged to the province of Masovia. The area, being closest to the [[Polans]], came to be populated by the [[Lechitic]] Kuyavians and tribes from Greater Poland. The [[Masovians]] were led by Masos, who left the Polish duke Boleslaw I and sought refuge with the Prussians. When this area was subdued by the rulers of the [[Polans (western)|Polans]] Chełmno became a local centre of administration (kasztelania). Chełmno Land was [[Christianised]] in the 11th century. 

According to the will of Duke [[Boleslaus III of Poland]], Chełmno land, after his death in 1137 became a part of the [[Duchy of Masovia]] governed by his son [[Boleslaus IV the Curly]] and his descendants during the feudal fragmentation of Poland. However the Prussians as well as the Pomeranians many times managed to regain their freedom from subjugation by the expanding Polish dukes.

By the 13th century the territory was subject to raids by [[Prussian people|Prussians]], who sacked [[Chełmno]], the province's main town, in 1216. In 1220 [[Conrad I of Masovia]], with the participation of the other princes of Poland, led a partial reconquest of the province, but the project of establishing a Polish defense of the province failed due to conflicts between the princes. He brought the crusading [[Knights of Dobrin]] to Masovia, where they built a castle at [[Dobrzyń nad Wisłą|Dobrzyń]] in 1224 as a base for attacks against the Prussians. As a result the territory was again sacked and devastated by Prussian raids, which led to depopulation of the province. 

Being involved in dynastic struggles elsewhere and too weak to deal with the Prussians alone, Conrad needed to safeguard and establish borders against the heathen [[Old Prussians]], because his territory of Masovia was also in danger after the Prussians besieged [[Płock]]. Conrad awarded the already devastated Chełmno Land to the [[Teutonic Knights]], giving them [[Nieszawa]] at first. He also brought in [[Germans|German]] settlers to Płock. 

In 1226 Duke [[Conrad I of Masovia]] enlisted the aid of the [[Teutonic Order]] to protect [[Masovia]] and help convert the Prussians to Christianity. In return, the knights were to keep Chełmno Land as a fief. The land constituted the base of the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]], and its later conquest of [[East Prussia]], marking the German ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''.

The Teutonic Order obtained an Imperial bull from Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] before entering Prussia. In 1243 the [[papal legate]] [[William of Modena]] divided Prussia into four dioceses under the archbishop of [[Riga]], one of which was Chełmno Land. 

After the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years War]] between the Prussian cities and the Teutonic Knights ended with the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]], Chełmno Land returned to the Polish crown as a part of autonomous [[Royal Prussia]] (see [[Chełmno Voivodship]]).

In 1772 as a result of the [[First Partition of Poland]], Chełmno Land (with the exception of [[Toruń]]) was seized by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Between 1807 and 1815 Chełmno Land was a part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. In 1815 it become part of the [[Grand Duchy of Poznań]], but in 1817 was incorporated into [[West Prussia]].

Following the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Chełmno Land was returned to Poland in January 1920. It was occupied in the [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 by [[Nazi Germany]] and annexed in October. In January 1945 it was captured by Red Army and returned to Poland.

The '''Cauchy–Lorentz distribution''', named after [[Augustin Cauchy]] and [[Hendrik Lorentz]], is a [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] [[probability distribution]].  As a probability distribution, it is known as the '''Cauchy distribution''', while among physicists, it is known as the '''Lorentz distribution''', '''Lorentz(ian) function''', or '''Breit–Wigner''' distribution.

Its importance in [[physics]] is due to its being the solution to the [[differential equation]] describing [[Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)#Resonance_hypothesis|forced resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://webphysics.davidson.edu/Projects/AnAntonelli/node5.html  Note that the intensity, which follows the Cauchy distribution, is the square of the amplitude.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mathematics]], it is closely related to the [[Poisson kernel]], which is the [[fundamental solution]] for the [[Laplace equation]] in the [[upper half-plane]].  In [[spectroscopy]], it is the description of the shape of [[spectral line]]s which are subject to [[homogeneous broadening]] in which all atoms interact in the same way with the frequency range contained in the line shape. Many mechanisms cause homogeneous broadening, most notably [[Line_broadening#Spectral_line_broadening_and_shift|collision broadening]], and Chantler–Alda [[radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=E. Hecht |year=1987 |title=Optics |page=603 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
===Probability density function===
The Cauchy distribution has the [[probability density function]]
:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi\gamma \left[1 + \left(\frac{x - x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]}
 = { 1 \over \pi } \left[ { \gamma \over (x - x_0)^2 + \gamma^2  } \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[location parameter]], specifying the location of the peak of the distribution, and ''γ'' is the [[scale parameter]] which specifies the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM).  ''γ'' is also equal to half the [[interquartile range]] and is sometimes called the [[probable error]].  [[Cauchy]] himself exploited such a density function in 1827, with [[infinitesimal]] scale parameter, in defining a [[Dirac delta function]] (see there).

The amplitude of the above Lorentzian function is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Amplitude (or  height)} = \frac{1}{\pi\gamma}. &lt;/math&gt;

The special case when ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''γ'' = 1 is called the '''standard Cauchy distribution''' with the probability density function
:&lt;math&gt; f(x; 0,1) = \frac{1}{\pi (1 + x^2)}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

In physics, a three-parameter Lorentzian function is often used, as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma,I) = \frac{I}{\left[1 + \left(\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]}
 = { I }\left[ { \gamma^2 \over (x - x_0)^2 + \gamma^2  } \right], &lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' is the height of the peak.

===Cumulative distribution function===
The cumulative distribution function ([[cdf]]) is:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x; x_0,\gamma)=\frac{1}{\pi} \arctan\left(\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma}\right)+\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[quantile function|quantile]](inverse [[cdf]]) function of the Cauchy distribution is
:&lt;math&gt;Q(p; x_0,\gamma) = x_0 + \gamma\,\tan\left[\pi\left(p-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the first and third quartiles are (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; – ''γ'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''γ''), and hence the [[interquartile range]] is 2''γ''.

The derivative of the [[quantile]] function, the quantile density function, for the Cauchy distribution is:
:&lt;math&gt;Q'(p; \gamma) = \gamma\,\pi\,{\sec}^2\left[\pi\left(p-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\right].\!&lt;/math&gt;
The [[differential entropy]] of a distribution can be defined in terms of its quantile density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vasicek  |first1=Oldrich |year=1976 |title=A Test for Normality Based on Sample Entropy |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (Methodological) |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=54–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically
:&lt;math&gt;h_e(\text{Cauchy}(\gamma)) = \int_0^1 \log\,(Q'(p; \gamma))\,\mathrm dp = \log(\gamma)\,+\,\log(4\,\pi).\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
The Cauchy distribution is an example of a distribution which has no [[mean]], [[variance]] or higher [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] defined. Its [[mode (statistics)|mode]] and [[median]] are well defined and are both equal to x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

When ''U'' and ''V'' are two independent [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]]s with [[expected value]] 0 and [[variance]] 1,  then the ratio ''U''/''V'' has the standard Cauchy distribution.

If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[independent and identically distributed]] random variables, each with a standard Cauchy distribution, then the [[Arithmetic mean|sample mean]] (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)/''n'' has the same standard Cauchy distribution (the sample median, which is not affected by extreme values, can be used as a measure of central tendency). To see that this is true, compute the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the sample mean:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{\overline{X}}(t) = \mathrm{E}\left(e^{i\,\overline{X}\,t}\right) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean. This example serves to show that the hypothesis of finite variance in the [[central limit theorem]] cannot be dropped. It is also an example of a more generalized version of the central limit theorem that is characteristic of all [[stable distribution]]s, of which the Cauchy distribution is a special case.

The Cauchy distribution is an [[infinitely divisible probability distribution]]. It is also a strictly [[stability (probability)|stable]] distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S.Kotz et al |year=2006 |title=Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences |page=778 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-0-471-15044-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard Cauchy distribution coincides with the [[Student's t-distribution]] with one degree of freedom.

Like all stable distributions, the [[location-scale family]] to which the Cauchy distribution belongs is closed under [[linear transformations]] with [[real number|real]] coefficients. In addition, the Cauchy distribution is the only univariate distribution which is closed under [[Möbius transformation|linear fractional transformations]] with real coefficients.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  In this connection, see also [[McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions]].

===Characteristic function===
Let ''X'' denote a Cauchy distributed random variable. The [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the Cauchy distribution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_X(t; x_0,\gamma) = \mathrm{E}(e^{i\,X\,t}) =\int_{-\infty}^\infty
f(x;x_{0},\gamma)e^{i\,x\,t}\,dx =  e^{i x_{0}t - \gamma\left| t \right|}. &lt;/math&gt;

which is just the [[Fourier transform]] of the probability density.  The original probability density may be expressed in terms of the characteristic function, essentially by using the inverse Fourier transform:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x; x_0,\gamma) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi_X(t;x_0,\gamma)e^{-i\,x\,t}\,dt \!&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that the characteristic function is not [[differentiable]] at the origin: this corresponds to the fact that the Cauchy distribution does not have an [[expected value]].

==Explanation of undefined moments==
===Mean===

If a [[probability distribution]] has a [[probability density function|density function]] ''f''(''x''), then the mean is
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x)\,dx. \qquad\qquad (1)\!&lt;/math&gt;

The question is now whether this is the same thing as
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x f(x)\,dx-\int_{-\infty}^0 |{x}| f(x)\,dx.\qquad\qquad (2) \!&lt;/math&gt;

If at most one of the two terms in (2) is infinite, then (1) is the same as (2). But in the case of the Cauchy distribution, both the positive and negative terms of (2) are infinite.  This means (2) is undefined. Moreover, if (1) is construed as a [[Lebesgue integral]], then (1) is also undefined, since (1) is then defined simply as the difference (2) between positive and negative parts.

However, if (1) is construed as an [[improper integral]] rather than a Lebesgue integral, then (2) is undefined, and (1) is not necessarily [[well-defined]].  We may take (1) to mean
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{-a}^a x f(x)\,dx, \!&lt;/math&gt;

and this is its [[Cauchy principal value]], which is zero, but we could also take (1) to mean, for example,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{-2a}^a x f(x)\,dx, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which is ''not'' zero, as can be seen easily by computing the integral.

Since the integrand is bounded and is not Lebesgue integrable, it is not even [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral|Henstock–Kurzweil integrable]].  Various results in probability theory about [[expected value]]s, such as the [[strong law of large numbers]], will not work in such cases.

===Higher moments===

The Cauchy distribution does not have moments of any order. This follows from [[Hölder's inequality]] which implies that higher moments diverge if lower moments do. In particular, no second central moment exists, as can be verified by direct computation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(X^2) \propto \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {x^2 \over 1+x^2}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {1 \over 1+x^2}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx  -\pi = \infty. \!&lt;/math&gt;

==Estimation of parameters ==

Since the mean and variance of the Cauchy distribution are not defined, attempts to estimate these parameters will not be successful. For example, if ''N'' samples are taken from a Cauchy distribution, one may calculate the sample mean as:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i&lt;/math&gt;

Although the sample values &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_i&lt;/math&gt; will be concentrated about the central value &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt;, the sample mean will become increasingly variable as more samples are taken, due to the increased likelihood of encountering sample points with a large absolute value. In fact, the distribution of the sample mean will be equal to the distribution of the samples themselves, i.e., the sample mean of a large sample is no better (or worse) an estimator of &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; than any single observation from the sample.  Similarly, calculating the sample variance will result in values that grow larger as more samples are taken.

Therefore, more robust means of estimating the central value &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; and the scaling parameter &lt;math&gt;\,\!\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are needed. One simple method is to take the median value of the sample as an estimator of &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; and half the sample [[interquartile range]] as an estimator of &lt;math&gt;\,\!\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Other, more precise and robust methods have been developed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cane  |first1=Gwenda J. |year=1974 |title=Linear Estimation of Parameters of the Cauchy Distribution Based on Sample Quantiles |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=69 |issue=345 |pages= 243–245 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2285535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Jin |year=2010 |title=A Highly Efficient L-estimator for the Location Parameter of the Cauchy Distribution |journal=Computational Statistics |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=97–105 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/3p1430175v4806jq }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[truncated mean]] of the middle 24% of the sample [[order statistics]] produces an estimate for &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; that is more efficient than using either the sample median or the full sample mean.&lt;ref name=rothenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rothenberg|first1=Thomas J.|last2=Fisher|first2=Franklin, M.|last3=Tilanus|first3=C.B.|year=1966|volume=59|issue=306|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|title=A note on estimation from a Cauchy sample|pages=460&amp;ndash;463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=Daniel|year=1966|volume=61|issue=316|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|title=A note on the estimation of the location parameters of the Cauchy distribution|pages=852&amp;ndash;855|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2282794}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the fat tails of the Cauchy distribution, the efficiency of the estimator decreases if more than 24% of the sample is used.&lt;ref name=rothenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;

[[Maximum likelihood]] can also be used to estimate the parameters &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,\!\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  However, this tends to be complicated by the fact that this requires finding the roots of a high degree polynomial, and there can be multiple roots that represent local maxima.&lt;ref name=ferguson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas S.|year=1978|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=73|issue=361|title=Maximum Likelihood Estimates of the Parameters of the Cauchy Distribution for Samples of Size 3 and 4|page=211|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2286549}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, while the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient, it is relatively inefficient for small samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pitman estimator of the Cauchy location parameter|last1=Cohen Freue|first1=Gabriella V.|journal=Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference|volume=137|year=2007|page=1901|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/69424/USEPAP/Coushy%20dist.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The log-likelihood function for the Cauchy distribution for sample size n is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat\ell(\!x_0,\gamma|\,x_1,\dots,x_n) = n \log (\gamma) - \sum_{i=1}^n (\log [(\gamma)^2 + (x_i - \!x_0)^2]) - n \log (\pi)
&lt;/math&gt;

Maximizing the log likelihood function with respect to &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,\!\gamma&lt;/math&gt; produces the following system of equations:

:&lt;math&gt;
 \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \!x_0) / (\gamma^2 + [x_i - \!x_0]^2) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma^2 / (\gamma^2 + [x_i - \!x_0]^2) - n/2 = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving just for &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; requires solving a polynomial of degree 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref name=ferguson/&gt; and solving just for &lt;math&gt;\,\!\gamma&lt;/math&gt; requires solving a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (first for &lt;math&gt;\,\!\gamma^2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt;).  It is also worthwhile to note that &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma^2 / (\gamma^2 + [x_i - \!x_0]^2) &lt;/math&gt; is a monotone function in &lt;math&gt;\,\!\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and that the solution &lt;math&gt;\,\!\gamma&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy &lt;math&gt; \min |x_i-x_0|\le \gamma\le \max |x_i-x_0| &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, whether solving for one parameter or for both paramters simultaneously, a [[numerical analysis|numerical]] solution on a computer is typically required.  The benefit of maximum likelihood estimation is asymptotic efficiency; estimating &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; using the sample median is only about 81% as asymptotically efficient as estimating &lt;math&gt;\,\!x_0&lt;/math&gt; by maximum likelihood.&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=V.

==Circular Cauchy distribution==

If ''X'' is Cauchy distributed with median ''μ'' and scale parameter ''γ'', then the complex variable

:&lt;math&gt;Z = (X - i)/(X+i)\,&lt;/math&gt;

has unit modulus and is distributed on the unit circle with density:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{cc}(\theta;\zeta)=\frac{1 - |\zeta|^2}{2\pi |e^{i\theta} - \zeta|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

with respect to the angular variable &lt;math&gt;\theta=\mathrm{arg}(z)&lt;/math&gt;,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} where

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{\psi - i}{\psi + i}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; expresses the two parameters of the associated linear Cauchy distribution for ''x'' as a complex number:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi=\mu+i\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;

The distribution &lt;math&gt;P_{cc}(\theta;\zeta)&lt;/math&gt; is called the circular Cauchy distribution

(also the complex Cauchy distribution){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} with parameter &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;. The circular Cauchy distribution is related to the [[wrapped Cauchy distribution]]. If &lt;math&gt;P_{wc}(\theta;\psi)&lt;/math&gt; is a wrapped Cauchy distribution with the parameter &lt;math&gt;\psi=\mu+i\gamma&lt;/math&gt; representing the parameters of the corresponding &quot;unwrapped&quot; Cauchy distribution in the variable ''y'' where &lt;math&gt;\theta=(y\,\,\mathrm{mod}\,\,2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;P_{wc}(\theta;\psi)=P_{cc}(\theta,e^{i\psi})\,&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions]] and [[Poisson kernel]] for related concepts.

The circular Cauchy distribution expressed in complex form has finite moments of all orders

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(Z^r) = \zeta^r,  \quad \operatorname{E}(\bar Z^r) = \bar\zeta^r&lt;/math&gt;

for integer &lt;math&gt;r\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;|\phi| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, the transformation

:&lt;math&gt;U(z, \phi) =  (z - \phi)/(1 - \bar \phi z)&lt;/math&gt;

is [[holomorphic]] on the unit disk, and the transformed variable &lt;math&gt;U(Z, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; is distributed as complex Cauchy with parameter &lt;math&gt;U(\zeta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a sample &lt;math&gt;z_1,\ldots, z_n&lt;/math&gt; of size ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2, the maximum-likelihood equation

:&lt;math&gt;n^{-1} U(z, \hat\zeta) = n^{-1} \sum U(z_j, \hat\zeta) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

can be solved by a simple fixed-point iteration:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta^{(r+1)} = U(n^{-1} U(z, \zeta^{(r)}), - \zeta^{(r)})\,&lt;/math&gt;

starting with &lt;math&gt;\zeta^{(0)} = 0.&lt;/math&gt; The sequence of likelihood values is non-decreasing, and the solution is unique for samples containing at least three distinct values.

The maximum-likelihood estimate for the median (&lt;math&gt;\hat\mu&lt;/math&gt;) and scale parameter (&lt;math&gt;\hat\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) of a real Cauchy sample is obtained by the inverse transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat\mu \pm i\hat\gamma = i(1+\hat\zeta)/(1-\hat\zeta).&lt;/math&gt;

For ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;4, closed-form expressions are known for &lt;math&gt;\hat\zeta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=ferguson/&gt; The density of the maximum-likelihood estimator at &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in the unit disk is necessarily of the form:

==Multivariate Cauchy distribution==

A [[random vector]] {{nowrap|1=''X'' = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)′}} is said to have the multivariate Cauchy distribution if every linear combination of its components ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + … + ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a Cauchy distribution. That is, for any constant vector {{nowrap|''a'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the random variable {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = ''a′X''}} should have a univariate Cauchy distribution.&lt;ref name=ferg2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas S.|title=A Representation of the Symmetric Bivariate Cauchy Distribution|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=|issue=|year=1962|page=1256|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2237984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The characteristic function of a multivariate Cauchy distribution is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_X(t) =  e^{i\,x_0\,(t)-\gamma\,(t)}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,x_0\,(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,(t)&lt;/math&gt; are real functions with &lt;math&gt;\,x_0\,(t)&lt;/math&gt; a [[homogeneous function]] of degree one and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,(t)&lt;/math&gt; a positive homogeneous function of degree one.&lt;ref name=ferg2/&gt;  More formally:&lt;ref name=ferg2/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\,x_0\,(at) = a\,x_0\,(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,(at) = |a|\gamma\,(t) &lt;/math&gt; for all ''t''.

An example of a bivariate Cauchy distribution can be given by:&lt;ref name=bivar&gt;{{cite journal|title=Non-linear Integral Equations to Approximate Bivariate Densities with Given Marginals and Dependence Function|last1=Molenberghs|first1=Geert|last2=Lesaffre|first2=Emmanuel|journal=Statistica Sinica|volume=7|year=1997|pages=713&amp;ndash;738|url=http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A7n310.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x, y; x_0,y_0,\gamma)= { 1 \over \pi } \left[ { \gamma \over ((x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 +\gamma^2)^{1.5}  } \right] .
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that in this example, even though there is no analogue to a covariance matrix, x and y are not [[Independence (probability theory)|statistically independent]].&lt;ref name=bivar/&gt;

Analogously to the univariate density, the multidimensional Cauchy density also relates to the [[Multivariate Student distribution]]. They are equivalent when the degrees of freedom parameter is equal to one.  The density of a k dimension Student distribution with one degree of freedom becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
f( {\mathbf x} ; {\mathbf\mu},{\mathbf\Sigma}, k)= \frac{\Gamma\left[(1+k)/2\right]}{\Gamma(1/2)\pi^{k/2}\left|{\mathbf\Sigma}\right|^{1/2}\left[1+({\mathbf x}-{\mathbf\mu})^T{\mathbf\Sigma}^{-1}({\mathbf x}-{\mathbf\mu})\right]^{(1+k)/2}} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Properties and details for this density can be obtained by taking it as a particular case of the Multivariate Student density.

[[Image:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|320px|Control systems play a critical role in [[space flight]]]]

'''Control engineering''' or '''Control systems engineering''' is the [[engineering]] discipline that applies [[control theory]] to design systems with predictable behaviors.  The practice uses [[sensors]] to measure the output performance of the device being controlled (often a vehicle) and those measurements can be used to give [[feedback]] to the input [[actuators]] that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called [[automatic control]] (such as [[cruise control]] for regulating a car's speed). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by [[mathematical model]]ing of [[system]]s of a diverse range.

== Overview  ==
Modern day control engineering (also called control systems engineering) is a relatively new field of study that gained a significant attention during 20th century with the advancement in technology. It can be broadly defined as practical application of [[control theory]]. Control engineering has an essential role in a wide range of control systems, from simple household washing machines to high-performance [[F-16]] fighter aircraft. It seeks to understand physical systems, using mathematical modeling, in terms of inputs, outputs and various components with different behaviors; use control systems design tools to develop [[Controller (control theory)|controller]]s for those systems; and implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology. A [[control system|system]] can be [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[fluid]], [[chemical]], [[finance|financial]] and even [[biology|biological]], and the mathematical modeling, analysis and controller design uses [[control theory]] in one or many of the [[Time domain|time]], [[frequency domain|frequency]] and [[S domain|complex-s]] domains, depending on the nature of the design problem.

== History ==

Automatic control Systems were first developed over two thousand years ago. The first feedback control device on record is thought to be the ancient water clock of Ktesibios in Alexandria Egypt around the third century B.C. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water flow from that vessel. This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols captured the city in 1258 A.D. A variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply to just entertain. The latter includes the automata, popular in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again; these automata are examples of open-loop control. Milestones among feedback, or &quot;closed-loop&quot; automatic control devices, include the temperature regulator of a furnace attributed to Drebbel, circa 1620, and the centrifugal flyball governor used for regulating the speed of steam engines by James Watt in 1788.

In his 1868 paper &quot;On Governors&quot;, J. C. Maxwell (who discovered the Maxwell electromagnetic field equations) was able to explain instabilities exhibited by the flyball governor using differential equations to describe the control system. This demonstrated the importance and usefulness of mathematical models and methods in understanding complex phenomena, and signaled the beginning of mathematical control and systems theory. Elements of control theory had appeared earlier but not as dramatically and convincingly as in Maxwell's analysis.

Control theory made significant strides in the next 100 years. New mathematical techniques made it possible to control, more accurately, significantly more complex dynamical systems than the original flyball governor. These techniques include developments in optimal control in the 1950s and 1960s, followed by progress in stochastic, robust, adaptive and optimal control methods in the 1970s and 1980s. Applications of control methodology have helped make possible space travel and communication satellites, safer and more efficient aircraft, cleaner auto engines, cleaner and more efficient chemical processes, to mention but a few.

Before it emerged as a unique discipline, control engineering was practiced as a part of mechanical engineering and control theory was studied as a part of [[electrical engineering]], since [[electrical circuits]] can often be easily described using control theory techniques. In the very first control relationships, a current output was represented with a voltage control input. However, not having proper technology to implement electrical control systems, designers left with the option of less efficient and slow responding mechanical systems. A very effective mechanical controller that is still widely used in some hydro plants is the [[Centrifugal governor|governor]]. Later on, previous to modern [[power electronics]], process control systems for industrial applications were devised by mechanical engineers using [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] and [[Hydraulic system|hydraulic]] control devices, many of which are still in use today.

== Control theory ==
{{main|Control Theory}}

There are two major divisions in control theory, namely, classical and modern, which have direct implications over the control engineering applications. The scope of classical control theory is limited to [[Single-Input and Single-Output|single-input and single-output]] (SISO) system design. The system analysis is carried out in time domain using [[differential equations]], in complex-s domain with [[Laplace transform]] or in frequency domain by transforming from the complex-s domain. All systems are assumed to be second order and single variable, and higher-order system responses and multivariable effects are ignored. A controller designed using classical theory usually requires on-site tuning due to design approximations. Yet, due to easier physical implementation of classical controller designs as compared to systems designed using modern control theory, these controllers are preferred in most industrial applications. The most common controllers designed using classical control theory are [[PID controller]]s.

In contrast, modern control theory is carried out strictly in the complex-s or the frequency domain, and can deal with multi-input and multi-output ([[MIMO]]) systems. This overcomes the limitations of classical control theory in more sophisticated design problems, such as fighter aircraft control. In modern design, a system is represented as a set of first order [[differential equation]]s defined using [[state variables]]. [[Nonlinear control|Nonlinear]], [[multivariable control|multivariable]], [[adaptive control|adaptive]] and [[robust control]] theories come under this division. Being fairly new, modern control theory has many areas yet to be explored. Scholars like [[Rudolf E. Kalman]] and [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] are well-known among the people who have shaped modern control theory.

== Control systems ==
Control engineering is the engineering [[discipline]] that focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic systems]] (e.g. [[mechanics|mechanical]] [[system]]s) and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controller]]s that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner.  Although such controllers need not be electrical many are and hence control engineering is often viewed as a subfield of electrical engineering.  However, the falling price of microprocessors is making the actual implementation of a control system essentially trivial{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.  As a result, focus is shifting back to the mechanical engineering discipline, as intimate knowledge of the physical system being controlled is often desired.

[[Electrical circuit]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s can all be used to implement [[Control system]]s. Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s.

In most of the cases, control engineers utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. This is often accomplished using a [[PID controller]] system. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system, which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[torque]] accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback. In practically all such systems [[stability theory|stability]] is important and control theory can help ensure stability is achieved.

Although feedback is an important aspect of control engineering, control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is known as [[open loop control]]. A classic example of [[open loop control]] is a [[washing machine]] that runs through a pre-determined cycle without the use of [[sensor]]s.

== Control engineering education ==
At many universities, control engineering courses are taught in [[electrical engineering|Electrical]] and [[Electronic Engineering]], [[Mechatronics Engineering]], [[Mechanical engineering]], and [[Aerospace engineering]]; in others it is connected to [[computer science]], as most control techniques today are implemented through computers, often as [[Embedded systems]] (as in the automotive field). The field of control within [[chemical engineering]] is often known as [[process control]]. It deals primarily with the control of variables in a chemical process in a plant. It is taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of any chemical engineering program, and employs many of the same principles in control engineering. Other engineering disciplines also overlap with control engineering, as it can be applied to any system for which a suitable model can be derived.

Control engineering has diversified applications that include science, finance management, and even human behavior.  Students of control engineering may start with a linear control system course dealing with the time and complex-s domain, which requires a thorough background in elementary mathematics and [[Laplace transform]] (called classical control theory).  In linear control, the student does frequency and time domain analysis.  [[Digital control]] and [[nonlinear control]] courses require [[z transform]]ation and algebra respectively, and could be said to complete a basic control education. From here onwards there are several sub branches.

== Recent advancement ==
Originally, control engineering was all about continuous systems. Development of computer control tools posed a requirement of discrete control system engineering because the communications between the computer-based digital controller and the physical system are governed by a [[computer clock]]. The equivalent to [[Laplace transform]] in the discrete domain is the [[z-transform]]. Today many of the control systems are computer controlled and they consist of both digital and analog components.

Therefore, at the design stage either digital components are mapped into the continuous domain and the design is carried out in the continuous domain, or analog components are mapped in to discrete domain and design is carried out there. The first of these two methods is more commonly encountered in practice because many industrial systems have many continuous systems components, including mechanical, fluid, biological and analog electrical components, with a few digital controllers.

Similarly, the design technique has progressed from paper-and-ruler based manual design to [[computer-aided design]], and now to [[computer-automated design]] (CAutoD), which has been made possible by [[evolutionary computation]].  CAutoD can be applied not just to tuning a predefined control scheme, but also to controller structure optimisation, system identification and invention of novel control systems, based purely upon a performance requirement, independent of any specific control scheme,.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, K.C. and Li, Y.

'''Chagas disease''' ({{lang-pt|doença de Chagas}}, {{lang-es|enfermedad de Chagas-Mazza}}, ''mal de Chagas'' in both languages; also called '''American trypanosomiasis''') is a [[tropical disease|tropical]] [[parasitic disease]] caused by the [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''. ''T. cruzi'' is commonly transmitted to humans and other mammals by an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], the [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects of the subfamily [[Triatominae]] (family [[Reduviidae]]) most commonly species belonging to the ''[[Triatoma]]'', ''[[Rhodnius]]'', and ''[[Panstrongylus]]'' genera.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;
The disease may also be spread through [[blood transfusion]] and [[organ transplantation]], ingestion of food contaminated with [[parasite]]s, and [[vertical transmission|from a mother to her fetus]].&lt;ref name=emed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/214581-overview |title=Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis) |author= Louis V Kirchhoff |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2010-12-17 |format= |work= |publisher= eMedicine |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of Chagas disease vary over the course of an infection. In the early, acute stage, symptoms are mild and usually produce no more than local swelling at the site of infection. The initial acute phase is responsive to [[antiparasitic]] treatments, with 60-90% cure rates. After 4–8 weeks, individuals with active infections enter the chronic phase of Chagas disease that is asymptomatic for 60-80% of chronically infected individuals through their lifetime.  The antiparasitic treatments also appear to delay or prevent the development of disease symptoms during the chronic phase of the disease, but 20-40% of chronically infected individuals will still eventually develop life-threatening heart and digestive system disorders. The currently available antiparasitic treatments for Chagas disease are [[benznidazole]] and [[nifurtimox]], which can cause temporary side effects in many patients including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.&lt;ref name=Bern&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bern C, Montgomery SP, Herwaldt BL, ''et al.'' |title=Evaluation and treatment of chagas disease in the United States: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=18 |pages=2171–81 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18000201 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.18.2171 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18000201 |issn= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rassi A, Rassi A, Marin-Neto JA |title=Chagas disease |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9723 |pages=1388–402 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20399979 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60061-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(10)60061-X |issn= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rassi A, Dias JC, Marin-Neto JA, Rassi A |title=Challenges and opportunities for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of Chagas' disease |journal=Heart |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=524–34 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19131444 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2008.159624 |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19131444 |issn= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chagas disease is contracted primarily in the [[Americas]], particularly in poor, rural areas of [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and [[South America]]; very rarely, the disease has originated in the [[Southern United States]]. The insects that spread the disease are known by various local names, including ''vinchuca'' in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, ''barbeiro'' (the [[barber surgeon|barber]]) in Brazil, ''pito'' in Colombia, ''chinche'' in Central America, ''chipo'' in Venezuela, ''chupança'', ''chinchorro'', and &quot;the kissing bug&quot;. It is estimated that as many as 8 to 11 million people in Mexico, Central America, and South America have Chagas disease, most of whom do not know they are infected. Large-scale population movements from rural to urban areas of Latin America and to other regions of the world have increased the geographic distribution of Chagas disease, and cases have been noted in many countries, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt; Control strategies have mostly focused on eliminating the triatomine insect vector and preventing transmission from other sources.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Heart pathology Chagas disease.JPG|thumb|Gross anatomy of a heart that has been damaged by chronic Chagas disease. See also: [[:Image:Heart radiology Chagas disease.JPG|Chagas heart, radiology]]]]
The human disease occurs in two stages: an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] stage, which occurs shortly after an initial [[infection]], and a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] stage that develops over many years.

The acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom free or exhibits only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body. The most recognized marker of acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes swelling of the eyelids on the side of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle ([[myocarditis]]) or brain ([[meningoencephalitis]]).&lt;ref name=Guimaraes1968&gt;{{cite journal | author= Guimarães FN, da Silva NN, Clausell DT, de Mello AL, Rapone T, Snell T, Rodrigues N| title=Um surto epidêmico de doença de Chagas de provável transmissão digestiva, ocorrido em Teutonia (Estrêla - Rio Grande Do Sul) | journal=Hospital (Rio J) | volume=73 | issue=6 | pages=1767–804| year=1968 |url=http://en.calameo.com/read/00000948401a1fdb85f76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; 

If symptoms develop during the acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within 3–8 weeks in approximately 90% of individuals.&lt;ref name=Bern/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt; Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60-80% will never develop symptoms (called ''indeterminate'' chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20-40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called ''determinate'' chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.&lt;ref name=Bern/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt;

The symptomatic (determinate) chronic stage affects the [[nervous system]], [[digestive system]] and [[heart]]. About two thirds of people with chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one third of patients go on to develop [[digestive system]] damage, resulting in dilation of the [[digestive tract]] ([[megacolon]] and [[megaesophagus]]), accompanied by severe [[weight loss]]. [[Swallowing]] difficulties (secondary [[achalasia]]) may be the first symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=emed/&gt; Twenty to fifty percent of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt; Up to 10% of chronically infected individuals develop [[neuritis]] that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment. Isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement, including [[dementia]], confusion, chronic [[encephalopathy]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensitivity]] and [[Motor skill|motor]] deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Córdova E, Maiolo E, Corti M, Orduña T |title=Neurological manifestations of Chagas' disease |journal=Neurol. Res. |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=238–44 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20406601 |doi=10.1179/016164110X12644252260637 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The clinical manifestations of Chagas disease are due to cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an [[inflammatory response]], cellular [[lesions]], and [[fibrosis]]. For example, intracellular [[amastigote]]s destroy the intramural neurons of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart [[aneurysm]]s, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;

==Transmission==
[[File:Rhodnius prolixus70-300.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]'' is the principal vector in Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras and some parts of Nicaragua and El Salvador.]]

In Chagas-endemic areas, the main mode of transmission is through an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] called a triatomine bug.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; A triatomine becomes infected with ''T. cruzi'' by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs. The bugs emerge at night, when the inhabitants are sleeping. Because they tend to feed on people’s faces, triatomine bugs are also known as “kissing bugs.” After they bite and ingest blood, they defecate on the person. Triatomines pass ''T. cruzi'' parasites (called [[trypomastigote]]s) in feces left near the site of the bite wound. Scratching the site of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound, or through intact [[mucous membranes]], such as the [[conjunctiva]]. Once inside the host, the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they differentiate into intracellular [[amastigote]]s. The amastigotes multiply by [[binary fission]] and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then released into the bloodstream. This cycle is repeated in each newly infected cell. Replication resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; (See also: [[:Image:Trypanosoma cruzi LifeCycle.gif|Life cycle and transmission of ''T. cruzi'']])

Dense vegetation (such as that of tropical [[rainforest]]s) and urban habitats are not ideal for the establishment of the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the [[sylvatic]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and its fauna are thinned by economical exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly [[deforestation|deforested]] areas, [[piassava palm]] culture areas, and some parts of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Teixeira AR, Monteiro PS, Rebelo JM |title=Emerging Chagas disease: trophic network and cycle of transmission of ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' from palm trees in the Amazon |journal=Emerging Infect Dis |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=100–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11266300 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no1/teixeira.htm |doi=10.3201/eid0701.010115 |pmc=2631687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''T. cruzi'' can also be transmitted through [[blood transfusions]]. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated [[antibodies]]), all blood components are infective. The parasite remains viable at 4°C for at least 18 days or up to 250 days when kept at room temperature. It is unclear whether ''T. cruzi'' can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wendel S |title=Transfusion transmitted Chagas disease: Is it really under control? |journal=Acta Trop |volume= 115|issue= 1-2|pages= 28–34|year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20044970 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.12.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001-706X(09)00386-6 |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modes of transmission include [[organ transplant]]ation, through [[breast milk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Santos Ferreira C, Amato Neto V, Gakiya E, Bezerra RC, Alarcón RS |title=Microwave treatment of human milk to prevent transmission of Chagas disease |journal=[[Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo]] |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |year=2003 |pmid=12751321 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by accidental laboratory exposure. Chagas disease can also be spread congenitally (from a pregnant woman to her baby) through the [[placenta]], and accounts for approximately 13% of stillborn deaths in parts of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hudson L, Turner MJ |title=Immunological consequences of infection and vaccination in South American trypanosomiasis [and discussion] |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond, B, Biol Sci |volume=307 |issue=1131 |pages=51–61 |year=1984 |month=November |pmid=6151688 |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2990154 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1984.0108}} Retrieved February 22, 2007 through [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, farm workers in the state of [[Paraíba]], Brazil, were infected by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated [[açaí palm]] fruit juice and [[garapa|sugar cane juice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |month=April |title=Chagas’ disease (American trypanosomiasis) in southern Brazil |journal=CDR Weekly |volume=15 |issue=13 |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/CDR/archives/2005/cdr1305.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=United Kingdom [[Health Protection Agency]] |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shikanai-Yasuda MA, Marcondes CB, Guedes LA |title=Possible oral transmission of acute Chagas' disease in Brazil |journal=Rev Inst Med Trop São Paulo |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=351–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1844961 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=da Silva Valente SA, de Costa Valente V, Neto HF |title=Considerations on the epidemiology and transmission of Chagas disease in the Brazilian Amazon |journal=Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz |volume=94 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=395–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10677763 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0074-0276(99)09400077&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated [[guava]] juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alarcón de Noya B, Díaz-Bello Z, Colmenares C, ''et al.''|title=Large urban outbreak of orally acquired acute Chagas disease at a school in Caracas, Venezuela|journal=J Infect Dis|year=2010|volume=201|issue=9|pages=1308&amp;ndash;15|pmid=20307205|doi=10.1086/651608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

[[Image:Trypanosoma cruzi crithidia.jpeg|thumb|Photomicrograph of [[Giemsa]]-stained ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' ([[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]])]]

The presence of ''T. cruzi'' is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It can be detected by [[microscope|microscopic]] examination of fresh anti[[coagulate]]d [[blood]], or its [[buffy coat]], for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]], for direct visualization of [[parasitism|parasites]]. Microscopically, ''T. cruzi'' can be confused with ''[[Trypanosoma rangeli]]'', which is not known to be pathogenic in humans. Isolation of ''T. cruzi'' can occur by inoculation into [[mouse|mice]], by culture in specialized media (for example,, NNN, LIT); and by [[xenodiagnosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Brumpt E| title=Le xénodiagnostic. Application au diagnostic de quelques infections parasitaires et en particulier à la trypanosomose de Chagas | journal=Bull Soc Pathol Exot | volume=7 | issue=10 | pages=706–10| year=1914 |url=http://www.pathexo.fr/documents/articles-bull/1914/1914n10/T7-10-706.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; where uninfected [[Reduviidae]] bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.&lt;ref name= emed/&gt;

Various [[immunoassay]]s for ''T. cruzi'' are available and can be used to distinguish among [[Strain (biology)|strains]] ([[zymodeme]]s of ''T.cruzi'' with divergent pathogenicities). These tests include: detecting [[complement fixation]], indirect [[hemagglutination]], indirect [[fluorescence]] assays, [[radioimmunoassay]]s, and [[ELISA]]. Alternatively, diagnosis and strain identification can be made using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).&lt;ref name= emed/&gt;

==Prevention==

[[Blood transfusion]] was formerly the second most common mode of transmission for Chagas disease, but the development and implementation of [[blood bank]] screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the last decade. [[Blood donation]]s in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Castro E |title=Chagas' disease: lessons from routine donation testing |journal=Transfus Med |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=16–23 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19302451 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3148.2009.00915.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0958-7578&amp;date=2009&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=16 |issn= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gascon&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gascon J, Bern C, Pinazo MJ |title=Chagas disease in Spain, the United States and other non-endemic countries |journal=Acta Trop. |volume= 115|issue= 1-2|pages= 22–7|year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19646412 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.07.019 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001-706X(09)00199-5 |issn= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.&lt;ref name=Gascon/&gt; The US FDA has approved two Chagas tests including one recently approved in April 2010, and has published guidelines that recommend testing of all donated blood and tissue products.&lt;ref name=Gascon/&gt;&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm210429.htm |title=FDA Approves Chagas Disease Screening Test for Blood, Tissue and Organ Donors |work= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these tests are not required in U.S., it is estimated that 75-90% of the blood supply is currently tested for Chagas, including all units collected by the [[American Red Cross]] which accounts for 40% of the U.S. blood supply.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcrossblood.org/hospitals/infectious-disease-testing#Chagas__disease__T._cruzi___2007_ |title=Infectious Disease Testing |format= |work= American Red Cross|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chagas Biovigilance Network reports current incidents of Chagas positive blood products in the United States, as reported by labs using the screening test approved by the FDA in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aabb.org/programs/biovigilance/Pages/chagas.aspx |title=Chagas' Biovigilance Network |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
There are two approaches to treating Chagas disease, [[antiparasitic]] treatment, to kill the parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of infection.

===Medication===

Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include [[azole]] or [[nitro]] derivatives such as [[benznidazole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garcia S, Ramos CO, Senra JF |title=Treatment with benznidazole during the chronic phase of experimental Chagas' disease decreases cardiac alterations |journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|Antimicrob Agents Chemother]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=1521–8 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15793134 |pmc=1068607 |doi=10.1128/AAC.49.4.1521-1528.2005 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15793134}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nifurtimox]]. Both agents are limited in their capacity to effect parasitologic cure (a complete elimination of ''T. cruzi'' from the body), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buckner FS, Wilson AJ, White TC, Van Voorhis WC |title=Induction of resistance to azole drugs in ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=3245–50 |year=1998 |month=December |pmid=9835521 |pmc=106029 |doi= |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9835521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that antiparasitic treatment leads to parasitological cure in about 60-85% of adults and more than 90% of infants treated in the first year of acute phase Chagas disease. Children (age 6 to 12-years) with chronic disease have a cure rate of about 60% with benznidazole. While the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with Chagas, treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic Chagas infections.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt; 

Treatment of chronic infection in women prior to or during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether [[prophylactic]] treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example,, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example,, those with [[HIV]] infection).&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;

===Complications===

In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For example, [[pacemaker]]s and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug [[amiodarone]], may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dubner S, Schapachnik E, Riera AR, Valero E |title=Chagas disease: state-of-the-art of diagnosis and management |journal=Cardiol J |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=493–504 |year=2008 |pmid=19039752}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[surgery]] may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for [[heart transplantation]] surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a [[contraindication]] for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the [[immunosuppression]] that follows surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bocchi EA, Bellotti G, Mocelin AO |title=Heart transplantation for chronic Chagas' heart disease |journal=Ann Thorac Surg |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1727–33 |year=1996 |month=June |pmid=8651775 |doi=10.1016/0003-4975(96)00141-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0003-4975(96)00141-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that survival rates in Chagas patients could be significantly improved by using lower dosages of the immunosuppressant drug [[ciclosporin]]. Recently, direct [[stem cell therapy]] of the heart muscle using [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow cell transplantation]] has been shown to dramatically reduce risks of heart failure in Chagas patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vilas-Boas F, Feitosa GS, Soares MB |trans_title=Early results of bone marrow cell transplantation to the myocardium of patients with heart failure due to Chagas disease |language=Portuguese |journal=Arq Bras Cardiol |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=159–66 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16951834 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0066-782X2006001500014&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |title=Early results of bone marrow cell transplantation to the myocardium of patients with heart failure due to Chagas disease}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental treatments===
Several experimental treatments have shown promise in animal models. These include inhibitors of [[2,3-oxidosqualene|oxidosqualene]] [[cyclase]] and [[squalene synthase]],&lt;ref name=Grupo&gt;Scientific Working Group on Chagas Disease [April 2005] (July 2007).

==Epidemiology==
[[Image:Carte maladie Chagas.png|thumb|Chagas in [[Latin America]] (A:[[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]] zones)]]

Chagas disease affects 8-10 million people living in endemic Latin American countries, with an additional 300,000-400,000 living in non-endemic countries, including Spain and the United States. An estimated 41,200 new cases occur annually in endemic countries and 14,400 infants are born with congenital Chagas disease annually. About 20,000 deaths are attributed to Chagas disease each year.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi1/&gt;

The disease is present in 18 countries on the American continents, ranging from the southern [[United States]] to northern [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Centers for Disease Control (CDC) |url= http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/TrypanosomiasisAmerican.htm |title=DPDx&amp;nbsp;– Trypanosomiasis, American. Fact Sheet |accessdate= 2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chagas exists in two different ecological zones. In the [[Southern Cone]] region the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where triatomine breed and feed on the over 150 species from 24 families of domestic and wild mammals, as well as humans, that are the [[natural reservoir]]s of ''T.cruzi''.&lt;ref name=NatRev&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morel CM, Lazdins J |title=Chagas disease |journal=Nat Rev Microbiol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=14–5 |year=2003|month=October |pmid=15040175 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Triatominae bugs feed on birds, they appear to be immune against infection and therefore are not considered to be a ''T. cruzi'' reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals that are part of the ancient, [[sylvatic]] (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Pinto-Dias JC | year = 1992 | title = Epidemiology of Chagas disease | conference = ISBT Brazil '92.

==History==
[[File:Carlos chagas 2.jpg|thumb|Carlos Chagas, in his laboratory at the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz.]]
The disease was named after the [[Brazil]]ian [[physician]] and [[Infectology|infectologist]] [[Carlos Chagas]], who first described it in 1909,&lt;ref name=Chagas_1909&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chagas C | title=Neue Trypanosomen |journal=Vorläufige Mitteilung Arch Schiff Tropenhyg |year=1909 |volume=13 |pages = 120–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Redhead_2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Redhead SA, Cushion MT, Frenkel JK, Stringer JR |title=''Pneumocystis'' and ''Trypanosoma cruzi'': nomenclature and typifications |journal=J Eukaryot Microbiol |year=2006 |pages=2–11 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pmid=16441572 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2005.00072.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chagas_1909b&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chagas C |title=Nova tripanozomiase humana: Estudos sobre a morfolojia e o ciclo evolutivo do Schizotrypanum cruzi n. gen., n. sp., ajente etiolojico de nova entidade morbida do homem [New human trypanosomiasis.

He discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now [[Reduviidae]]: [[Triatominae]]) harbored a flagellate protozoan, a new species of the ''[[Trypanosoma]]'' genus, and was able to prove experimentally that it could be transmitted to [[marmoset]] monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed that [[squirrel monkey]]s were also vulnerable to infection.&lt;ref name=Hulsebos_1989&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hulsebos LH, Choromanski L, Kuhn RE |title=The effect of interleukin-2 on parasitemia and myocarditis in experimental Chagas' disease |journal=J Protozool |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=293–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2499678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chagas named the [[pathogen]]ic parasite ''Trypanosoma cruzi''&lt;ref name=Chagas_1909 /&gt; and later that year as ''Schizotrypanum cruzi'',&lt;ref name=Chagas_1909b /&gt; both honoring [[Oswaldo Cruz]], the noted Brazilian physician and [[epidemiologist]] who fought successfully [[epidemics]] of [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], and [[bubonic plague]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and other cities in the beginning of the 20th century. Chagas’ work is unique in the [[history of medicine]] because he was the only researcher so far to describe ''solely'' and completely a new [[infectious disease]]: its [[pathogen]], [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], [[Host (biology)|host]], clinical manifestations, and epidemiology.

Nevertheless, he believed (falsely) until 1925 that the main infection route was by the bite of the insect—and not by its [[feces]], as was proposed by his colleague [[Emile Brumpt]] in 1915 and assured by [[Silveira Dias]] in 1932, Cardoso in 1938, and Brumpt himself in 1939.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|''Pneumocystis'']], later infamously to be linked to PCP ([[Pneumocystis pneumonia]] in AIDS victims).&lt;ref name=Redhead_2006 /&gt; Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus ''Schizotrypanum'', but following the description of ''Pneumocystis'' by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name ''Trypanosoma cruzi''.

In [[Argentina]], the disease is known as ''[http://www.drwebsa.com.ar/alcha/hist4.htm Mal de Chagas-Mazza]'', in honor of [[Salvador Mazza]], the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[physician]] who in 1926 began investigating the disease and over the years became the principal researcher of this disease in the country. Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in Argentina in 1927, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and Argentine government policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |title=Historia de la enfermedad de Chagas |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesized that [[Charles Darwin]] might have suffered from Chagas disease as a result of a bite of the so-called Great Black Bug of the [[Pampas]] (vinchuca) (see [[Charles Darwin's illness]]). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the [[Andes]] near [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at the [[Westminster Abbey]] by using modern [[PCR]] techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's [[curator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adler D |title=Darwin's Illness |journal=Isr J Med Sci |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=218–21 |year=1989 |pmid=2496051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christiaan Neethling Barnard''' (November 8, 1922 &amp;ndash; September 2, 2001) was a [[South Africa]]n [[Heart|cardiac]] [[surgery|surgeon]] who performed the world's first successful human-to-human [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]].

== Early life ==
Barnard grew up in [[Beaufort West]], [[Cape Province]], [[Union of South Africa]]. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. One of his four brothers, Abraham, died of a heart problem at the age of five. Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the [[University of Cape Town]] [[Medical School]], where he obtained his [[MBChB|MB ChB]] in 1945.

==Career==
Barnard did his internship and residency at the [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] in [[Cape Town]], after which he worked as a general practitioner in [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]], a rural town in the [[Cape Province]]. In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar. He completed his [[Masters degree]], receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the [[University of Cape Town]]. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation entitled &quot;The treatment of tuberculous meningitis&quot;.

In 1956, he received a two-year scholarship for postgraduate training in cardiothoracic surgery at the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Minneapolis]], [[United States]]. It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with [[Norman Shumway]], who did much of the pioneering research leading to the first human heart transplant. In 1958 he received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis entitled, &quot;The [[aortic valve]] - problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve&quot;. The same year he was awarded [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree for his dissertation entitled &quot;The aetiology of congenital intestinal [[atresia]]&quot;. Barnard described the two years he spent in the USA as &quot;the most fascinating time in my life.&quot; 

Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed cardiothoracic surgeon at the Groote Schuur Hospital, establishing the hospital's first heart unit. He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town. Three years later he was appointed Head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the teaching hospitals of the University of Cape Town. He rose to the position of Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1962. Barnard's younger brother Marius, who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard's right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery. Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the [[Tetralogy of Fallot]] and [[Ebstein's anomaly]]. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. Among the many awards he received over the years, he was named [[Professor Emeritus]] in 1984.

== The first successful heart transplant ==
Following the first successful [[kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed the first kidney &lt;!--Do not change this to heart, Barnard performed kidney transplants in addition to heart transplants--&gt;transplant in South Africa in October 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2008 |title=Flesh and Blood: Organ Transplantation and Blood Transfusion in Twentieth-Century America |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JaZn25Uv6XwC&amp;dq=flesh+and+blood&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |first=Susan E. |last=Lederer |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=174 |isbn=9780195161502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard experimented for several years with animal heart transplants. More than 50 dogs received transplanted hearts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily_I&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date=November 29, 1987 |title=Memories of the Heart |publisher=''Daily Intelligencer'' |location=Doylestown, Pennsylvania |page=A-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the availability of new breakthroughs introduced by several pioneers, amongst them [[Norman Shumway]], several surgical teams were in a position to prepare for a human heart transplant. Barnard had a patient willing to undergo the procedure, but as with other surgeons, he needed a suitable donor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily_I&quot; /&gt;

He performed the world's first human heart transplant operation on 3 December 1967, in an operation assisted by his brother, [[Marius Barnard (surgeon)|Marius Barnard]]; the operation lasted nine hours and used a team of thirty people. The patient, [[Louis Washkansky]], was a 54-year-old [[grocer]], suffering from [[diabetes]] and incurable [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily_I&quot; /&gt; Barnard later wrote, &quot;For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.&quot; The donor heart came from a young woman, [[Denise Darvall]], who had been rendered brain damaged in an accident on December 2, 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. After securing permission from Darvall's father to use her heart, Barnard performed the transplant. Rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother, Dr. Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyze it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.&lt;ref&gt;Donald McRae, &quot;Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart,&quot; New York, Putnam, 2006, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, Dr. Marius Barnard recounted, &quot;Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily_I&quot; /&gt; Washkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days. However, he succumbed to [[pneumonia]] as he was taking [[Immunosuppressive drug]]s. Though the first patient with the heart of another human being survived for only a little more than two weeks, Barnard had passed a milestone in a new field of life-extending surgery. 

Barnard became an international superstar overnight and was celebrated around the world for his daring accomplishment. He was quite [[photogenic]], and enjoyed the media attention following the operation. Barnard continued to perform heart transplants. A transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, [[Philip Blaiberg]], survived for 19 months. Dorothy Fisher was given a new heart in 1969 and became the first black recipient. She lived for 12 years and 6 months after the transplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=November 8, 1997 |title=Barnard Celebrates 75th in Home Town |url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/1997/11/08/page%207.htm |publisher=''Daily Dispatch'' |accessdate=2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 7, 1994 |title=Dirk van Zyl, 68; Had '71 Transplant |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/obituaries/dirk-van-zyl-68-had-71-transplant.html |publisher=''New York Times'' |accessdate=2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard performed ten [[Heart transplantation#Orthotopic procedure|orthotopic]] transplants (1967 &amp;ndash; 1973). He was also the first to perform a [[Heart transplantation#Heterotopic procedure|heterotopic]] heart transplant, an operation that he himself devised. Forty-nine consecutive heterotopic heart transplants were performed in Cape Town between 1975 and 1984.

When many surgeons — disillusioned by poor results — gave up cardiac transplantation, Barnard persisted until the advent of [[ciclosporin]], which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He was also the first surgeon to attempt [[xenograft]] transplantation in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a young girl unable to leave artificial life support after a second aortic valve replacement. He was later accused of wrongdoing by her parents.

== Public life ==
After his first successful heart transplant Barnard became known as the &quot;film star surgeon&quot;. He was loved by his patients throughout the world, hundreds of whom were treated free of charge, and hated by many others who were jealous of his instant success. He was accused by some colleagues in the profession of &quot;stealing&quot; the idea and the opportunity to perform the first heart transplant. Often considered a spoiled and arrogant personality, he was also regarded as kind and considerate by others. Because of his widely publicized love affairs, he became jokingly known as &quot;doctor of hearts&quot;, referring to the heart as an emotional symbol rather than in its usual medical context. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Barnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of [[apartheid]], and was not afraid to criticize his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent in order to travel abroad. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame in order to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan's brother, Dr. [[Marius Barnard (surgeon)|Marius Barnard]], went into politics, and was elected to the legislature on an anti-apartheid platform. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was probably because he was a &quot;[[white South African]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1422/14220850.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Barnard's first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a [[nurse]], whom he married in 1948 while practicing medicine in [[Ceres, South Africa|Ceres]]. The couple had two children: Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951-1984&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/christiaan-barnard-celebrated-pioneer-of-heart-transplant-surgery-dies-aged-78-667863.html Christiaan Barnard, celebrated pioneer of heart transplant surgery, dies aged 78]&quot;, ''The Independent'', September 3, 2001. Retrieved 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;). International fame took a toll on his personal life, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, and they had two children: Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974).&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio&gt;{{cite web |title=Christiaan Barnard Biography |url=http://www.allsands.com/entertainment/people/christiaanbarna_aoi_gn.htm |accessdate=2009-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He divorced Zoellner in 1982.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt; Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt; They also had two children: Armin (born 1990) and Lara (born 1997), but this last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.&lt;ref name=cbarnardbio/&gt;

Barnard allegedly had affairs with a number of famous women, including [[Gina Lollobrigida]] and [[Françoise Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Celebrity Surgeon: Christiaan Barnard - A Life|first=Chris|last=Logan|publisher=[[Jonathan Ball Publishers]]|year=2004|isbn=1868421635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement ==
Barnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing [[rheumatoid arthritis]] in his hands which precluded his surgical career. He struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in USA. After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the USA, and an acting consultant for various institutions.

He had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted ''[[Glycel]]'', an expensive &quot;anti-aging&quot; skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] soon thereafter.{{Verify source|date=June 2007}} He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in [[Switzerland]], where the controversial &quot;rejuvenation therapy&quot; was practiced. He later expressed regret for endorsing Glycel.{{Verify source|date=June 2007}}

Barnard divided the remainder of his years between [[Austria]], where he established the [[Christiaan Barnard Foundation]], dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game-farm in [[Beaufort West]], South Africa.

== Death ==
Christiaan Barnard died in September 2001, whilst on holiday in [[Paphos]], [[Cyprus]]. Early reports claimed that he had died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], although an [[autopsy]] showed his death to be caused by a severe asthma attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Autopsy confirms asthma killed Barnard | date= September 5, 2001 | publisher= | url =http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main_old.php?id=4655&amp;archive=1 | work =[[Cyprus Mail]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927202905/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main_old.php?id=4655&amp;archive=1 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Christiaan Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, ''One Life'', was published in 1969 and subsequently sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town. His second autobiography, ''The Second Life'', was published in 1993, 8 years before his death.

Apart from his autobiographies, Dr Barnard also wrote several other books including:
*''The Donor''
*''Your Healthy Heart''
*''In The Night Season''
*''The Best Medicine''
*''Arthritis Handbook: How to Live With Arthritis''
*''Good Life Good Death: A Doctor's Case for Euthanasia and Suicide''

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Close Relationships}}

'''Concubinage''' is the state of a woman or man in an ongoing, usually [[matrimonial]]ly oriented, relationship with somebody to whom they cannot be married, often because of a difference in [[social status]].

==Concubinage==
A ''concubine'' is generally a woman in an ongoing, marriage-like relationship with a man whom she cannot marry for a specific reason. It may be because she is of lower social rank than the man (including [[slave]] status) or because the man is already married. Generally, only men of high economic and social status have concubines. Many historical rulers maintained concubines as well as wives.

Historically, concubinage was frequently voluntary (by the woman and/or her family's arrangement), as it provided a measure of economic security for the woman involved.

Under [[Roman law]], Roman culture under the Empire came to tolerate concubinage so long as the relation was durable and exclusive; for the [[jurist]]s, concubinage was an honourable ''[[de facto]]'' situation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, &quot;The Household and its Freed Slaves&quot;, in Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby, eds, ''A History of Private Life !; FromPagan Rome to Byzantium'' 1987:76).&lt;/ref&gt;

When having no legal status but being recognized, or defined in law, as in [[ancient China]], concubinage was akin, although inferior, to marriage. The children of a concubine were recognized as legal offspring of the father; their inheritance rights may have been inferior to younger children of a marriage, or they may have received a smaller inheritance. Men frequently used concubines to bear heirs when a wife was not successful in having sons.

In distinction to such systems, modern [[Western world|Western]] laws do not acknowledge the legal status of concubines, and recognize only [[monogamous]] marriages. Any other relationship does not enjoy legal protection, making the woman essentially a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]].

==Ancient Greece==
In [[Ancient Greece]], the practice of keeping a slave concubine (Greek ''&quot;pallakis&quot;'') was little recorded but appears throughout Athenian history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens |page = 98 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Draconian law prescribed that a man could kill another man caught with his concubine for the production of free children (thereby implying that concubines' children were not granted citizenship)&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot;/&gt;.  While references to the sexual exploitation of maidservants appear in literature, it was considered disgraceful for a man to keep such women under the same roof as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens | pages = 98–99 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some interpretations of ''[[hetaera]]'' have held they were concubines when one had a permanent relationship with a single man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens | page = 101 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concubinus==
In [[Ancient Rome]], ''concubinus'' was the title of a young male slave chosen by his master as a [[Sexual partner|lover]].  Concubini were often referred to ironically in the literature of the time. [[Catullus]] assumes in the wedding poem 61.126 that the young [[Manorialism|manor lord]] has a ''concubinus'' who considers himself elevated above the other slaves.

==In the Bible==

Among the [[Israelites]], men commonly acknowledged their concubines, and such women enjoyed the same rights in the house as legitimate wives.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot;&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Pilegesh|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=313&amp;letter=P&amp;search=Pilegesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal difference in the [[Bible]] between a wife and a concubine is that wives had [[dowry|dowries]], while concubines did not.

The concubine commanded the same respect and [[inviolability]] as the wife.  The man to whom she belonged was dishonoured if other men lay hands on her.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; For instance, [[David]] is portrayed as having been dishonoured when his concubines had a sexual relationship with his son [[Absalom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:21-25|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, legitimate wives often gave their maids to their husbands to atone, at least in part, if they were barren, as in the cases of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], [[Leah]] and [[Zilpah]], [[Rachel]] and [[Bilhah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; The children of the concubine had equal rights with those of the legitimate wife;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt; biblical figures such as Gideon, [[David]], and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] says that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Judaism==
In Judaism, concubines are referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''pilegesh''. The term is a non-Hebrew, non-Semitic loanword deriving from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word pallakis, Greek ''παλλακίς''&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;, meaning a mistress staying in house. Or the [[Aramaic]] phrase ''palga isha'', meaning ''half-wife''{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 21a&lt;/ref&gt; the difference between a concubine and a full wife was that the latter received a ''[[ketubah|marriage contract]]'' (Hebrew:''ketubah'') and her marriage (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]'') was preceded by a formal betrothal (''[[erusin]]''), neither being the case for a concubine. But, one opinion in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] argues that the concubine should also receive a ''marriage contract'', but without including a clause specifying a divorce settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncPil&quot; /&gt;

Certain [[Jew]]ish thinkers, such as [[Maimonides]], believed that concubines are strictly reserved for kings, and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine; indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[Human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage. Before Maimonides concluded this, [[Sunni Muslims]] officially prohibited ''[[mutah]]'' (i.e. temporary marriage) relationships; some commentators' {{Who|date=November 2009}} suggest that Maimonides changed his view in response to this development, similar to [[Gershom ben Judah]]'s ban on [[polygamy]] being made after Christians had prohibited it.

Maimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage; for example, it is severely condemned in [[Leviticus Rabbah]].&lt;ref&gt;''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly object to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.

In the Hebrew of the contemporary [[State of Israel]], the word ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word ''[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]'' - i.e. the female partner in extramarital relations, even when these relations have no legal recognition. There are attempts to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital and extramarital relationships which (in their view) would be permitted by [[halacha|Jewish religious law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=16328 Mathew Wagner, &quot;Kosher sex without marriage&quot;], Jpost]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Dickter, &quot;ISO: Kosher Concubine&quot;, ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html SUZANNE GLASS, &quot;THE CONCUBINE CONNECTION&quot;], ''The Independent'', London October 20, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Ancient China==
[[File:A Chinese Emperor With his Concubines Inspecting his Fantasy Fishing Fleet.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A European painting of an [[Emperor of China]] inspecting his fantasy fishing fleet with his concubines]]

In [[Ancient China]], successful men often supported several concubines – [[Chinese Emperors]] kept thousands.&lt;ref name=CAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Concubines in Ancient China|url=http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-history/concubines-of-ancient-china|publisher=Beijing Made Easy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A concubine's treatment and situation was highly variable according to the social status of the male with whom she was engaged, as well as the attitude of the wife; the position of the concubine was generally inferior to that of the wife. Though a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in status to legitimate children. Concubines were allegedly, on occasion, buried alive with their masters to &quot;keep them company in the afterlife.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAC&quot;/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on ancient Chinese concubines, history and literature has examples of concubines achieving great power and influence. For example, in one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of China, ''[[The Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' (believed to be a [[semi-autobiographical]] account of author [[Cao Xueqin]]'s own family life), three generations of the Jia family are supported by one favorite concubine of the Emperor.

Imperial concubines, kept by Emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], were traditionally guarded by [[eunuchs]] to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAC&quot;/&gt; Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Dowager Empress Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in China’s history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to the [[Xianfeng Emperor]] and gave birth to his only male heir, who would become the [[Tongzhi Emperor]]. She would eventually become the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in China for 47 years after her son's death.&lt;ref name=EmpressChina&gt;{{cite book|Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave|title=Dragon lady: the life and legend of the last empress of China|year=1993|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
When [[slavery]] became institutionalized in the North American colonies, white men, whether or not they were married, sometimes took enslaved women as concubines. Marriage between the races was prohibited by law in the colonies and the later United States. Many colonies and states also had laws against [[miscegenation]], or any interracial relations, but these were generally ignored by white men. In some cases men might have long-term relationships with enslaved women, giving them and their mixed-race children freedom and providing their children with apprenticeships, education and transfer of capital. In other cases, they might do nothing for them except in a minor way. Such arrangements were more prevalent in [[Southern United States|the South]] during the antebellum years. Historians now widely believe that the widower [[Thomas Jefferson]], both before and during his presidency of the United States in the early 19th century, had an intimate relationship of 38 years with his [[mixed-race]] slave [[Sally Hemings]], in such an arrangement.  He freed all four of her surviving children as they came of age; the Hemings were the only slave family to go free from Monticello. A [[Jefferson DNA data|1998 DNA study]] showed a match between the Jefferson male line and a male descendant of Sally Hemings.

In [[Louisiana]] and former French territories, a system of concubinage called ''placage'' developed. European men took enslaved or [[free people of color|free women of color]] as mistresses after making arrangements to give them a dowry, house or other transfer of property, and sometimes, if they were enslaved, offering freedom and education for their children.  A third class of [[free people of color]] developed, especially in [[New Orleans]].  Many became educated, artisans and property owners. French-speaking and practicing [[Catholics]] who combined French and African-American culture, they created an elite between the whites of European descent and the masses of slaves. Today descendants of the free people of color are generally called [[Louisiana Creole people]].

'''Central Plaza''' is the third tallest [[skyscraper]] in [[Hong Kong]]. With a height of 374&amp;nbsp;m (1,227&amp;nbsp;ft), Central Plaza is only surpassed by [[International Finance Centre|2 IFC]] in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and the [[International Commerce Centre|ICC]] in [[West Kowloon]]. The building is located at 18 [[Harbour Road]], in [[Wan Chai]] on [[Hong Kong Island]]. It was the tallest building in [[Asia]] from 1992 to 1996, until the [[Shun Hing Square]] in [[Shenzhen]], [[People's Republic of China]], was built. The 78-storey building was completed in August 1995. The building surpassed the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] as the tallest building in Hong Kong until the completion of [[International Finance Centre#Two International Finance Centre|2IFC]].

Central Plaza was also the tallest [[reinforced concrete]] building in the world, until it was surpassed by [[CITIC Plaza]], [[Guangzhou]]. The building uses a triangular [[floor plan]]. On the top of the tower is a four-bar neon clock that indicates the time by displaying different colors in 15 minute intervals, blinking at the change of the quarter.

An [[anemometer]] is installed on the tip of the building's mast; the anemometer sits at 378&amp;nbsp;m (1,240&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. The mast has a height of 102&amp;nbsp;m (335&amp;nbsp;ft). It also houses the world's highest [[Church (building)|church]] inside a skyscraper, [http://www.skycitychurch.com Sky City Church].

==Design==
[[Image:HK Central Plaza 60407 1st.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Main Lobby]]
Central Plaza is made up of two principal components: a free standing 368&amp;nbsp;m (1,207&amp;nbsp;ft) high office tower and a 30.5&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) high podium block attached to it. The tower is made up of three sections: a 30.5&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) high tower base forming the main entrance and public circulation spaces; a 235.4&amp;nbsp;m (772&amp;nbsp;ft) tall tower body containing 57 office floors, a sky lobby and five mechanical plant floors; and the tower top consist of six mechanical plant floors and a 102&amp;nbsp;m (335&amp;nbsp;ft) tall tower mast.

The ground level public area along with the public sitting out area form an 8,400&amp;nbsp;m² (90,400&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft) landscaped garden with fountain, trees and artificial stone paving. No commercial element is included in the podium. The first level is a public thoroughfare for three pedestrian bridges linking the Mass Transit Railway, the Convention and Exhibition Centre and the China Resource Building. By turning these space to public use, the building got 20% plot ratio more as bonus. The shape of the tower is not truly triangular but with its three corners cut off to provide better internal office spaces.

==Design constraints==
[[Image:Central Plaza Sky Lobby.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The Sky Lobby]]

===Triangular shaped floor plan===
The building was designed to be in triangular shape because it could provide 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared with the square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement could provide better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of 9 to 13.4 metres and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.
Nonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core also to assume a triangular configuration with only limited space. This makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, electrical trunking and piping gathered inside the core area had to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- To allow the next headline a clean row. --&gt;

===Super high-rise building===
As the building is situated opposite to the HKCEC, the only way to get more sea view for the building and not be obstructed by the neighbouring high-rise buildings is to build it tall enough. However, a tall building brings a lot of difficulties to structural and building services design, for example, excessive system static pressure for water systems, high line voltage drop and long distance of vertical transportation. All these problems can increase the capital cost of the building systems and impair the safety operation of the building.

===Maximum clear ceiling height===
As a general practice, for achieving a clear height of 2.6 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;m (8.5 to 8.9&amp;nbsp;ft), a floor-to-floor height of 3.9 to 4.0&amp;nbsp;m (12.8 to 13.1&amp;nbsp;ft) would be required. However, because of high windload in Hong Kong for such a super high-rise building, every increase in building height by a metre would increase the structural cost by more than HK$1 million (HK$304,800 per ft). Therefore a comprehensive study was conducted and finally a floor height of 3.6&amp;nbsp;m (11.8&amp;nbsp;ft) was adopted. With this issue alone, an estimated construction cost saving for a total of 58 office floors, would be around HK$30 million. Yet at the same time, a maximum ceiling height of 2.6&amp;nbsp;m (8.5&amp;nbsp;ft) in office area could still be achieved with careful coordination and dedicated integration.

===Structural constraints===
[[Image:Hong Kong City Church.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sky City Church lounge area in the Apex]]
*The site is a newly reclaimed area with a maximum water table rises to about 2 meters (6.5&amp;nbsp;ft) below ground level. In the original brief, a 6 storey basement is required, therefore a diaphragm wall design came out.
*The keyword to this project is: time. With a briefing in a limited detail, the structural engineer needed to start work The diaphragm wall design allowed for the basement to be constructed by the top-down method. It allows the superstructure to be constructed at the same time as the basement, thereby removing time consuming basement construction period from the critical path.
*Wind loading is another major design criterion in Hong Kong as it is situated in an area influenced by typhoons. Not only must the structure be able to resist the loads generally and the cladding system and its fixings resist higher local loads, but the building must also perform dynamically in an acceptable manner such that predicted movements lie within acceptable standards of occupant comfort criteria. To ensure that all aspects of the building's performance in strong winds will be acceptable, a detailed wind tunnel study was carried out by Professor [[Alan Davenport]] at the [[Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory|BLWT]] at the [[University of Western Ontario|UWO]].

===Steel structure vs reinforced concrete===
Steel structure is more commonly adopted in high-rise building. In the original scheme, an externally cross-braced framed tube was applied with primary/secondary beams carrying metal decking with reinforced concrete slab. The core was also of steelwork, designed to carry vertical load only. Later after a financial review by the developer, they decided to reduce the height of the superstructure by increasing the size of the floor plate so as to reduce the complex architectural requirements of the tower base which means a highstrength concrete solution became possible.

In the final scheme, columns at 4.6&amp;nbsp;m (15.1&amp;nbsp;ft) centres and 1.1&amp;nbsp;m (3.6&amp;nbsp;ft) deep floor edge beams were used to replace the large steel corner columns. As climbing form and table form construction method and efficient construction management are used in this project which make this reinforced concrete structure take no longer construction time than the steel structure. And the most attractive point is that the reinforced concrete scheme can save HK$230 million compared to that of steel structure. Hence the reinforced concrete structure was adopted and Central Plaza is now one of the tallest reinforced concrete buildings in the world.

In the reinforced concrete structure scheme, the core has a similar arrangement to the steel scheme and the wind shear is taken out from the core at the lowest basement level and transferred to the perimeter diaphragm walls. In order to reduce large shear reversals in the core walls in the basement, and at the top of the tower base level, the ground floor, basement levels 1 and 2 and the 5th and 6th floors, the floor slabs and beams are separated horizontally from the core walls.

Another advantage of using reinforced concrete structure is that it is more flexible to cope with changes in structural layout, sizes and height according to the site conditions by using table form system.

'''Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio''' (29 September 1571 – 18 July 1610) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[artist]] active in [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Malta]], and [[Sicily]] between 1593 and 1610. His paintings, which combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, had a formative influence on the [[Baroque]] [[Baroque painting|school of painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Caravaggio&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500115312 Getty profile, including variant spellings of the artist's name.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio trained as a painter in [[Milan]] under a master who had himself trained under [[Titian]]. In his early twenties Caravaggio moved to Rome where, during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, many huge new churches and [[palazzi]] were being built and paintings were needed to fill them. During the [[Counter-Reformation]] the Roman Catholic Church searched for [[Sacred art|religious art]] with which to counter the threat of [[Protestantism]], and for this task the artificial conventions of [[Mannerism]], which had ruled art for almost a century, no longer seemed adequate. Caravaggio's novelty was a radical [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]] which combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of [[chiaroscuro]] that came to be known as [[Tenebrism]], the shift from light to dark with little intermediate value. He burst upon the Rome art scene in 1600 with the success of his first public commissions, the [[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|''Martyrdom of Saint Matthew'']] and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of Saint Matthew]]''. Thereafter he never lacked for commissions or patrons, yet he handled his success atrociously. He was thrown in jail on several occasions, vandalized his own apartment, and ultimately had a death warrant issued for him by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37059/caravaggios-rap-sheet-reveals-him-to-have-been-a-lawless-sword-obsessed-wildman-and-a-terrible-renter/ Caravaggio's Rap Sheet Reveals Him to have been a Lawless, Sword-Obsessed Wildman, and a Terrible Renter] ARTINFO.com&lt;/ref&gt; An early published notice on him, dating from 1604 and describing his lifestyle three years previously, tells how &quot;after a fortnight's work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Floris Claes van Dijk, a contemporary of Caravaggio in Rome in 1601, quoted in John Gash, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.13. The quotation originates in [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''Het Schilder-Boek'' of 1604, translated in full in Howard Hibbard, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;. The first reference to Caravaggio in a contemporary document from Rome is the listing of his name, with that of Prospero Orsi as his partner, as an 'assistente' in a procession in October 1594 in honour of St. Luke (see H. Waga &quot;Vita nota e ignota dei virtuosi al Pantheon&quot; Rome 1992, Appendix I, pp.219 and 220ff). The earliest informative account of his life in the city  is a court transcript dated 11 July 1597 where Caravaggio and Prospero Orsi were witnesses to a crime near San Luigi de' Francesi. (See &quot;The earliest account of Caravaggio in Rome&quot; Sandro Corradini and Maurizio Marini, [[The Burlington Magazine]], pp.25-28).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1606 he killed a young man in a brawl and fled from Rome with a price on his head. In [[Malta]] in 1608 he was involved in another brawl, and yet another in Naples in 1609, possibly a deliberate attempt on his life by unidentified enemies. By the next year, after a relatively brief career, he was dead.

Infamous while he lived, Caravaggio was forgotten almost immediately after his death, and it was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. Despite this, his influence on the new Baroque style that eventually emerged from the ruins of Mannerism, was profound. It can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of [[Rubens]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Bernini]], and [[Rembrandt]], and artists in the following generation heavily under his influence were called the &quot;Caravaggisti&quot; or &quot;Caravagesques&quot;, as well as [[Tenebrism|Tenebrists]] or &quot;Tenebrosi&quot; (&quot;shadowists&quot;). Andre Berne-Joffroy, [[Paul Valéry]]'s secretary, said of him: &quot;What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gilles Lambert, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life (1571–1592)===
Caravaggio was born in [[Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by the finding of the baptism certificate from the Milanese parish of Santo Stefano in Brolo:  [http://www.italica.rai.it/index.php?categoria=bio&amp;scheda=caravaggio_prima_parte Rai International Online]. Traditionally it was believed that he was born in the Lombardy town of Caravaggio, hence his name.&lt;/ref&gt; where his father, Fermo Merisi, was a household administrator and architect-decorator to the Marchese of [[Caravaggio, Italy|Caravaggio]], a town not far from the city of [[Bergamo]]. His mother, Lucia Aratori, came from a propertied family of the same district. In 1576 the family moved to Caravaggio to escape a plague which ravaged Milan, and Caravaggio's father died there in 1577. It is assumed that the artist grew up in Caravaggio, but his family kept up connections with the [[Sforza]]s and with the powerful [[Colonna]] family, who were allied by marriage with the Sforzas and destined to play a major role later in Caravaggio's life.

Caravaggio's mother died in 1584, and in the same year he was apprenticed for four years to the Milanese painter [[Simone Peterzano]], described in the contract of apprenticeship as a pupil of [[Titian]]. Caravaggio appears to have stayed in the Milan-Caravaggio area after his apprenticeship ended, but it is possible that he visited [[Venice]] and saw the works of [[Giorgione]], whom [[Federico Zuccari]] later accused him of imitating,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Titian]]. He would also have become familiar with the art treasures of Milan, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]'', and with the regional Lombard art, a style which valued simplicity and attention to naturalistic detail and was closer to the [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]] of Germany than to the stylised formality and grandeur of Roman [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Giorgi, &quot;Caravaggio: Master of light and dark – his life in paintings&quot;, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome (1592–1600)===
[[File:Caravaggio - I Musici.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Musician'', 1595–1596, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York]].]]
Caravaggio left Milan for Rome in mid-1592, in flight after &quot;certain quarrels&quot; and the wounding of a police officer. He arrived in Rome &quot;naked and extremely needy ... without fixed address and without provision ... short of money.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted without attribution in Robb, p.35, apparently based on the three primary sources, Mancini, Baglione and Bellori, all of whom depict Caravaggio's early Roman years as a period of extreme poverty (see references below).&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later he was performing hack-work for the highly successful [[Giuseppe Cesari]], [[Pope Clement VIII]]'s favourite artist, &quot;painting flowers and fruit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Pietro Bellori, ''Le Vite de' pittori, scultori, et architetti moderni'', 1672: &quot;Michele was forced by necessity to enter the services of Cavalier Giuseppe d'Arpino, by whom he was employed to paint flowers and fruits so realistically that they began to attain the higher beauty that we love so much today.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in his factory-like workshop. Known works from this period include a small ''[[Boy Peeling Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy Peeling a Fruit]]'' (his earliest known painting), a ''[[Boy with a Basket of Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy with a Basket of Fruit]]'', and the ''[[Young Sick Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Young Sick Bacchus]]'', supposedly a self-portrait done during convalescence from a serious illness that ended his employment with Cesari. All three demonstrate the physical particularity for which Caravaggio was to become renowned: the fruit-basket-boy's produce has been analysed by a professor of horticulture, who was able to identify individual cultivars right down to &quot;... a large fig leaf with a prominent fungal scorch lesion resembling [[anthracnose]] (''Glomerella cingulata'').&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/caravaggio/caravaggio_l.html Caravaggio's Fruit: A Mirror on Baroque Horticulture (Jules Janick, Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana)]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Canestra di frutta (Caravaggio).jpg|250px|thumb|left|''[[Basket of Fruit (Caravaggio)|Basket of Fruit]],'' c. 1595–1596, oil on canvas, [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]], [[Milan]].]]
Caravaggio left Cesari in January 1594, determined to make his own way. His fortunes were at their lowest ebb, yet it was now that he forged some extremely important friendships, with the painter [[Prospero Orsi]], the architect [[Onorio Longhi]], and the sixteen year old [[Sicily|Sicilian]] artist [[Mario Minniti]]. Orsi, established in the profession, introduced him to influential collectors; Longhi, more balefully, introduced him to the world of Roman street-brawls; and Minniti served as a model and, years later, would be instrumental in helping Caravaggio to important commissions in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Puglisi, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.79. Longhi was with Caravaggio on the night of the fatal brawl with Tomassoni; Robb, &quot;M&quot;, p.341, believes that Minniti was as well.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|The Fortune Teller]]'', his first composition with more than one figure, shows Mario being cheated by a gypsy girl. The theme was quite new for Rome, and proved immensely influential over the next century and beyond. This, however, was in the future: at the time, Caravaggio sold it for practically nothing. ''[[Cardsharps|The Cardsharps]]'' — showing another unsophisticated boy falling the victim of card cheats — is even more psychologically complex, and perhaps Caravaggio's first true masterpiece. Like the ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|Fortune Teller]]'' it was immensely popular, and over 50 copies survive. More importantly, it attracted the patronage of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria Del Monte]], one of the leading connoisseurs in Rome. For Del Monte and his wealthy art-loving circle Caravaggio executed a number of intimate chamber-pieces — ''[[The Musicians (Caravaggio)|The Musicians]]'', ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'', a tipsy ''[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]'', an allegorical but realistic ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard (Caravaggio)|Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'' — featuring Minniti and other adolescent models.

The realism returned with Caravaggio's first paintings on religious themes, and the emergence of remarkable spirituality. The first of these was the ''[[Penitent Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Penitent Magdalene]]'', showing [[Mary Magdalene]] at the moment when she has turned from her life as a courtesan and sits weeping on the floor, her jewels scattered around her. &quot;It seemed not a religious painting at all ... a girl sitting on a low wooden stool drying her hair ... Where was the repentance ... suffering ... promise of salvation?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robb, p.79. Robb is drawing on Bellori, who praises Caravaggio's &quot;true&quot; colours but finds the naturalism offensive: &quot;He (Caravaggio) was satisfied with [the] invention of nature without further exercising his brain.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It was understated, in the Lombard manner, not histrionic in the Roman manner of the time. It was followed by others in the same style: ''[[Saint Catherine (Caravaggio)|Saint Catherine]]'', ''[[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Martha and Mary Magdalene]]'', ''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]]'', a ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac (Caravaggio)|Sacrifice of Isaac]]'', a ''[[Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy (Caravaggio)|Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy]]'', and a ''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio)|Rest on the Flight into Egypt]]''. The works, while viewed by a comparatively limited circle, increased Caravaggio's fame with both connoisseurs and his fellow artists. But a true reputation would depend on public commissions, and for these it was necessary to look to the Church.

Already evident was the intense realism or naturalism for which Caravaggio is now famous. He preferred to paint his subjects as the eye sees them, with all their natural flaws and defects instead of as idealised creations. This allowed a full display of Caravaggio's  virtuosic talents. This shift from accepted standard practice and the classical idealism of [[Michelangelo]] was very controversial at the time. Not only was his realism a noteworthy feature of his paintings during this period, he turned away from the lengthy preparations traditional in central Italy at the time. Instead, he preferred the Venetian practice of working in oils directly from the subject - half-length figures and still life. One of the characteristic paintings by Caravaggio at this time which gives a good demonstration of his virtuoso talent was his work, ''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio, London version)|Supper at Emmaus]]'' from c.1600–1601.

===&quot;Most famous painter in Rome&quot; (1600–1606)===

In 1599, presumably through the influence of Del Monte, Caravaggio was contracted to decorate the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in the church of [[San Luigi dei Francesi]]. The two works making up the commission, the [[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|''Martyrdom of Saint Matthew'']] and ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of Saint Matthew]]'', delivered in 1600, were an immediate sensation. Caravaggio's [[tenebrism]] (a heightened [[chiaroscuro]]) brought high drama to his subjects, while his acutely observed realism brought a new level of emotional intensity. Opinion among Caravaggio's artist peers was polarized. Some denounced him for various perceived failings, notably his insistence on painting from life, without drawings, but for the most part he was hailed as a great artistic visionary: &quot;The painters then in Rome were greatly taken by this novelty, and the young ones particularly gathered around him, praised him as the unique imitator of nature, and looked on his work as miracles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bellori. The passage continues: &quot;[The younger painters] outdid each other in copying him, undressing their models and raising their lights; and rather than setting out to learn from study and instruction, each readily found in the streets or squares of Rome both masters and models for copying nature.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio went on to secure a string of prestigious commissions for religious works featuring violent struggles, grotesque decapitations, torture and death, most notable and most technically masterful among them [[The Taking of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Taking of Christ]] of circa 1602 for the Mattei Family, recently rediscovered in Ireland after two centuries. For the most part each new painting increased his fame, but a few were rejected by the various bodies for whom they were intended, at least in their original forms, and had to be re-painted or find new buyers. The essence of the problem was that while Caravaggio's dramatic intensity was appreciated, his realism was seen by some as unacceptably vulgar.&lt;ref&gt;For an outline of the Counter-Reformation Church's policy on decorum in art, see Giorgi, p.80. For a more detailed discussion, see Gash, p.8ff; and for a discussion of the part played by notions of decorum in the rejection of &quot;St Matthew and the Angel&quot; and &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot;, see Puglisi, pp.179–188.&lt;/ref&gt; His first version of ''[[Saint Matthew and the Angel (Caravaggio)|Saint Matthew and the Angel]]'', featured the saint as a bald peasant with dirty legs attended by a lightly clad over-familiar boy-angel, was rejected and a second version had to be painted as ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]''. Similarly, ''[[The Conversion of Saint Paul (Caravaggio)|The Conversion of Saint Paul]]'' was rejected, and while another version of the same subject, the ''[[Conversion on the Way to Damascus]]'', was accepted, it featured the saint's horse's haunches far more prominently than the saint himself, prompting this exchange between the artist and an exasperated official of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]]: &quot;Why have you put a horse in the middle, and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] on the ground?&quot; &quot;Because!&quot; &quot;Is the horse God?&quot; &quot;No, but he stands in God's light!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted without attribution in Lambert, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Caravaggio - Martirio di San Pietro.jpg|250px|thumb|upright|''[[Crucifixion of St. Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]'', 1601. [[Cerasi Chapel]], [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], [[Rome]].]]

Other works included ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment]]'', the ''[[Madonna di Loreto (Caravaggio)|Madonna di Loreto]]'' (''Madonna of the Pilgrims''), the [[Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (Caravaggio)|''Grooms' Madonna'']], and the ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]''. The history of these last two paintings illustrate the reception given to some of Caravaggio's art, and the times in which he lived. The [[Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (Caravaggio)|''Grooms' Madonna'']], also known as [[Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri) (Caravaggio)|Madonna dei palafrenieri]], painted for a small altar in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, remained there for just two days, and was then taken off. A cardinal's secretary wrote: &quot;In this painting there are but vulgarity, sacrilege, impiousness and disgust...One would say it is a work made by a painter that can paint well, but of a dark spirit, and who has been for a lot of time far from God, from His adoration, and from any good thought...&quot;
The ''[[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|Death of the Virgin]]'', then, commissioned in 1601 by a wealthy jurist for his private chapel in the new Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala, was rejected by the Carmelites in 1606. Caravaggio's contemporary [[Giulio Mancini]] records that it was rejected because Caravaggio had used a well-known prostitute as his model for the Virgin;&lt;ref&gt;Mancini: &quot;Thus one can understand how badly some modern artists paint, such as those who, wishing to portray the Virgin Our Lady, depict some dirty prostitute from the Ortaccio, as Michelangelo da Caravaggio did in the Death of the Virgin in that painting for the Madonna della Scala, which for that very reason those good fathers rejected it, and perhaps that poor man suffered so much trouble in his lifetime.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Baglione]], another contemporary, tells us it was due to Mary's bare legs&lt;ref&gt;Baglione: &quot;For the [church of] Madonna della Scala in Trastevere he painted the death of the Madonna, but because he had portrayed the Madonna with little decorum, swollen and with bare legs, it was taken away, and the Duke of Mantua bought it and placed it in his most noble gallery.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; —a matter of decorum in either case. Caravaggio scholar John Gash suggests that the problem for the Carmelites may have been theological rather than aesthetic, in that Caravaggio's version fails to assert the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary]], the idea that the Mother of God did not die in any ordinary sense but was assumed into Heaven. The replacement altarpiece commissioned (from one of Caravaggio's most able followers, [[Carlo Saraceni]]), showed the Virgin not dead, as Caravaggio had painted her, but seated and dying; and even this was rejected, and replaced with a work which showed the Virgin not dying, but ascending into Heaven with choirs of angels. In any case, the rejection did not mean that Caravaggio or his paintings were out of favour. The ''Death of the Virgin'' was no sooner taken out of the church than it was purchased by the Duke of Mantua, on the advice of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and later acquired by [[Charles I of England]] before entering the French royal collection in 1671.

One secular piece from these years is ''[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Victorious]]'', painted in 1602 for [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], a member of Del Monte's circle. The model was named in a memoir of the early 17th century as &quot;Cecco&quot;, the diminutive for Francesco. He is possibly Francesco Boneri, identified with an artist active in the period 1610–1625 and known as [[Cecco del Caravaggio]] ('Caravaggio's Cecco'),&lt;ref&gt;While Gianni Papi's identification of Cecco del Caravaggio as Francesco Boneri is widely accepted, the evidence connecting Boneri to Caravaggio's servant and model in the early 17th century is circumstantial. See Robb, pp193–196.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying a bow and arrows and trampling symbols of the warlike and peaceful arts and sciences underfoot. He is unclothed, and it is difficult to accept this grinning urchin as the Roman god [[Cupid]] – as difficult as it was to accept Caravaggio's other semi-clad adolescents as the various angels he painted in his canvases, wearing much the same stage-prop wings. The point, however, is the intense yet ambiguous reality of the work: it is simultaneously Cupid and Cecco, as Caravaggio's Virgins were simultaneously the Mother of Christ and the Roman courtesans who modeled for them.

===Exile and death (1606–1610)===

Caravaggio led a tumultuous life. He was notorious for brawling, even in a time and place when such behavior was commonplace, and the transcripts of his police records and trial proceedings fill several pages. On 29 May 1606, he killed, possibly unintentionally, a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni from Terni (Umbria).&lt;ref&gt;The circumstances of the brawl and the death of Ranuccio Tomassoni remain mysterious. Several contemporary ''avvisi'' referred to a quarrel over a gambling debt and a tennis game, and this explanation has become established in the popular imagination. But recent scholarship has made it clear that more was involved. Good modern accounts are to be found in Peter Robb's &quot;M&quot; and Helen Langdon's &quot;Caravaggio: A Life&quot;. An interesting theory relating the death to Renaissance notions of honour and symbolic wounding has been advanced by art historian [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]]. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/1396127/Red-blooded-Caravaggio-killed-love-rival-in-bungled-castration-attempt.html 'Red-blooded Caravaggio killed love rival in bungled castration attempt']&lt;/ref&gt; Previously his high-placed patrons had protected him from the consequences of his escapades, but this time they could do nothing. Caravaggio, outlawed, fled to [[Naples]]. There, outside the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities and protected by the Colonna family, the most famous painter in Rome became the most famous in Naples. His connections with the [[Colonna family|Colonnas]] led to a stream of important church commissions, including the ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'', and ''[[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|The Seven Works of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In 1606, following the death of Tomassoni, he fled first to the Colonna estates south of Rome, then on to Naples where Costanza Colonna Sforza, widow of Francesco Sforza, in whose husband's household Caravaggio's father had held a position, maintained a palace. Costanza's brother Ascanio was Cardinal-Protector of the Kingdom of Naples, another brother, Marzio, was an advisor to the Spanish Viceroy, and a sister was married into the important Neapolitan Carafa family—connections which might help explain the cornucopia of major commissions which fell into Caravaggio's lap in that city. Costanza's son Fabrizio Sforza Colonna, Knight of Malta and general of the Order's galleys, appears to have facilitated his arrival in the island in 1607 and his escape the next year, and he stayed in Costanza's Neapolitan palazzo on his return there in 1609. These connections are treated in most biographies and studies—see, for example, Catherine Puglisi, &quot;Caravaggio&quot;, p.258, for a brief outline. Helen Langdon, &quot;Caravaggio: A Life&quot;, ch.12 and 15, and Peter Robb, &quot;M&quot;, pp.398ff and 459ff, give a fuller account.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his success in Naples, after only a few months in the city Caravaggio left for [[Malta]], the headquarters of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]], presumably hoping that the patronage of [[Alof de Wignacourt]], Grand Master of the Knights, could help him secure a pardon for Tomassoni's death. De Wignacourt proved so impressed at having the famous artist as official painter to the Order that he inducted him as a knight, and the early biographer Bellori records that the artist was well pleased with his success.  Major works from his Malta period include a huge ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]'' (the only painting to which he put his signature) and a ''[[Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page (Caravaggio)|Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page]]'', as well as portraits of other leading knights. Yet by late August 1608 he was arrested and imprisoned.  The circumstances surrounding this abrupt change of fortune have long been a matter of speculation, but recent investigation has revealed it to have been the result of yet another brawl, during which the door of a house was battered down and a knight seriously wounded.&lt;ref&gt;The discovery of the evidence for this brawl was reported by Dr Keith Sciberras of the University of Malta, in &quot;Frater Michael Angelus in tumultu: the cause of Caravaggio's imprisonment in Malta&quot;, ''The Burlington Magazine'', CXLV, April 2002, pp.229–232, and &quot;Riflessioni su Malta al tempo del Caravaggio&quot;, ''Paragone Arte'', Anno LII N.629, July 2002, pp.3–20.  Sciberras' findings are summarised online at [http://caravaggio.com/preview/attach/data01/D000199.htm Caravaggio.com].&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned by the knights and managed to escape. By December he had been expelled from the Order &quot;as a foul and rotten member.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This was the formal phrase used in all such cases. The senior knights of the Order convened on 1 December 1608 and, after verifying that the accused had failed to appear although summoned four times, voted unanimously to expel their ''putridum et foetidum'' ex-brother. Caravaggio was expelled, not for his crime, but for having left Malta without permission (i.e., escaping).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michelangelo Caravaggio 029.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Seven Works of Mercy'', 1606–1607, [[Pio Monte della Misericordia]], [[Naples]].]]

Caravaggio made his way to [[Sicily]] where he met his old friend Mario Minniti, who was now married and living in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. Together they set off on what amounted to a triumphal tour from Syracuse to [[Messina]] and on to the island capital, [[Palermo]]. In each city Caravaggio continued to win prestigious and well-paid commissions. Among other works from this period are ''[[Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)|Burial of St. Lucy]]'', ''[[The Raising of Lazarus - Messina (Caravaggio)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'', and ''[[Adoration of the Shepherds (Caravaggio)|Adoration of the Shepherds]]''. His style continued to evolve, showing now friezes of figures isolated against vast empty backgrounds. &quot;His great Sicilian altarpieces isolate their shadowy, pitifully poor figures in vast areas of darkness; they suggest the desperate fears and frailty of man, and at the same time convey, with a new yet desolate tenderness, the beauty of humility and of the meek, who shall inherit the earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, p.365.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary reports depict a man whose behaviour was becoming increasingly bizarre, sleeping fully armed and in his clothes, ripping up a painting at a slight word of criticism, mocking the local painters.&lt;ref&gt;Caravaggio displayed bizarre behaviour from very early in his career. Mancini describes him as &quot;extremely crazy&quot;, a letter of Del Monte notes his strangeness, and Mario Minniti's 1724 biographer says that Mario left Caravaggio because of his behaviour. The strangeness seems to have increased after Malta. Susinno's early 18th century ''Le vite de' pittori Messinesi'', &quot;Lives of the Painters of Messina&quot;, provides several colourful anecdotes of Caravaggio's erratic behaviour in Sicily, and these are reproduced in modern full-length biographies such as Langdon and Robb. Bellori writes of Caravaggio's &quot;fear&quot; driving him from city to city across the island and finally, &quot;feeling that it was no longer safe to remain&quot;, to Naples. Baglione says Caravaggio was being &quot;chased by his enemy&quot;, but like Bellori does not say who this enemy was.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Caravaggio - David con la testa di Golia.jpg|thumb|250px|''David with the Head of Goliath'', 1609–1610, [[Galleria Borghese]], [[Rome]].]]
After only nine months in Sicily, Caravaggio returned to Naples. According to his earliest biographer he was being pursued by enemies while in Sicily and felt it safest to place himself under the protection of the Colonnas until he could secure his pardon from the pope (now [[Paul V]]) and return to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Baglione says that Caravaggio in Naples had &quot;given up all hope of revenge&quot; against his unnamed enemy.&lt;/ref&gt; In Naples he painted ''[[The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Denial of Saint Peter]]'', a final ''[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist (Borghese)]]'', and his last picture, ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]''. His style continued to evolve — [[Saint Ursula]] is caught in a moment of highest action and drama, as the arrow fired by the king of the [[Huns]] strikes her in the breast, unlike earlier paintings which had all the immobility of the posed models. The brushwork was much freer and more impressionistic. Had Caravaggio lived, something new would have come.

In Naples an attempt was made on his life, by persons unknown. At first it was reported in Rome that the &quot;famous artist&quot; Caravaggio was dead, but then it was learned that he was alive, but seriously disfigured in the face. He painted a ''[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)]]'', showing his own head on a platter, and sent it to de Wignacourt as a plea for forgiveness. Perhaps at this time he painted also a ''[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio)|David with the Head of Goliath]]'', showing the young David with a strangely sorrowful expression gazing on the severed head of the giant, which is again Caravaggio's. This painting he may have sent to his patron the unscrupulous art-loving Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], nephew of the pope, who had the power to grant or withhold pardons.&lt;ref&gt;According to a 17th century writer the painting the head of Goliath is a self-portrait of the artist, while David is ''il suo Caravaggino'', &quot;his little Caravaggio&quot;. This phrase is obscure, but it has been interpreted as meaning either that the boy is a youthful self-portrait, or, more commonly, that this is the Cecco who modelled for the ''Amor Vincit''. The sword-blade carries an abbreviated inscription which has been interpreted as meaning Humility Conquers Pride. Attributed to a date in Caravaggio's late Roman period by Bellori, the recent tendency is to see it as a product on Caravaggio's second Neapolitan period. (See Gash, p.125).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1610 he took a boat northwards to receive the pardon, which seemed imminent thanks to his powerful Roman friends. With him were three last paintings, gifts for Cardinal Scipione.&lt;ref&gt;A letter from the [[Bishop of Caserta]] in Naples to Cardinal Scipione Borghese in Rome, dated 29 July 1610, informs the Cardinal that the Marchesa of Caravaggio is holding two John the Baptists and a Magdalene which were intended for Borghese. These were presumably the price of Caravaggio's pardon from Borghese's uncle, the pope.&lt;/ref&gt; What happened next is the subject of much confusion and conjecture. The bare facts are that on 28 July an anonymous ''avviso'' (private newsletter) from Rome to the ducal court of Urbino reported that Caravaggio was dead. Three days later another ''avviso'' said that he had died of fever on his way from Naples to Rome. A poet friend of the artist later gave 18 July as the date of death, and a recent researcher claims to have discovered a death notice showing that the artist died on that day of a fever in [[Porto Ercole]], near [[Grosseto]] in [[Tuscany]]. Human remains found in a church in Porto Ercole in 2010 are believed to almost certainly belong to Caravaggio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10682743 Vatican reveals Caravaggio painting 'found' in Rome] BBC website, published: 19 July 2010, accessed: 20 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The findings come after a year-long investigation using DNA, carbon dating and other analyses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10333158 Church bones 'belong to Caravaggio', researchers say] BBC website, published: 16 June 2010, accessed: 20 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an artist==

Caravaggio's application of the [[chiaroscuro]] technique shows through on the faces and armour notwithstanding the lack of a visible shaft of light. The figure on the extreme right is a self portrait.]]

===The birth of Baroque===
Caravaggio &quot;put the oscuro (shadows) into [[chiaroscuro]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiaroscuro was practiced long before he came on the scene, but it was Caravaggio who made the technique definitive, darkening the shadows and transfixing the subject in a blinding shaft of light. With this came the acute observation of physical and psychological reality which formed the ground both for his immense popularity and for his frequent problems with his religious commissions. He worked at great speed, from live models, scoring basic guides directly onto the canvas with the end of the brush handle; very few of Caravaggio's drawings appear to have survived, and it is likely that he preferred to work directly on the canvas. The approach was anathema to the skilled artists of his day, who decried his refusal to work from drawings and to idealise his figures. Yet the models were basic to his realism. Some have been identified, including [[Mario Minniti]] and [[Francesco Boneri]], both fellow artists, Mario appearing as various figures in the early secular works, the young Francesco as a succession of angels, Baptists and Davids in the later canvasses. His female models include [[Portrait of a Courtesan (Caravaggio)|Fillide Melandroni]], [[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Anna Bianchini]], and Maddalena Antognetti (the &quot;Lena&quot; mentioned in court documents of the &quot;artichoke&quot; case&lt;ref&gt;Much of the documentary evidence for Caravaggio's life in Rome comes from court records; the &quot;artichoke&quot; case refers to an occasion when the artist threw a dish of hot artichokes at a waiter.&lt;/ref&gt; as Caravaggio's concubine), all well-known prostitutes, who appear as female religious figures including the Virgin and various saints.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, ''passim'', makes a fairly exhaustive attempt to identify models and relate them to individual canvases.&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio himself appears in several paintings, his final self-portrait being as the witness on the far right to the ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Caravaggio's self-portraits run from the ''Sick Bacchus'' at the beginning of his career to the head of Goliath in the ''David with the Head of Goliath'' in Rome's Borghese Gallery. Previous artists had included self-portraits as onlookers to the action, but Caravaggio's innovation was to include himself as a participant.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caravaggio - Cena in Emmaus.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Supper at Emmaus (London) (Caravaggio)|Supper at Emmaus]]'', 1601. Oil on canvas, {{convert|139|x|195|cm|0|abbr=on}}. [[National Gallery, London]].]]

Caravaggio had a noteworthy ability to express in one scene of unsurpassed vividness the passing of a crucial moment. ''[[Supper at Emmaus (London) (Caravaggio)|The Supper at Emmaus]]'' depicts the recognition of Christ by his disciples: a moment before he is a fellow traveler, mourning the passing of the Messiah, as he never ceases to be to the inn-keeper's eyes, the second after, he is the Saviour.  In ''[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of St Matthew]]'', the hand of the Saint points to himself as if he were saying &quot;who, me?&quot;, while his eyes, fixed upon the figure of Christ, have already said, &quot;Yes, I will follow you&quot;.  With ''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Caravaggio)|The Resurrection of Lazarus]]'', he goes a step further, giving us a glimpse of the actual physical process of resurrection.  The body of Lazarus is still in the throes of rigor mortis, but his hand, facing and recognizing that of Christ, is alive. Other major Baroque artists would travel the same path, for example [[Bernini]], fascinated with themes from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.

===The ''Caravaggisti''===

The installation of the St. Matthew paintings in the Contarelli Chapel had an immediate impact among the younger artists in Rome, and Caravaggism became the cutting edge for every ambitious young painter. The first Caravaggisti included [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Baglione's Caravaggio phase was short-lived; Caravaggio later accused him of plagiarism and the two were involved in a long feud. Baglione went on to write the first biography of Caravaggio. In the next generation of Caravaggisti there were [[Carlo Saraceni]], [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Orazio Borgianni]]. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620, and ended up as court painter to [[Charles I of England]]. His daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was also close to Caravaggio, and one of the most gifted of the movement. Yet in Rome and in Italy it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of [[Annibale Carracci]], blending elements from the [[High Renaissance]] and Lombard realism, which ultimately triumphed.

Caravaggio's brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including [[Battistello Caracciolo]] and [[Carlo Sellitto]]. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but the Spanish connection – Naples was a possession of Spain – was instrumental in forming the important Spanish branch of his influence.

A group of Catholic artists from [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the [[Utrecht School|&quot;Utrecht Caravaggisti&quot;]], travelled to Rome as students in the first years of the 17th century and were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio, as Bellori describes. On their return to the north this trend had a short-lived but influential flowering in the 1620s among painters like [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], [[Andries Both]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]]. In the following generation the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] (who purchased one of his paintings for the Gonzaga of Mantua and painted a copy of the ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]''), [[Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], the last of whom presumably saw his work during his various sojourns in Italy.

===Death and rebirth of a reputation===
[[File:Caravaggio - La Deposizione di Cristo.jpg|250px|thumb|left|''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Entombment of Christ]]'', (1602&amp;ndash;1603), [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], [[Rome]].]]

Caravaggio's fame scarcely survived his death. His innovations inspired the Baroque, but the Baroque took the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism. While he directly influenced the style of the artists mentioned above, and, at a distance, the Frenchmen [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Simon Vouet]], and the Spaniard [[Giuseppe Ribera]], within a few decades his works were being ascribed to less scandalous artists, or simply overlooked. The Baroque, to which he contributed so much, had evolved, and fashions had changed, but perhaps more pertinently Caravaggio never established a workshop as the Carracci's did, and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism which can only be deduced from his surviving work. Thus his reputation was doubly vulnerable to the critical demolition-jobs done by two of his earliest biographers, [[Giovanni Baglione]], a rival painter with a personal vendetta, and the influential 17th century critic [[Giovanni Bellori|Giovan Bellori]], who had not known him but was under the influence of the French [[Classicist]] [[Poussin]], who had not known him either but hated his work.&lt;ref&gt;Also see criticism by fellow Italian [[Vincenzo Carducci]] (living in Spain), who calls Caravaggio an &quot;Antichrist&quot; of painting with &quot;monstrous&quot; talents of deception.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s art critic [[Fondazione Roberto Longhi|Roberto Longhi]] brought Caravaggio's name once more to the foreground, and placed him in the European tradition: &quot;[[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[Vermeer]], La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] would have been utterly different&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Longhi, quoted in Lambert, op. cit., p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The influential [[Bernard Berenson]] agreed: &quot;With the exception of [[Michelangelo]], no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berenson, in Lambert, op. cit., p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michelangelo Caravaggio 036.jpg|thumb|250px|''Conversion of Saint Paul'', 1601, [[Cerasi Chapel]], [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], [[Rome]].]]

===Oeuvre===

About 80 paintings by Caravaggio survive, and lost works (or alleged lost works) are found from time to time. One, ''[[The Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew]]'', was recently authenticated and restored; it had been in storage in [[Hampton Court]], mislabeled as a copy. [[Richard Francis Burton]] writes of a &quot;picture of St. Rosario (in the museum of the Grand Duke of Tuscany), showing a circle of thirty men ''turpiter ligati''&quot; which is not known to have survived. The rejected version of ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]'' intended for the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in [[San Luigi dei Francesi]] in [[Rome]] was destroyed during the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]], though black and white photographs of the work exist.

===Epitaph===
Caravaggio's epitaph was composed by his friend Marzio Milesi. It reads:

&quot;Michelangelo Merisi, son of Fermo di Caravaggio - in painting not equal to a painter, but to Nature itself - died in Port' Ercole - betaking himself hither from Naples - returning to Rome - 15th calend of August - In the year of our Lord 1610 - He lived thirty-six years nine months and twenty days - Marzio Milesi, Jurisconsult - Dedicated this to a friend of extraordinary genius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptiones et Elogia (Cod.Vat.7927)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin''' (2 November 1699 – 6 December 1779) was an 18th-century [[France|French]] [[List of painters|painter]]. He is considered a master of [[still life]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artchive.com/artchive/C/chardin.html Excerpt from Robert Hughes, ''Nothing if not Critical'']&lt;/ref&gt; and is also noted for his [[genre works|genre]] paintings which depict kitchen maids, children, and domestic activities.  Carefully balanced composition, soft diffusion of light, and granular [[impasto]] characterize his work.

==Life==
Chardin was born in [[Paris]], the son of a cabinetmaker, and rarely left the city. He lived on the [[Left Bank]] near [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] until 1757, when [[Louis XV]] granted him a studio and living quarters in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Chardin/chardin_more.htm Chardin at the Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved on 2007-7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chardin entered into a marriage contract with Marguerite Saintard in 1723, whom he did not marry until 1731.&lt;ref name=rosenberg179&gt;Rosenberg p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; He served apprenticeships with the history painters [[Pierre-Jacques Cazes]] and [[Noël-Nicolas Coypel]], and in 1724 became a master in the Académie de Saint-Luc.

According to one nineteenth-century writer, at a time when it was hard for unknown painters to come to the attention of the Royal Academy, he first found notice by displaying a painting at the &quot;small Corpus Christi&quot; (held eight days after the regular one) on the [[Place Dauphine]] (by the [[Pont Neuf]]). [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo|Van Loo]], passing by in 1720, bought it and later assisted the young painter.&lt;ref&gt;Édouard Fournier, ''Histoire du Pont-Neuf'', 1862, I:300
 By  http://books.google.com/books?dq=intitle:Pont-neuf+inauthor&amp;q=Chardin&amp;pg=PA300&amp;id=w3jG6Xy1rHUC#v=snippet&amp;q=Chardin&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon presentation of ''The Ray'' in 1728, he was admitted to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. The following year he ceded his position in the Académie de Saint-Luc. He made a modest living by &quot;produc[ing] paintings in the various genres at whatever price his customers chose to pay him&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg56&quot;&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and by such work as the restoration of the [[fresco]]es at the Galerie François I at [[Fontainebleau]] in 1731.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
In November of 1731 his son Jean-Pierre was baptized, and a daughter, Marguerite-Agnès, was baptized in 1733. In 1735 his wife Marguerite died, and within two years Marguerite-Agnès had died as well.&lt;ref name=rosenberg179/&gt;
[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin 007.jpg|thumb|left|''The Ray'', 1728, [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.]]
Beginning in 1737 Chardin exhibited regularly at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. He would prove to be a &quot;dedicated academician&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;metmuseum1&quot;&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Chardin/chardin_more.htm Chardin at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; regularly attending meetings for fifty years, and functioning successively as counsellor, treasurer, and secretary, overseeing in 1761 the installation of Salon exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work gained popularity through reproductive engravings of his [[genre works|genre]] paintings (made by artists such as F.-B. Lépicié and P.-L. Sugurue), which brought Chardin income in the form of &quot;what would now be called royalties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1744 he entered his second marriage, this time to Françoise-Marguerite Pouget. The union brought a substantial improvement in Chardin's financial circumstances. In 1745 a daughter, Angélique-Françoise, was born, but she died in 1746. 

In 1752 Chardin was granted a pension of 500 [[livres]] by Louis XV. At the Salon of 1759 he exhibited nine paintings; it was the first Salon to be commented upon by [[Denis Diderot]], who would prove to be a great admirer and public champion of Chardin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, p.182.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1761, his responsibilities on behalf of the Salon, simultaneously arranging the exhibitions and acting as treasurer, resulted in a diminution of productivity in painting, and the showing of 'replicas' of previous works.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg183&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763 his services to the Académie were acknowledged with an extra 200 livres in pension. In 1765 he was unanimously elected associate member of the Académie des Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts of Rouen, but there is no evidence that he left Paris to accept the honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg183&quot;/&gt; By 1770 Chardin was the 'Premiere peintre du roi', and his pension of 1,400 livres was the highest in the Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg184&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1772 Chardin's son, also a painter, drowned in [[Venice]], a probable suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg184&quot;/&gt; The artist's last known oil painting was dated 1776; his final Salon participation was in 1779, and featured several pastel studies. Gravely ill by November of that year, he died in Paris on December 6, at the age of 80.

[[Image:Retrato de Auguste Gabriel Godefroy.jpg|thumb| ''Boy with a Top'', c.1735, oil on canvas, [[São Paulo Museum of Art]]]]

==Work==
Chardin worked very slowly and he only painted slightly more than 200 pictures (about four a year) total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morris, Roderick Conway|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/arts/23iht-chardin23.html|title=Chardin's Enchanting and Ageless Moments|date=December 22, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chardin's work had little in common with the [[Rococo]] painting that dominated French art in the 18th century. At a time when history painting was considered the supreme classification for public art, Chardin's subjects of choice were viewed as minor categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;metmuseum1&quot;/&gt; He favored simple yet beautifully textured still lifes, and sensitively handled domestic interiors and [[Genre works|genre paintings]].  Simple, even stark, paintings of common household items (''Still Life with a Smoker's Box'') and an uncanny ability to portray children's innocence in an unsentimental manner (''Boy with a Top'' [right]) nevertheless found an appreciative audience in his time, and account for his timeless appeal.  

Largely self-taught, he was greatly influenced by the realism and subject matter of the 17th-century [[Low Country]] masters. Despite his unconventional portrayal of the ascendant [[bourgeoisie]], early support came from patrons in the French [[aristocracy]], including Louis XV. Though his popularity rested initially on paintings of animals and fruit, by the 1730s he introduced kitchen utensils into his work (''The Copper Cistern'', ca.1735, Louvre). Soon figures populated his scenes as well, supposedly in response to a portrait painter who challenged him to take up the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Woman Sealing a Letter'' (ca. 1733), which  may have been his first attempt,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by half-length compositions of children saying grace, as in ''[[Le Bénédicité]]'', and kitchen maids in moments of reflection. These humble scenes deal with simple, everyday activities, yet they also have functioned as a source of documentary information about a level of French society not hitherto considered a worthy subject for painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen_ing/coleccion/obras_ficha_biografia_print207.html# Chardin at the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza] Retrieved 15 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures are noteworthy for their formal structure and pictorial harmony.&lt;ref name=&quot;metmuseum1&quot;/&gt; 

Chardin frequently painted replicas of his compositions—especially his genre paintings, nearly all of which exist in multiple versions which in many cases are virtually indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, pp. 68–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with ''The Governess'' (1739, in the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]), Chardin shifted his attention from  working-class subjects to slightly more spacious scenes of bourgeoise  life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Bruyant, pp. 187 and 242.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin 017.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Woman Cleaning Turnips'', ca. 1738, [[Alte Pinakothek]].]] 
In 1756 he returned to the subject of the still life. In the 1770s his eyesight weakened and he took to painting in [[pastels]], a medium in which he executed portraits of his wife and himself (see ''Self-portrait'' at top right). His works in pastels are now highly valued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/chardin/ Chardin, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon]&lt;/ref&gt; Chardin's extant paintings, which number about 200,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg56&quot; /&gt; are in many major museums, including the [[Louvre]].

==Influence==
Chardin's influence on the art of the modern era was wide-ranging, and has been well-documented.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Without realizing he was doing it, he rejected his own time and opened the door to modernity&quot;. Rosenberg, cited by Wilkin, Karen, ''[http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/chardin-wilkin-2351 The Splendid Chardin]'', New Criterion. Requires subscription. Retrieved 15 October, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Édouard Manet]]'s half-length ''Boy Blowing Bubbles'' and the still lifes of [[Paul Cézanne]] are equally indebted to their predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkin1&quot;&gt;Wilkin.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of [[Henri Matisse]]'s most admired painters; as an art student Matisse made copies of four Chardin paintings in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Unknown Matisse: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Early Years, 1869-1908'', Hilary Spurling, p.86. accessed online July 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaim Soutine]]'s still lifes looked to Chardin for inspiration, as did the paintings of [[Georges Braque]], and later, [[Giorgio Morandi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkin1&quot;/&gt; In 1999 [[Lucian Freud]] painted and etched several copies after ''The Young Schoolmistress'' ([[National Gallery, London]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smee, Sebastian, ''Lucian Freud 1996-2005'', illustrated.

      <comment>/* All-black light mill */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Crookes radiometer.jpg|thumbnail|Crookes radiometer]]
The '''Crookes radiometer''', also known as the ''light mill'', consists of an airtight glass bulb, containing a partial [[vacuum]].  Inside are a set of vanes which are mounted on a spindle. The vanes rotate when exposed to light, with faster rotation for more intense light, providing a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity. The reason for the rotation has historically been a cause of much [[scientific debate]].&lt;ref&gt;J Worrall, The pressure of light: The strange case of the vacillating ‘crucial experiment’. Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, 1982. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Electrical engineer. (1884). London: Biggs &amp;. Co. [http://books.google.com/books?id=0AsAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA158 Page 158].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was invented in 1873 by the chemist [[Sir William Crookes]] as the by-product of some chemical research.  In the course of very accurate quantitative chemical work, he was weighing samples in a partially evacuated chamber to reduce the effect of air currents, and noticed the weighings were disturbed when sunlight shone on the balance. Investigating this effect, he created the device named after him. It is still manufactured and sold as a novelty item.

==General description==
[[File:Radiometer 9965 Nevit.gif|thumbnail|200px|left|A Crookes radiometer in action]]
The [[radiometer]] is made from a glass bulb from which much of the air has been removed to form a partial [[vacuum]].  Inside the bulb, on a low [[friction]] spindle, is a rotor with several (usually four) vertical lightweight metal vanes spaced equally around the axis. The vanes are polished or white on one side, black on the other. When exposed to [[sunlight]], artificial light, or [[infrared]] radiation (even the heat of a hand nearby can be enough), the vanes turn with no apparent motive power, the dark sides retreating from the radiation source and the light sides advancing.  Cooling the radiometer causes rotation in the opposite direction.

The effect begins to be seen at partial vacuum pressures of a few [[torr]] (several hundred [[pascals]]), reaches a peak at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr (1 pascal) and has disappeared by the time the vacuum reaches 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr (10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; pascal) ([[Crookes radiometer#Explanations for the force on the vanes|see explanations note 1]]). At these very high vacuums the effect of photon [[radiation pressure]] on the vanes can be observed in very sensitive apparatus (see [[Nichols radiometer]]) but this is insufficient to cause rotation.

The word-element &quot;radio-&quot; in the title originates from the combining form of Latin ''radius'', a ray. Here it refers to [[electromagnetic radiation]]. A Crookes radiometer, consistent with the word-element &quot;meter&quot; in its title, can provide a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity. This can be done, for example, by visual means (e.g., a spinning slotted disk, which functions as a simple [[stroboscope]]) without interfering with the measurement itself.

Radiometers are now commonly sold worldwide as a novelty ornament; needing no batteries, but only light to get the vanes to turn. They come in various forms, such as the one pictured, and are often used in [[science museum]]s to illustrate &quot;[[radiation pressure]]&quot; &amp;ndash; a scientific principle that they do not in fact demonstrate.

==Thermodynamic explanation==
===External radiant source motion===
[[Image:Crookes radiometer moving.gif|thumbnail|200px|A Crookes Radiometer being powered by an [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent bulb]]]]
When a [[radiant energy]] source is directed at a Crookes radiometer, the radiometer becomes a [[heat engine]]. The operation of a heat engine is based on a difference in [[temperature]] that is converted to a mechanical output. In this case, the black side of the vane becomes hotter than the other side, as radiant energy from a light source warms the black side by [[black-body absorption]] faster than the silver or white side.  The internal air [[molecule]]s are &quot;heated up&quot; (i.e. experience an increase in their speed) when they touch the black side of the vane.  The details of exactly how this moves the hotter side of the vane forward are given in the [[Crookes_radiometer#Explanations_for_the_force_on_the_vanes|section below]].

The internal temperature rises as the black vanes impart heat to the air molecules, but the molecules are cooled again when they touch the bulb's glass surface, which is at ambient temperature.  This heat loss through the glass keeps the internal bulb temperature steady so that the two sides of the vanes can develop a temperature difference.  The white or silver side of the vanes are slightly warmer than the internal air temperature but cooler than the black side, as some heat conducts through the vane from the black side. The two sides of each vane must be thermally insulated to some degree so that the silver or white side does not immediately reach the temperature of the black side. If the vanes are made of metal, then the black or white paint can be the insulation.  The glass stays much closer to ambient temperature than the temperature reached by the black side of the vanes.  The higher external air pressure helps conduct heat away from the glass.  

The air pressure inside the bulb needs to strike a balance between too low and too high. A strong vacuum inside the bulb does not permit motion, because there are not enough air molecules to cause the air currents that propel the vanes and transfer heat to the outside before both sides of each vane reach thermal equilibrium by heat conduction through the vane material. High inside pressure inhibits motion because the temperature differences are not enough to push the vanes through the higher concentration of air: there is too much air resistance for &quot;eddy currents&quot; to occur, and any slight air movement caused by the temperature difference is damped by the higher pressure before the currents can &quot;wrap around&quot; to the other side.

===Motion without external radiation===

When the radiometer is heated in the absence of a light source, it turns in the forward direction (i.e. black sides trailing). If a person's hands are placed around the glass without touching it, the vanes will turn slowly or not at all, but if the glass is touched to warm it quickly, they will turn more noticeably. Directly heated glass gives off enough infrared radiation to turn the vanes, but glass blocks much of the far-infrared radiation from a source of warmth not in contact with it. However, near-infrared and visible light more easily penetrate the glass.

If the glass is cooled quickly in the absence of a strong light source by putting ice on the glass or placing it in the freezer with the door almost closed, it turns backwards (i.e. the silver sides trail). This demonstrates black-body radiation from the black sides of the vanes rather than black-body absorption. The wheel turns backwards because the black sides cool more quickly than the silver sides.

==Explanations for the force on the vanes ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Crookes radiometer]] --&gt;

Over the years, there have been many attempts to explain how a Crookes radiometer works:

#Crookes incorrectly suggested that the force was due to the [[radiation pressure|pressure of light]]. This theory was originally supported by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who had predicted this force. This explanation is still often seen in leaflets packaged with the device. The first experiment to disprove this theory was done by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1876, who observed that there was a force on the glass bulb of the Crookes radiometer that was in the opposite direction to the rotation of the vanes. This showed that the force turning the vanes was generated inside the radiometer. If light pressure were the cause of the rotation, then the better the vacuum in the bulb, the less air resistance to movement, and the faster the vanes should spin. In 1901, with a better vacuum pump, [[Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev|Pyotr Lebedev]] showed that in fact, the radiometer only works when there is low pressure gas in the bulb, and the vanes stay motionless in a hard vacuum. Finally, if light pressure were the motive force, the radiometer would spin in the opposite direction, as the [[photon]]s on the shiny side being reflected would deposit more momentum than on the black side where the photons are absorbed. The actual pressure exerted by light is far too small to move these vanes, but can be measured with devices such as the [[Nichols radiometer]].
#Another incorrect theory was that the heat on the dark side was causing the material to outgas, which pushed the radiometer around. This was effectively disproved by both Schuster's and Lebedev's experiments.
#A partial explanation is that gas [[molecule]]s hitting the warmer side of the vane will pick up some of the heat, bouncing off the vane with increased speed. Giving the molecule this extra boost effectively means that a minute pressure is exerted on the vane. The imbalance of this effect between the warmer black side and the cooler silver side means the net pressure on the vane is equivalent to a push on the black side, and as a result the vanes spin round with the black side trailing. The problem with this idea is that while the faster moving molecules produce more force, they also do a better job of stopping other molecules from reaching the vane, so the net force on the vane should be exactly the same — the greater temperature causes a decrease in local density which results in the same force on both sides. Years after this explanation was dismissed, [[Albert Einstein]] showed that the two pressures do not cancel out exactly at the edges of the vanes because of the temperature difference there. The force predicted by Einstein would be enough to move the vanes, but not fast enough.
#The final piece of the puzzle, [[thermal transpiration]], was theorized by [[Osborne Reynolds]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On certain dimensional properties of matter in the gaseous state&quot; Osborne Reynolds, Royal Society Phil. Trans., Part 2, (1879)&lt;/ref&gt; but first published by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On stresses in rarefied gases arising from inequalities of temperature&quot; James Clerk Maxwell, Royal Society Phil. Trans. (1879)&lt;/ref&gt; in the last paper before his death in 1879.  Reynolds found that if a porous plate is kept hotter on one side than the other, the interactions between gas molecules and the plates are such that gas will flow through from the cooler to the hotter side.  The vanes of a typical Crookes radiometer are not porous, but the space past their edges behaves like the pores in Reynolds's plate.  On average, the gas molecules move from the cold side toward the hot side whenever the pressure ratio is less than the square root of the (absolute) temperature ratio.  The pressure difference causes the vane to move, cold (white) side forward.

Both Einstein's and Reynolds's forces appear to cause a Crookes radiometer to rotate, although it still isn't clear which one is stronger.

==All-black light mill==
To rotate, a light mill does not have to be coated with different colors across each vane. In 2009, researchers at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] created a monocolored light mill which has four curved vanes; each vane forms a [[convex]] and a [[concave]] surface. The light mill is uniformly coated by gold [[nanocrystals]], which are a strong light absorber. Upon exposure, due to geometric effect, the convex side of the vane receives more photon energy than the concave side does, and subsequently the gas molecules receive more heat from the convex side than from the concave side. At rough vacuum, this [[asymmetric]] heating effect generates a  net gas movement across each vane, from the concave side to the convex side, as shown by the researchers' [[Direct Simulation Monte Carlo]] (DSMC) modeling. The gas movement causes the light mill to rotate with the concave side moving forward, due to [[Newton's Third Law]].
This monocolored design promotes the fabrication of [[micrometer]]- or [[nanometer]]- scaled light mills, for it is difficult to pattern materials of distinct optical properties within a very narrow, three-dimensional space.

==Nanoscale light mill==
In 2010 researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] succeeded in building a [[nanoscale]] light mill that works on an entirely different principle to the Crookes radiometer. A [[gammadion]] shaped [[gold]] light mill, only  100 nanometers in diameter, was built and illuminated by laser light that had been tuned to have an angular momentum. The possibility of doing this had been suggested by the Princeton physicist [[Richard Beth]] in 1936. The torque was greatly enhanced by the resonant coupling of the incident light to [[Surface plasmon|plasmonic wave]]s in the gold structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news197555841.html|title=Nano-sized light mill drives micro-sized disk|last=Yarris|first=Lynn|publisher=Physorg|accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cold Chisel''' are a rock band that originated in [[Adelaide]], Australia. It is one of the most acclaimed  Australian rock bands of all time, with a string of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s and huge sales that continue to this day, although its success and acclaim was almost completely restricted to Australia and New Zealand.

==Beginnings 1973–78==
Originally named Orange, the band was formed in [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]] in 1973 as a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] act covering songs by [[Led Zeppelin]], Deep Purple and Free by bassist Les Kaczmarek, keyboard player [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]], [[guitar]]ist [[Ian Moss]] and [[drum]]mer [[Steve Prestwich]]. Seventeen-year-old singer [[Jimmy Barnes]] - known throughout his time with the band as Jim Barnes — joined in December '73, taking leave from the band in 1975 for a brief stint as [[Bon Scott]]'s replacement in [[Fraternity (band)|Fraternity]].&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, Toby ''Jimmy Barnes: Too Much Ain't Enough'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The group changed its name several times before settling on Cold Chisel in 1974 after writing a song with that title. Barnes' relationship with other band members was volatile; as a Scot he often came to blows with Liverpool-born Prestwich and he left the band several times. During these periods Moss would handle vocals until Barnes returned.

Walker soon emerged as Cold Chisel's primary songwriter. Walker spent 1974 in [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], completing his studies and in 1975 Kaczmarek left the band and was replaced by [[Phil Small]]. . Barnes' older brother [[Swanee (singer)|John Swan]] was a member of Cold Chisel around this time, providing backing vocals and [[percussion instrument|percussion]] but after several violent incidents he was fired.&lt;ref name = &quot;bnuzeq&quot;&gt;Creswell&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1976 Cold Chisel relocated to Melbourne but found little success and moved to Sydney in November. Six months later, in May 1977, Barnes announced he was quitting Cold Chisel in order to join Swan in Feather, a hard-rocking blues band that had evolved from an earlier group called [[Blackfeather]]. A farewell performance took place in Sydney that went so well the singer changed his mind and the following month Cold Chisel was picked up by the Warner Music Group.

==Main career 1978–82==
In the early months of 1978, Cold Chisel recorded its [[Cold Chisel (album)|self-titled debut album]] with producer Peter Walker. All tracks were written by Don Walker except &quot;Juliet&quot;, for which Barnes wrote the melody and Walker the lyrics. ''Cold Chisel'' was released in April and featured appearances from [[harmonica]] player Dave Blight, who would become a regular on-stage guest, and [[saxophonists]] [[Joe Camilleri]] and [[Wilbur Wilde]] from [[Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons]]. The following month the song &quot;[[Khe Sanh (song)|Khe Sanh]]&quot; was released as a single but was deemed too offensive for airplay on commercial radio because of the lyric ''&quot;Their legs were often open/But their minds were always closed&quot;'',&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Noel ''The Australian Encyclopedia of Rock and Pop'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; although it was played regularly on Sydney rock station, [[Double Jay]], which was not subject to such restrictions because it was part of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. Despite that setback, it still reached #48 on the Australian singles chart and number four on the Adelaide charts thanks mainly to the band's rising popularity as a touring act and some local radio support in Adelaide where the single was aired in spite of the ban. &quot;Khe Sanh&quot; has since become Cold Chisel's signature tune and arguably its most popular among fans. The song was later remixed for inclusion on the international version of 1980's ''[[East (album)|East]]. 

The band's next release was a live E.P. titled &quot;[[You're Thirteen, You're Beautiful, and You're Mine]]&quot;, in November. This had been recorded at a show at Sydney's Regent Theatre in 1977 that had featured [[Midnight Oil]] as one of the support acts. One of the EP's tracks, &quot;Merry Go Round&quot; was later recorded on the follow-up, ''[[Breakfast at Sweethearts]]''. This album was recorded between July 1978 and January 1979 with experienced producer [[Richard Batchens]], who had previously worked with [[Richard Clapton]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]] and Blackfeather. Batchens smoothed out many of the band's rough edges and attempted to give their songs a sophisticated sound. This approach has made the album sit a little uncomfortably with the band ever since. Once again, the majority of the songs were penned by Walker, with Barnes collaborating with Walker on the first single &quot;Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye)&quot; and Moss contributing to &quot;Dresden&quot;. &quot;Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye)&quot; became a live favourite for the band, and even went on to be performed by [[U2]] during Australian tours in the 1980s.

By now the band stood at the verge of major national success, even without significant radio airplay or support from ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', the country's most important youth music program. The band had become notorious for its wild behaviour, particularly from Barnes who was rumoured to have had sex with over 1000 women and who was known to consume more than a bottle of [[vodka]] every night during performances.&lt;ref name = &quot;bnuzeq&quot;/&gt;

Following their problematic relationship with Batchens, Cold Chisel chose Mark Opitz to produce the next single, &quot;Choirgirl&quot;, a Don Walker composition dealing with a young woman's experience with [[abortion]]. In spite of the controversial subject matter, the track became a hit and paved the way for Cold Chisel's next album. Recorded over two months in 1980, ''[[East (album)|East]]'' reached #2 on the Australian album charts and was the second-highest selling album by an Australian artist for the year. Despite the continued dominance of Walker, during Cold Chisel's later career all four of the other members began to contribute songs to the band, and this was the first of their albums to feature songwriting contributions from each member of the band. Cold Chisel is the only Australian rock band to score hits with songs written by every member of the group. 

Of the album's 12 tracks, two were written by Barnes, with Moss, Prestwich and Small contributing one song each. The songs ranged from straight ahead rock tracks such as &quot;Standing on the Outside&quot; and &quot;My Turn to Cry&quot; to [[rockabilly]]-flavoured work-outs (&quot;Rising Sun&quot;, written about Barnes' relationship with his girlfriend Jane Mahoney) and pop-laced love songs (&quot;[[My Baby (Cold Chisel song)|My Baby]]&quot;, featuring [[Joe Camilleri]] on saxophone) to a poignant piano ballad about prison life, &quot;Four Walls&quot;. The cover featured Barnes asleep in a bathtub wearing a [[kamikaze]] bandanna in a room littered with junk and was inspired by [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s 1793 painting ''[[The Death of Marat]]''. The Ian Moss-penned &quot;Never Before&quot; was chosen as the first song to air by the ABC's radio station [[Triple J]] when it switched to the [[FM]] band that year.

Following the release of ''East'', Cold Chisel embarked on the Youth in Asia Tour, which took its name from a lyric in &quot;Star Hotel&quot;. This tour saw the group play more than 60 shows in 90 days and would form the basis of 1981's double live album ''[[Swingshift]]''.

In April 1981 the band was nominated for all seven of the major awards at the joint ''Countdown''/''[[TV Week]]'' music awards held at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, and won them all. As a protest against the concept of a TV magazine being involved in a music awards ceremony, the band refused to accept its awards and finished the night by performing &quot;My Turn to Cry&quot;. After only one verse and chorus, the band smashed up the set and left the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, Toby and Fabinyi, Martin ''The Real Thing''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Swingshift'' debuted at No. 1 on the Australian album charts, crystallizing the band's status as the biggest-selling act in the country. Overseas, however, Cold Chisel was unable to make an impact. With a slightly different track-listing, ''East'' had been issued in the United States and the band undertook its first (and only) US tour. But while it was popular as a live act, the American arm of their label did little to support the album. According to Barnes biographer [[Toby Creswell]], at one point the band was ushered into an office to listen to the US master only to find it drenched in tape hiss and other ambient noise,&lt;ref name = &quot;bnuzeq&quot;/&gt; making it almost unreleasable. The band was even booed off stage after a lacklustre performance in Dayton, Ohio in May 1981 opening for Ted Nugent, who at the time was touring with his guitar army aka the 'D.C. Hawks'. European audiences were more accepting of the band and the group developed a small but significant fan base in Germany.

In August 1981, the band began work on the album ''[[Circus Animals]]'', again with Opitz producing. The album opened with &quot;[[You Got Nothing I Want]]&quot;, an aggressive Barnes-penned hard rock track that attacked the American industry for its handling of the band. The song would later cause problems for Barnes when he later attempted to break into the US market as a solo performer as senior music executives there continued to hold it against him. Like its predecessor, ''Circus Animals'' contained songs of contrasting styles, with harder-edged tracks like &quot;Bow River&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in place beside more expansive ballads such as &quot;[[Forever Now (Cold Chisel song)|Forever Now]]&quot; and &quot;[[When the War Is Over]]&quot;, both written by Prestwich. The latter track has proved to be the most popular Cold Chisel song for other artists to record -- [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] included a version on the 1989 album ''[[Raging Silence]]'' and [[John Farnham]] has recorded it twice, once while he and Prestwich were members of [[Little River Band]] in the mid-80s and again for his 1990 solo album ''[[Age of Reason (album)|Age of Reason]]''. The song was also a No. 1 hit for former ''[[Australian Idol]]'' contestant [[Cosima De Vito]] in 2004 and was also performed by [[Bobby Flynn]] during that show's 2006 season. &quot;Forever Now&quot; was also covered (as a country waltz) by Australian band [[The Reels]].

To launch the album, the band performed under a circus tent at Wentworth Park in Sydney and toured heavily once more, including a show in Darwin that attracted more than 10 per cent of the city's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creswell, et al&quot;&gt;Creswell, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Break up and aftermath 1983–84==
''Circus Animals'' and its three singles, &quot;You Got Nothing I Want&quot;, &quot;[[Forever Now (Cold Chisel song)|Forever Now]]&quot; and &quot;When the War is Over&quot; were all major hits in Australia during 1982 but further success overseas continued to elude the band and cracks began to appear. In early 1983 the band toured Germany but the shows went so badly that in the middle of the tour Walker up-ended his keyboard and stormed off stage during one show and Prestwich was fired. Returning to Australia, Prestwich was replaced by [[Ray Arnott]], formerly of the 1970s progressive rock band Spectrum. After this, Barnes requested a large advance from management. Now married with a young child, exorbitant spending had left him almost broke. His request was refused however because there was a standing arrangement that any advance to one band member had to be paid to all the others. After a meeting on 17 August during which Barnes quit the band it was decided that Cold Chisel would split up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creswell, et al&quot;/&gt; A final concert series known as The Last Stand was planned and a final studio album was also recorded. Prestwich returned for the tour, which began in October. Before the Sydney shows however, Barnes lost his voice and those dates were re-scheduled for December. The band's final performance was at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on 12 December 1983, apparently precisely 10 years since its first live appearance. The Sydney shows formed the basis of the film ''[[The Last Stand (film)|The Last Stand]]'', the biggest-selling concert film of any Australian band. Several other recordings from the tour were used on the 1984 live album ''Barking Spiders Live: 1983'', the title of which was inspired by the name the group occasionally used to play warm-up shows before tours, and as b-sides for a three-CD singles package known as ''Three Big XXX Hits'', issued ahead of the release of the 1994 compilation album, ''[[Teenage Love]]''. 

During breaks in the tour, ''[[Twentieth Century (album)|Twentieth Century]]'' was recorded. It was a fragmentary process, spread across various studios and sessions as the individual members often refused to work together, but nonetheless successful. Released in February 1984, it reached No. 1 upon release and included the songs &quot;[[Saturday Night (Cold Chisel song)|Saturday Night]]&quot; and &quot;[[Flame Trees]]&quot;, both of which remain radio staples. &quot;Flame Trees&quot;, co-written by Prestwich and Walker, took its title from the BBC series ''[[The Flame Trees of Thika]]'' although it was lyrically inspired by the organist's hometown of [[Grafton, New South Wales]]. Barnes later recorded an acoustic version of the song on his 1993 album ''[[Flesh and Wood]]'' and the track was also covered by [[Sarah Blasko]] in 2006.

Barnes launched a solo career in January 1984 that has produced nine Australian No. 1 albums and an array of hit singles. One of those, &quot;[[Too Much Ain't Enough Love]]&quot; also peaked at No. 1. He has recorded with [[INXS]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Joe Cocker]], John Farnham and a long list of other Australian and international artists and is arguably the country's most popular male rock singer.

Prestwich joined Little River Band in 1984 and appeared on the albums ''[[Playing to Win]]'' and ''No Reins'' before departing in 1986 to join John Farnham's touring band. Walker, Moss and Small all took extended breaks from music. Small, the least prominent member of the band virtually disappeared from the scene for many years, playing in a variety of minor acts. Walker formed Catfish in 1988, ostensibly a solo band with floating membership that included Moss, Charlie Owen and Dave Blight at various times. The music had a distinctly modern jazz aspect and his recordings during this phase attracted little commercial success. During 1989 he wrote several songs for Moss including &quot;Tucker's Daughter&quot; and &quot;Telephone Booth&quot; that the guitarist recorded on his debut solo album ''[[Matchbook (album)|Matchbook]]''. Both the album and &quot;Tucker's Daughter&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the chart in 1989 and won Moss five [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA Awards]]. His other albums met with little success.

==Reunion==

Throughout the '80s and most of the '90s, Cold Chisel was courted to re-form but refused, at one point reportedly turning down an offer of $5 million to play a single show in each of the major Australian state capitals. While Moss and Walker often collaborated on projects, neither would work with Barnes again until Walker wrote &quot;Stone Cold&quot; for the singer's ''[[Heat (Jimmy Barnes album)|Heat]]'' in 1993. The pair then recorded an acoustic version for ''Flesh and Wood'' later the same year. Thanks primarily to continued radio airplay and Barnes' solo success, Cold Chisel's legacy remained solidly intact and by the early 90s the group had surpassed 3 million album sales, most of which had been sold since 1983. The 1991 compilation album ''[[Chisel (album)|Chisel]]'' was re-issued and re-packaged several times, once with the long-deleted 1978 EP as a bonus disc and a second time in 2001 as a double album. The ''Last Stand'' soundtrack album was also finally released in 1992 and in 1994 a complete album of previously unreleased demo and rare live recordings also surfaced. ''[[Teenage Love]]'' spawned a string of hit singles.

Cold Chisel reunited in 1998 to record the album ''[[The Last Wave of Summer]]'' and supported it with a sold-out national concert tour. The album debuted at number one on the Australian album chart. In 2003, the band re-grouped once more for the &quot;Ringside&quot; tour and in 2005 again reunited to perform at a benefit for the victims of the [[Boxing Day tsunami]] at the Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne.

On 10 September 2009, two days after Barnes' 15th studio solo album ''The Rhythm and the Blues'' hit No. 1 on the Australian album charts, Cold Chisel announced it would reform for a one-off performance at the [[Sydney 500]] [[V8 Supercars]] event on 5 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/cold-chisel-reform-for-sydney-telstra-500-v8-supercars-series-at-sydneys-olympic-park/story-e6frewyr-1225771678625|title=Cold Chisel Reform for Sydney Telstra 500 V8 Supercars Series at Olympic Park|last=McCabe|first=Kathy|date=11 September 2009|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reunion saw the band perform at [[ANZ Stadium]] to the largest crowd of its career, with more than 45,000 fans in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anzstadium.com.au/News/LatestNews/NewsArticles.aspx?NewsContentId=1d218436-5943-40ec-9fe7-960ca337c40f|title=Cold Chisel rock race fans|date=5 December 2009|publisher=[[ANZ Stadium]]|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold Chisel played a single live performance in 2010, at the [[Deniliquin]] [[ute muster]] in October. In December Ian Moss confirmed that Cold Chisel was working on new material for an album, with a potential tour possibly in 2011.

==Death of Steve Prestwich==
In January 2011, Steve Prestwich was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]]. He underwent surgery on 14 January but never regained consciousness and died two days later, aged 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/australian-music-industry-in-mourning-over-chisel-sherbet-deaths-20110117-19t4h.html|title=Australian music industry in mourning over Chisel, Sherbet deaths|last=Levy|first=Megan|date=18 January 2011|publisher=The Age|accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
Influences from blues and early rock n' roll was broadly apparent, fostered by the love of those styles by Moss, Barnes and Walker and Small and Prestwich contributed strong pop sensibilities. This allowed volatile rock songs like &quot;You Got Nothing I Want&quot; and &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; to stand beside thoughtful ballads like &quot;Choirgirl&quot;, pop-flavoured love songs like &quot;My Baby&quot; and caustic political statements like &quot;Star Hotel&quot;, an attack on the late-70s government of [[Malcolm Fraser]], inspired by the [[Star hotel riot|Star Hotel riot]] in [[Newcastle, Australia|Newcastle]]. 

The songs were not overtly political but rather observations of everyday life within Australian society and culture, in which the members with their various backgrounds (Moss was from [[Alice Springs, Australia|Alice Springs]], Walker grew up in rural New South Wales, Barnes and Prestwich were working-class immigrants from the UK) were quite well able to provide. 

Cold Chisel's songs were about distinctly Australian experiences, a factor often cited as a major reason for the band's lack of international appeal. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Breakfast at Sweethearts&quot; were observations of the urban experience of Sydney's [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] district where Walker lived for many years. &quot;Misfits&quot;, which featured on the b-side to &quot;My Baby&quot;, was about homeless kids in the suburbs surrounding Sydney. Songs like &quot;Shipping Steel&quot; and &quot;Standing on The Outside&quot; were working class anthems and many others featured characters trapped in mundane, everyday existences, yearning for the good times of the past (&quot;Flame Trees&quot;) or for something better from life (&quot;Bow River&quot;).

==Reputation==

Alongside contemporaries like [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]] and [[Midnight Oil]], whose rise to popularity came in their wake, Cold Chisel was renowned as one of the most dynamic live acts of their day and from early in their career concerts routinely became sell-out events. But the band was also famous for its wild lifestyle, particularly the hard-drinking Barnes, who played his role as one of the wild men of Australian rock to the hilt, never seen on stage without at least one bottle of vodka and often so drunk he could barely stand upright. Despite this, by 1982 he was a devoted family man who refused to tour without his wife and daughter. All the other band members were also settled or married; Ian Moss had a long-term relationship with the actress [[Megan Williams (actress)|Megan Williams]] (she even sang on ''Twentieth Century'') whose own public persona could have hardly been more different. Yet it was the band's public image that often saw them compared less favourably with other important acts like [[Midnight Oil]], whose music and politics (while rather more overt) were often similar but whose image and reputation was far more clean-cut. Cold Chisel remained hugely popular however and by the mid-90s had continued to sell records at such a consistent rate they became the first Australian band to achieve higher sales after their split than during their active years{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. While repackages and compilations accounted for much of these sales, 1994's ''Teenage Love'' album of rarities and two of its singles were Top Ten hits and when the group finally reformed in 1998 the resultant album was also a major hit and the follow-up tour sold out almost immediately.

Cold Chisel is one of the few Australian acts (along with [[AC/DC]], The [[Easybeats]],and [[Slim Dusty]]) to have become the subject of a major tribute album. In 2007, ''[[Standing on the Outside (album)|Standing on the Outside: The Songs of Cold Chisel]]'' was released, featuring a collection of the band's songs as performed by artists including [[The Living End]], [[Evermore (band)|Evermore]], [[Something for Kate]], [[Pete Murray]], [[Katie Noonan]], [[You Am I]], [[Paul Kelly (musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[Alex Lloyd]], [[Thirsty Merc]] and [[Ben Lee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Confederate States of America''' (also called the '''Confederacy''', the '''Confederate States''', and the '''C.S.A.''') was a government set up from 1861 to 1865 by 11 [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[slave state]]s of the [[United States|United States of America]] that had declared their [[secession in the United States|secession from the U.S.]] The U.S. government ([[Union (American Civil War)|The Union]]) rejected secession as illegal, and, after its army was fired upon at the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], used military action to defeat it. No foreign nation officially recognized the Confederate States as an independent country,&lt;ref name=&quot;history-state-gov&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McPherson&quot; /&gt; but they did allow their citizens to do business with the Confederacy. The Confederate government in Richmond had an uneasy relationship with its member states, with some historians arguing the Confederacy &quot;died of states rights&quot; because of the reluctance of several states to put troops under the control of the Confederate States government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank L. Owsley 1925&quot;&gt;Frank L. Owsley, ''State Rights in the Confederacy'' (Chicago, 1925).&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy's control over its claimed territory shrank steadily during the course of the [[American Civil War]], as the Union took control of much of the seacoast and inland waterways. The leading Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] successfully stopped repeated Union attempts to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia, but after four years of very bloody fighting, the Confederates ran out of men, supplies and public support. In spring 1865 its armies surrendered, its government collapsed, its slaves were emancipated, and the Union imposed a program of [[Reconstruction Era in the United States|Reconstruction]] to restore the seceding states to normal status.

Secessionists argued that the [[United States Constitution]] was a compact among states that could be abandoned at any time without consultation and that each state had a right to secede. After intense debates and statewide votes, seven [[Deep South]] cotton states passed secession ordinances by February 1861 (before [[Abraham Lincoln]] took office as president), while secession efforts failed in the other eight slave states. Delegates from the seven formed the C.S.A. in February 1861, selecting [[Jefferson Davis]] as temporary president until elections could be held in 1862. Talk of reunion and compromise went nowhere, because the Confederates insisted on independence which the Union strongly rejected. Davis began raising a 100,000 man army.&lt;ref&gt;February 28, 1861, Congress authorized Davis to accept state militias into national service. Confederate Act of Congress for “provisionals” on March 6, 1861, authorized 100,000 militia and volunteers under Davis' command. May 6, Congress empowered Davis to accept volunteers directly without state intermediaries. Keegan, John.  [http://books.google.com/books?id=A7O0FYunvPwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=confederate+called+up+100,00+militia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DyapEEiCMQ&amp;sig=rrrM3a49DRLYwsrrdYKvcYEqWZ4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3KFcTc2XLYG0lQf0152wCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The American Civil War: a military history] 2009.  ISBN 978-0-307-26343-8, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting began with the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]] on April 12, 1861. Lincoln called for 75,000 troops to recapture lost federal properties in the South, the same number of arms the disunionists confiscated from US forts and arsenals in six seceding states prior to his inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, William W., “The Road To Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant”, Vol. II, 2007, ISBN 978-0-19-505815-4 p.485-6&lt;/ref&gt; With the developing Federal policy of military action to suppress the rebellion, [[Arkansas]], [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] also declared their secession and joined the Confederacy. All the main tribes of the [[Indian Territory]] (later Oklahoma) aligned with the Confederacy, but efforts to secure secession in Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland failed in the face of federal military action and occupation of those states.

The Confederacy effectively collapsed after [[Ulysses S. Grant]] captured its capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army in April 1865. The remaining Confederate forces surrendered by the end of June, as the U.S. Army took control of the South. Because Congress was not sure that white Southerners had really given up slavery or their dreams of Confederate nationalism, a decade-long process known as [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] expelled ex-Confederate leaders from office, enacted [[civil rights]] legislation (including the right to vote) that included the [[freedman#United States|freedmen]] (ex-slaves), and imposed conditions on the readmission of the states to Congress. The war and subsequent Reconstruction left the South economically prostrate, and it remained well below national levels of prosperity until after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Cooper | first1 = William J.

==History==
{{Expand section|information on formation of government|date=October 2010}}

===A “Revolution” in disunion===
{{Main|Origins of the American Civil War}}
The Confederate States of America was created by [[Secession in the United States|Secessionists]] working for years prior to 1860. They believed the South to be under attack by [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] and anti-slavery elements in the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Southern interests in the United States had been protected by [[doughface]] northern presidents with southern principles and patronage. The Supreme Court had been led by slaveholders. During [[United States presidential election, 1860|the campaign for president in 1860]], secessionists threatened disunion at Lincoln’s election, most notably by [[William L. Yancey]]. However there were no plans underway to set up a new country.&lt;ref name=&quot;disunion_v_ii&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Freehling | first1 = William W. | title = The Road to Disunion: Volume II, Secessionists Triumphant | year = 1990 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-505815-4 }} p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; With Lincoln as president he would have little direct power over the South except for the appointment of local postmasters. Secessionists warned that Republican postmasters would allow the mail to carry newspapers or pamphlets advocating freedom for all Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;disunion_v_ii&quot;/&gt; The arguments of the disunionists emphasized states rights and warned against a strong national government—themes that came to haunt the Confederacy, with some historians arguing that it &quot;died of states rights.&quot;

====Causes of secession====

By 1860, sectional disagreements between North and South revolved primarily around the maintenance or expansion of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]. Historian [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] observed that &quot;leaders of the secession movement across the South cited slavery as the most compelling reason for southern independence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The immediate spark for secession came from the victory of the Republican Party and the election of Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 elections. Civil War historian [[James M. McPherson]] wrote:

{{quote|To southerners the election’s most ominous feature was the magnitude of Republican victory north of the [[41st parallel north|41st parallel]]. Lincoln won more than 60 percent of the vote in that region, losing scarcely two dozen counties. Three-quarters of the Republican congressmen and senators in the next Congress would represent this &quot;Yankee&quot; and antislavery portion of the free states. The ''New Orleans Crescent'' saw these facts as &quot;full of portentous significance&quot;. &quot;The idle canvas prattle about Northern conservatism may now be dismissed,&quot; agreed the ''Richmond Examiner''. &quot;A party founded on the single sentiment... of hatred of African slavery, is now the controlling power.&quot; No one could any longer &quot;be deluded... that the Black Republican party is a moderate&quot; party, pronounced the ''New Orleans Delta''. &quot;It is in fact, essentially, a revolutionary party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson pp. 232-233.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Four of the seceding states, the [[Deep South]] states of South Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;The text of [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp the ''Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union''].&lt;/ref&gt;
Mississippi,&lt;ref&gt;The text of [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_missec.asp ''A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union''].&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;The text of [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_geosec.asp Georgia's secession declaration].&lt;/ref&gt; and Texas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thetext&quot;&gt;The text of [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_texsec.asp ''A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union''].&lt;/ref&gt; issued formal declarations of causes, each of which identified the threat to slaveholders’ rights as the cause of, or a major cause of, secession. Georgia also claimed a general Federal policy of favoring Northern over Southern economic interests. Texas mentioned slavery 21 times, but also listed the failure of the federal government to live up to its obligations, in the original annexation agreement, to protect settlers along the exposed western frontier. Texas further stated:
[[File:Alexander Stephens -1855.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Stephens]]&lt;br&gt;Pre-war Lincoln correspondent; author of ‘Cornerstone Speech’]]
{{quote|We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.}}

In what later became known as the [[Cornerstone Speech]], C.S. Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]] declared that the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the new government &quot;rest[ed] upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery—subordination to the superior race—is his natural and normal condition.

The text of [http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=76 Alexander Stephens' &quot;Cornerstone Speech&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, however, Stephens made efforts to qualify his remarks, claiming they were extemporaneous, metaphorical, and never meant to literally reflect &quot;the principles of the new Government on this subject.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Davis | first1 = William C. | title = A government of our own : the making of the Confederacy | year = 1994 | publisher = Free Press  | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-02-907735-1 | pages = 294–295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What I Really Said in the Cornerstone Speech&quot;.{{Cite book | last1 = Stephens | first1 = Alexander Hamilton | last2 = Avary | first2 = Myrta Lockett. | title = Recollections of Alexander H.

====Religion, slavery, and secession====
As the nation divided over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], religion exacerbated the sectional differences. Methodists and Baptists in the 1830s and 1840s split bitterly over slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Levine (1992) p. 109. Stampp (1956) p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in the North some Protestant churches were characterized by strong abolitionist sentiment among the membership, while the Catholics and Episcopalians stood aloof. Religion played a prominent role on both sides of this great moral chasm, with abolitionists claiming religious justification on one side, while Southerners claimed slavery as part of God's order as well. Texas went so far as to note in their declaration of secession:

{{quote|That in this free government '''all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights''' [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thetext&quot; /&gt;}}

====The battle for a unified South====

The [[Fire-Eaters]], calling for immediate secession, were opposed by two elements. &quot;Cooperationists&quot; in the Deep South would delay secession until several states went together, maybe in a Southern Convention. Under the influence of men such as Texas Governor [[Sam Houston]], delay had the effect of sustaining the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, pp. 448+&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Unionists&quot;, especially in the Border South, often former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], appealed to sentimental attachment to the United States. Their favorite was [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee.

Secessionists were active politically. Governor [[William Henry Gist]] of South Carolina corresponded secretly with other Deep South governors, and most governors exchanged clandestine commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Charleston’s 1860 Association published over 200,000 pamphlets to persuade the youth of the South. The top three were South Carolina’s John Townsend’s “The Doom of Slavery”, “The South Alone Should Govern the South”, and James D.B. De Bow’s “The Interest of Slavery of the Southern Non-slaveholder.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, pp. 391-394&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secessionist conventions====

Developments in South Carolina started a chain of events. The foreman of a jury refused the legitimacy of federal courts, so Federal Judge Andrew Magrath ruled that U.S. judicial authority in South Carolina was vacated. A mass meeting in Charleston celebrating the Charleston and Savannah railroad and state cooperation led to the South Carolina legislature to call for a Secession Convention. U.S. Senator [[James Chesnut, Jr.]] resigned, and U.S. Senator [[James Henry Hammond]] followed.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, p.416&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections for Secessionist conventions were heated to “an almost raving pitch, no one dared dissent” Even once respected voices, including the Chief Justice of South Carolina, [[John Belton O’Neall]], lost election to the Secession Convention on a Cooperationist ticket. Across the South mobs lynched Yankees and (in Texas) Germans suspected of loyalty to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, pp. 418+&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, seceding conventions which followed did not call for a referendum to ratify, although Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee did, also Virginia’s second convention. Missouri and Kentucky declared neutrality.

The first secession state conventions from the Deep South sent representatives to meet in Montgomery, Alabama, where the fundamental documents of government were promulgated, a provisional government was established and a representative Congress met for the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freehling&quot;&gt;Freehling, p.503&lt;/ref&gt; The new Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]], a former Cooperationist, issued a call for militias to defend the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freehling&quot; /&gt; Previously [[John B. Floyd]], U.S. Secretary of War under President [[James Buchanan]], had moved arms south out of northern U.S. armories. To economize, armaments for southern forts had not been put in place. These were now appropriated to the Confederacy along with bullion and coining dies at the U.S. mints in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Dahlonega, Georgia]]; and [[New Orleans]].

====Lincoln's position====
Abraham Lincoln’s first Inaugural Address tried to contain the expansion of the Confederacy, by assuring the Border States that [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] would be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Holzer | first1 = Harold | title = Lincoln president-elect : Abraham Lincoln and the great secession winter 1860-1861 | year = 2008 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7432-8948-1 | pages =  }} p.429&lt;/ref&gt; But at the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], Lincoln called up the states’ militia to muster under his command and re-occupy U.S. forts. The attack on Fort Sumter and Lincoln's response ignited a firestorm of emotion, as the people North and South demanded war and young men rushed to the colors. Four more states (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) declared secessions, while Kentucky tried to remain neutral.

Seven states declared their secession from the United States before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861:

After the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]] April 12, 1861, and Lincoln's subsequent call for troops on April 15, four more states declared their secession:&lt;ref&gt;Some southern unionists blamed Lincoln's call for troops as the precipitating event for the second wave of secessions. Historian James McPherson argues that such claims have &quot;a self-serving quality&quot; and regards them as misleading. He wrote:

{{quote|As the telegraph chattered reports of the attack on Sumter April 12 and its surrender next day, huge crowds poured into the streets of Richmond, Raleigh, Nashville, and other upper South cities to celebrate this victory over the Yankees. These crowds waved Confederate flags and cheered the glorious cause of southern independence. They demanded that their own states join the cause. Scores of demonstrations took place from April 12 to 14, before Lincoln issued his call for troops. Many conditional unionists were swept along by this powerful tide of southern nationalism; others were cowed into silence.| McPherson p. 278}}

Historian Daniel W. Crofts disagrees with McPherson. Crofts wrote:

{{quote|The bombardment of Fort Sumter, by itself, did not destroy Unionist majorities in the upper South. Because only three days elapsed before Lincoln issued the proclamation, the two events viewed retrospectively, appear almost simultaneous. Nevertheless, close examination of contemporary evidence ... shows that the proclamation had a far more decisive impact.|Crofts p. 336}}
Crofts further noted that, {{quote|Many concluded ... that Lincoln had deliberately chosen 'to drive off all the Slave states, in order to make war on them and annihilate slavery.'| Crofts pp. 337-338, quoting the North Carolina politician [[Jonathan Worth]] (1802-1869).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Virginia]] (April 17, 1861; ratified by voters May 23, 1861)&lt;ref&gt;The text of [http://gen.1starnet.com/civilwar/vaord.htm Virginia's Ordinance of Secession]. Virginia seceded in two steps, first by secession convention vote on April 17, 1861, and then by ratification of this by a popular vote conducted on May 23, 1861. A Unionist [[Restored government of Virginia]] also operated. Virginia did not turn over its military to the Confederate States until June 8, 1861. The Commonwealth of Virginia ratified the [[Confederate States Constitution|Constitution of the Confederate States]] on June 19, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Arkansas]] (May 6, 1861)&lt;ref&gt;The text of [http://gen.1starnet.com/civilwar/arord.htm Arkansas' Ordinance of Secession].&lt;/ref&gt;

Tennessee voters approved the agreement on June 8, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[North Carolina]] (May 20, 1861)&lt;ref&gt;The text of [http://gen.1starnet.com/civilwar/ncord.htm North Carolina's Ordinance of Secession].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kentucky declared neutrality but after Confederate troops moved in it asked for Union troops to drive them out. Confederates tried to set up their own [[Confederate government of Kentucky|state government]], but it was driven out and never controlled Kentucky. The Union had a [[Restored government of Virginia|rump government]] in Virginia, and when its western counties rejected the Confederacy the Unionists government approved the creation of [[West Virginia]], which was admitted to the U.S. as a state.

In Missouri, [[Missouri Secession|a pro-CSA remnant of the General Assembly]] met on October 31, 1861, and although lacking a quorum in either house, passed an [[ordinance of secession]].&lt;ref&gt;Weigley (2000) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gen.1starnet.com/civilwar/misouord.htm Missouri's Ordinance of Secession].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this occurred after [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861-63)|a standing constitutional convention]] declared the legislature and governor void after Federal troops marched on and took over the capital. The Confederate government was driven out of Missouri and never was in control of the state. Missouri never seceded and was not covered by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. The standing State constitutional convention repealed slavery in Missouri before Federal constitutional amendments passed.

The Confederacy recognized the pro-Confederate claimants in both Kentucky and Missouri and laid claim to those states based on their authority, with representatives from both states seated in the Confederate Congress. Later versions of Confederate flags had 13 stars, reflecting the Confederacy's claims to Kentucky and Missouri, and the large numbers of soldiers they provided.

On April 27, 1861, President Lincoln, in response to the destruction of railroad bridges and telegraph lines by southern sympathizers in [[Maryland in the American Civil War|Maryland]] (surrounding Washington, D.C., on three sides), authorized General Scott to suspend the [[Habeas corpus in the United States|writ of habeas corpus]] along the railroad line from Philadelphia to Baltimore to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;White (2009) p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delaware]], also a slave state, never considered secession, nor did Washington, D.C. Although the slave states of [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]] did not secede, citizens from those states did exhibit divided loyalties. Only Delaware among the slave states did not produce a full regiment to fight for the Confederacy. Delaware achieved the distinction of providing more soldiers by percentage than any other state, and overwhelmingly they fought for the Union.

In 1861, a [[Wheeling Convention|Unionist legislature]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling, Virginia]], seceded from Virginia, eventually claiming 50 counties for a new state. However, 24 of those counties had voted in favor of Virginia's secession, and control of these counties, as well as some counties that had voted against secession, remained contested until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;R. Curry, &quot;A House Divided&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[West Virginia]] joined the United States in 1863 with a constitution that gradually abolished slavery. According to military historian Russell F. Weigley, &quot;Most of West Virginia went through the Civil War not as an asset to the Union but as a troublesome battleground...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weigley, Russell Frank, ''A Great Civil War'', W.W. Norton, 2003, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate declarations of martial law checked attempts to secede from the Confederate States of America by some counties in [[East Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aotc.net/Marxen.htm &quot;&quot;Marx and Engels on the American Civil War&quot;, ''Army of the Cumberland and George H.

===Seceding territories===
{{Main|New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory in the American Civil War}}
Citizens at [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the southern part of [[New Mexico Territory]] (modern day [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]) formed a secession convention, which voted to join the Confederacy on March 16, 1861, and appointed [[Lewis Owings]] as the new territorial governor. In July, the Mesilla government appealed to Confederate troops in [[El Paso, Texas]], under Lieutenant Colonel [[John Baylor]] for help in removing the [[Union Army]] under Major Isaac Lynde that had taken up position nearby. The Confederates defeated Lynde's forces at the [[Battle of Mesilla]] on July 27, 1861. After the battle, Baylor established a territorial government for the Confederate [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Arizona Territory]] and named himself governor. The Confederacy proclaimed the portion of the [[New Mexico Territory]] south of the [[34th parallel north|34th parallel]] as the Confederate Arizona Territory on February 14, 1862,&lt;ref&gt;

Although Confederates briefly occupied the territorial capital of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], they suffered defeat at [[Glorieta Pass]] in March and retreated, never to return. The Union regained military control of the area, and on February 24, 1863, set up the U.S. [[Arizona Territory]] with [[Fort Whipple, Arizona|Fort Whipple]] as the capital.

Confederate supporters also claimed portions of modern-day Oklahoma as Confederate territory after the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] abandoned and evacuated the federal forts and installations in the territory. The five tribal governments of the [[Indian Territory]]&amp;nbsp;— which became [[Oklahoma]] in 1907&amp;nbsp;— mainly supported the Confederacy, providing troops and one [[general officer]]. On July 12, 1861, the newly formed Confederate States government signed a treaty with both the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] Indian nations in the Indian Territory.&lt;ref&gt;

The Cherokee, in their declaration of causes, gave as reasons for aligning with the Confederacy the similar institutions and interests of the Cherokee nation and the Southern states, alleged violations of the Constitution by the North, claimed that the North waged war against Southern commercial and political freedom and for the abolition of slavery in general and in the Indian Territory in particular, and that the North intended to seize Indian lands as had happened in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarhome.com/cherokeecauses.htm ''Declaration by the People of the Cherokee Nation of the Causes Which Have Impelled Them to Unite Their Fortunes With Those of the Confederate States of America''].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise and fall of the Confederacy===
The American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Federal troops of the U.S. had retreated to [[Fort Sumter]] soon after South Carolina declared its secession on 20 December 1860. U.S. President Buchanan had attempted to re-supply Sumter by sending the ''[[Star of the West]]'', but Confederate forces led by cadets from The Citadel, fired upon the ship on Jan. 9, 1861, driving it away. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln also attempted to resupply Sumter. Lincoln notified South Carolina Governor [[Francis W. Pickens]] that &quot;an attempt will be made to supply Fort Sumter with provisions only, and that if such attempt be not resisted, no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition will be made without further notice, [except] in case of an attack on the fort.&quot; However, suspecting just such an attempt to reinforce the fort, the Confederate cabinet decided at a meeting in Montgomery to capture Fort Sumter before the relief fleet arrived.

On April 12, 1861, Confederate troops, following orders from [[Jefferson Davis]] and his Secretary of War, fired upon the federal troops occupying Fort Sumter, forcing their surrender. Nobody was killed in the battle, though two Union soldiers did die from an accidental explosion during the surrender ceremonies. After the war, Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens maintained that Lincoln's attempt to resupply Sumter was a disguised reinforcement and had provoked the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Following the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], Lincoln called for the states to send troops to recapture Sumter and all other federal property that had been seized in the seven seceding states&lt;ref name=LincolnCallToArms&gt;
[http://www.civilwarhome.com/lincolntroops.htm Lincoln's proclamation calling for troops from the remaining states (bottom of page); Department of War details to States (top)].&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln issued this call before Congress could convene on the matter, and the original request from the War Department called for volunteers for only three months of duty. Lincoln's call for troops resulted in four border states deciding to secede rather than provide troops that would be marching into neighboring Southern states. Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina joined the Confederacy, bringing the total to 11 states. Once Virginia had joined, the Confederate States moved their capital from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. All but two major battles ([[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]) took place in Confederate territory.

By 1862, the Union had taken control of [[New Orleans in the American Civil War|New Orleans]], and had gained control of the contested northernmost slave states (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia). Two major Confederate incursions into Union territory, [[Maryland Campaign|into Maryland in 1862]] and [[Gettysburg Campaign|into Pennsylvania in 1863]], each lasted only a matter of days. By 1863 the Union held control of most of [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]]; with the fall of [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, on July 4 of that year, the Union gained complete control over the Mississippi River, cutting off the westernmost portions of the Confederacy (Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and the Oklahoma and Arizona Territories).

In 1864, the Union took [[Battle of Mobile Bay|Mobile, Alabama]], the last major port on the Gulf Coast, and by September 1864 [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta]] fell to Union troops, paving the way for the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] by [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s forces; he reached Savannah by the end of the year, then moved north into the Carolinas, devastating a wide swath of the Confederate heartland.

The Union took the Confederate capital, [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]], Virginia, in April 1865. The surrender of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] by General [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] on April 9, 1865, marked the end of the Confederacy. Some high officials escaped to Europe but Union patrols captured President Davis on May 10; all remaining Confederate forces surrendered by June 1865. The U.S. Army took control of the Confederate areas and there was no post-surrender insurgency or guerrilla warfare against the army, but there was a great deal of local violence, feuding and revenge killings.&lt;ref&gt;The crew of the [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']] hauled down the last Confederate flag at Liverpool in the UK on November 6, 1865. {{cite book | last = John Baldwin (Author), Ron Powers (Author) | authorlink = | title = Last Flag Down: The Epic Journey of the Last Confederate Warship|edition= May 6, 2008|page= 368 | publisher = Three Rivers Press| isbn= 0307236560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Gary Gallagher concludes: &quot;The Confederacy capitulated in the spring of 1865 because northern armies had demonstrated their ability to crush organized southern military resistance. Soldiers laid down their arms at Appomattox and Durham Station when brought to bay by imposing Federal forces under the resolute command of U.S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. Civilians who had maintained faith in their defenders despite material hardship and social disruption similarly recognized that the end had come.... Most Confederates knew that as a people they had expended blood and treasure in profusion before ultimately collapsing in the face of northern power sternly applied.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
===Constitution===
{{Wikisource|Constitution of the Confederate States of America}}
{{Main|Confederate States Constitution}}
[[File:Davis4-2.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Jefferson Davis]]&lt;br/&gt;President 1861–1865]]

The Southern leaders met in Montgomery, Alabama, to write their constitution. Much of the [[Confederate States Constitution]] replicated the [[United States Constitution]] verbatim, but it contained several explicit protections of the institution of slavery, though it maintained the [[History of slavery#Early United States law|existing ban on international slave-trading]]. In certain areas, the Confederate Constitution gave greater powers to the states (or curtailed the powers of the central government more) than the U.S. Constitution of the time did, but in other areas, the states actually lost rights they had under the U.S. Constitution. Although the Confederate Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, contained a [[commerce clause]], the Confederate version prohibited the central government from using revenues collected in one state for funding [[internal improvement]]s in another state. The Confederate Constitution's equivalent to the U.S. Constitution's [[General Welfare clause|general welfare clause]] prohibited [[protective tariff]]s (but allowed tariffs for providing domestic revenue), and spoke of &quot;carry[ing] on the Government of the Confederate States&quot; rather than providing for the &quot;general welfare&quot;. State legislatures had the power to [[impeachment|impeach]] officials of the Confederate government in some cases. On the other hand, the Confederate Constitution contained a [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] and a [[Supremacy Clause]] that essentially duplicated the respective clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Confederate Constitution also incorporated each of the 12 amendments to the U.S. Constitution that had been ratified up to that point.

The Confederate Constitution did not specifically include a provision allowing states to secede; the Preamble spoke of each state &quot;acting in its sovereign and independent character&quot; but also of the formation of a &quot;permanent federal government&quot;. During the debates on drafting the Confederate Constitution, one proposal would have allowed states to secede from the Confederacy. The proposal was tabled with only the South Carolina delegates voting in favor of considering the motion.&lt;ref&gt;Davis p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate Constitution also explicitly denied States the power to bar slaveholders from other parts of the Confederacy from bringing their slaves into any state of the Confederacy or to interfere with the property rights of slave owners traveling between different parts of the Confederacy. In contrast with the secular 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] language of the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution overtly asked God's blessing (&quot;...invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God...&quot;).

The Constitution provided for a President of the Confederate States of America, elected to serve a six-year term but without the possibility of re-election. Unlike the Union Constitution, the Confederate Constitution gave the president the ability to subject a bill to a [[line item veto]], a power also held by some state governors. The Confederate Congress could overturn either the general or the line item vetoes with the same two-thirds majorities that are required in the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]]. In addition, appropriations not specifically requested by the executive branch required passage by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. The only person to serve as president was [[Jefferson Davis]], due to the Confederacy being defeated before the completion of his term.

===Legislative===
{{Main|Confederate Congress}}

As its [[legislative branch]], the Confederate States of America instituted the Confederate Congress. Like the United States Congress, the Confederate Congress consisted of two houses:

# the Confederate Senate, whose membership included two senators from each state (and chosen by the state legislature)
# the Confederate House of Representatives, with members popularly elected by properly enfranchised residents of the individual states

'''Provisional Congress'''&lt;br/&gt;
For the first year, the unicameral [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] functioned as the Confederacy's legislative branch.

===Judicial===
The Confederate Constitution outlined a judicial branch of the government, but the ongoing war and resistance from states-rights advocates, particularly on the question of whether it would have appellate jurisdiction over the state courts, prevented the creation or seating of the &quot;Supreme Court of the Confederate States&quot;; the state courts generally continued to operate as they had done, simply recognizing the C.S.A. as the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=821 |title=&quot;Legal Materials on the Confederate States of America in the Schaffer Law Library&quot;, Albany Law School |publisher=Albanylaw.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confederate district courts were authorized by Article III, Section 1, of the Confederate Constitution,&lt;ref name=&quot;Moise, E. Warren 2003&quot;&gt;[Moise, E. Warren, Rebellion in the Temple of Justice (iUniverse 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; and President Davis appointed judges within the individual states of the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moise, E. Warren 2003&quot;/&gt; In many cases, the same U.S. Federal District Judges were appointed as Confederate States District Judges. Confederate district courts began reopening in the spring of 1861 handling many of the same type cases as had been done before. Prize cases, in which Union ships were captured by the Confederate Navy or raiders and sold through court proceedings, were heard until the blockade of southern ports made this impossible. After a Sequestration Act was passed by the Confederate Congress, the Confederate district courts heard many cases in which enemy aliens (typically Northern absentee landlords owning property in the South) had their property sequestered (i.e., seized) by Confederate Receivers. When the matter came before the Confederate court, the property owner could not appear because he was unable to travel across the [[front line]]s between Union and Confederate forces. Thus, the C.S. District Attorney won the case by default, the property was typically sold, and the money used to further the Southern war effort. Eventually, because there was no Confederate Supreme Court, sharp attorneys like South Carolina's Edward McCrady began filing appeals. This prevented their clients' property from being sold until a supreme court could be constituted to hear the appeal, which never occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moise, E. Warren 2003&quot;/&gt; Where Federal troops gained control over parts of the Confederacy and re-established civilian government, U.S. district courts sometimes resumed jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/021.html |title=Records of District Courts of the United States, National Archives |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties===
The Confederacy actively used the army to arrest people suspected of loyalty to the United States. Historian Mark Neely found 4,108 names of men arrested and estimated a much larger total.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (1999) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy arrested pro-Union civilians in the South at about the same rate as the Union arrested pro-Confederate civilians in the North. Neely concludes:

{{quote|The Confederate citizen was not any freer than the Union citizen&amp;nbsp;— and perhaps no less likely to be arrested by military authorities. In fact, the Confederate citizen may have been in some ways less free than his Northern counterpart. For example, freedom to travel within the Confederate states was severely limited by a [[Internal passport|domestic passport]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (1993) pp. 11, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Capital===
[[File:Virginia Capitol 1865.jpg|thumb|[[Virginia State Capitol|Virginia State House]], which served as the last Confederate Capitol building]]

[[Montgomery, Alabama]] served as the capital of the Confederate States of America from February 4 until May 29, 1861. The naming of [[Richmond, Virginia]] as the new capital took place on May 30, 1861. Shortly before the end of the war, the Confederate government evacuated Richmond, planning to relocate farther south. Little came of these plans before Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. [[Danville, Virginia]], served as the last capital of the Confederate States of America, from April 3 to April 10, 1865.

===Financial instruments===
Both the individual Confederate states and later the Confederate government printed [[Confederate States of America dollar]]s as paper currency in various denominations, much of it signed by the Treasurer [[Edward C. Elmore]]. During the course of the war these severely depreciated and eventually became worthless. Many bills still exist, although in recent years copies have proliferated.

The Confederate government initially financed the war effort mostly through [[tariffs]] on imports, [[custom duties|export taxes]], and voluntary donations of coins and bullion. However, after the imposition of a self-[[embargo]] on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried up and the Confederacy increasingly turned to [[Government debt|issuing debt]] and printing money to pay for war expanses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states throughout the rest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burdekin and Farrokh Langdana, &quot;War Finance in the Southern Confederacy, 1861-1865&quot;, ''Explorations in Economic History'', Vol 30, No 3, July 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Confederate currency $100 John Calhoun.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Hundred dollar bill|$100 bill]] issued by Confederate States of America, bearing image of [[John C. Calhoun]], November 1862]]
The Treasury also issued paper bonds in large numbers, and the Post Office produced a considerable number of [[postage stamps]]; both stamps and bonds (and especially bond coupons) remain readily available. The [[philatelic]] market regards as far more valuable the stamps placed on envelopes that were actually used during the war.

At the time of their secession, the states (and later the Confederate government) took over the national mints in their territories: the [[Charlotte Mint]] in North Carolina, the [[Dahlonega Mint]] in Georgia, and the [[New Orleans Mint]] in Louisiana. During 1861, the first two produced small amounts of gold coinage, the latter half dollars. Since the mints used the current dies on hand, these issues remain indistinguishable from those minted by the Union.

However the four half dollars with a Confederate (rather than U.S.) reverse, mentioned below, used an obverse die that had a small crack. Thus &quot;regular&quot; 1861-O halves with this crack probably were among the 962,633 pieces struck under Confederate authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipwreck.net/pdf/OMEPaper7_000.pdf |title=The SS '&amp;#39;Republic'&amp;#39; Shipwreck Project: the Coin Collection, p.23 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 plans also originated to produce Confederate coins. The New Orleans Mint produced dies and four specimen half dollars, but a lack of [[bullion]] prevented any further minting. A jeweler in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, manufactured a dozen pennies under an agreement, but did not deliver them for fear of arrest. Over the years copies of both denominations have appeared. More details and pictures of the original issues appear in ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]''.

===International diplomacy===
Once the war with the United States began, the Confederacy pinned its hopes for survival on military intervention by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. The United States realized this as well and made it clear that diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy meant war with the United States&amp;nbsp;— and the cutting off of food shipments into Britain. The Confederates who had believed that &quot;[[King Cotton|cotton is king]]&quot;&amp;nbsp;— that is, Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton&amp;nbsp;— proved mistaken. The British had ample stocks to last over a year, and had been developing alternative sources of cotton (most notably [[British Raj|India]] and [[Egypt]]) and were not about to go to war with the U.S. to try to get more cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Lebergott Why the South Lost: Commercial Purpose in the Confederacy, 1861-1865 The Journal of American History, Vol. 70, No. 1. (June, 1983), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate government sent repeated delegations to Europe; historians give them low marks for their poor diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal (1966); Jones (2009); Owsley (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; [[James M. Mason]] went to London and [[John Slidell]] traveled to Paris, but neither were officially received. Each did succeed in holding unofficial private meetings with high British and French officials but neither secured [[diplomatic recognition|official recognition]] for the Confederacy. Britain and the United States came dangerously close to war during the [[Trent Affair]] (when the U.S. Navy seized two Confederate agents traveling on a British ship in late 1861), and it seemed possible that the Confederacy would see its much desired recognition. When Lincoln released the two, however, tensions cooled, and in the end the episode did not aid the Confederate cause.

[[File:Lord John Russell.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lord John Russell]]&lt;br&gt; British Foreign Minister independently pressed to mediate in the American War.]]&lt;br&gt;Throughout the early years of the war, British foreign secretary [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], [[Napoleon III]] of France, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], showed interest in the idea of recognition of the Confederacy, or at least of offering a mediation. Recognition meant certain war with the United States, and war would have meant loss of American grain, loss of exports to the United States, loss of huge investments in American securities, invasion of Canada, much higher taxes, many lives lost and a threat to British trade. Intervention was considered by the British government following the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], but the Union victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]] and Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]], combined with internal opposition, caused Britain to back away; the British government did allow [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|''blockade runners'']] to be built in Britain and operated by British seamen.

No country appointed any diplomat to the Confederacy, but several maintained their consuls in the South whom they had appointed before the outbreak of war.&lt;ref&gt;In November 1863, Confederate diplomat [[A. Dudley Mann]] met [[Pope Pius IX]] in Rome and received a letter addressed &quot;to the Illustrious and Honorable Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America&quot;. Mann, in his dispatch to Richmond, interpreted the letter as &quot;a positive recognition of our Government&quot;. Confederate Secretary of State [[Judah P. Benjamin]], however, interpreted it as &quot;a mere inferential recognition, unconnected with political action or the regular establishment of diplomatic relations&quot; and thus did not assign it the weight of formal recognition. See [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?root=%2Fmoa%2Fofre%2Fofre2003%2F&amp;tif=01043.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fsgml%2Fmoa-idx%3Fnotisid%3DANU4547-2003&amp;coll=moa&amp;frames=1&amp;view=50 ''Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion'', p. 1015.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, [[Ernst Raven]] applied to Richmond for approval as the [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] consul, but he held citizenship in Texas and officials in Saxe-Coburg-Gotha never saw his request; they strongly supported the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=x82ncYYwq98C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=ernest+raven+texas&amp;q=ernest%20raven%20texas |first=Eugene H |last=Berwanger |title=The British Foreign Service and the American Civil War |publisher=U of Kentucky Press |year=1994 |page=111 |isbn=9780813118765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, the Confederacy expelled all foreign consuls (all of them European diplomats) for advising their subjects to refuse to serve in the Confederate army.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander DeConde, ed. ''Encyclopedia of American foreign policy'' (2001) vol 1 p 202&lt;/ref&gt;

No nation ever sent an ambassador or an official delegation to Richmond. However, they applied principles of international law that recognized the Union and Confederate sides as [[belligerent]]s. Both Confederate and Union agents were allowed to work openly in British territories. For example, in [[Hamilton, Bermuda]] a Confederate agent openly worked to help [[blockade runner]]s. Some state governments in northern Mexico negotiated local agreements to cover trade on the Texas border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=_kq7diciSsQC Wise, Stephen R., ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running During the Civil War'', University of South Carolina Press, 1991, ISBN 0872497992, 9780872497993], [http://books.google.com/books?id=_kq7diciSsQC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq p. 86].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius IX]] caused a controversy during the war by [[Pope Pius IX and the United States#Political involvement during the Civil War|writing a letter]] to Jefferson Davis in which he addressed Davis as the &quot;Honorable President of the Confederate States of America.&quot; In doing so, the Pope appeared to informally (on a personal level) recognize that the CSA was a separate country. The [[Holy See]] never released a formal statement supporting or recognizing the Confederacy, however.

===&quot;Died of states' rights&quot;===
Historian [[Frank Lawrence Owsley]] argued that the Confederacy &quot;died of states' rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank L. Owsley 1925&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owsley, &quot;Local Defense and the Overthrow of the Confederacy&quot;, ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 11 (Mar. 1925): 492–525, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1895910 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Owsley, strong-willed governors and state legislatures in the South refused to give the central government the soldiers and money it needed because they feared that Richmond would encroach on the rights of the states. Georgia's governor [[Joseph E. Brown|Joseph Brown]] warned that he saw the signs of a deep-laid conspiracy on the part of Jefferson Davis to destroy states' rights and individual liberty. Brown declaimed: &quot;Almost every act of usurpation of power, or of bad faith, has been conceived, brought forth and nurtured in secret session.&quot; He saw granting the Confederate government the power to draft soldiers as the &quot;essence of military despotism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rable (1994) 257; however Wallace Hettle in ''The Peculiar Democracy: Southern Democrats in Peace and Civil War'' (2001) p. 158 says Owsley's &quot;famous thesis... is overstated.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 governor [[Pendleton Murrah]] of Texas insisted that his State needed Texas troops for self-defense (against Native Americans or against a threatened Union advance), and refused to send them East.&lt;ref&gt;John Moretta; &quot;Pendleton Murrah and States Rights in Civil War Texas,&quot; ''Civil War History,'' Vol. 45, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zebulon Vance]], the governor of North Carolina, had a reputation for hostility to Davis and to his demands. North Carolina showed intense opposition to conscription, resulting in very poor results for recruiting. Governor Vance's faith in states' rights drove him into a stubborn opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Burton Moore, ''Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy.'' (1924) p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian George Rable wrote:
{{quote|For Alexander Stephens, any accommodation would only weaken the republic, and he therefore had no choice but to break publicly with the Confederate administration and the president. In an extraordinary three-hour speech to the legislature on the evening of March 16 [1864], the vice-president carefully outlined his position. Allowing Davis to make &quot;arbitrary arrests&quot; and to draft state officials conferred on him more power than the English Parliament had ever bestowed on the king. History proved the dangers of such unchecked authority.

....The Confederate government intended to suppress the peace meetings in North Carolina, he warned, and &quot;put a muzzle upon certain presses&quot; (i.e., the ''Raleigh Standard'') in order to control elections in that state.&lt;ref&gt;Rable (1994) [http://books.google.com/books?id=aaxuu3YTD3oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 258]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Echoing [[Patrick Henry]]'s &quot;give me liberty or give me death&quot; Stephens warned the Southerners they should never view liberty as &quot;subordinate to independence&quot; because the cry of &quot;independence first and liberty second&quot; was a &quot;fatal delusion&quot;. As Rable concludes, &quot;For Stephens, the essence of patriotism, the heart of the Confederate cause, rested on an unyielding commitment to traditional rights. In his idealist vision of politics, military necessity, pragmatism, and compromise meant nothing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rable (1994) p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite political differences within the Confederacy, no political parties were formed. Historian William C. Cooper Jr. wrote that &quot;at the birth of their new nation, Confederates, in the language of the Founding Fathers, denounced the legitimacy of parties. Anti-partyism became an article of political faith. Almost nobody, even Davis’s most fervent antagonists, advocated parties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper (2000) p. 462.  Rable (1994) pp. 2-3.  Rable wrote, &quot;But despite heated arguments and no little friction between the competing political cultures of unity and liberty, antiparty and broader fears about politics in general shaped civic life. These beliefs could obviously not eliminate partisanship or prevent Confederates from holding on to and exploiting old political prejudices.  Indeed, some states, notably Georgia and North Carolina, remained political tinderboxes throughout the war.  Even the most bitter foes of the Confederate government, however, refused to form an opposition party, and the Georgia dissidents, to cite the most prominent example, avoided many traditional political activities.  Only in North Carolina did there develop anything resembling a party system, and there the central values of the Confederacy's two political cultures had a far more powerful influence on political debate than did organizational maneuvering.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of a functioning two party system, according to historian David M. Potter, caused &quot;real and direct damage&quot; to the Confederate war effort since it prevented the formulation of any effective alternatives to the Davis administration's policies in conducting the war.&lt;ref&gt;David Herbert Donald, , ed. ''Why the North Won the Civil War.'' (1996) p.112-113.  Potter wrote in his contribution to this book, &quot;Where parties do not exist, criticism of the administration is likely to remain purely an individual matter; therefore the tone of the criticism is likely to be negative, carping, and petty, as it certainly was in the Confederacy. But where there are parties, the opposition group is strongly impelled to formulate real alternative policies and to press for the adoption of these policies on a constructive basis. ... But the absence of a two-party system meant the absence of any available alternative leadership, and the protest votes which were cast in the [1863 Confederate mid-term] election became more expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction rather than implements of a decision to adopt new and different policies for the Confederacy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival of the Confederacy depended on a strong base of civilians and soldiers devoted to victory. The soldiers performed well, though increasing numbers deserted in the last year of fighting, and the Confederacy never succeeded in replacing casualties as the Union could. The civilians, although enthusiastic in 1861-62, seem to have lost faith in the future of the Confederacy by 1864, and instead looked to protect their homes and communities. As Rable explains, &quot;As the Confederacy shrank, citizens' sense of the cause more than ever narrowed to their own states and communities. This contraction of civic vision was more than a crabbed libertarianism; it represented an increasingly widespread disillusionment with the Confederate experiment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rable (1994) p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self image===
Historian [[Emory Thomas]] reconstructed the Confederacy's self image by studying the correspondence sent by the Confederate government in 1861-62 to foreign governments. He found that the C.S.A. had multiple self images:
{{quote|The Southern nation was by turns a guileless people attacked by a voracious neighbor, an 'established' nation in some temporary difficulty, a collection of bucolic aristocrats making a romantic stand against the banalities of industrial democracy, a cabal of commercial farmers seeking to make a pawn of King Cotton, an apotheosis of nineteenth-century nationalism and revolutionary liberalism, or the ultimate statement of social and economic reaction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Emory M. Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation: 1861-1865'' (1979), pp. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relations with the United States==
During the four years of its existence, the Confederate States of America asserted its independence and appointed dozens of diplomatic agents abroad. The United States government, by contrast, regarded the Southern states as states in rebellion and refused any formal recognition of their status. Thus, even before the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] issued formal instructions in April 1861 to [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]], the newly appointed minister to Great Britain:
{{quote|You will indulge in no expressions of harshness or disrespect, or even impatience concerning the seceding States, their agents, or their people. But you will, on the contrary, all the while remember that those States are now, as they always heretofore have been, and, notwithstanding their temporary self-delusion, they must always continue to be, equal and honored members of this Federal Union, and that their citizens throughout all political misunderstandings and alienations, still are and always must be our kindred and countrymen.&lt;ref name=SewardToAdams1861 &gt;William Seward to Charles Francis Adams, April 10, 1861 in Marion Mills Miller, (ed.) ''Life And Works Of Abraham Lincoln'' (1907) Vol 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, if the British seemed inclined to recognize the Confederacy, or even waver in that regard, they would receive a sharp warning, with a strong hint of war:
[[File:PRINCE ARTHUR CDSPC.JPG|thumb|British [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|Mail Packet]], an ocean-going side-wheeler like the [[RMS Trent]] which caused a diplomatic crisis for the United States and Britain when Confederate diplomats were seized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c08243/ |title=The San Jacinto, having overhauled the British mail packet Trent, forces her to heave to.

{{quote|[if Britain is] tolerating the application of the so-called seceding States, or wavering about it, you will not leave them to suppose for a moment that they can grant that application and remain friends with the United States. You may even assure them promptly, in that case, that if they determine to recognize, they may at the same time prepare to enter into alliance with the enemies of this republic.&lt;ref name=SewardToAdams1861 /&gt;}}

The Union government never declared war, but conducted its military efforts under a presidential proclamation issued April 15, 1861, calling for troops to recapture forts and suppress a rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/1861/april/abraham-lincoln-declaration-war.htm |title=President Abraham Lincoln's Declaration of War |publisher=Sonofthesouth.net |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Mid-war negotiations between the two sides occurred without formal political recognition, though the [[laws of war]] governed military relationships.

Following the Battle of Fort Sumter, the Confederate Congress asserted on May 6, 1861: {{quote |... war exists between the Confederate States and the Government of the United States, and the States and Territories thereof, excepting the States of Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, and Delaware, and the Territories of Arizona, and New Mexico, and the Indian Territory south of Kansas...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Four years after the war, in 1869, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Texas v. White]]'' ruled Texas' declaration of secession was [[Void (law)|legally null and void]]. The court's opinion was authored by Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]]. The court did allow some possibility of separation from the Union &quot;through revolution or through consent of the States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandar Pavković, Peter Radan, [http://books.google.com/books?id=-IjHbPvp1W0C  Creating New States: Theory and Practice of Secession], p. 222, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007.

[[Jefferson Davis]], former President of the Confederacy, and Alexander Stephens, its former Vice-President, both penned arguments in favor of secession's legality, most notably Davis' ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]''.

==Confederate Post Office==

[[File:John Henninger Reagan - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;John H. Reagan&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;Confederate Postmaster General&lt;/center&gt;]]

When the Confederacy was formed and its seceding states broke from the Union, it was at once confronted with the arduous task of providing its citizens with a mail delivery system, and in the midst of the American Civil War the newly formed Confederacy created and established the Confederate Post Office. One of the first undertakings in establishing the Post Office was the appointment of [[John H. Reagan]] to the position of Postmaster General, by [[Jefferson Davis]] in 1861, making him the first Postmaster General of the Confederate Post Office as well as a member of Davis' presidential cabinet. Through Reagan's resourcefulness and remarkable industry, he had his department assembled, organized and in operation before the other Presidential cabinet members had their departments fully operational.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOHN H. REAGAN - The Old Roman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reaganscvcamp.org/ |title=JOHN H. REAGAN - The Old Roman |publisher= John H.

When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began, the U.S. Post Office still delivered mail from the seceded states for a brief period of time. Mail that was postmarked after the date of a state’s admission into the Confederacy through May 31, 1861 and bearing US (Union) Postage was still delivered.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Postal used in the Confederacy &quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;mode=&amp;tid=2040514 |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |title=U.S. Postal Issue Used in the Confederacy  (1893) |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, private express companies still managed to carry some of the mail across enemy lines.  Later mail that crossed lines had to be sent by [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Covers|'Flag of Truce']] and was only allowed to pass at two specific points:  Mail sent from the South to Northern states was received, opened and inspected at [[Fortress Monroe]] on the Virginia coast before being passed on into the U.S. mail stream. Mail sent from the North to any of the seceded states passed at [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]], also in Virginia, where it was also inspected before being sent on. &lt;ref&gt;Walter Flavius McCaleb, &quot;The Organization of the Post-Office Department of the Confederacy,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 12, No. 1 (Oct., 1906), pp. 66-74 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1832885 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.

With the chaos of the war, a working postal system was more important than ever for the Confederacy. The Civil War had divided family members and friends and consequently letter writing naturally increased dramatically across the entire divided nation, especially to and from the men who were away serving in an army. Mail delivery was also important for the Confederacy for a myriad of business and military reasons. Because of the Union blockade, basic supplies were always in demand and so getting mailed correspondence out of the country to suppliers was imperative to the successful operation of the Confederacy. Volumes of material have been written about the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|Blockade runners]] who evaded Union ships on blockade patrol, usually at night, and who moved cargo and mail in and out of the Confederate States throughout the course of the war. Of particular interest to students and historians of the American Civil War is [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|''Prisoner of War mail'']] and [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|''Blockade mail'']] as these items were often involved with a variety of military and other war time activities. The postal history of the Confederacy along with [[:File:Pow cover 19May1865.jpg|surviving Confederate mail]] has helped historians document the various people, places and events that were involved in the American Civil War as it unfolded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Confederate States Post Office&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2027888 |title=Confederate States Post Office |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Flags of the Confederate States of America}}

The first official flag of the Confederate States of America—called the &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; -- originally had seven stars, representing the first seven states that initially formed the Confederacy. As more states seceded, more stars were added, until the total was 13 (two stars were added for the divided states of [[Kentucky]] and [[Missouri]]). However, during the Battle of Bull Run (or First Manassas) it sometimes proved difficult to distinguish the Stars and Bars from the [[Flag of the United States#Historical progression of designs|Union flag]]. To rectify the situation, a separate &quot;Battle Flag&quot; was designed for use by troops in the field. Also known as the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, many variations sprang from the original square configuration. Although it was never officially adopted by the Confederate government, the popularity of the Southern Cross among both soldiers and the civilian population was a primary reason why it was made the main color feature when a new national flag was adopted in 1863. This new standard—known as the &quot;Stainless Banner&quot; -- consisted of a lengthened white field area with a Battle Flag canton. This flag too had its problems when used in military operations as, on a windless day, it could easily be mistaken for a flag of truce or surrender. Thus, in 1865, a modified version of the Stainless Banner was adopted. This final national flag of the Confederacy kept the Battle Flag canton, but shortened the white field and added a vertical red bar to the fly end.

Because of its depiction in the 20th-century{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and popular media, many people consider the rectangular battle flag design as being synonymous with &quot;the Confederate Flag&quot;, even though most were square, and none were ever adopted as Confederate national flags. The generic version of the banner familiar today was used as the Confederate Naval Jack and the Battle Flag of the Army of Tennessee as well as other units.

==Geography==
The Confederate States of America claimed a total of 2,919 miles (4,698&amp;nbsp;km) of coastline, thus a large part of its territory lay on the seacoast with level and often sandy or marshy ground. Most of the interior portion consisted of arable farmland, though much was also hilly and mountainous, and the far western territories were deserts. The lower reaches of the [[Mississippi River]] bisected the country, with the western half often referred to as the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]]. The highest point (excluding Arizona and New Mexico) was [[Guadalupe Peak]] in [[Texas]] at 8,750 feet (2,667 m).

[[File:Map of CSA 4.png|center|thumb|550px|Map of the states and territories claimed by the Confederate States of America]]

===Climate===
Much of the area claimed by the Confederate States of America had a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild winters and long, hot, humid summers. The climate and terrain varied from vast [[swamp]]s (such as those in [[Florida]] and [[Louisiana]]) to semi-arid [[steppe climate|steppes]] and arid [[desert climate|deserts]] west of longitude 96 degrees west. The subtropical climate made winters mild but allowed [[infectious disease]]s to flourish. Consequently, on both sides more soldiers died from disease than were killed in combat,&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsWarCost&quot;&gt;Two-thirds of soldiers' deaths occurred due to disease. {{cite web|last=Nofi|first=Al|title=Statistics on the War's Costs|publisher=Louisiana State University|date=2001-06-13|url=http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070711050249/http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archivedate=2007-07-11|accessdate=2008-09-08}}
&lt;/ref&gt; a fact hardly atypical of pre–World War I conflicts.

===River system===
In peacetime, the vast system of navigable rivers allowed for cheap and easy transportation of farm products. The railroad system, built as a supplement, tied plantation areas to the nearest river or seaport. The vast geography of the Confederacy made logistics difficult for the Union, and the Union armies assigned many of their soldiers to garrison captured areas and to protect rail lines. Nevertheless, the [[Union Navy]] had seized most of the navigable rivers by 1862, making its own logistics easy and Confederate movements difficult. After the [[Siege of Vicksburg|fall of Vicksburg]] in July 1863, it became impossible for Confederate units to cross the Mississippi: Union gunboats constantly patrolled the river. The South thus lost the use of its western regions.

===Railroad system===
{{Main|Confederate railroads in the American Civil War}}

[[File:LocomotiveFredLeach.jpg|thumb|left|The Union locomotive, &quot;Fred Leach&quot;, is photographed on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad after it escaped from Confederates on August 1, 1863 near Union Mills. Holes in the smokestack from Confederate shot are visible.]] [[File:1860 B&amp;O.jpg|thumb|Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR map of 1860 with connections. Rail connections to Chatanooga, Tn since mid-1850s are missing. Click through to magnifying icon.]]

At the end of 1860, the Southern rail network was disjointed and plagued by break of gauge as well as lack of interchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trains1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hankey |first1=John P. |year=2011 |title=The Railroad War |journal=Trains |publisher=Kalmbach Publishing Company |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=24–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most rail lines lead from coastal or river ports to inland cities, with few lateral railroads. This made travel between adjacent states by rail difficult.

The outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the railroad system in Confederate territory. The hoarding of the cotton crop in an attempt to entice European intervention left railroads bereft of their main source of income.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ramsdell, &quot;The Confederate Government and the Railroads, ''American Historical Review,'' Vol. 22, No. 4 (July, 1917), p. 795.&lt;/ref&gt; Many had to lay off employees, and in particular, let go skilled technicians and engineers.&lt;ref name=&quot;RamsRail1&quot;&gt;Charles W. Ramsdell The Confederate Government and the Railroads The American Historical Review, Vol. 22, No. 4 (July, 1917), p. 795.&lt;/ref&gt; For the early years of the war, the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate an overall policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ersatz&quot;&gt;Mary Elizabeth Massey. ''Ersatz in the Confederacy'' (1952) p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; With the legislation of [[impressment]] the same year, railroads and their rolling stock came under the de facto control of the military.

In the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and the heavy use of rolling stock wore them out.&lt;ref name=&quot;RamsRail4&quot;&gt;Ramsdell, &quot;The Confederate Government and the Railroads,&quot; pp. 809-810.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural/urban configuration===
The area claimed by the Confederate States of America consisted overwhelmingly of rural land. Few urban areas had populations of more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;— the typical [[county seat]] had a population of fewer than 500 people. Cities were rare. Of the twenty largest U.S. cities in the 1860 census, only [[New Orleans]] lay in Confederate territory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab09.txt |title=U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1860, Internet Release date: June 15, 1998 |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— and the Union captured New Orleans in 1862. Only 13 Confederate-controlled cities ranked among the top 100 U.S. cities in 1860, most of them ports whose economic activities vanished or suffered severely in the [[Union blockade]]. The population of Richmond swelled after it became the Confederate capital, reaching an estimated 128,000 in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Dabney 1990 p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Other large Southern cities ([[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and [[Washington, D.C]] as well as [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]]) never came under the control of the Confederate government.

The cities of the Confederacy included most prominently in order of size of population:

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Confederate States of America}}

The Confederacy started its existence as an agrarian economy with exports, to a world market, of [[cotton]], and, to a lesser extent, [[tobacco]] and [[sugarcane]]. Local food production included grains, hogs, cattle, and gardens. The 11 states produced $155 million in manufactured goods in 1860, chiefly from local grist-mills, and lumber, processed tobacco, cotton goods and [[naval stores]] such as [[turpentine]]. By the 1830s, the 11 states produced more cotton than all of the other countries in the world combined.

The Confederacy adopted a low [[tariff]] of 15 per cent, but imposed it on all imports from other countries, including the Union states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/tariff/tariff.html Tariff of the Confederate States of America, May 21, 1861].&lt;/ref&gt; The tariff mattered little; the Union blockade minimized commercial traffic through the Confederacy's ports, and very few people paid taxes on goods smuggled from the Union states. The government collected about $3.5 million in tariff revenue from the start of their war against the Union to late 1864. The lack of adequate financial resources led the Confederacy to finance the war through printing money, which led to high inflation. The requirements of its military encouraged the Confederate government to take a [[dirigisme|dirigiste]]-style approach to industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1860 the areas that later formed the 11 Confederate States (and including the future West Virginia) had 132,760 (1.46%) free blacks. Males made up 49.2% of the total population and females 50.8% (whites: 48.60% male, 51.40% female; slaves: 50.15% male, 49.85% female; free blacks: 47.43% male, 52.57% female).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 All data for this section taken from the University of Virginia Library, Historical Census Browser, Census Data for Year 1860].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armed forces==
{{Main|Military of the Confederate States of America}}
[[File:Navy Jack CSA.jpg|thumb|right|Navy Jack of the CSA]]

The military armed forces of the Confederacy comprised three branches:
*[[Confederate States Army]]
*[[Confederate States Navy]]
*[[Confederate States Marine Corps]]

The Confederate military leadership included many veterans from the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]] who had resigned their Federal commissions and had won appointment to senior positions in the Confederate armed forces. Many had served in the [[Mexican-American War]] (including Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis), but some such as [[Leonidas Polk]] (who had attended [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] but did not graduate) had little or no experience. The Confederate officer corps consisted of men from both slave-owning and non-slave-owning families. The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks. Although no Army service academy was established for the Confederacy, many colleges of the South (such as [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] and [[Virginia Military Institute]]) maintained cadet corps that were seen as a training ground for Confederate military leadership. A naval academy was established at [[Drewry’s Bluff]], Virginia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navyandmarine.org/ondeck/1862blackCSN.htm 1862blackCSN].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1863, but no midshipmen graduated before the Confederacy's end.

The soldiers of the Confederate armed forces consisted mainly of white males aged between 16 and 28.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The Confederacy adopted [[conscription]] in 1862. Many thousands of slaves served as laborers, cooks, and pioneers. Some freed blacks and men of color served in local state militia units of the Confederacy, primarily in Louisiana and South Carolina, but their officers deployed them for &quot;local defense, not combat.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Rubin p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted by casualties and desertions, the military suffered chronic manpower shortages. In the spring of 1865, the Confederate Congress, influenced by the public support by General Lee, approved the recruitment of black infantry units. Contrary to Lee’s and Davis’s recommendations, the Congress refused “to guarantee the freedom of black volunteers.” No more than two hundred black troops were ever raised.&lt;ref&gt;Levine pp. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military leaders===
Military leaders of the Confederacy (with their state or country of birth and highest rank)&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, ''Civil War High Commands''.&lt;/ref&gt; included:

'''Cranberries''' are a group of [[evergreen]] dwarf [[shrub]]s or trailing vines in the [[subgenus]] '''''Oxycoccus''''' of the genus ''[[Vaccinium]]''. In some methods of classification, ''Oxycoccus'' is regarded as a [[genus]] in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymf.bbg.org/profile_species_tech.asp?id=412]&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in [[acid]]ic [[bog]]s throughout the cooler regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Cranberries are low, creeping shrubs or vines up to {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} long and {{Convert|5|to|20|cm|0}} in height;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cranberryinstitute.org/about_cranberry.htm |title=About Cranberries |publisher=Cranberry Institute |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have slender, wiry stems that are not thickly woody and have small [[evergreen]] leaves. The [[flower]]s are dark pink, with very distinct ''reflexed'' [[petal]]s, leaving the [[Gynoecium|style]] and [[stamen]]s fully exposed and pointing forward. They are pollinated by [[bee]]s. The fruit is a [[berry]] that is larger than the leaves of the plant; it is initially white, but turns a deep red when fully ripe. It is edible, with an acidic taste that can overwhelm its sweetness.

Cranberries are a major commercial crop in certain [[United States|American]] states and [[Canada|Canadian]] provinces (see [[Cranberry#Cultivation|cultivation]] and [[Cranberry#Food uses|uses]] below). Most cranberries are processed into products such as [[cranberry juice|juice]], sauce, and sweetened [[dried cranberries]], with the remainder sold fresh to consumers. [[Cranberry sauce]] is regarded an indispensable part of traditional American and Canadian [[Thanksgiving]] menus and [[Europe]]an winter festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/nov/19/give-thanks-for-cranberries-grown-with-a-taste|date=2009-11-19|accessdate=2009-11-20|title=Garden Tips: Give thanks for cranberries, grown with a taste of Florida|author=Carol Cloud Bailey|publisher=Scripps Interactive Newspapers Group|work=TCPalm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 21st century within the global [[functional food]] industry, there has been a rapidly growing recognition of raw (not dried) cranberries for their consumer product popularity, [[nutrient]] content and [[antioxidant]] qualities, giving them commercial status as a &quot;[[superfruit]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hortresearch.co.nz/index/news/493 |title=Newsroom – 'Superfruits' the future of health |publisher=HortResearch |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nznewsuk.co.uk/news/?ID=4952&amp;StartRow=91 |title=Superfruit To the Rescue &gt; General News &amp;#124; New Zealand News UK &amp;#124; nznewsuk.co.uk |publisher=Nznewsuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Species and description ==
[[File:Cranberrymap.jpg|thumb|250px|Approximate ranges of the cranberries in sect. ''Oxycoccus'': Red: Common Cranberry. Orange: Small Cranberry. Green: American Cranberry.]]

There are three to four species of cranberry, classified in two sections:
;Subgenus ''Oxycoccus'', sect. ''Oxycoccus''
*'''''Vaccinium oxycoccos''''' or ''Oxycoccus palustris'' ('''Common Cranberry''' or '''Northern Cranberry''') is widespread throughout the cool temperate [[Northern Hemisphere]], including northern [[Europe]], northern [[Asia]] and northern [[North America]]. It has small 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm leaves. The flowers are dark pink, with a purple central spike, produced on finely hairy stems. The fruit is a small pale pink [[berry]], with a refreshing sharp acidic flavour.
*'''''Vaccinium microcarpum''''' or ''Oxycoccus microcarpus'' ('''Small Cranberry''') occurs in northern Europe and northern Asia, and differs from ''V. oxycoccos'' in the leaves being more triangular, and the flower stems hairless. Some botanists include it within ''V. oxycoccos''.
*'''''Vaccinium macrocarpon''''' or ''Oxycoccus macrocarpus'' ('''Large cranberry''', '''American Cranberry''', '''Bearberry''') native to northeastern [[North America]] (eastern [[Canada]], and eastern [[United States]], south to [[North Carolina]] at high altitudes). It differs from ''V. oxycoccos'' in the leaves being larger, 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm long, and in its slightly apple-like taste.
;Subgenus ''Oxycoccus'', sect. ''Oxycoccoides''
*'''''Vaccinium erythrocarpum''''' or ''Oxycoccus erythrocarpus'' ([[Southern Mountain Cranberry]]) native to southeastern [[North America]] at high altitudes in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], and also in eastern [[Asia]].
[[File:Vaccinum oxycoccos 120604.jpg|left|thumb|''Vaccinium oxycoccos'' flowers]]
Cranberries are related to [[bilberry|bilberries]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], and [[huckleberry|huckleberries]], all in ''Vaccinium'' subgenus ''Vaccinium''. These differ in having stouter, woodier stems forming taller shrubs, and in the bell-shaped flowers, the petals not being reflexed.

Some plants of the completely unrelated genus ''[[Viburnum]]'' are sometimes inaccurately called &quot;highbush cranberries&quot; (''[[Viburnum trilobum]]'').

Cranberries are susceptible to false blossom, a harmful but controllable [[phytoplasma]] disease common in the eastern production areas of Massachusetts and New Jersey.

== Etymology and history ==
[[File:Jonathan eastman johnson cranberry harvest.jpg|thumb|''The Cranberry Harvest on the Island of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]]'', [[Eastman Johnson]], 1880.]]
The name cranberry derives from &quot;craneberry&quot;, first named by early European settlers in America who felt the expanding flower, stem, calyx, and petals resembled the neck, head, and bill of a [[crane (bird)|crane]]. Another name used in northeastern Canada is '''mossberry'''. The traditional English name for ''Vaccinium oxycoccos'', '''[[:ang:Fenberȝe|fenberry]]''', originated from plants found growing in [[fen]] (marsh) lands. In 17th century New England cranberries were sometimes called &quot;bearberries&quot; as bears were often seen feeding on them.

In [[North America]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were the first to use cranberries as food. Native Americans used cranberries in a variety of foods, especially for [[pemmican]], wound medicine and dye. Calling the red berries '''Sassamanash''', natives may have introduced cranberries to starving English settlers in [[Massachusetts]] who incorporated the berries into traditional [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] feasts. [[American Revolutionary War]] veteran [[Henry Hall (American)|Henry Hall]] is credited as first to farm cranberries in the [[Cape Cod]] town of [[Dennis (town), Massachusetts|Dennis]] around 1816. In the 1820s cranberries were shipped to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cranberries.org/cranberries/history.html |title=History |publisher=Cranberries.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranberries became popular for wild harvesting in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Russia]]. In [[Scotland]], the berries were originally wild-harvested but with the loss of suitable habitat, the plants have become so scarce that this is no longer done.

== Cultivation==
=== Geography and bog method ===
[[File:Cranberrys beim Ernten.jpeg|thumb|right|Cranberry harvest in [[New Jersey]]]]
Cranberries are a major commercial crop in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Missouri]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Jersey]], [[Oregon]], [[Tennessee]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin]], as well as in the Canadian provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Ontario]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Quebec]]. According to the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, Wisconsin is the leading producer of cranberries, with over half of U.S. production. Massachusetts is the second largest U.S. producer, with 28% of total domestic production. A very small production is found in southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Eastern Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Historically, cranberry beds were constructed in wetlands. Currently cranberry beds are constructed in upland areas that have a shallow water table. The topsoil is scraped off to form [[dyke (construction)|dyke]]s around the bed perimeter. Clean sand is hauled in to a depth of four to eight inches. The surface is laser leveled flat to provide even drainage. Beds are frequently drained with socked tile in addition to the perimeter ditch. In addition to making it possible to hold water, the dykes allow equipment to service the beds without driving on the vines. Irrigation equipment is installed in the bed to provide [[irrigation]] for vine growth and for spring and autumn frost protection.

=== Cultivation ===
Cranberry vines are propagated by moving vines from an established bed. The vines are spread on the surface of the sand of the new bed and pushed into the sand with a blunt disk. The vines are watered frequently during the first few weeks until roots form and new shoots grow. Beds are given frequent light application of nitrogen fertilizer during the first year. The cost of establishment for new cranberry beds is estimated to be about US$70,000 per hectare (approx. $28,300 per acre).

A common misconception about cranberry production is that the beds remain flooded throughout the year. During the [[growing season]] cranberry beds are not flooded, but are irrigated regularly to maintain soil moisture. Beds are flooded in the autumn to facilitate harvest and again during the winter to protect against low temperatures. In cold climates like Wisconsin, Maine, and eastern Canada, the winter flood typically freezes into ice, while in warmer climates the water remains liquid. When ice forms on the beds, trucks can be driven onto the ice to spread a thin layer of sand that helps to control pests and rejuvenate the vines. Sanding is done every three to five years.

=== Harvesting ===
[[File:Harvesting cranberries 2.jpg|thumb|Cranberry harvest (wet-picking)]]
Cranberries are harvested in the fall when the fruit takes on its distinctive deep red color. This is usually in September through the first part of November. To harvest cranberries, the beds are flooded with six to eight inches of water above the vines. A harvester is driven through the beds to remove the fruit from the vines. For the past 50 years, water reel type harvesters have been used. Harvested cranberries float in the water and can be corralled into a corner of the bed and conveyed or pumped from the bed. From the farm, cranberries are taken to receiving stations where they are cleaned, sorted, and stored prior to packaging or processing.

Although most cranberries are wet-picked as described above, 5–10% of the US crop is still dry-picked. This entails higher labor costs and lower yield, but dry-picked berries are less bruised and can be sold as fresh fruit instead of having to be immediately frozen or processed. Originally performed with two-handed comb scoops, dry picking is today accomplished by motorized, walk-behind harvesters which must be small enough to traverse beds without damaging the vines.

White [[cranberry juice]] is made from regular cranberries that have been harvested after the fruits are mature, but before they have attained their characteristic dark red color. Yields are lower on beds harvested early and the early flooding tends to damage vines, but not severely.

Cranberries for fresh market are stored in shallow bins or boxes with perforated or slatted bottoms, which deter decay by allowing air to circulate. Because harvest occurs in late autumn, cranberries for fresh market are frequently stored in thick walled barns without mechanical refrigeration. Temperatures are regulated by opening and closing vents in the barn as needed. Cranberries destined for processing are usually frozen in bulk containers shortly after arriving at a receiving station.

== Food uses ==
[[File:cranberries20101210.jpg|thumb|Cranberries]]
About 95% of cranberries are processed into products such as [[cranberry juice|juice drinks]], sauce, and sweetened dried cranberries. The remaining 5% are sold fresh to consumers.

Cranberries are normally considered too sharp to be eaten plain and raw, as they are not only sour but bitter as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | authorlink =  | title = Eat this!

Cranberry juice is a major use of cranberries; it is usually either sweetened to make &quot;cranberry juice cocktail&quot; or blended with other fruit juices to reduce its natural severe tartness. Many cocktails, including the [[Cosmopolitan (cocktail)|Cosmopolitan]], are made with cranberry juice.

Usually cranberries as fruit are cooked into a [[compote]] or [[jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]], known as [[cranberry sauce]]. Such preparations are traditionally served with roast [[Domesticated turkey|turkey]], as a staple of English Christmas dinners, and the [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Canadian]] and [[Holidays of the United States|US holiday]] [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The berry is also used in baking ([[muffin]]s, [[scones]] and [[cake]]s). Less commonly, innovative cooks use cranberries to add tartness to savory dishes such as soups and stews.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot; /&gt;

Fresh cranberries can be frozen at home, and will keep up to nine months; they can be used directly in recipes without thawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.wisc.edu/content.php?pid=87646&amp;sid=652165 |title=The American Cranberry-Basic Information on Cranberries |publisher=Library.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cranberry wine]] is made in some of the cranberry-growing regions of the United States from either whole cranberries, cranberry juice or cranberry juice concentrate.

=== Phytochemicals ===
Raw cranberries are a source of [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s, [[phytochemical]]s under active research for possible benefits to the [[cardiovascular system]] and [[immune system]], and as anti-[[cancer]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seifried HE, Anderson DE, Fisher EI, Milner JA |title=A review of the interaction among dietary antioxidants and reactive oxygen species |journal=J Nutr Biochem. |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=567–79 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17360173 |doi=10.1016/j.jnutbio.2006.10.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Halliwell B 2007 341–7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Halliwell B |title=Dietary polyphenols: good, bad, or indifferent for your health? |journal=Cardiovasc Res. |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=341–7 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17141749 |doi=10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on [[in-vitro]] prostate cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean MA, Scott BE, Deziel BA, Nunnelley MC, Liberty AM, Gottschall-Pass KT, Neto CC, Hurta RA&quot;North American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) stimulates apoptotic pathways in DU145 human prostate cancer cells in vitro.&quot;  Nutr Cancer. 2011 Jan;63(1):109-20  &lt;/ref&gt;
Although [[polyphenol]]s have powerful antioxidant effects [[in vitro]], they can act as pro-oxidants in others. {{Clarify|date=April 2011|Reason=in other what???}} In addition, the health benefits of diets rich in plant-derived foods and beverages is uncertain, and the overall health benefit antioxidants is uncertain, and consumption of large quantities of them in fortified foods or supplements should not yet be encouraged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halliwell B 2007 341–7&quot;/&gt;

Research shows that an effect occurs from a component of the juice inhibiting bacterial attachment to the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[urethra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-07/wpi-cjc072108.php |title=Cranberry juice creates energy barrier that keeps bacteria away from cells, study shows |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news77194887.html |title=Compounds in cranberry juice show promise as alternatives to antibiotics |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2006-09-11 |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080721152005.htm |title=How Cranberry Juice Can Prevent Urinary Tract Infections |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2008-07-25 |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although promising for anti-bacterial activity, long-term consumption of cranberry juice has not been proven to reduce urinary tract infections in whole populations. However, there is limited evidence for beneficial effects against [[urinary tract infections]] in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jepson RG, Mihaljevic L, Craig J |editor1-last=Jepson |editor1-first=Ruth |title=Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=2 |pages=CD001321 |year=2004 |pmid=15106157 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001321.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been observed to have a relaxing effect, reducing stress. Similar applications have not been successfully proven in other clinical trials of consuming cranberry juice or tablets by people with spinal cord injury associated with bladder [[catheterization]], [[neurogenic bladder]] or infrequent [[urination]], any of which may be associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Linsenmeyer TA, Harrison B, Oakley A, Kirshblum S, Stock JA, Millis SR |title=Evaluation of cranberry supplement for reduction of urinary tract infections in individuals with neurogenic bladders secondary to spinal cord injury.

=== Possible contraindications ===
An autumn 2004 caution from the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]], the UK agency dealing with drug safety, advised patients taking [[warfarin]] not to drink cranberry juice after adverse effects (such as increased incidence of bruising) were reported, possibly resulting from the presence of [[salicylic acid]] native to polyphenol-rich plants such as the cranberry. However, during 2006-8, several reviews of case reports and pilot studies have failed to confirm this effect, collectively indicating no statistically significant interaction between daily consumption of 250 mL cranberry juice and warfarin in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Li Z, Seeram NP, Carpenter CL, Thames G, Minutti C, Bowerman S |title=Cranberry does not affect prothrombin time in male subjects on warfarin |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=106 |issue=12 |pages=2057–61 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17126638 |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2006.09.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pham DQ, Pham AQ |title=Interaction potential between cranberry juice and warfarin |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=490–4 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17322161 |doi=10.2146/ajhp060370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A gene (VKORC1, CYP2C9) has been shown to change warfarin sensitivity. This gene may also contribute to bruising susceptibility as a result of cranberries for carriers of the gene.

=== History ===
{{globalize|date=November 2010}}

In 1550, James White Norwood made reference to indians using cranberries. In James Rosier's book &quot;The Land of Virginia&quot; there is an account of Europeans coming ashore and being met with indians bearing bark cups full of cranberries. In Plymouth, Massachusetts, there is a 1633 account of the husband of Mary Ring auctioning her cranberry-dyed petticoat for 16 shillings. In 1640's &quot;Key Into the Language&quot; [[Roger Williams]] described cranberries, referring to them as &quot;bearberries&quot; because bears ate them. In 1648, preacher [[John Elliott]] was quoted in [[Thomas Shepherd]]'s book &quot;Clear Sunshine of the Gospel&quot; with an account of the difficulties the Pilgrims were having in using the indians to harvest cranberries as they preferred to hunt and fish. In 1663, the Pilgrim cookbook appears with a recipe for cranberry sauce. In 1667, New Englanders sent to [[King Charles]] 10 barrels of cranberries, 3 barrels of codfish and some indian corn as a means of appeasement for his anger over their local coining of the Pine Tree shilling. In 1669, Captain Richard Cobb had a banquet in his house (to celebrate both his marriage to Mary Gorham and his election to the Convention of Assistance), serving wild turkey with sauce made from wild cranberries. In the 1672 book &quot;New England Rarities Discovered&quot; author John Josselyn described cranberries, writing: &quot;Sauce for the Pilgrims, cranberry or bearberry, is a small trayling plant that grows in salt marshes that are overgrown with moss.  The berries are of a pale yellow color, afterwards red, as big as a cherry, some perfectly round, others oval, all of them hollow with sower (sic) astringent taste; they are ripe in August and September.  They are excellent against the Scurvy.  They are also good to allay the fervor of hoof diseases.  The indians and English use them mush, boyling (sic) them with sugar for sauce to eat with their meat; and it is a delicate sauce, especially with roasted mutton.  Some make tarts with them as with gooseberries.&quot;  &quot;The Compleat Cook's Guide&quot; published in 1683 made reference to cranberry juice. In 1703, cranberries were served at the Harvard University commencement dinner. In 1787, [[James Madison]] wrote [[Thomas Jefferson]] in France for background information on constitutional government to use at the Constitutional Convention. Jefferson sent back a number of books on the subject and in return asked for a gift of apples, pecans and cranberries. In 1796, cranberries were served at the first celebration of the landing of the Pilgrims, and Amelia Simmons (an American orphan) wrote a book entitled &quot;American Cookery&quot; which contained a recipe for cranberry tarts. In 1816, [[Henry Hall]] first comercially grew cranberries in East Dennis, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. In 1843, [[Eli Howes]] planted his own crop of cranberries on Cape Cod, using the &quot;Howes&quot; variety. In 1847, Cyrus Cahoon planted a crop of &quot;Early Black&quot; variety near Pleasant Lake, Harwich, Massachusetts. In 1860, [[Edward Watson]], a friend of [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote a poem called &quot;The Cranberry Tart.&quot;

Cranberry sales in the United States have traditionally been associated with [[public holiday|holidays]] of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]]. Until the 1930s most of the crop was sold fresh.

In the U.S., large scale cranberry cultivation has been developed as opposed to other countries. American cranberry growers have a long history of cooperative [[marketing]]. As early as 1904, John Gaynor, a [[Wisconsin]] grower, and A.U. Chaney, a fruit broker from [[Des Moines, Iowa]], organized Wisconsin growers into a cooperative called the Wisconsin Cranberry Sales Company to receive a uniform price from buyers. Growers in [[New Jersey]] and [[Massachusetts]] were also organized into cooperatives, creating the National Fruit Exchange that marketed fruit under the [[Eatmor]] [[brand]]. The success of cooperative marketing almost led to its failure. With consistent and high prices, area and production doubled between 1903 and 1917 and prices fell. In 1918, [[US$]]54,000 was spent on advertising, leading to US$1 million in increased sales.

With surplus cranberries and changing American households some enterprising growers began [[canning]] cranberries that were below-grade for fresh market. [[Competition]] between canners was fierce because [[profit (accounting)|profits]] were thin. The [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] cooperative was established in 1930 through a merger of three primary processing companies: Ocean Spray Preserving company, Makepeace Preserving Co, and Cranberry Products Co. The new company was called Cranberry Canners, Inc. and used the Ocean Spray label on their products. Since the new company represented over 90% of the market, it would have been illegal (cf. [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]]) had [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] John Quarles not found an exemption for [[agricultural cooperative]]s. As of 2006, about 65% of the North American industry belongs to the Ocean Spray cooperative. (The percentage may be slightly higher in Canada than in the U.S.)

A turning point for the industry occurred on November 9, 1959, when the secretary of the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] [[Arthur S. Flemming]] announced that some of the 1959 crop was tainted with traces of the [[herbicide]] [[aminotriazole]]. The market for cranberries collapsed and growers lost millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehound.net/19870404/mp3s/start12.mp3 |title=&quot;Cranberry Blues&quot; 1959 recording (mp3 file) by Robert Williams and the Groovers |date= |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scare taught the industry that they could not be completely dependent on the holiday market for their products: they had to find year-round markets for their fruit. They also had to be exceedingly careful about their use of [[pesticide]]s.

After the aminotriazole scare, Ocean Spray reorganized and spent substantial sums on [[product development]]. New products such as cranberry apple [[juice]] blends were introduced, followed by other juice blends.

A [[Federal Marketing Order]] that is authorized to synchronize supply and demand was approved in 1962. The order has been renewed and modified slightly in subsequent years, but it has allowed for more stable marketing. The market order has been invoked during six crop years: 1962 (12%), 1963 (5%), 1970 (10%), 1971 (12%), 2000 (15%), and 2001 (35%). Even though supply still slightly exceeds demand, there is little will to invoke the Federal Marketing Order out of the realization that any pullback in supply by U.S. growers would easily be filled by Canadian production.

Prices and production increased steadily during the 1980s and 1990s. Prices peaked at about $65.00 per barrel (29&amp;nbsp;¢/kg—A cranberry barrel equals 100 pounds or 45.4&amp;nbsp;kg.) in 1996 then fell to $18.00 per barrel (8.2&amp;nbsp;¢/kg) in 2001. The cause for the precipitous drop was classic oversupply. Production had outpaced consumption leading to substantial inventory in freezers or as concentrate.

Cranberry handlers (processors) include [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]], [[Cliffstar|Cliffstar Corporation]], Northland Cranberries Inc.[Sun Northland LLC], Clement Pappas &amp; Co., Decas Cranberry Products as well as a number of small handlers and processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roper TR, Vorsa N |chapter=Cranberry: Botany and Horticulture |editor=Janick J |title=Horticultural Reviews |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=215–6 |isbn=0-471-18907-3 |url=http://www.pubhort.org/hr/hr21/HR_21_07_00000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code coverage''' is a measure used in [[software testing]].  It describes the degree to which the [[source code]] of a [[computer program|program]] has been tested.  It is a form of testing that inspects the code directly and is therefore a form of [[white box testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolawa | first = Adam | coauthors = Huizinga, Dorota | title = Automated Defect Prevention: Best Practices in Software Management |  url = http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470042125.html | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press | location =| page=254| pages =426 | isbn = 0470042125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, the use of code coverage has been extended to the field of [[digital hardware]], the contemporary design methodology of which relies on [[hardware description language]]s (HDLs).

Code coverage was among the first methods invented for systematic software testing.  The first published reference was by Miller and Maloney in ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Code coverage is one consideration in the safety certification of avionics equipment.  The standard by which avionics gear is certified by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) is documented in [[DO-178B]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DO-178B&quot;&gt;RTCA/[[DO-178B]], ''Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics,'' December 1, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage criteria==
To measure how well the program is exercised by a [[test suite]], one or more ''coverage criteria'' are used. 

=== Basic coverage criteria ===
There are a number of  coverage criteria, the main ones being:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Glenford J. Myers | title=The Art of Software Testing, 2nd edition |publisher=Wiley | year=2004| id=ISBN 0471469122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Function coverage''' - Has each function (or [[subroutine]]) in the program been called?
* '''Statement coverage''' - Has each [[Graph theory|node]] in the program been executed?
* '''Decision coverage''' (not the same as '''branch coverage'''.&lt;ref name =&quot;Position Paper CAST10&quot;&gt;Position Paper CAST-10 (June 2002). ''[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/cast/cast_papers/media/cast-10.pdf What is a “Decision” in Application of Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) and Decision Coverage (DC)?]''&lt;/ref&gt;) - Has every [[Graph theory|edge]] in the program been executed?  For instance, have the requirements of each branch of each control structure (such as in [[Conditional (programming)|IF and CASE statements]]) been met as well as not met?
* '''Condition coverage''' (or predicate coverage) - Has each boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false? This does not necessarily imply decision coverage.
* '''Condition/decision coverage''' - Both decision and condition coverage should be satisfied.

For example, consider the following C++ function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int foo(int x, int y)
{
    int z = 0;
    if ((x&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (y&gt;0)) {
        z = x;
    }
    return z;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Assume this function is a part of some bigger program and this program was run with some test suite. 
* If during this execution function 'foo' was called at least once, then ''function coverage'' for this function is satisfied. 
* ''Statement coverage'' for this function will be satisfied if it was called e.g. as &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;, as in this case, every line in the function is executed including &lt;code&gt;z = x;&lt;/code&gt;.
* Tests calling &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foo(0,1)&lt;/code&gt; will satisfy ''decision coverage'', as in the first case the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition and the [[Short-circuit evaluation|short circuit]] condition are satisfied and &lt;code&gt;z = x;&lt;/code&gt; is executed, and in the second neither conditional is satisfied and x is not assigned to z.
* ''Condition coverage'' can be satisfied with tests that call &lt;code&gt;foo(1,1)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;foo(1,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foo(0,0)&lt;/code&gt;. These are necessary as in the first two cases &lt;code&gt;(x&gt;0)&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; while in the third it evaluates &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. At the same time, the first case makes &lt;code&gt;(y&gt;0)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; while the second and third make it &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

In languages, like [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], where standard boolean operations are not [[Short-circuit evaluation|short circuited]], condition coverage does not necessarily imply decision coverage. For example, consider the following fragment of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
if a and b then
&lt;/source&gt;
Condition coverage can be satisfied by two tests:
* &lt;code&gt;a=true&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b=false&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;a=false&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b=true&lt;/code&gt;
However, this set of tests does not satisfy decision coverage as in neither case will the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition be met.

[[Fault injection]] may be necessary to ensure that all conditions and branches of [[exception handling]] code have adequate coverage during testing.

=== Modified condition/decision coverage ===
For [[safety-critical]] applications (e.g., for avionics software) it is often required that '''[[Modified Condition/Decision Coverage|modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC)]]''' is satisifed. This criteria extends condition/decision criteria with requirements that each condition should affect the decision outcome independently. For example, consider the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
if (a or b) and c then
&lt;/source&gt;
The condition/decision criteria will be satisfied by the following set of tests:
* a=true, b=true, c=true
* a=false, b=false, c=false
However, the above tests set will not satisfy modified condition/decision coverage, since in the first test, the value of 'b' and in the second test the value of 'c' would not influence the output. So, the following test set is needed to satisfy MC/DC:
* a='''false''', b='''false''', c=true
* a='''true''',  b=false, c='''true'''
* a=false, b='''true''',  c='''true'''
* a=true,  b=true,  c='''false'''
The bold values influence the output, each variable must be present as an influencing value at least once with false and once with true.

=== Multiple condition coverage ===
This criteria requires that all combinations of conditions inside each decision are tested. For example, the code fragment from the previous section will require eight tests:
* a=false, b=false, c=false
* a=false, b=false, c=true
* a=false, b=true, c=false
* a=false, b=true, c=true
* a=true, b=false, c=false
* a=true, b=false, c=true
* a=true, b=true, c=false
* a=true, b=true, c=true

=== Other coverage criteria ===
There are further coverage criteria, which are used less often:
* '''[[Linear Code Sequence and Jump]] (LCSAJ) coverage''' - has every LCSAJ been executed?
* '''JJ-Path coverage''' - have all jump to jump paths &lt;ref name=&quot;On the relationship between two control-flow coverage criteria: all JJ-paths and MCDC&quot;&gt;M. R. Woodward, M. A. Hennell, &quot;On the relationship between two control-flow coverage criteria: all JJ-paths and MCDC&quot;, Information and Software Technology 48 (2006) pp. 433-440&lt;/ref&gt; (aka LCSAJs) been executed?
* '''Path coverage''' - Has every possible route through a given part of the code been executed?
* '''Entry/exit coverage''' - Has every possible call and return of the function been executed?
* '''Loop coverage''' - Has every possible loop been executed zero times, once, and more than once?

[[Safety-critical]] applications are often required to demonstrate that testing achieves 100% of some form of code coverage.

Some of the coverage criteria above are connected. For instance, path coverage implies decision, statement and entry/exit coverage. Decision coverage implies statement coverage, because every statement is part of a branch.

Full path coverage, of the type described above, is usually impractical or impossible. Any module with a succession of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; decisions in it can have up to &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; paths within it; loop constructs can result in an infinite number of paths.  Many paths may also be infeasible, in that there is no input to the program under test that can cause that particular path to be executed.  However, a general-purpose algorithm for identifying infeasible paths has been proven to be impossible (such an algorithm could be used to solve the [[halting problem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dorf, Richard C.: ''Computers, Software Engineering, and Digital Devices'', Chapter 12, pg. 15. CRC Press, 2006. ISBN 0849373409, 9780849373404; via [http://books.google.com/books?id=jykvlTCoksMC&amp;pg=PT386&amp;lpg=PT386&amp;dq=%22infeasible+path%22+%22halting+problem%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=WUWz3qMPRv&amp;sig=dSAjrLHBSZJcKWZfGa_IxYlfSNA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google Book Search]&lt;/ref&gt;  Methods for practical path coverage testing instead attempt to identify classes of code paths that differ only in the number of loop executions, and to achieve &quot;basis path&quot; coverage the tester must cover all the path classes.

==In practice==
The target software is built with special options or libraries and/or run under a special environment such that every function that is exercised (executed) in the program(s) is mapped back to the function points in the source code. This process allows developers and quality assurance personnel to look for parts of a system that are rarely or never accessed under normal conditions (error handling and the like) and helps reassure test engineers that the most important conditions (function points) have been tested.  The resulting output is then analyzed to see what areas of code have not been exercised and the tests are updated to include these areas as necessary.  Combined with other code coverage methods, the aim is to develop a rigorous, yet manageable, set of regression tests.

In implementing code coverage policies within a software development environment one must consider the following:

*  What are coverage requirements for the end product certification and if so what level of code coverage is required?  The typical level of rigor progression is as follows: Statement, Branch/Decision, [[Modified Condition/Decision Coverage]](MC/DC), LCSAJ ([[Linear Code Sequence and Jump]])
*  Will code coverage be measured against tests that verify requirements levied on the system under test ([[DO-178B]])?
*  Is the object code generated directly traceable to source code statements?  Certain certifications, (i.e. DO-178B Level A) require coverage at the assembly level if this is not the case: &quot;Then, additional verification should be performed on the object code to establish the correctness of such generated code sequences&quot; ([[DO-178B]]) para-6.4.4.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;DO-178B&quot; /&gt;

Test engineers can look at code coverage test results to help them devise test cases and input or configuration sets that will increase the code coverage over vital functions. Two common forms of code coverage used by testers are statement (or line) coverage and path (or edge) coverage. Line coverage reports on the execution footprint of testing in terms of which lines of code were executed to complete the test. Edge coverage reports which branches or code decision points were executed to complete the test. They both report a coverage metric, measured as a percentage.  The meaning of this depends on what form(s) of code coverage have been used, as 67% path coverage is more comprehensive than 67% statement coverage.

Generally, code coverage tools and [[library (computing)|libraries]] exact a performance and/or memory or other resource cost which is unacceptable to normal operations of the software. Thus, they are only used in the lab. As one might expect, there are classes of software that cannot be feasibly subjected to these coverage tests, though a degree of coverage mapping can be approximated through analysis rather than direct testing.

There are also some sorts of defects which are affected by such tools. In particular, some [[race condition]]s or similar [[Real-time computing|real time]] sensitive operations can be masked when run under code coverage environments; and conversely, some of these defects may become easier to find as a result of the additional overhead of the testing code.

'''Caitlin Clarke''' (May 3, 1952 – September 9, 2004) was an American [[theater]] and [[film]] actress best known for her role as Valerian in the 1981 fantasy film ''[[Dragonslayer]]'' and for her role as Charlotte Cardoza in the 1998–1999 [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Titanic (musical)|Titanic]]''.

==Biography==
Clarke was born '''Katherine Anne Clarke''' in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], the oldest of five sisters, the youngest of whom is [[Victoria Clarke]].  Her family moved to [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania|Sewickley]] when she was ten.

Clarke received her B.A. in theater arts from [[Mount Holyoke College]] in 1974 and her M.F.A. from the [[Yale School of Drama]] in 1978.  During her final year at Yale Clarke performed with the [[Yale Repertory Theater]] in such plays as [[Tales from the Vienna Woods]].

The first few years of Clarke's professional career were largely theatrical, apart from her role in [[Dragonslayer]]. After appearing in three [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] plays in 1985, Clarke moved to [[Los Angeles]] for several years as a [[film]] and [[television]] actress. She returned to [[theater]] in the early 1990s, and to [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] as Charlotte Cardoza in ''[[Titanic (musical)|Titanic]]''.

Clarke was diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]] in 2000. She returned to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to teach [[theater]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and at the [http://www.pittsburghmusicals.com/] Pittsburgh Musical Theater's [http://www.pittsburghmusicals.com/company/rerc.php] Rauh Conservatory until her death on September 9, 2004.

[[Image:USS Port Royal CG-73.jpg|thumb|250px|right|{{USS|Port Royal|CG-73}}, a {{sclass|Ticonderoga|cruiser|0}} [[guided missile]] cruiser, launched in 1992.]]

A '''cruiser''' is a type of [[warship]]. The term has been in use for several hundreds of years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the [[Age of Sail]], the term 'cruiser' reflected a type of mission - independent scouting, raiding or commerce protection - fulfilled by a [[frigate]] or [[sloop]], which were the 'cruising warships' of a fleet. 

From the middle of the 19th century, 'cruiser' came to be a classification for the ships intended for this kind of role, though cruisers came in a wide variety of sizes, from the small [[protected cruiser]] to [[armoured cruiser]]s which were as large (though not as powerful) as a [[battleship]]. 

By the early 20th century, cruisers could be placed on a consistent scale of warship size, smaller than a [[battleship]] but larger than a [[destroyer]]. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty placed a formal limit on cruisers, which were defined as warships of up to 10,000 tons displacement carrying guns no larger than 8&amp;nbsp;inches in calibre. These limits shaped cruisers up until the end of World War II. The very large [[battlecruisers]] of the World War I era were now classified, along with battleships, as [[capital ships]]. 

In the later 20th century, the obsolescence of the [[battleship]] left the cruiser as the largest and most powerful surface combatant. The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defence, commerce raiding and shore bombardment. The U.S. Navy in the Cold War period built guided-missile cruisers primarily designed to provide air defence, while the navy of the USSR built cruisers with heavy anti-ship missiles designed to sink NATO carrier task forces.

Currently only three nations, the [[United States Navy|United States]], [[Russian Navy|Russia]], and [[Peruvian Navy|Peru]] ([[BAP Almirante Grau (CLM-81)]] while still in service with the Peruvian Navy), operate cruisers, though the line between cruisers and destroyers is once again blurred. New models of destroyers (for instance the [[Zumwalt class destroyer|''Zumwalt'' class]] or [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'' class]]) are often larger and more powerful than cruiser classes they replace.

==Early history==
The term &quot;cruiser&quot; or &quot;cruizer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The alternative spelling could be found at least as late as 1900: [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] wrote &quot;We a require an increase.... in all classes of cruizer&quot; in a letter dated 20th Feb 1900. Mackay, R. ''Fisher of Kilverstone'', p.242&lt;/ref&gt; was first commonly used in the 17th century to refer to an independent warship. &quot;Cruiser&quot; meant the purpose or mission of a ship, rather than a category of vessel. However, the term was nonetheless used to mean a smaller, faster warship suitable for such a role. In the 17th century, the [[ship of the line]] was generally too large, inflexible, and expensive to be dispatched on long-range missions (for instance, to the Americas), and too strategically important to be put at risk of fouling and foundering by continual patrol duties.

The [[Dutch navy]] was noted for its cruisers in the 17th century, while the [[Royal Navy]]—and later French and Spanish navies—subsequently caught up in terms of their numbers and deployment. The British [[Cruiser and Convoy Act]]s were an attempt by mercantile interests in Parliament to focus the Navy on commerce defence and raiding with cruisers, rather than the more scarce and expensive ships of the line.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodger, N. A. M.]]: ''The Command of the Ocean, A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815''. Allen Lane, London, 2004. ISBN 0-7139-9411-8&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century the [[frigate]] became the preeminent type of cruiser. A frigate was a small, fast, long range, lightly armed (single gun-deck) ship used for scouting, carrying dispatches, and disrupting enemy trade. The other principal type of cruiser was the [[sloop]], but many other miscellaneous types of ship were used as well.

==Steam cruisers==
During the 19th century, fleets began to use steam power for their navies. The 1840s saw the construction of experimental steam-powered frigates and sloops. By the middle of the 1850s, the British and U.S. Navies were both building steam frigates with very long hulls and a heavy gun armament, for instance [[USS Merrimack|USS ''Merrimack'']] or [[HMS Mersey (1858)|HMS ''Mersey'']].&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1860s saw the introduction of the [[ironclad]]. The first ironclads were frigates, in the sense of having one gun deck; however, they were also clearly the most powerful ships in the navy, and were principally to serve in the line of battle. In spite of their great speed, they would have been wasted in a cruising role.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

The French constructed a number of smaller ironclads for overseas cruising duties, starting with the {{ship|French ship|Belliqueuse||2}}, commissioned 1865. These &quot;station ironclads&quot; were the beginning of the development of the [[armored cruiser]]s, a type of ironclad specifically for the traditional cruiser missions of fast, independent, raiding and patrol. 

The first true armored cruiser was the Russian [[Russian cruiser General-Admiral (1873)|''General-Admiral'']], completed in 1874, and followed by the British [[HMS Shannon (1875)|''Shannon'']] a few years later.

Until the 1890s armored cruisers were still built with masts for a full sailing rig, to enable them to operate far from friendly coaling stations.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Richard: ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age''. Cassell, London, 2000. ISBN 0-304-35273-X&lt;/ref&gt;

Unarmored cruising warships, built out of wood, iron, steel or a combination of those materials, remained popular until towards the end of the 19th century. The ironclad's armor often meant that they were limited to  short range under steam, and many ironclads were unsuited to long-range missions or for work in distant colonies. The unarmored cruiser - often a [[screw sloop]] or [[screw frigate]] - could continue in this role. Even though mid- or late-19th century cruisers typically carried up-to-date guns firing explosive shells, they were unable to face ironclads in combat. This was evidenced by the clash between {{HMS|Shah|1873|6}}, a modern British cruiser, and the Peruvian [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] ''[[Huáscar (ship)|Huáscar]]''. Even though the Dutch  vessel was obsolescent by the time of the encounter, it stood up well to roughly 50 hits from British shells.

==Steel cruisers==
{{main|Protected cruiser}}
[[Image:Croiseur Aurore.png|thumb|The Russian protected cruiser [[Russian cruiser Aurora|''Aurora'']]]]
In the 1880s naval architects began to use [[steel]] as a material for construction and armament. A steel cruiser could be lighter and faster than one built of iron or wood. The [[Jeune Ecole]] school of naval doctrine suggested that a fleet of fast unprotected steel cruisers were ideal for [[commerce raiding]], while the [[torpedo boat]] would be able to destroy an enemy battleship fleet.

Steel also offered the cruiser a way of acquiring the protection needed to survive in combat. Steel armor was considerably stronger, for the same weight, than iron. By putting a relatively thin layer of steel armor above the vital parts of the ship, and by placing the coal bunkers where they might stop shellfire, a useful degree of protection could be achieved without slowing the ship too much.

The first protected cruiser was the Chilean ship [[Japanese cruiser Izumi|''Esmeralda'']]. Produced by a shipyard at [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]], in Britain, owned by Armstrong, she inspired a group of protected cruisers produced in the same yard and known as the &quot;Elswick cruisers&quot;. Her [[forecastle]], [[poop deck]] and the wooden board deck had been removed, replaced with an armored deck. 

''Esmeralda's'' armament consisted of fore and aft 10-inch (25.4&amp;nbsp;cm) guns and 6-inch (15.2&amp;nbsp;cm) guns in the midships positions. It could reach a speed of {{convert|18|kn|km/h|0}}, and was propelled by steam alone. It also had a displacement of less than 3,000 tons. During the two following decades, this cruiser type came to be the inspiration for combining heavy artillery, high speed and low displacement.

===Pre-dreadnought armored cruisers===
Steel also had an impact on the construction and role of armored cruisers. Steel meant that new designs of battleship, later known as [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, would be able to combine firepower and armor with better endurance and speed than ever before. The armored cruisers of the 1890s greatly resembled the battleships of the day; they tended to carry slightly smaller main armament ({{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on}} rather than 12-inch) and have somewhat thinner armor in exchange for a faster speed (perhaps {{convert|21|kn|km/h}} rather than 18). Because of their similarity, the lines between battleships and armored cruisers became blurred.

==Cruisers from 1900 to 1914==

Shortly after the turn of the 20th century there were difficult questions about the design of future cruisers. Modern armored cruisers, almost as powerful as battleships, were also fast enough to outrun older protected and unarmored cruisers. In the Royal Navy, [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] cut back hugely on older vessels, including many cruisers of different sorts, calling them 'a miser's hoard of useless junk' that any modern cruiser would sweep from the seas.

===Battlecruisers===
{{main|Battlecruiser}}
[[Image:HMS Repulse (1919) profile drawing.png|thumb|200px|right|HMS ''Repulse'' in 1919.]]
The growing size and power of the armored cruiser resulted in the [[battlecruiser]], with an armament and size similar to the revolutionary new [[dreadnought battleship]], was the brainchild of British admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]]. He believed that to ensure British naval dominance in its overseas colonial possessions, a fleet of large, fast, powerfully-armed vessels which would be able to hunt down and mop up enemy cruisers and armored cruisers with overwhelming fire superiority was needed. These vessels came to be known as the '''battlecruiser''', and the first were commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1907. Germany and eventually Japan followed suit to build these vessels, replacing armored cruisers in most front line roles.

===Light cruisers===
[[Image:HMS Caroline 1914.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Caroline|1914|6}}, a [[World War I]] era light cruiser, still serves as a headquarters and training vessel in [[Belfast]].]]
{{main|Light cruiser}}
At around the same time as the battlecruiser was developed, the distinction between the armored and the unarmored cruiser finally disappeared. By the British [[Town class cruiser (1910)|''Town''-class cruiser (1910)]], it was possible for a small, fast cruiser to carry both belt and deck armor, particularly when turbine engines were adopted. These 'light armored cruisers' began to occupy the traditional cruiser role once it became clear that the battlecruiser squadrons were required to operate with the battle fleet.

===Flotilla leaders===
{{main|Flotilla leader}}
Some light cruisers were built specifically to act as the leaders of flotillas of [[destroyer]]s.

===Auxiliary cruisers===
{{main|Auxiliary cruiser}}
The [[Armed merchantmen|auxiliary cruiser]] was a [[merchant marine|merchant ship]] hastily armed with small guns on the outbreak of war. Auxiliary cruisers were used to fill gaps in their long-range lines or provide escort for other cargo ships, although they generally proved to be useless in this role because of their low speed, feeble firepower and lack of armor. In both world wars the Germans also used small merchant ships armed with cruiser guns to surprise Allied merchant ships. 

Some large liners were armed in the same way. In British service these were known as Armed Merchant Cruisers (AMC). The Germans and French used them in World War I as raiders because of their high speed (around 30&amp;nbsp;knots (56&amp;nbsp;km/h)), and they were used again as raiders in World War II by the Germans and Japanese. In both the First World War and in the early part of the Second, they were used as convoy escorts by the British.

==World War I==
{{main|Naval warfare of World War I}}
Cruisers were one of the workhorse types of ship of World War I.

==Cruisers from 1919-1945==
[[Image:Armando Diaz AllenGren3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Italian cruiser ''[[Armando Diaz]]'' of the [[Regia Marina]].]]
Naval construction in the 1920s and 1930s was limited by international treaties designed to prevent the repetition of the [[Dreadnought]] arms race of the early 20th century. The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 placed limits on the construction of ships with a displacement of 10,000 [[ton]]s or more and an armament of greater than {{convert|8|in|mm|sing=on}} calibre. A number of navies commissioned classes of cruisers at the top end of this limit. 

The [[London Naval Treaty]] in 1930 then formalised the distinction between these 'heavy' cruisers and light cruisers: a 'heavy' cruiser was one with guns of {{convert|6.1|in|mm|sing=on}} calibre or more.  The [[Second London Naval Treaty]] attempted to reduce the tonnage of new cruisers to 8,000 or less, but this had little impact; Japan and Germany were not signatories, and navies had already begun to evade treaty limitations on warships.

===Heavy cruisers===
{{see also|Heavy cruisers}}
The '''heavy cruiser''' was a type of cruiser, a naval [[warship]] designed for long range, high speed and an armament of naval guns roughly {{convert|8|in|mm|sing=on}} in calibre. The first heavy cruisers were built in 1915, although it only became a widespread classification following the London Naval Treaty in 1930. The heavy cruiser's immediate precursors were the [[light cruiser]] designs of the 1910s and 1920s; the US 8-inch 'treaty cruisers' of the 1920s were originally classed as light cruisers until the London Treaty forced their redesignation. Heavy cruisers continued in use until after World War II.

===The German pocket battleships===
The German {{sclass|Deutschland|cruiser|0}} was a series of three ''Panzerschiffe'' (&quot;armored ships&quot;), a form of heavily armed cruiser, built by the [[Reichsmarine|German Reichsmarine]] in accordance with restrictions imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The class is named after the first ship of this class to be completed (the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Deutschland||2}}). All three ships were launched between 1931 and 1934, and served with Germany's [[Kriegsmarine]] during [[World War II]].

The [[United Kingdom|British]] began referring to the vessels as pocket battleships, in reference to the heavy firepower contained in the relatively small vessels; they were considerably smaller than [[battleship]]s and [[battlecruisers]], and although their displacement was that of a [[heavy cruiser]], they were armed with guns larger than the heavy cruisers of other nations. ''Deutschland''-class ships continue to be called ''pocket battleships'' in some circles. The ships were actually two feet longer than the American {{sclass|Pennsylvania|battleship|0}} - although the latter was unusually stubby for a modern battleship.

''Deutschland''-class ships were initially classified as ''Panzerschiffe'', but the [[Kriegsmarine]] reclassified them as heavy cruisers in February 1940.

===Anti-aircraft cruisers===
[[Image:USS Atlanta (CL-51).jpg|thumb|[[USS Atlanta (CL-51)|USS ''Atlanta'']] (CL-51)]]
The development of the anti-aircraft cruiser began in 1935 when the [[Royal Navy]] re-armed {{HMS|Coventry|D43|6}} and {{HMS|Curlew|D42|6}}.  Torpedo tubes and 6-inch (15&amp;nbsp;cm) low-angle guns were removed from these World War I light cruisers and replaced by ten 4-inch (10&amp;nbsp;cm) high-angle guns with appropriate fire-control equipment to provide larger warships with protection against high-altitude bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman &quot;Anti-Aircraft Cruisers: The Life of a Class&quot; ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' January 1965 p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

A tactical shortcoming was recognized after completing six additional conversions of [[C class cruiser|''C''-class cruiser]]s.  Having sacrificed anti-ship weapons for anti-aircraft armament, the converted anti-aircraft cruisers might need protection themselves against surface units.  New construction was undertaken to create cruisers of similar speed and displacement with [[dual-purpose gun]]s.  

Dual-purpose guns offered good anti-aircraft protection with anti-surface capability for the traditional light cruiser role of defending capital ships from destroyers.  The first purpose built anti-aircraft cruiser was the British {{sclass|Dido|cruiser|0}}, completed shortly before the beginning of World War II.  The US Navy {{sclass|Atlanta|cruiser|0}} anti-aircraft cruisers (CLAA) were designed to match capabilities of the Royal Navy.  Both ''Dido'' and ''Atlanta'' carried torpedo tubes.

The quick-firing dual-purpose gun anti-aircraft cruiser concept was embraced in several designs completed too late to see combat including {{USS|Worcester|CL-144}} and {{USS|Roanoke|CL-145}} completed in 1948 and 1949, two {{sclass|De Zeven Provinciën|cruiser}}s completed in 1953, [[French cruiser De Grasse (C610)|''De Grasse'']] and [[French cruiser Colbert (C611)|''Colbert'']] completed in 1955 and 1959, and {{HMS|Tiger|C20|6}}, {{HMS|Lion|C34|6}} and {{HMS|Blake|C99|6}} completed between 1959 and 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman &quot;Anti-Aircraft Cruisers: The Life of a Class&quot; ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' January 1965 pp.96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

Most post–World War II cruisers were tasked with air defense roles. In the early 1950s, advances in aviation technology forced the move from anti-aircraft artillery to anti-aircraft missiles. Therefore most cruisers of today are equipped with surface-to-air missiles as their main armament. The modern equivalent of the anti-aircraft cruiser is the '''guided missile cruiser''' (CAG/CLG/CG/CGN).

==Later 20th century==
The rise of air power during [[World War II]] dramatically changed the nature of naval combat. Even the fastest cruisers could not steer quickly enough to evade aerial attack, and aircraft now had torpedoes, allowing moderate-range standoff capabilities. This change led to the end of independent operations by single ships or very small task groups, and for the second half of the 20th century naval operations were based on very large fleets able to fend off all but the largest air attacks. 

This has led most navies to change to fleets designed around ships dedicated to a single role, [[anti-submarine]] or [[anti-aircraft]] typically, and the large &quot;generalist&quot; ship has disappeared from most forces. The [[United States Navy]], the [[Russian Navy]], and the [[Peruvian Navy]] are the only remaining navies which operate cruisers. France operated a single cruiser until May 2010: {{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc|R97|2}}, which in the NATO pennant number system was classified as an [[aircraft carrier]], but for training purposes only.

In the [[Soviet Navy]], cruisers formed the basis of combat groups. In the immediate post-war era they built a fleet of large-gun ships, but replaced these fairly quickly with very large ships carrying huge numbers of [[guided missile]]s and anti aircraft missiles. The most recent ships of this type, the four [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirovs'']], were built in the 1970s and 1980s. Currently 2 of the Kirov classes are currently in refit until 2020, and 1 is in refit until 2012. Only the Pyotr Velikiy is in active service. Russia also operates one [[Kara class cruiser|''Kara''-class]] and four [[Slava class cruiser|''Slava''-class]] cruisers, plus one ''Kuznetsov''-class carrier which is officially designated as a cruiser.

Currently, the Kirov class of heavy missile cruisers are used for command purposes, as it's the [[Flagship]] of the [[Northern Fleet]]. However, its air defense capabilities are still powerful. An example of its capabilities can be shown by its array of [[Point defense]] missiles, from 44 [[9K33 Osa#Variants|OSA-MA]] missiles to 196 [[Tor missile system#3K95 Kinzhal|9K311 Tor]] missiles. For longer range targets, the [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] is used. For closer range targets, [[AK-630]] or [[Kashtan]] CIWSs are used. Asides from that, Kirovs have 20 [[P-700 Granit]] for anti-ship warfare. For target acquisition beyond the [[Over-the-horizon radar|radar horizon]], 3 Helicopters can be used. Besides a vast array of armaments, Kirov classes are also outfitted with many Sensors and Communications equipment, allowing it to lead the fleet. 

The United States Navy has centered on the [[aircraft carrier]] since World War II. The {{sclass|Ticonderoga|cruiser|0}} cruisers, built in the 1980s, were originally designed and designated as a class of [[destroyer]], intended to provide a very powerful air-defense in these [[aircraft carrier|carrier]]-centered fleets. The ships were later redesignated largely as a [[public relations]] move, in order to highlight the capability of the [[Aegis combat system]] the ships were designed around.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} 

In the years since the launch of {{USS|Ticonderoga|CG-47|2}} in 1981 the class has received a number of upgrades that have dramatically improved their capabilities for [[anti-submarine]] and land attack (using the [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk missile]]). Like their Soviet counterparts, the modern ''Ticonderogas'' can also be used as the basis for an entire battle group. Their cruiser designation was almost certainly deserved when first built, as their sensors and combat management systems enable them to act as 'flagships' for a surface warship flotilla if no carrier is present, but newer ships rated as destroyers and also equipped with AEGIS approach them very closely in capability, and once more blur the line between the two classes.

===Aircraft cruisers===
{{main|Aircraft cruiser}}
From time to time, some navies have experimented with aircraft-carrying cruisers. One example is the Swedish [[HMS Gotland (cruiser)|HMS ''Gotland'']]. Another variant is the '''helicopter cruiser'''. The last example in service was the Soviet Navy's {{sclass|Kiev|aircraft carrier|0}}, the last unit of which has been converted to a pure aircraft carrier and sold to [[India]]. The Russian Navy's {{ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Kuznetsov||2}} is nominally designated as an aviation cruiser but otherwise resembles a standard medium aircraft carrier, albeit with an [[Surface-to-surface missile|SSM]] battery. The [[Royal Navy]]'s aircraft-carrying {{sclass|Invincible|aircraft carrier|0}} and the [[Italian Navy]]'s aircraft-carrying ''[[Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'' vessels were originally designated 'through-deck cruisers', but have since been designated as small [[aircraft carrier]]s.

==Cruisers in service today==
[[Image:Jeanne D Arc 4.jpg|thumb|{{ship|French cruiser|Jeanne d'Arc|R97|2}} of the [[French Navy]], launched in 1961, decommissioned in 2010.]]

Few cruisers remain operational in the world navies. Those that do are:
* [[United States Navy]]: 22&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/active/fleet.htm Naval Vessel Register]&lt;/ref&gt; {{sclass|Ticonderoga|cruiser|0}} guided missile cruisers.
* [[Russian Navy]]: One {{sclass|Kirov|battlecruiser|0}} large missile cruisers (sometimes referred to as [[battlecruisers]] due to their size) and three {{sclass|Slava|cruiser|0}} missile cruisers and one {{sclass|Kara|cruiser|0}}.
* [[Peruvian Navy]]: The {{ship|BAP|Almirante Grau|CLM-81|}}, a {{sclass|De Zeven Provinciën|cruiser|0}} cruiser, was modernized as a guided-missile cruiser in the late eighties, is the world's last operational gun cruiser.

==The US Navy's &quot;cruiser gap&quot;==
{{main|United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification}}
Prior to the introduction of the ''Ticonderogas'', the US Navy used odd naming conventions that left its fleet seemingly without many cruisers, although a number of their ships were cruisers in all but name. From the 1950s to the 1970s, US Navy &quot;cruisers&quot; were large vessels equipped with heavy offensive missiles (including the [[Regulus missile|Regulus]] [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[cruise missile]]) for wide-ranging combat against land-based and sea-based targets. All save one—{{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9}}—were converted from World War II ''Chicago''-, [[Baltimore class cruiser|''Baltimore'']]- and [[Cleveland class cruiser|''Cleveland'']]-class cruisers. 

&quot;[[Frigate]]s&quot; under this scheme were almost as large as the cruisers and optimized for [[anti-aircraft]] warfare, although they were capable anti-surface warfare combatants as well. In the late 1960s, the US government perceived a &quot;cruiser gap&quot;—at the time, the US Navy possessed six ships designated as &quot;cruisers&quot;, compared to 19 for the Soviet Union, even though the USN possessed at the time 21 &quot;frigates&quot; with equal or superior capabilities to the Soviet cruisers—because of this, in 1975 the Navy performed a massive redesignation of its forces:
* CVA/CVAN were redesignated CV/CVN (although {{USS|Midway|CV-41}} and {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43}} never embarked anti-submarine squadrons).
* DLG/DLGN (Frigate/Nuclear-powered Frigate) were redesignated CG/CGN (Guided Missile Cruiser/Nuclear-powered Guided Missile Cruiser).
* [[Farragut class destroyer (1958)|''Farragut''-class]] guided missile frigates (DLG), being smaller and less capable than the others, were redesignated to DDGs ({{USS|Coontz|DDG-40|6}} was the first ship of this class to be re-numbered; because of this the class is sometimes called the ''Coontz''-class);
* DE/DEG (Ocean Escort/Guided Missile Ocean Escort) were redesignated to FF/FFG (Guided Missile Frigates), bringing the US &quot;Frigate&quot; designation into line with the rest of the world.

Also, a series of Patrol Frigates of the {{sclass|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|0}}, originally designated PFG, were redesignated into the FFG line. The cruiser-destroyer-frigate realignment and the deletion of the Ocean Escort type brought the US Navy's ship designations into line with the rest of the world's, eliminating confusion with foreign navies. In 1980, the Navy's then-building DDG-47 class destroyers were redesignated as cruisers (CG-47 [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class guided missile cruiser]]) to emphasize the additional capability provided by the ships' [[Aegis combat system]]s.

'''Chlamydia infection''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], χλαμύδα meaning &quot;cloak&quot;) is a common [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) in humans caused by the bacterium ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]''. The term ''Chlamydia infection'' can also refer to infection caused by any [[species]] belonging to the bacterial [[family (biology)|family]] ''[[Chlamydiaceae]]''. ''C. trachomatis'' is found only in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chlamydiae.com/docs/Chlamydiales/diagram/taxondiag.htm|title= www.chlamydiae.com (professional) - Taxonomy diagram|accessdate=2007-10-27 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chlamydia is a major infectious cause of human [[genital]] and [[eye disease]].
Chlamydia infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide; it is estimated that about 1 million individuals in the [[United States]] are infected with chlamydia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/std/Chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm Chlamydia fact sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]&lt;/ref&gt; 

''C. trachomatis'' is naturally found living only inside human cells. Chlamydia can be transmitted during [[vaginal intercourse|vaginal]], [[anal sex|anal]], or [[oral sex]], and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during vaginal [[childbirth]]. Between half and three-quarters of all women who have a chlamydia infection of the neck of the womb ([[cervicitis]]) have no symptoms and do not know that they are infected. In men, infection of the urethra ([[urethritis]]) is usually symptomatic, causing a white discharge from the penis with or without pain on urinating ([[dysuria]]). Occasionally, the condition spreads to the upper genital tract in women (causing [[pelvic inflammatory disease]]) or to the [[epididymis]] in men (causing [[epididymitis]]). If untreated, chlamydial infections can cause serious reproductive and other health problems with both short-term and long-term consequences.

Chlamydia [[conjunctivitis]] or [[trachoma]] is a common cause of [[blindness]] worldwide. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that it accounted for 15% of blindness cases in 1995, but only 3.6% in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thylefors B, Négrel AD, Pararajasegaram R, Dadzie KY |title=Global data on blindness |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=115–21 |year=1995 |pmid=7704921 |doi= |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1995/Vol73-No1/bulletin_1995_73(1)_115-121.pdf |pmc=2486591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Resnikoff S, Pascolini D, Etya'ale D ''et al.'' |title=Global data on visual impairment in the year 2002 |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=82 |issue=11 |pages=844–851 |year=2004 |pmid=15640920 |doi= |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/11/en/844.pdf |pmc=2623053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NatRevMicrobiol&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Belland R, Ojcius D, Byrne G |title=Chlamydia |journal=Nat Rev Microbiol |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=530–1 |year=2004 |pmid=15248311 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
===Genital disease===

[[Image:SOA-Chlamydia-trachomatis-female.jpg|thumb|Chlamydial [[cervicitis]] in a female patient characterized by [[mucopurulent]] [[cervix|cervical]] discharge, [[erythema]], and [[inflammation]].]]
[[Image:SOA-Chlamydia-trachomatis-male.jpg|thumb|Male patients may develop a white, cloudy or watery discharge (shown) from the tip of the [[penis]].]]

Chlamydial infection of the neck of the womb ([[cervicitis]]) is a sexually transmitted infection which is [[asymptomatic]] for about 50-70% of women infected with the disease. The infection can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Of those who have an asymptomatic infection that is not detected by their doctor, approximately half will develop [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID), a generic term for infection of the [[uterus]], [[fallopian tubes]], and/or [[ovaries]]. PID can cause scarring inside the [[reproductive organ]]s, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic [[pelvis|pelvic]] pain, difficulty becoming [[pregnancy|pregnant]], [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic (tubal) pregnancy]], and other dangerous complications of pregnancy.

Chlamydia is known as the &quot;Silent Epidemic&quot; because in women, it may not cause any [[symptom]]s in 75% of cases,&lt;ref name=&quot;asymp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freetest.me.uk/about-chlamydia |title=FreeTest.Me - About Chlamydia |accessdate=2008-12-15 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can linger for months or years before being discovered. Symptoms that may occur include: unusual [[vagina]]l bleeding or discharge, pain in the abdomen, painful [[sexual intercourse]] ([[dyspareunia]]), [[fever]], [[Dysuria|painful urination]] or the urge to urinate more frequently than usual ([[urinary urgency]]).

In men, Chlamydia shows symptoms of infectious [[urethritis]] ([[inflammation]] of the [[urethra]]) in about 50% of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;asymp&quot;/&gt; Symptoms that may occur include: a painful or burning sensation when urinating, an unusual discharge from the [[penis]], swollen or tender [[testicle]]s, or fever. Discharge, or the purulent exudate, is generally less viscous and lighter in color than for [[gonorrhea]]. If left untreated, it is possible for Chlamydia in men to spread to the testicles causing [[epididymitis]], which in rare cases can cause [[infertility|sterility]] if not treated within 6 to 8 weeks. Chlamydia is also a potential cause of [[prostatitis]] in men, although the exact relevance in prostatitis is difficult to ascertain due to possible contamination from urethritis.&lt;ref name=&quot;urology&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wagenlehner FM, Naber KG, Weidner W |title=Chlamydial infections and prostatitis in men |journal=BJU Int. |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=687–90 |year=2006 |pmid=16536754 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06007.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1464-4096&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=97&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye disease===
{{Main|Trachoma}}
[[Image:SOA-conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|Conjunctivitis due to chlamydia.]]
Chlamydia conjunctivitis or trachoma was once the most important cause of blindness worldwide, but its role diminished from 15% of blindness cases by trachoma in 1995 to 3.6% in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2002&quot;/&gt; The infection can be spread from eye to eye by fingers, shared towels or cloths, coughing and sneezing and eye-seeking flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;LancetTrachoma&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mabey DC, Solomon AW, Foster A |title=Trachoma |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9379 |pages=223–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12885486 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13914-1 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(03)13914-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newborns can also develop chlamydia eye infection through [[childbirth]] (see below). Using the SAFE strategy ([[acronym]] for surgery for [[trichiasis|in-growing]] or [[entropion|in-turned]] lashes, [[antibiotics]], facial cleanliness, and environmental improvements), the [[World Health Organisation]] aims for the global elimination of trachoma by 2020 (GET 2020 initiative).&lt;ref name=&quot;GET2020&quot;&gt;[[World Health Organisation]]. [http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/trachoma/en/index.html Trachoma]. Accessed March 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LancetSAFE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ngondi J, Onsarigo A, Matthews F, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of 3 years of SAFE (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental change) strategy for trachoma control in southern Sudan: a cross-sectional study |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9535 |pages=589–95 |year=2006 |pmid=16905023 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69202-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)69202-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rheumatological conditions===
Chlamydia may also cause [[reactive arthritis|reactive arthritis (reiter's syndrome)]] - the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis and urethritis (inflammation of the urethra) - especially in young men. About 15,000 men develop reactive arthritis due to chlamydia infection each year in the U.S., and about 5,000 are permanently affected by it. It can occur in both sexes, though is more common in men.

===Perinatal infections===
As many as half of all [[infant]]s born to mothers with chlamydia will be born with the disease. Chlamydia can affect infants by causing spontaneous abortion; [[premature birth]]; [[conjunctivitis]], which may lead to [[blindness]]; and [[pneumonia]]. Conjunctivitis due to chlamydia typically occurs one week after birth (compared with chemical causes (within hours) or gonorrhea (2–5 days)).

===Other conditions===
Chlamydia trachomatis is also the cause of [[lymphogranuloma venereum]], an infection of the [[lymph nodes]] and [[lymphatics]]. It usually presents with [[genital ulcer]]ation and [[Lymphadenopathy|swollen lymph nodes]] in the [[groin]], but it may also manifest as [[proctitis]] (inflammation of the [[rectum]]), [[fever]] or swollen lymph nodes in other regions of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;proctitis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams D, Churchill D |title=Ulcerative proctitis in men who have sex with men: an emerging outbreak |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7533 |pages=99–100 |year=2006 |pmid=16410585 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7533.99 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16410585 |pmc=1326936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
''Chlamydiae'' have the ability to establish long-term associations with host cells. When an infected host cell is starved for various nutrients such as [[amino acid]]s (for example, [[tryptophan]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17724071&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leonhardt RM, Lee SJ, Kavathas PB, Cresswell P |title=Severe Tryptophan Starvation Blocks Onset of Conventional Persistence and Reduces Reactivation of Chlamydia trachomatis |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=75 |issue=11 |pages=5105–17 |year=2007 |pmid=17724071 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00668-07 |pmc=2168275}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[iron]], or [[vitamin]]s, this has a negative consequence for ''Chlamydiae'' since the organism is dependent on the host cell for these nutrients. Long-term cohort studies indicate that approximately 50% of those infected clear within a year, 80% within two years, and 90% within three years.&lt;ref name=Fairley2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fairley et al. | year = 2007 | title = &quot;Doctor, How Long Has My Chlamydia Been There?&quot; Answer:&quot;... Years&quot; | journal = Sexually Transmitted Diseases | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 727 | doi = 10.1097/OLQ.0b013e31812dfb6e | url = http://www.stdjournal.com/pt/re/std/fulltext.00007435-200709000-00018.htm | pmid = 17717486 | first1 = CK | last2 = Gurrin | first2 = L | last3 = Walker | first3 = J | last4 = Hocking | first4 = JS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starved chlamydiae enter a persistent growth state wherein they stop cell division and become morphologically aberrant by increasing in size.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16338585&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mpiga P, Ravaoarinoro M |title=Chlamydia trachomatis persistence: an update |journal=Microbiol. Res. |volume=161 |issue=1 |pages=9–19 |year=2006 |pmid=16338585 |doi=10.1016/j.micres.2005.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent organisms remain viable as they are capable of returning to a normal growth state once conditions in the host cell improve. 

There is much debate as to whether persistence has ''[[in vivo]]'' relevance. Many believe that persistent chlamydiae are the cause of chronic chlamydial diseases. Some antibiotics such as β-lactams can also induce a persistent-like growth state, which can contribute to the chronicity of chlamydial diseases.

== Screening for women==
For sexually active women who are not pregnant, screening is recommended in those under 25 and others at risk of infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;&gt;Meyers D, Wolff T, Gregory K.

The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] recommends screening all at risk, while the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend universal screening of pregnant women.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;/&gt; The USPSTF acknowledges that in some communities there may be other risk factors for infection, such as ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;/&gt; Evidence-based recommendations for screening initiation, intervals and termination are currently not possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;/&gt; There is no universal agreement on screening men for chlamydia.{{why|date=December 2010}}

In England and Wales the NHS [http://www.chlamydiascreening.nhs.uk National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP)] aims to

#Prevent and control chlamydia infection through early detection and treatment of asymptomatic infection;
#Reduce onward transmission to sexual partners;
#Prevent the consequences of untreated infection;
#Test at least 25 percent of the sexually active under 25 population annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chlamydiascreening.nhs.uk/ps/data/data_tables.html|title=National Chlamydia Screening Programme Data tables|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the programme chlamydia testing is available for free to men and women under 25 in a range of local venues including Contraceptive and Sexual Health Clinics, Community Pharmacy, General Practice and in some areas [http://freetest.me.uk/ postal testing is available].

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of genital chlamydial infections evolved rapidly from the 1990s through 2006. [[Nucleic acid amplification test]]s (NAAT), such as [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[transcription mediated amplification]] (TMA), and the DNA [[strand displacement amplification]] (SDA) now are the mainstays. NAAT for chlamydia may be performed on swab specimens collected from the cervix (women) or urethra (men), on self-collected vaginal swabs, or on voided urine. Urine and self-collected swab testing facilitates the performance of screening tests in settings where genital examination is impractical. At present, the NAATs have regulatory approval only for testing urogenital specimens, although rapidly evolving research indicates that they may give reliable results on rectal specimens.

Because of improved test accuracy, ease of specimen management, convenience in specimen management, and ease of screening sexually active men and women, the NAATs have largely replaced culture, the historic [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for chlamydia diagnosis, and the non-amplified probe tests. The latter test is relatively insensitive, successfully detecting only 60-80% of infections in asymptomatic women, and often giving falsely positive results. Culture remains useful in selected circumstances and is currently the only assay approved for testing non-genital specimens.

== Treatment==
[[Image:ChlamydiaTrachomatisEinschlusskörperchen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Chlamydia trachomatis'' inclusion bodies (brown) in a McCoy cell culture.]] 
''C. trachomatis'' infection can be effectively cured with [[antibiotic]]s once it is detected. Current [[Centers for Disease Control]] guidelines provide for the following treatments:
* [[Azithromycin]] 1&amp;nbsp;gram oral as a single dose, or
* [[Doxycycline]] 100 milligrams twice daily for seven to 14 days.
* [[Tetracycline]]
* [[Erythromycin]]
Non-approved
* [[Ciprofloxacin]] 500 milligrams twice daily for 3 days. (Although this is not an approved method of treatment.)

Agents recommended for pregnant women include erythromycin or [[amoxicillin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDiagnosis and Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection - April 15, 2006 - American Family Physician&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0415/p1411.html |title=Diagnosis and Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection - April 15, 2006 - American Family Physician |work= |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[β-lactams]] are not suitable drugs for the treatment of chlamydia. While they have the ability to halt growth of the organism (i.e. are microbistatic), these antibiotics do not eliminate the bacteria. Once treatment is stopped, the bacteria will begin to grow once more. (See below for Persistence.)

An option for treating partners of patients ([[index case]]s) diagnosed with chlamydia or [[gonorrhea]] is ''[[patient-delivered partner therapy]]'' (PDT or PDPT), which is the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of index cases by providing prescriptions or medications to the patient to take to his/her partner without the health care provider first examining the partner.&lt;ref name=EPTFinalReport2006&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/EPTFinalReport2006.pdf Expedited Partner Therapy in the Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (2 February 2006)] U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE.

Chlamydia causes more than 250,000 cases of epididymitis in the U.S. each year. Chlamydia causes 250,000 to 500,000 cases of PID every year in the United States. Women infected with chlamydia are up to five times more likely to become infected with HIV, if exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm#complications |title=STD Facts - Chlamydia |accessdate=2007-10-26 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Recent phylogenetic studies have revealed that chlamydia shares a [[common ancestor]] with modern plants and retains unusual plant-like traits (both [[genetics|genetically]] and [[physiology|physiologically]]). In particular, the [[enzyme]] ''L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase'', which is related to [[lysine]] production in plants, is also linked with the construction of chlamydia's [[cell wall]]. The genetic encoding for the enzymes is remarkably similar in plants and chlamydia, demonstrating a close common ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17093042&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCoy AJ, Adams NE, Hudson AO, Gilvarg C, Leustek T, Maurelli AT |title=L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase, a trans-kingdom enzyme shared by Chlamydia and plants for synthesis of diaminopimelate/lysine |journal=Proc.

'''Candidiasis''' or '''thrush''' is a [[fungal infection]] (mycosis) of any of the ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' species (all [[yeast]]s), of which ''[[Candida albicans]]'' is the most common.&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book | author = Walsh TJ, Dixon DM | chapter=Deep Mycoses |title=Baron's Medical Microbiology |editor=Baron S ''et al.'' eds.| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 |isbn=0-9631172-1-1 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.4006 |format=via NCBI Bookshelf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline Plus&quot;&gt;{{MedlinePlus|001511|Vaginal yeast infection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also commonly referred to as a '''yeast infection''', candidiasis is also technically known as '''candidosis''', '''moniliasis''', and '''oidiomycosis'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|308}}

Candidiasis encompasses infections that range from [[superficial]], such as [[Oral candidiasis|oral thrush]] and [[vaginitis]], to [[systemic disease|systemic]] and potentially life-threatening diseases. ''Candida'' infections of the latter category are also referred to as [[candidemia]] and are usually confined to severely [[immunocompromised]] persons, such as [[cancer]], [[Organ transplant|transplant]], and [[AIDS]] patients as well as non-trauma emergency surgery patients.&lt;ref&gt;T Kourkoumpetis et al. Candida infection and colonization among non-trauma emergency surgery patients (2010) Virulence http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/virulence/article/12795/l.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superficial infections of skin and [[mucosa]]l membranes by ''Candida'' causing local [[inflammation]] and [[Stress (medicine)|discomfort]] are common in many human populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline Plus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fidel PL|year= 2002|title=Immunity to Candida|journal=Oral Dis. |volume=8 |pages=69–75 |pmid=12164664 |doi=10.1034/j.1601-0825.2002.00015.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pappas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pappas PG |title=Invasive candidiasis |journal=Infect.

== Classification ==
Candidiasis may be divided into the following types:&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews&quot;/&gt;{{rp|308-311}}
&lt;div class=&quot;references-medium&quot; style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;

* [[Antibiotic candidiasis]]  (Iatrogenic candidiasis)
&lt;/div&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Most candidial infections are treatable and result in minimal complications such as redness, itching and discomfort, though complication may be severe or fatal if left untreated in certain populations. In [[immunocompetence|immunocompetent]] persons, candidiasis is usually a very localized infection of the skin or mucosal membranes, including  the [[oral cavity]] ([[oral thrush|thrush]]), the [[pharynx]] or [[esophagus]], the [[gastrointestinal tract]],  the [[urinary bladder]], or the genitalia ([[vagina]], [[penis]]).&lt;ref name=Baron/&gt;

Candidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation, or [[vaginitis]], and can also occur on the [[male genitals]]. In [[immunocompromised]] patients, ''Candida'' infections can affect the [[esophageal candidiasis|esophagus]] with the potential of becoming [[systemic disease|systemic]], causing a much more serious condition, a [[fungemia]] called [[candidemia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pappas&quot;/&gt;

Thrush is commonly seen in infants. It is not considered abnormal in infants unless it lasts longer than a couple of weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Thrush| url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001650/ |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children, mostly between the ages of three and nine years of age, can be affected by chronic mouth yeast infections, normally seen around the mouth as white patches. However, this is not a common condition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Symptoms of candidiasis may vary depending on the area affected. Infection of the [[vagina]] or [[vulva]] may cause severe itching, burning, soreness, irritation, and a whitish or whitish-gray [[cottage cheese]]-like discharge, often with a curd-like appearance. These symptoms are also present in the more common [[bacterial vaginosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/features/is-it-yeast-infection |author=Terri Warren, RN |title=Is It a Yeast Infection? |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 study published in the ''Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology'', only 33 percent of women who were self-treating for a yeast infection actually had a yeast infection, while most had either bacterial vaginosis or a mixed-type infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01759-8 |author=Ferris DG; Nyirjesy P; Sobel JD; Soper D; Pavletic A; Litaker MS |year=2002 |month=March |title=Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=99 |series= |issue=3 |pages=419–425 |pmid=11864668 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11864668 |accessdate=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of infection of the male genitalia include red patchy sores near the head of the penis or on the foreskin, severe itching, or a burning sensation. Candidiasis of the penis can also have a white discharge, although uncommon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

''Candida'' yeasts are commonly present in humans, and their growth is normally limited by the human [[immune system]] and by other [[microorganism]]s, such as bacteria occupying the same locations ([[niche]]s) in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mulley, A.

In penile candidiasis, the causes include sexual intercourse with an infected individual, low immunity, antibiotics, and diabetes.

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Esophageal candidiasis (2) PAS stain.jpg|thumb|Micrograph of esophageal candidiasis. [[Biopsy]] specimen; [[PAS stain]].]]

Diagnosis of a yeast infection is done either via microscopic examination or culturing.

For identification by light microscopy, a scraping or swab of the affected area is placed on a [[microscope slide]]. A single drop of 10% [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution is then added to the specimen. The KOH dissolves the skin cells but leaves the ''Candida'' cells intact, permitting visualization of [[hyphae|pseudohyphae]] and budding [[yeast cell]]s typical of many ''Candida'' species.

For the culturing method, a sterile swab is rubbed on the infected skin surface. The swab is then streaked on a culture medium. The culture is incubated at 37 °C for several days, to allow development of yeast or bacterial colonies. The characteristics (such as morphology and colour) of the colonies may allow initial diagnosis of the organism that is causing disease symptoms.

== Treatment ==



In clinical settings, candidiasis is commonly treated with [[antimycotic]]s—the [[antifungal drug]]s commonly used to treat candidiasis are topical [[clotrimazole]], topical [[nystatin]], [[fluconazole]], and topical [[ketoconazole]].

== History ==

The [[genus]] ''Candida'' and [[species]] ''C. albicans'' was described by botanist [[Christine Marie Berkhout]] in her doctoral thesis at the [[University of Utrecht]] in 1923. Over the years, the classification of the genera and species has evolved. Obsolete names for this genus include ''Mycotorula'' and ''Torulopsis''. The species has also been known in the past as ''Monilia albicans'' and ''Oidium albicans''. The current classification is ''[[nomen conservandum]]'', which means the name is authorized for use by the International Botanical Congress (IBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0000St.Luistitle.htm |title=International Code of Botanical Nomenclature |year=2000 |isbn=3-904144-22-7 |location =Königstein | accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus ''Candida'' includes about 150 different species, however, only a few are known to cause human infections: ''C. albicans'' is the most significant [[pathogen]]ic species. Other ''Candida'' species pathogenic in humans include ''C. tropicalis'', ''C. glabrata'', ''C. krusei'', ''C. parapsilosis'', ''C. dubliniensis'', and ''C. lusitaniae''.

== Society and culture ==

Some [[alternative medicine]] proponents postulate a widespread occurrence of systemic candidiasis (or candida hypersensitivity syndrome, yeast allergy, or gastrointestinal candida overgrowth). The view was most widely promoted in a book published by Dr. William Crook,&lt;ref name=Crook&gt;{{cite book |author=Crook, William G. |title=The yeast connection: a medical breakthrough |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0394747003 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which hypothesized that a variety of common symptoms such as fatigue, [[PMS]], [[sexual dysfunction]], [[asthma]], [[psoriasis]], digestive and urinary problems, [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[Myalgia|muscle pain]], could be caused by [[subclinical infection]]s of ''Candida albicans''.&lt;ref name=Crook/&gt; Crook suggested a variety of remedies to treat these symptoms, ranging from dietary modification, prescription antifungals, to [[colonic irrigation]]. With the exception of the few dietary studies in the [[urinary tract infection]] section conventional medicine has not used most of these alternatives, since there is limited scientific evidence to prove their effectiveness, or that subclinical systemic candidiasis is a viable diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Weil A |title=Concerned About Candidiasis? |url=http://www.drweil.com/u/QA/QA125503/ |date=2002-10-25 |publisher=Weil Lifestyle |accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Barrett S |title=Dubious &quot;Yeast Allergies&quot; |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html |date=2005-10-08 |publisher=QuackWatch |accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Katherine Zeratsky |title=Candida cleanse: Does it treat candidiasis? |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/candida-cleanse/AN01679 |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Edward Blonz|title=Is There an Epidemic of Chronic Candidiasis in Our Midst? |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/summary/256/22/3138?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=chronic+candidiasis&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT|publisher=JAMA|date=1986-12-12|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|The concept of the feedback loop to control the dynamic behavior of the system: this is negative feedback, because the sensed value is subtracted from the desired value to create the error signal, which is amplified by the controller.]]
'''Control theory''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]] that deals with the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s. The desired output of a system is called the ''[[reference]]''. When one or more output variables of a system need to follow a certain reference over time, a [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] manipulates the inputs to a system to obtain the desired effect on the output of the system.

==Overview==
Control theory is
* a theory that deals with influencing the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s
* an interdisciplinary subfield of science, which originated in [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]], and evolved into use by the social sciences, like [[psychology]], [[control theory (sociology)|sociology]] and [[criminology]].

===An example===
Consider a car's [[cruise control]], which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant ''desired'' or ''reference'' speed provided by the driver. The ''controller'' is the cruise control, the ''plant'' is the car,  and the ''system'' is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's [[throttle]] position which determines how much power the engine generates.

A primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control.  However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an [[open-loop controller]] because no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller can not compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.

In a '''closed-loop control system''', a sensor monitors the system output (the car's speed) and feeds the data to a controller which adjusts the control (the throttle position) as necessary to maintain the desired system output (match the car's speed to the reference speed.) Now when the car goes uphill the decrease in speed is measured, and the throttle position changed to increase engine power, speeding the vehicle. Feedback from measuring the car's speed has allowed the controller to dynamically compensate for changes to the car's speed. It is from this feedback that the paradigm of the control ''loop'' arises: the control affects the system output, which in turn is measured and looped back to alter the control.

[[Image:Boulton and Watt centrifugal governor-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Centrifugal governor]] in a [[Boulton &amp; Watt engine]] of 1788]]

Although control systems of various types date back to antiquity, a more formal analysis of the field began with a dynamics analysis of the [[centrifugal governor]], conducted by the physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868 entitled ''On Governors''.&lt;ref name=Maxwell1867&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This described and analyzed the phenomenon of &quot;[[Self-exciting oscillation|hunting]]&quot;, in which lags in the system can lead to overcompensation and unstable behavior. This generated a flurry of interest in the topic, during which Maxwell's classmate [[Edward John Routh]] generalized the results of Maxwell for the general class of linear systems.&lt;ref name=Routh1975&gt;{{cite book

A notable application of dynamic control was in the area of manned flight. The [[Wright brothers]] made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Control of the airplane was necessary for safe flight.

By [[World War II]], control theory was an important part of [[fire-control system]]s, [[guidance system]]s and [[electronics]]. 

Sometimes mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems. For example, [[Stabilizer (ship)|ship stabilizers]] are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally.  In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.

The [[Sidewinder missile]] uses small control surfaces placed at the rear of the missile with spinning disks on their outer surface; these are known as [[rolleron]]s. Airflow over the disk spins them to a high speed. If the missile starts to roll, the gyroscopic force of the disk drives the control surface into the airflow, cancelling the motion. Thus the Sidewinder team replaced a potentially complex control system with a simple mechanical solution.

The [[Space Race]] also depended on accurate spacecraft control. However, control theory also saw an increasing use in fields such as [[economics]].

==People in systems and control==
{{Main|People in systems and control}}
Many active and historical figures made significant contribution to control theory, including, for example:
* [[Alexander Lyapunov]] (1857–1918) in the 1890s marks the beginning of [[stability theory]].
* [[Harold Stephen Black|Harold S. Black]] (1898–1983), invented the concept of [[negative feedback amplifier]]s in 1927. He managed to develop stable negative feedback amplifiers in the 1930s.
* [[Harry Nyquist]] (1889–1976), developed the [[Nyquist stability criterion]] for feedback systems in the 1930s.
* [[Richard Bellman]] (1920–1984), developed [[dynamic programming]] since the 1940s.
* [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (1903–1987) co-developed the [[Wiener filter|Wiener-Kolmogorov filter]] (1941).
* [[Norbert Wiener]] (1894–1964) co-developed the Wiener-Kolmogorov filter and coined the term [[cybernetics]] in the 1940s.
* [[John R. Ragazzini]] (1912–1988) introduced [[digital control]] and the [[z-transform]] in the 1950s.
* [[Lev Pontryagin]] (1908–1988) introduced the [[Pontryagin's minimum principle|maximum principle]] and the [[Bang-bang control|bang-bang principle]].

==Classical control theory==
To avoid the problems of the open-loop controller, control theory introduces [[feedback]].
A closed-loop [[controller (control theory)|controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[output]]s of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g. [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g. velocity or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is used as input to the process, closing the loop.

Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:
* disturbance rejection (such as unmeasured friction in a motor)
* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact
* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized
* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations
* improved reference tracking performance

In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed-forward|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.

A common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].

===Closed-loop transfer function===
{{details|Closed-loop transfer function}}
The output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.

This is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e. Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).

[[Image:simple feedback control loop2.png|center|A simple feedback control loop]]

If we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e.: elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = P(s) U(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;U(s) = C(s) E(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives:

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \left( \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)} \right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If &lt;math&gt;|P(s)C(s)| \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if &lt;math&gt;|F(s)| \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.

===PID controller===
{{details|PID controller}}
The [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design. ''PID'' is an acronym for ''Proportional-Integral-Differential'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal. If ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and tracking error &lt;math&gt;e(t)=r(t)- y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, a PID controller has the general form

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \int e(t)\text{d}t + K_D \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}e(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters &lt;math&gt; K_P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_D&lt;/math&gt;, often iteratively by &quot;tuning&quot; and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if [[MIMO]] systems are considered.

Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation

:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  (K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s) e(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with the PID controller transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = (K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s).&lt;/math&gt;

==Modern control theory==
In contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain [[state space (controls)|state space]] representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the &quot;time-domain approach&quot;) provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With  inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down  Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. &quot;State space&quot; refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a vector within that space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State space &amp; linear systems|series=Schaum's outline series |publisher=McGraw Hill|author=Donald M Wiberg|isbn=0070700966}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Topics in control theory==
=== Stability ===

The ''stability'' of a general [[dynamical system]] with no input can be described with [[Lyapunov stability]] criteria. A [[linear system]] that takes an input is called [[BIBO stability|bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable]] if its output will stay [[bounded function|bounded]] for any bounded input. Stability for [[nonlinear system]]s that take an input is [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS), which combines Lyapunov stability and a notion similar to BIBO stability. For simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems.

Mathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its [[transfer function]] must satisfy some criteria depending on whether a continuous or discrete time analysis is used:
* In continuous time, the [[Laplace transform]] is used to obtain the transfer function. A system is stable if the poles of this transfer function lie strictly in the open left half of the [[complex plane]] (i.e. the real part of all the poles is less than zero).
* In discrete time the [[Z-transform]] is used. A system is stable if the poles of this transfer function lie strictly inside the [[unit circle]]. i.e. the magnitude of the poles is less than one).

When the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]]: the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]: in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.

Differences between the two cases are not a contradiction. The Laplace transform is in [[Cartesian coordinates]] and the Z-transform is in [[circular coordinates]], and it can be shown that:
* the negative-real part in the Laplace domain can map onto the interior of the unit circle
* the positive-real part in the Laplace domain can map onto the exterior of the unit circle

If a system in question has an [[impulse response]] of

:&lt;math&gt;\ x[n] = 0.5^n u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

then the Z-transform (see [[Z-transform#Example 2 (causal ROC)|this example]]), is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}\ &lt;/math&gt;

which has a pole in &lt;math&gt;z = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; (zero [[imaginary number|imaginary part]]). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is ''inside'' the unit circle.

However, if the impulse response was

:&lt;math&gt;\ x[n] = 1.5^n u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

then the Z-transform is

:&lt;math&gt;\ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - 1.5z^{-1}}\ &lt;/math&gt;

which has a pole at &lt;math&gt;z = 1.5&lt;/math&gt; and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one.

Numerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the [[root locus]], [[Bode plot]]s or the [[Nyquist plot]]s.

Mechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use antiroll fins that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.

===Controllability and observability===
{{Main| Controllability|Observability}}

[[Controllability]] and [[observability]] are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed Stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of &quot;observing&quot;, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behaviour of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.

From a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every &quot;bad&quot; state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behaviour in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the [[eigenvalues]] of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.

Solutions to problems of uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.

===Control specification===
Several different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones ([[PID controller]]), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially [[robotics]] or [[aircraft]] cruise control).

A control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present: the controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have &lt;math&gt;Re[\lambda] &lt; -\overline{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that &lt;math&gt;Re[\lambda]&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Another typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an [[integrator]] in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.

Other &quot;classical&quot; control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system: these include the [[rise time]] (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ([[settling time]], quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to [[robust control|robustness]] (see after).

Modern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE,ISA,CQI).

===Model identification and robustness===
A control system must always have some robustness property. A [[robust control]]ler is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This specification is important: no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible.

;System identification
{{details|System identification}}
The process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called [[system identification]]. This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its [[transfer function]] or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations: for example, in the case of a [[Damping#Example: mass-spring-damper|mass-spring-damper]] system we know that &lt;math&gt; m \ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \Beta \dot{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Even assuming that a &quot;complete&quot; model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called &quot;nominal parameters&quot;) are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.

Some advanced control techniques include an &quot;on-line&quot; identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated (&quot;identified&quot;) while the controller itself is running: in this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues (for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight), the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.

;Analysis
Analysis of the robustness of a SISO control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using [[Nyquist diagram|Nyquist]] and [[Bode diagram]]s. Topics include [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain and phase margin]] and amplitude margin. For MIMO and, in general, more complicated control systems one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section): i.e., if particular robustness qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique including them in its properties.

;Constraints
A particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system: for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: [[model predictive control]] (see later), and [[anti-wind up system (control)|anti-wind up systems]]. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.

==System classifications==
=== Linear Systems control ===
{{Main|State space (controls)}}
For MIMO systems, pole placement can be performed mathematically using a [[State space (controls)|state space representation]] of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.

===Nonlinear Systems control===
{{Main|Nonlinear control}}
Processes in industries like [[robotics]] and the [[aerospace industry]] typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., [[feedback linearization]], [[backstepping]],  [[sliding mode control]], trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on [[Lyapunov's theory]]. [[Differential geometry]] has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.

===Decentralized Systems ===
{{Main|Decentralized/distributed control}}
When the system is controlled by multiple controllers, the problem is one of decentralized control. Decentralization is helpful in many ways, for instance, it helps control systems operate over a larger geographical area. The agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions.

==Main control strategies==
Every control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For [[linear system]]s, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]]'s Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen. Here a summary list of the main control techniques is shown:

;Adaptive control : [[Adaptive control]] uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the [[aerospace industry]] in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.

;Hierarchical control : A [[Hierarchical control system]] is a type of [[Control System]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[Networked control system]].

; Intelligent control : [[Intelligent control]] uses various AI computing approaches like [[neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to control a [[dynamic system]].

; Optimal control : [[Optimal control]] is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain &quot;cost index&quot;: for example, in the case of a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC) and [[Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the &quot;optimal control&quot; structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in [[process control]].

; Robust control : [[Robust control]] deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design.  Controllers designed using ''robust control'' methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design.  The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness.  A modern example of a robust control technique is [[H-infinity loop-shaping]] developed by [[Duncan McFarlane]] and [[Keith Glover]] of [[Cambridge University]], [[United Kingdom]].  Robust methods aim to achieve robust performance and/or [[Stability theory|stability]] in the presence of small modeling errors.

; Stochastic control : [[Stochastic control]] deals with control design with uncertainty in the model. In typical stochastic control problems, it is assumed that there exist random noise and disturbances in the model and the controller, and the control design must take into account these random deviations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cracking joints''' is the action of moving [[joint]]s to produce a sharp cracking or popping sound. The most common form of this occurs during deliberate [[knuckle]]-cracking.  It is possible to crack many other joints, such as those between the back and neck [[vertebrae]], hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, toes, ankles, knees, jaws, and the [[Achilles tendon]] area.

==Causes==
To deliberately produce the [[Joint manipulation#Audible click|clicking sounds]], many people bend their [[finger]]s into unusual positions. These positions are usually ones that their own muscles are unable to achieve. However, cracking a joint that has been exercised recently is generally recognized to be [[Palliative care|palliative]]. For example, bending a finger backwards away from the palm (into [[extension (anatomy)|extension]]), pulling them away from the [[hand]] (distraction), compressing a finger [[knuckle]] toward the palm (into [[flexion]]), or twisting a finger about (torsion).

The snapping of tendons or scar tissue over a prominence (as in [[snapping hip syndrome]]) can also generate a loud snapping or popping sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protopapas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Protopapas M, Cymet T, Protapapas M | title = Joint cracking and popping: understanding noises that accompany articular release. | journal = J Am Osteopath Assoc | volume = 102 | issue = 5 | pages = 283–7 | date=1 May 2002| pmid = 12033758 | url = http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/reprint/102/5/283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source==
The physical mechanism is uncertain. Suggested causes include:

* [[Cavitation]] within the joint&amp;mdash;small cavities of partial vacuum form in the fluid and then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp sound. This explains the popping that can occur in any joint, such as during [[spinal manipulation]]. [[Synovial fluid]] cavitation is the most likely theory and substantial evidence exists in support of it. Cracking knuckles releases gases from the joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brodeur R. | title = The audible release associated with joint manipulation. | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–64 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7790795}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rapid stretching of ligaments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protopapas&quot;/&gt;
* Intra-articular (within-joint) [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] being broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protopapas&quot;/&gt;

Of these hypotheses, perhaps the most popular is cavitation. When a manipulation is performed, the applied force separates the [[articular]] surfaces of a fully encapsulated synovial joint, which in turn creates a reduction in pressure within the joint cavity. In this low-pressure environment, some of the [[gases]] that are dissolved in the [[synovial fluid]] (which are naturally found in all bodily fluids) leave the solution, making a [[liquid bubble|bubble]], or [[cavity]], which rapidly collapses upon itself, resulting in a &quot;clicking&quot; sound. This process is known as [[cavitation]]. The contents of the resultant gas bubble are thought to be mainly [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Unsworth A, Dowson D, Wright V. | title = 'Cracking joints'. A bioengineering study of cavitation in the metacarpophalangeal joint. | journal = Ann Rheum Dis | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 348–58 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5557778 | doi = 10.1136/ard.30.4.348 | pmc = 1005793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of this process will remain for a period of time known as the &quot;[[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]&quot;, which can range from a few seconds to some hours while it is slowly reabsorbed back into the [[synovial fluid]]. There is some evidence that ligament laxity may be associated with an increased tendency to cavitate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fryer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fryer, Gary and Jacob, Mudge and McLaughlin, Patrick | year = 2002 | title = The Effect of Talocrural Joint Manipulation on Range of Motion at the Ankle | journal = [[Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics]] | issue = 25 | pages = 384–390 | pmid = 12183696 | doi = 10.1067/mmt.2002.126129 | volume = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussions==
The common advice &quot;cracking your knuckles gives you [[arthritis]]&quot; is not supported by any evidence. A study concluded that there was no increased preponderance of arthritis of the hand in either group; however, habitual knuckle-crackers were more likely to have hand swelling and 25% lower grip strength. Habitual knuckle-cracking was associated with manual labour, biting of the nails, smoking, and drinking alcohol in the study participants and their families. The study concluded that habitual knuckle-cracking results in functional hand impairment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castellanos&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Castellanos J., Axelrod D. | title = Effect of habitual knuckle cracking on hand function | journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | pages = 49(5):308–9 | year = 1990  | doi = 10.1136/ard.49.5.308 | pmc = 1004074 | volume = 49 | pmid=2344210 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical doctor Donald Unger regularly cracked the knuckles of his left hand for fifty years while not manipulating those of his right. No arthritis or other ailments formed in either hand, and he was awarded 2009's [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Medicine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=crack-research | title=Crack Research: Good news about knuckle cracking.|first=Steve|last=Mirsky |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date=December 2009 |accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|&lt;center&gt;Example of a&lt;br /&gt;chemical formula,&lt;br/&gt; [[aluminium sulfate]]&lt;/center&gt;
|}
A '''chemical formula''' or '''molecular formula''' is a way of expressing information about the [[atom]]s that constitute a particular [[chemical compound]]. 

The chemical formula identifies each constituent [[chemical element|element]] by its [[chemical symbol]] and indicates the number of atoms of each element found in each discrete [[molecule]] of that compound. If a molecule contains more than one atom of a particular element, this quantity is indicated using a [[subscript]] after the chemical symbol (although 18th-century books often used superscripts) and also can be combined by more chemical elements. For example, [[methane]], a small molecule consisting of one [[carbon]] atom and four [[hydrogen]] atoms, has the chemical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[sugar]] molecule [[glucose]] has six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and six [[oxygen]] atoms, so its chemical formula is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

Chemical formulas may be used in [[chemical equation]]s to describe [[chemical reaction]]s. For [[ionic compound]]s and other non-molecular substances an [[empirical formula]] may be used, in which the subscripts indicate the ratio of the elements. 
 
The 19th-century Swedish chemist [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] worked out this system for writing chemical formulas.{{cite}}

== Molecular geometry and structural formulas ==
[[File:Isobutane-numbered-2D.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Isobutane]]&lt;br /&gt;Molecular formula: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semi-structural formula: (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH]]

[[File:Butan Lewis.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Butane]]&lt;br /&gt;Molecular formula: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semi-structural formula: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The [[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms (i.e. a pair of [[isomers]]) might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a [[structural formula]] can be useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate [[molecular geometry|shape of the molecule]].

A chemical formula supplies information about the types and spatial arrangement of [[Chemical bond|bonds]] in the chemical, though it does not necessarily specify the exact [[isomer]]. For example [[ethane]] consists of two carbon atoms single-bonded to each other, with each carbon atom having three hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Its chemical formula can be rendered as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In [[ethylene]] there is a double bond between the carbon atoms (and thus each carbon only has two hydrogens), therefore the chemical formula may be written: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the fact that there is a double bond between the carbons is implicit because carbon has a valence of four. However, a more explicit method is to write H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or less commonly H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C'''::'''CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The two lines (or two pairs of dots) indicate that a [[double bond]] connects the atoms on either side of them.

A [[triple bond]] may be expressed with three lines or pairs of dots, and if there may be ambiguity, a single line or pair of dots may be used to indicate a single bond.

Molecules with multiple [[functional group]]s that are the same may be expressed by enclosing the repeated group in [[parenthesis|round brackets]]. For example [[isobutane]] may be written (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH. This semi-structural formula implies a different connectivity from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms in the same proportions (isomers). The formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH implies a central carbon atom attached to one hydrogen atom and three [[methyl group|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups]]. The same number of atoms of each element (10 hydrogens and 4 carbons, or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) may be used to make a straight chain molecule, [[butane]]: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

The alkene but-2-ene has two isomers which the chemical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not identify. The relative position of the two methyl groups must be indicated by additional notation denoting whether the methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond (''cis'' or ''Z'') or on the opposite sides from each other (''trans'' or ''E'').

== Polymers ==

For [[polymer]]s, parentheses are placed around the repeating unit. For example, a [[hydrocarbon]] molecule that is described as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a molecule with fifty repeating units. If the number of repeating units is unknown or variable, the letter ''n'' may be used to indicate this formula: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Ions ==
For [[ion]]s, the charge on a particular atom may be denoted with a right-hand superscript. For example Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The total charge on a charged molecule or a [[polyatomic ion]] may also be shown in this way. For example: [[Hydronium|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [[Sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]].

For more complex ions, brackets [ ] are often used to enclose the ionic formula, as in [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is found in compounds such as [[Caesium dodecaborate|Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]]. Parentheses ( ) can be nested inside brackets to indicate a repeating unit, as in [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Here (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that the ion contains six [[ammine|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups]], and [ ] encloses the entire formula of the ion with charge +3.

== Isotopes ==

Although [[isotope]]s are more relevant to [[nuclear chemistry]] or [[stable isotope]] chemistry than to conventional chemistry, different isotopes may be indicated with a left-hand [[superscript]] in a chemical formula. For example, the phosphate ion containing radioactive phosphorus-32 is &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;. Also a study involving stable isotope ratios might include the molecule &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O.

A left-hand subscript is sometimes used redundantly to indicate the [[atomic number]]. For example, &lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for dioxygen, and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the most abundant isotopic species of dioxygen. This is convenient when writing equations for [[nuclear reactions]], in order to show the balance of charge more clearly.

== Empirical formulas ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Acetic acid]] --&gt;
{{main|Empirical formula}}
In [[chemistry]], the [[empirical formula]] of a chemical is a simple expression of the relative number of each type of atom or ratio of the elements in the compound. Empirical formulas are the standard for ionic compounds, such as {{chem|CaCl|2}}, and for macromolecules, such as {{chem|SiO|2}}. An empirical formula makes no reference to [[isomer]]ism, structure, or absolute number of atoms. The term '''empirical''' refers to the process of [[elemental analysis]], a technique of [[analytical chemistry]] used to determine the relative percent composition of a pure chemical substance by element.

For example [[hexane]] has a molecular formula of {{chem|C|6|H|14}}, or structurally {{chem|CH|3|CH|2|CH|2|CH|2|CH|2|CH|3}}, implying that it has a chain structure of 6 [[carbon]] atoms, and 14 [[hydrogen]] atoms. However, the empirical formula for hexane is {{chem|C|3|H|7}}. Likewise the empirical formula for [[hydrogen peroxide]], {{chem|H|2|O|2}}, is simply HO expressing the 1:1 ratio of component elements. [[Formaldehyde]] and [[acetic acid]] have the same empirical formula, {{chem|CH|2|O}}. This is the actual chemical formula for formaldehyde, but acetic acid has double the number of atoms.

==Trapped atoms==

The @ symbol (&quot;at&quot;) indicates an atom or molecule trapped inside a cage but not chemically bound to it. This notation became popular in the 1990s with the discovery of [[fullerene]] cages, which can trap atoms such as La to form La@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; or La@C&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt; for example. A non-fullerene example is [As@Ni&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;, an ion in which one As atom is trapped in a cage formed by the other 32 atoms.

==Non-stoichiometric formulas==

{{Main|Non-stoichiometric compound}}

Chemical formulas most often use [[integer]]s for each element. However, there is a whole class of compounds, called [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s, that cannot be represented by small integers. Such a formula might be written using [[decimal fraction]]s, as in Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O, or it might include a variable part represented by a letter, as in Fe&lt;sub&gt;1–x&lt;/sub&gt;O, where x is normally much less than 1.

==General forms for organic compounds==
Chemical formula used for a series of compounds that differ from each other by a constant unit is called '''general formula'''. Such a series is called the [[homologous series]], while its members are called homologs.&lt;br /&gt;
For example [[alcohols]] : C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;(2n + 1)&lt;/sub&gt;OH  (''n'' ≥  1)

==Hill System==
{{main|Hill system}}
The '''Hill system''' is a system of writing chemical formulas such that the number of [[carbon]] [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]] is indicated first, the number of [[hydrogen]] atoms next, and then the number of all other [[chemical element]]s subsequently, in [[alphabetical order]]. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.  This deterministic system enables straightforward sorting and searching of compounds.

'''Coleoptera''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|oʊ|l|iː|ˈ|ɒ|p|t|ər|ə}}), an order commonly called '''Beetles''', is an order of [[insect]]s; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κολεός}}, ''koleos'', &quot;sheath&quot;; and {{lang|grc|πτερόν}}, ''pteron'', &quot;wing&quot;, thus &quot;sheathed wing&quot;, which contains more [[species]] than any other order in the [[animal|animal kingdom]], constituting almost 25% of all known life-forms.&lt;ref name=insenc&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=Jerry A. |editor2-last=Cardé|editor2-first=Ring T.|editor1-first=Vincent H. |editor1-last=Resh |editor1-link= |title=Encyclopedia of Insects |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wrMcPwAACAAJ |accessdate=14 November 2010 |type=|edition=2 (illustrated) |series= |volume= |date= |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |location=|isbn=9780123741448 |pages=1132 |chapter=Coleoptera |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40% of all described insect species are beetles (about 400,000 species&lt;ref&gt;P. M. Hammond 1992. Species inventory. pp. 17–39 in Global Biodiversity, Status of the Earth’s Living Resources, B. Groombridge, ed. Chapman and Hall, London. 585 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;), and new species are discovered frequently. Some estimates put the total number of species, described and undescribed, at as high as 100 million, but 1 million is a more likely figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/2009/pubs/nlsaw-2nd-complete.pdf |title=Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World |author=Arthur D. Chapman |edition=2nd |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts]] |isbn=978-0-642-56861-8 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest taxonomic family, the [[Curculionidae]] (the weevils or snout beetles), also belongs to this order .

The diversity of beetles is very wide-ranging. Being found in almost all habitats, but are not known to occur in the [[sea]] or in the [[polar region]]s. They interact with their [[ecosystem]]s in several ways. They often feed on [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]], break down animal and plant debris, and eat other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species are prey of various animals including birds and mammals. Certain species are agricultural pests, such as the [[Colorado potato beetle]] ''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'', the [[boll weevil]] ''Anthonomus grandis'', the [[red flour beetle]] ''Tribolium castaneum'', and the mungbean or cowpea beetle ''Callosobruchus maculatus'', while other species of beetles are important controls of agricultural pests. For example, beetles in the family [[Coccinellidae]] (&quot;ladybirds&quot; or &quot;ladybugs&quot;) consume [[aphid]]s, [[scale insect]]s, [[thrips]], and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.

Species in the order Coleoptera are generally characterized by a particularly hard [[exoskeleton]] and hard forewings ([[elytron|elytra]]). This elytra separates it from most other insect species, except for a few [[Hemiptera]] species. The beetle's exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates called [[sclerite]]s, separated by thin sutures. This design creates the armored defenses of the beetle while maintaining flexibility. The general [[anatomy]] of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and [[appendage]]s may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The internal morphology is like other insects, however some factors are unique. Such as species of diving beetles, who use air bubbles in order to dive under the water, which could last a respectable period of time due to [[passive diffusion]] allowing oxygen to transfer from the water into the bubble.

Beetles are [[Endopterygota|endopterygotes]], which means that they undergo complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], a [[biological process]] by which an [[animal]] physically [[developmental biology|develops]] after [[birth]] or hatching, undergoing a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in the its [[body]] structure. Coleopteran species have an extremely intricate behavior when mating, using such methods as pheromones for communication to locate potential mates. Males may fight for females using very elongated [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s, causing a strong divergence between males and females in [[sexual dimorphism]].

==Etymology==
Coleoptera comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''koleopteros'', literally &quot;sheath-wing,&quot; from ''koleos'' meaning &quot;sheath,&quot; and ''pteron'', meaning &quot;wing.&quot; The name ''Coleoptera'' was given by [[Aristotle]] for the elytra, a hardened shield-like forewing. According to common vernacular, species of Coleoptera may go by an array of names, including [[firefly|fireflies]], [[Phyllophaga (genus)|June bugs]], [[Coccinellidae|ladybugs]], [[weevil]]s, and the obvious beetles.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; The word beetle comes from the [[Old English]] word ''bitela'', literally meaning small biter, deriving from the word ''bitel'', which means biting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Coleoptera |title=Coleoptera|author=Harper, Douglas |publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and diversity==
Beetles are one of the largest orders of insects, with 350,000–400,000 species in four suborders ([[Adephaga]], [[Archostemata]], [[Myxophaga]], and [[Polyphaga]]), making up about 40% of all insect species described. Even though classification at the family level is a bit unstable, there are about 500 recognized families and subfamilies.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilliott | first=Cedric | title=Entomology | publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | date=August 1995 | edition=2 | pages= | isbn=0-306-44967-6 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DrTKxvZq_IcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Insect+classification+based+on+winged+and+wingless#v=onepage&amp;q=coleoptera&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first proposed estimates of the total number of beetle species on the planet, based on field data rather than on catalog numbers. The technique used for his original estimate, possibly as many as 12,000,000 species, was criticized, and was later revised, with estimates of 850,000–4,000,000 species proposed. Some 70–95% of all beetle species, depending on the estimate, remain undescribed. The beetle fauna is not equally well known in all parts of the world. For example, the known beetle diversity of Australia is estimated at 23,000 species in 3265 genera and 121 families. This is slightly lower than reported for North America, a land mass of similar size with 25,160 species in 3526 genera and 129 families. While other predictions show there could be as many as 28,000 species in North America, including those currently undescribed, a realistic estimate of the little-studied Australian beetle fauna's true diversity could vary from 80,000 to 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foottit 09&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Insect biodiversity: science and society | author=Foottit, Robert G. | year=2009 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=1405151420 | coauthor=Peter Holdridge Adler|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LBZHpYY2_8gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=Biodiversity%20of%20Coleoptera&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterns of beetle diversity can be used to illustrate factors that have led to the success of the group as a whole. Based on estimates for all 165 families, more than 358,000 species of beetles have been described and are considered valid. Most species (about 62%) are in six extremely diverse families, each with at least 20,000 described species: [[Curculionidae]], [[Staphylinidae]], [[Chysomelidae]], [[Carabidae]], [[Scarabaeidae]], and [[Cerambycidae]]. The smaller families account for 22% of the total species - 127 families with fewer than 1000 described species and 29 families with 1000–6000 described species. So, the success of beetles as a whole is driven not only by several extremely diverse lineages, but also by a high number of moderately successful lineages. The patterns seen today indicate that beetles went through a massive adaptive radiation early in their evolutionary history, with many of the resulting lineages flourishing through hundreds of millions of years to the present. The adaptive radiation of angiosperms helped drive the diversification of beetles, as four of the six megadiverse families of beetles are primarily angiosperm-feeders:[[Curculionidae]], [[Chysomelidae]], [[Scarabaeidae]], and [[Cerambycidae]]. However, even without the phytophagous groups, lineages of predators, scavengers, and fungivores are tremendously successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foottit 09&quot;/&gt; Coleoptera are found in nearly all natural habitats, including freshwater and marine habitats, everywhere there is vegetative foliage, from trees and their bark to flowers, leaves, and underground near roots- even inside plants in galls, in every plant tissue including dead or decaying ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gullan&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gullan |first=P.J. |coauthors=P.S.

==External Morphology==

Beetles are generally characterized by a particularly hard [[exoskeleton]] and hard forewings ([[elytron|elytra]]). The beetle's exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates called [[sclerite]]s, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general [[anatomy]] of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and [[appendage]]s may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

[[File:Scarabaeus viettei head.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''[[Scarabaeus viettei]]'' (syn. ''Madateuchus viettei'', Scarabaeidae) showing a &quot;shovel head&quot; adaptation.]]

[[File:Cephalota circumdata circumdata front.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Head of ''[[Cephalota circumdata]]'', showing the [[compound eye]]s and [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]]]]

===Head===

The head, having mouthparts projecting forward or sometimes downturned, is usually heavily sclerotized and varies in size.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt; The eyes are [[compound eye|compound]] and may display remarkable adaptability, as in the case of [[whirligig beetle]]s (family Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Other species also have divided eyes – some [[longhorn beetle]]s (family Cerambycidae) and weevils – while many have eyes that are notched to some degree. A few beetle genera also possess [[ocellus|ocelli]], which are small, simple eyes usually situated farther back on the head (on the [[Vertex (anatomy)|vertex]]).

Beetles' [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] are primarily organs of smell, but may also be used to feel out a beetle's environment physically. They may also be used in some families during mating, or among a few beetles for defence. Antennae vary greatly in form within the Coleoptera, but are often similar within any given family. In some cases, males and females of the same species will have different antennal forms. Antennae may be [[Wiktionary:clavate|clavate]] ([[Wiktionary:flabellate|flabellate]] and [[Wiktionary:lamellate|lamellate]] are sub-forms of clavate, or clubbed antennae), [[Wiktionary:filiform|filiform]], [[Wiktionary:geniculate|geniculate]], [[Wiktionary:moniliform|moniliform]], [[Wiktionary:pectinate|pectinate]], or [[Wiktionary:serrate|serrate]].

Beetles have [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] similar to those of [[grasshopper]]s. Of these parts, the most commonly known are probably the [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]], which appear as large pincers on the front of some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see [[#Defence|defence]], below). Two pairs of finger-like [[appendage]]s are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. These are the maxillary and labial palpi. In many species the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with the males' enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

===Thorax===
The thorax is [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] into the two discernible parts, the pro- and pterathorax. The pterathorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separate in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle &quot;section&quot; is a hard plate called the [[pronotum]], which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's [[insect wing|wings]]. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.

[[File:Acilius sulcatus.gemeiner furchenschwimmer.jpg|thumb|''[[Acilius sulcatus]]'', a diving beetle showing hind legs adapted for life in water]]

===Extremities===
The multi-segmented [[arthropod leg|legs]] end in two to five small segments called tarsi. Like many other insect orders beetles bear claws, usually one pair, on the end of the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs may be variously modified and adapted for other uses. Among aquatic families – [[Dytiscidae]], [[Haliplidae]], many species of [[Hydrophilidae]] and others – the legs, most notably the last pair, are modified for swimming and often bear rows of long hairs to aid this purpose. Other beetles have [[fossorial]] legs that are widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and [[clown beetle]]s (family [[Histeridae]]). The hind legs of some beetles, such as [[flea beetle]]s (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), are enlarged and designed for jumping.

===Wings===
The elytra are connected to the pterathorax; so named because it is where the wings are connected (''pteron'' meaning &quot;wing&quot; in Greek).&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; The elytra are not used for [[insect flight|flight]], but tend to cover the hind part of the body and protect the second pair of [[insect wing|wings]] (''alae''). They must be raised in order to move the hind flight wings. A beetle's flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. In some beetles, the ability to fly has been lost. These include some [[ground beetle]]s (family Carabidae) and some &quot;true weevils&quot; (family [[Curculionidae]]), but also desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, with the best known example being the [[glowworm|glow-worms]] of the family [[Phengodidae]], in which the females are [[Larviform female|larviform]] throughout their lives.

===Abdomen===
The [[abdomen]] is the section behind the metathorax, made up of a series of rings, each with a hole for breathing and respiration, called a spiracle; composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura (singular: pleuron) are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less scelortized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, however some species (for example,, ''[[Mordellidae]]'') have articulating sternal lobes.&lt;ref name=&quot;american&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael A. Ivie |title=American Beetles: Polyphaga: Scarabaeoidea through Curculionoidea |series=Volume 2 of American Beetles |editor=Ross H. Arnett &amp; Michael Charles Thomas |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=9780849309540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal Morphology==
[[File:Internal morphology of Coleoptera.svg|450px|center|thumb|A diagram showing the general internal anatomy of species of coleoptera.]]

===Digestive system===
The [[digestive system]] of beetles is primarily based on plants which they for the most part feed upon, with mostly the anterior [[midgut]] performing digestion. Although, in predatory species (for example,, [[Carabidae]]) most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In [[Elateridae]] species, the predatory larvae defecate enzymes on their prey, with digestion being extraorally.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; The alimentary canal basically comprises of a short narrow [[pharynx]], a widened expansion, the [[crop]] and a poorly developed [[gizzard]]. After there is a midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of [[cecum]], with a hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six [[Malpighian tubule]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

===Nervous system===
The [[nervous system]] in beetles contains all the types found in insects, varying between different species. With three thoracic and seven or eight abdominal ganglia can be distinguished to that in which all the thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

===Respiratory system===
[[Oxygen]] is obtained via a [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]]. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called [[spiracle]]s, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibers.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; This bubble may be held under the elytra or it may be trapped against the body using specialized hairs. The bubble usually covers one or more spiracles so the insect can breathe air from the bubble while submerged. An air bubble provides an insect with only a short-term supply of oxygen, but thanks to its unique physical properties, oxygen will diffuse into the bubble and displacing the nitrogen, called [[passive diffusion]], however the volume of the bubble eventually diminishes and the beetle will have to return to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmidt-Nielsen|first= Knut|title=Animal Physiology: Adaptation and Environment |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Af7IwQWJoCMC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=oxygen+diffusing+into+a+bubble#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=6 March 2010|edition=5 (illustrated)|date=Jan 15, 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=|isbn=0521570980  |pages=55 |chapter=Insect Respiration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulatory system===
Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system. Beetles have [[hemolymph]] instead of [[blood]] like other insect species, the [[open circulatory system]] of the beetle is driven by a tube-like heart attached to the top inside of the thorax. Some species of [[Dytiscidae|diving beetle]]s ('''Dytiscidae''') carry a bubble of air with them whenever they dive beneath the water surface.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

===Excretory system===
===Specialized organs===
Different glands specialize for different pheromones produced for finding mates. Pheromones from species of [[Rutelinea]] are produced from [[epithelium|epithelial cell]]s lining the inner surface of the apical abdominal segments or amino acid based pheromones of [[Melolonthinae]] from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. [[Dermestidae|Dermestid]]s produce [[ester]]s, and species of [[Elateridae]] produce [[aldehyde|fatty-acid-derived aldehyde]]s and [[acetate]]s.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; For means of finding a mate also, fireflies (Lampyridae) utilized modified fat body cells woth transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to biosynthetically produce light, or [[bioluminescence]]. The light produce is highly efficient, as it is produced by oxidation of [[Firefly luciferin|luciferin]] by the enzymes [[luciferase]] in the presence of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (adenosine triphospate) and oxygen, producing [[oxyluciferin]], carbon dioxide, and light.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

A notable number of species have developed special glands that produce chemicals for deterring predators (see [[Beetle#Defense and predation|Defense and predation]]). The [[Ground beetle]]'s (of Carabidae) defensive glands, located at the posterior, produce a variety of [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[phenol]]s, [[quinone]]s, [[ester]]s, and [[acid]]s released from an opening at the end of the abdomen. While african carabid beetles (for example,, ''Anthia'' and ''Thermophilium'') employ the same chemicals as ants: [[formic acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1= Evans, Arthur V. |author2= Bellamy, Charles |title= An Inordinate Fondness for Beetles |date=April 2000|publisher= |isbn=0-520-22323-3 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZZ_hfpMo8oAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=The+Beetles+of+the+World#v=onepage&amp;q=defense&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Bombardier beetle]]s have well-developed, like other carabid beetles, pygidial glands that empty from the lateral edges of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers. The first holds [[hydroquinone]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], with the second holding just hydrogen peroxide plus [[catalase]]s. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, forming temperatures of around 100 C, with the breakdown of hydroquinone to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + quinone, with the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; propelling the excretion.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

[[Tympanal organ]]s or hearing organs, which is a membrane (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons, are described in two families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scoble&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scoble|first1=MJ. |title=The Lepidoptera: Form, function, and diversity. |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|isbn=9781402062421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several species of the genus ''[[Cicindela]]'' ('''Cicindelidae''') have ears on the dorsal surface of the first abdominal segment beneath the wing; two tribes tribes in the family [[Dynastinae]] ('''[[Scarabaeidae]]''') have ears just beneath the pronotal shield or neck membrane. The ears of both families are to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence that they function to detect the presence of bats via there ultrasonic echolocation. Even though beetles constitute a large order and live in a variety of [[Ecological niche|niche]]s, examples of hearing is surprisingly lacking in species, though it is likely that most are just undiscovered.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

==Reproduction and development==
Beetles are members of [[Endopterygota]], which means like most other insects under complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], which consists of four main stages: the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], the [[larva]], the [[pupa]], and the [[imago]] or adult. The larvae are commonly called [[Larva|grubs]] and the pupa are called cocoons.

===Mating===
[[File:Punctate Flower Chafer.jpg|thumb|[[Punctate flower chafer]]s (''Neorrhina punctata'', Scarabaeidae) mating]]
Beetles may display extremely intricate behavior when mating. Pheromone communication is likely to be important in the location of a mate.
Different species use different chemicals for their pheromones. Some scarab beetles (for example,, [[Rutelinae]]) utilize pheromones derived from [[fatty acid synthesis]], while other scarab beetles use [[amino acid]]s and terpenoid compounds (for example,, [[Melolonthinae]]). Another way species of Coleoptera find mates is the use of biosynthesized light, or [[bioluminescence]]. This special form of a mating call is confined to [[Firefly|fireflies]] ('''Lampyridae''') by the use of abdominal light producing organs. The males and females engage in complex dialogue before mating, identifying different species by differences in duration, flight patterns, composition, and intensity.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

Before mating male and females may engage in various forms of behavior. Males and females may stridulate, or vibrate the object they are on. In some species (for example,, Meloidae) the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and stroke his antennae on her head, palps and antennae. In the genus Eupompha of said family, the males draws the antennae along the longitudinal vertex on the male. They may not mate at all if they do not perform the precopulatory ritual.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

Conflict can play a part in the mating rituals of species such as [[burying beetle]]s (genus ''Nicrophorus'') where conflicts between males and females rage until only one of each is left, thus ensuring reproduction by the strongest and fittest. Many male beetles are territorial and will fiercely defend their small patch of territory from intruding males. In such species, the males may often have horns on the head and/or thorax, making their overall body lengths greater than those of the females, unlike most insects. Pairing is generally short but in some cases will last for several hours. During pairing [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]]s are transferred to the female to [[fertilization|fertilize]] the egg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

===Embryogenesis===
===Life Cycle===
[[File:Life cycle of stag beetle.svg|320px|thumb|left|The life cycle of the [[stag beetle]], including the 3 [[instar]]s.]]

====Egg====
A single female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime. Eggs are usually laid according to the substrate the [[larva]] will feed on upon hatching. Among others, they can be laid loose in the substrate (for example, flour beetle), laid in clumps on leaves (for example, [[Colorado potato beetle]]), or individually attached (for example, mungbean beetle and other seed borers) or buried in the medium (for example, carrot weevil).

Parental care varies between species, ranging from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf to certain [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]], which construct underground structures complete with a supply of dung to house and feed their young.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; Other beetles are [[Attelabidae|leaf roller]]s, biting sections of leaves to cause them to curl inwards, then laying their eggs, thus protected, inside.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

====Larva====
[[Image:Curl grub.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Scarabaeoidea|scarabaeiform]] larvae known as a Curl grub.]]
The [[larva]] is usually the principal feeding stage of the beetle [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most [[Buprestidae]] and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species but can be as long as several years. The larva are highly varied amongst species, with a well-developed and sclerotized head and have distinguishable thoracic and abdominal segments (usually the tenth, though sometimes the eight or ninth).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

Beetle larvae can be differentiated from other insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened head, the presence of chewing mouthparts, and [[spiracle]]s along the sides of the body. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles whose larvae are somewhat flattened and are highly mobile are the ground beetles, some rove beetles, and others; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the [[click beetle]] (Elateridae) and [[darkling beetle]] (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as [[click beetle|wireworms]]. Beetles in the families of the [[Scarabaeoidea]] have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, but more commonly known as grubs.

All beetle larvae go through several [[instar]]s, which are the developmental stages between each [[ecdysis|moult]]. In many species the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the [[planidium]]) is highly mobile in order to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as [[hypermetamorphosis]]; examples include the [[blister beetle]]s (family Meloidae) and some rove beetles, particularly those of the genus ''[[Aleochara]]''.

====Pupa====
As with all endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from this [[pupa]] emerges a fully formed, sexually mature adult beetle, or [[imago]]. Adults have an extremely variable lifespan, from weeks to years, depending on the species. In some species the pupa may go through all four forms during its development, called hypermetamorphosis (for example,, [[Meloidae]]). Pupae always have no mandibles, or adecticous. In most, the appendages are not attached to the pupae, or they are exarate; with most being obtect in form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

==Behavior==
===Locomotion===
[[File:Photinus pyralis Firefly 2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''[[Photinus pyralis]]'' in midflight.Photinus pyralis Firefly  ]]
Aquatic beetles use several techniques for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Beetles of the family Dytiscidae hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain a layer of air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind [[Arthropod leg|coxa]]e (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Haliplidae |pages=138–143 |author=[[Ross H. Arnett, Jr.|R. H. Arnett, Jr.]] &amp; [[Michael C. Thomas|M. C. Thomas]] |title=[[American Beetles]], Volume 1 |publisher=[[CRC Press]], [[Boca Raton, Florida]] |isbn=0-8493-1925-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[whirligig beetle]]s simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.

The elytra allows beetles and weevils to both fly and move through confined spaces. Doings so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles attached to the wing base; as long as the tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In day-flying species (for example, [[Buprestidae]], [[Scarabaeidae]]), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

===Communication===
Beetles have a variety of ways to communicate. Some of which include a sophisticated chemical language through the use of [[pheromone]]s. From the host tree, the [[mountain pine beetle]] have many forms of communication. They can emit both an aggregative pheromone and an anti-aggregative pheramone. The aggregative pheromone attracts other beetles to the tree, and the anti-aggregative pheromone neutralizes the aggregative pheromone. This helps to avoid the harmful effects of having too many beetles on one tree competing for resources. The mountain pine beetle can also [[stridulate]] to communicate, or rub body parts together to create sound, having a “scraper” on their abdomen that they rub against a grooved surface on the underside of their left wing cover to create a sound that is not audible to humans. Once the female beetles have arrived on a suitable pine tree host, they begin to stridulate and produce aggregative pheromones to attract other unmated males and females. New females arrive and do the same as they land and bore into the tree. As the males arrive, they enter the galleries that the females have tunneled, and begin to stridulate to let the females know they have arrived, and to also warn others that the female in that gallery is taken. At this point, the female stops producing aggregative pheromones and starts producing anti-aggregative pheromone to deter more beetles from coming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetle love&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/v-g/dpp-mpb/sec2/dpp-mpb2b.aspx |title=Mountain Pine Beetle - Beetle Love |publisher=Parks Canada |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since species of Coleoptera use environmental stimuli to communicate, they are affected by the climate. [[Microclimate]]s, such as wind or temperature, can disturb the use of pheromones; wind would blow the pheromones while they ravel through the air. Stridulating can be interrupted when the stimulus is vibrated by something else.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetle love&quot;/&gt;

===Parental care===
[[File:Scarabaeus laticollis.jpg|200px|thumb|right|a dung beetle rolling dung, near the giant tomb ''Sa Ena 'e Thomes'', Sardinia, Italy]]
Among insect, parental care is very uncommon, only found in a few species. Some beetles also display this unique social behavior.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; One theory states why there is parental care is that it is necessary for the survival of the larvae, protecting them from adverse environmental conditions and predators. One species, a rover beetle (''[[Bledius spectabilis]]'') displays both causes for parental care: physical and biotic environmental factors. Said species lives in [[salt marsh]]es, so the eggs and/or larvae are endangered by the rising [[tide]]. The maternal beetle will patrol the eggs and larva and apply the appropriate burrowing behavior the keep them from flooding and from [[asphyxiation|asphyxiating]]. Another advantage is that the mother protects the eggs and larvae from the predatory carabid beetles species ''[[Dicheirotrichus gustavi]]'' and from the [[parasitism|parasitoid]] wasp species ''[[Barycnemis blediator]]''. Up to 15% of larvae are killed by this parasitoid wasp, being only protected by maternal beetles in their [[Lair|dens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brill |first=Leiden E.J. |date=Oct., 1989  |title=Observations on certain lepidopterous and hymenopterous parasites of Polistes wasps |journal=Behaviour |publisher= |volume=110  |issue= 1/4 |pages=pp. 76–92 (1–4)|doi=   |jstor=4534785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of [[Dung beetle]]s also display a form of parental care. Dung beetles, from which their name is derived, collect the feces, or &quot;dung&quot; and roll it into a ball, sometimes being up to 50 times their own weight; albeit sometimes it is also used to store food. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, with the female hitch-hiking or simply following behind. In some cases the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the dung ball. They will then [[mating|mate]] underground. After the mating, both or one of them will prepare the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of [[mass provisioning]]. Some species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hanski|first1=Ilkka |last2=Yves  |first2=Cambefort  | title=Dung Beetle Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1991 |pages=626–672 |isbn=0691087393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feeding===
Besides being abundant and varied, beetles are able to exploit the widediversity of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. [[Ground beetle]]s and [[rove beetle]]s (family Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and will catch and consume many other [[arthropod]]s and small prey such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zin.ru/animalia/coleoptera/eng/biol3.htm |title=feeding |author=A.L. Lobanov |year=2002 |work=Beetle Biology And Ecology|publisher=Beetles (Coleoptera) and Coleopterologist |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decaying organic matter is a primary diet for many species. This can range from [[Feces|dung]], which is consumed by [[coprophagous]] species such as certain [[dung beetle|scarab beetle]]s (family Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by [[necrophagous]] species such as the [[carrion beetle]]s (family Silphidae). Some of the beetles found within [[Feces|dung]] and carrion are in fact predatory, such as the [[clown beetle]]s, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects.

==Ecology==
===Defense and predation===
[[File:Pegesimallus sp robberfly.jpg|thumb|Beetles may be preyed upon by other insects such as [[Asilidae|robber flies]]]]

Beetles and their larvae have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or [[parasitoid]]s. These include [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]], toxicity, and active defense. [[Camouflage]] involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the [[leaf beetle]]s (family Chrysomelidae) or [[weevil]]s. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans&quot;/&gt;{{rp|126}} For example, the Giant African longhorn beetle (''Petrognatha gigas'') which resembles the mossa nd bark of the tree from which it feeds on.

Another defense that often uses color or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry. A number of [[longhorn beetle]]s (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to [[wasp]]s, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. This defense can be found to a lesser extent in other beetle families, such as the scarab beetles. Beetles may combine their color mimicry with behavioral mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many beetle species, including [[Coccinellidae|ladybirds]], [[blister beetle]]s, and [[Lycidae|lycid beetles]] can secrete distasteful or toxic substances to make them unpalatable or even poisonous. These same species often exhibit [[aposematism]], where bright or contrasting color patterns warn away potential predators, and there are, not surprisingly, a great many beetles and other insects that [[mimicry|mimic]] these chemically protected species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Gemeiner Widderbock 4483.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Clytus arietis]]'' ([[Longhorn beetle|Cerambycidae]]), a wasp mimic]]
Chemical defense is another important defense found amongst species of Coleoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors. Others may utilize behaviors that would be done when releasing noxious chemicals (for example,, [[Tenebrionidae]]). Chemical defense may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection from a wide range of microbes, and repellents. Some species release chemicals in the form of a spray with surprising accuracy, such as [[ground beetle]]s (Carabidae), may spray chemicals from their abdomen to repel predators. Some species take advantage of the plants from which they feed, and sequester the chemicals from the plant that would protect it and incorporate into their own defense. African carabid beetles (for example,, ''Anthia'' and ''Thermophilium'') employ the same chemicals sued by ants, while [[Bombardier beetle]]s have a their own unique separate gland, spraying potential predators from far distances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans&quot;/&gt;{{rp|126}}

Large [[ground beetle]]s and longhorn beetles may defend themselves using strong [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]] and/or spines or horns to forcibly persuade a predator to seek out easier prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans&quot;/&gt;{{rp|126}} Many species have large protrusions from their thorax and head such as the [[Rhinoceros beetle]], which can be used to defended themselves from predators. Many species of weevil that feed out in the open on leaves of plants react to attack by employing a &quot;drop-off reflex.&quot; Even further, some will combine it with [[thanatosis]], which they will close up their legs, antennae, mandibles, ect. and use their cryptic coloration to blend in with the background. Species with varied coloration do not do this as they can not camaflouge.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;{{rp|199}}

===Parasitism===
There are over 1000 known species of beetles to be either parasitic, predatory, or commensals in the nests of ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/compendium/coleop~1.html |title=Coleoptera |author=Meyer, John R. |date=8 March 2005 |publisher=Department of Entomology, NC State University |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most beetle larvae can be considered parasites, as they feed on the plants and live inside the bark of trees and plants. Though there are a few species that are ectoparasitic to mammals, such as ''[[Platypsyllus castoris]]'', which is affects beavers ('''[[Beaver|Castor]]''' spp.). This beaver beetle parasite is a parasite as both an adult and a larva, with the appropriate modifications. They are wingless and eyeless with a striking dorso-ventral flattening. Additionally, P. castoris, has a remarkably modified antennal club, with antennomeres 3-11 shortened, globularly compacted, and partly enclosed in a scoop shaped antennomere 2, as is also found in '''[[Gyrinidae]]''' and '''[[Dryopidae]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peck |first1=Stewart B.|year=2006 |title=Distribution and biology of the ectoparasitic beaver beetle Platypsyllus castoris Ritsema in North America (Coleoptera: Leiodidae: Platypsyllinae)|journal=Insecta Mundi |publisher=Carleton University, Canada |volume=20 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&amp;context=insectamundi |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |issue=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

other parasites include those who are parasitoids of other invertebrates, such as the [[small hive beetle]] (''Aethina tumida'') infecting [[Honey bee]] hives. The larvae tunnel through comb towards stored honey or pollen, damaging or destroying cappings and comb in the process. Larvae defecate in honey and the honey becomes discolored from the feces, which causes fermentation and a frothiness in the honey; the honey develops a characteristic odor of decaying oranges. Damage and fermentation cause honey to run out of combs, destroing large portions in hives and sometimes the extracting rooms. Heavy infestations cause bees to abscond; some beekeepers have reported the rapid collapse of even strong colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1051/apido:2004010 | author = Neumann P, Elzen PJ | year = 2004 | title = The biology of the small hive beetle (''Aethina tumida'', Coleoptera: Nitidulidae): Gaps in our knowledge of an invasive species | url = | journal = Apidologie | volume = 35 | issue = 3| pages = 229–247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollination===
===Mutualism===
Amongst most orders of insects, mutualism is not common, however there are some examples in species of Coleoptera. Such as the [[Ambrosia beetle]], the [[Ambrosia fungus]], and probably bacteria. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery; so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles can not eat due to toxins, which uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome it's host tree defenses and to provide nutrition for their larvae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malloch&quot;&gt;Malloch, D., and M. Blackwell. 1993. Dispersal biology of ophiostomatoid fungi. p. 195-206. In: Ceratocystis and Ophiostoma: Taxonomy, Ecology and Pathology. Eds., Wingfield, M.J., K.A. Seifert, and J.F. Webber. APS, St. Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ambrosia beetle life cycle.svg|600px|thumb|center|

3: The larva pupates and then ecloses.]]

The beetle-fungal mutualism is chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide. The molecule's selective toxicity toward the beetle's fungal antagonist, combined with the prevalence and localization of its bacterial source, indicates an insect-microbe association that is both mutualistic and coevolved. This unexpected finding in a well-studied system indicates that mutualistic associations between insects and antibiotic-producing bacteria are more common than currently recognized and that identifying their small-molecule mediators can provide a powerful search strategy for therapeutically useful antimicrobial compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malloch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francke-Grossmann H. (1967). ''Ectosymbiosis in wood inhabiting insects''. In: M. Henry (ed.) ''Symbiosis'', Vol. 2. Academic Press, NewYork. pp.141-205&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commensalism===
[[Pseudoscorpion]]s are small arachnids with a flat, pear-shaped body and pincers that resemble those of [[scorpion]]s (only distant relatives), usually ranging from {{convert|2|to|8|mm|2|in}} in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/pseudoscorpion.htm |title=Pseudoscorpions |year=2011 |work=Insect Advice from Extension |publisher=College of Agricultural Sciences |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their small size allows them to hitch rides under the elytra of a giant harlequin beetle to be dispersed over wide areas while simultaneously being protected from predators. They may also find mating partners as other individuals join them on the beetle. This would be a form of parasitism if the beetle was harmed in the process, however the beetle is, presumably, unaffected by the presence of the hitchhikers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vines |last=Gail |title=Hitchhiking pseudoscorpions take beetles for a ride |journal=Science |date= 18 April 1992 |issue=1817 |url= http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13418173.500--science-hitchhiking-pseudoscorpions-take-beetles-for-a-ride-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nearctica.com/ecology/pops/commens.htm#pseudoscorpion |title= Ecology - Population Ecology - Commensalism |first=Robert W. |last=Poole |year=2004 |work= Nearctica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prachtkäfer aus der Grube Messel.JPG|thumb|right|Fossil [[Buprestidae|buprestid beetle]] from the [[Eocene]] [[Messel pit]], which retains its [[structural color]]]]

There is a large number of important fossil sites worldwide containing beetles from the Cretaceous. Most of them are located in Europe and Asia and belong to the temperate climate zone during the Cretaceous. A few of the fossil sites mentioned in the chapter Jurassic also shed some light on the early cretaceous beetle fauna (for example, the Yixian formation in Liaoning, North China).&lt;ref name=&quot;liaoning&quot;/&gt; Further important sites from the Lower Cretaceous include the Crato Fossil Beds in the Araripe basin in the [[Ceará]], North Brazil as well as overlying Santana formation, with the latter was situated near the paleoequator, or the position of the earth's equator in the geologic past as defined for a specific geologic period. In [[Spain]] there are important sites near [[Serra del Montsec|Montsec]] and [[Las Hoyas]]. In Australia the Koonwarra fossil beds of the Korumburra group, [[South Gippsland]], Victoria is noteworthy. Important fossil sites from the Upper Cretaceous are [[Kzyl-Dzhar]] in South [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Arkagala]] in Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Phylogenetic chart of Coleoptera.svg|300px|thumb|left|The phylogenetic growth of three different trophic levels in Coleoptera by number of genera.]]

===Evolution===
The oldest known insect that resembles species of Coleoptera date back to the [[Permian|Lower Permian]] (270 mya), though they instead have 13-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]e, [[elytra]] with more fully developed venation and more irregular longitudinal ribbing, and an abdomen and [[ovipositor]] extending beyond the apex of the elytra. The oldest true beetle, that is having features that include 11-segmented antennae, regular longitudinal ribbing on the elytra, and having [[genitalia]] that are internal.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;{{rp|186}} At the end of the Permian, the biggest mass extinction in the history history took place, collectively called the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]]: 30% of all insect species became extinct, however, it is the only mass extinction of insects in Earth's history until today.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt;

Consequence do to the P-Tr extinction, there is only little fossil record of insects including beetles from the [[Triassic|Lower Triassic]] (220 mya). Around this time, during the Late Triassic, [[mycetophagous]], or fungus feeding species (e.i. '''[[Cupedidae]]''') appear in the fossil record. In the stages of the Upper Triassic representatives of the [[algophagous]], or algae feeding species (e.i. '''[[Triaplidae]]''' and '''[[Hydrophilidae]]''') begin to appear, as well as predatory water beetles. The first primitive weevils appear (e.i. '''[[Obrienidae]]'''), as well as the first representatives of the rove beetles (e.i. '''[[Staphylinidae]]'''), which show no marked difference in physique compared to recent species.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt;

During the Jurassic (210-145 mya) there was a dramatic increase in the known diversity of family-level Coleoptera.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt; This includes the development and growth of carnivorous and herbivorous species. Species of the superfamily '''[[Chrysomeloidea]]''' are believed to have developed around the same time, which include a wide array of plant host ranging from [[cycad]]s and [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s, to [[Flowering plants|angiosperm]]s.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;{{rp|186}} Close to the Upper Jurassic, the portion of the '''[[Cupedidae]]''' decreased, however at the same time the diversity of the early plant eating, or phytophagous species increased. Most of the recent phytophagous species of Coleoptera feed on flowering plants or angiosperms. It is believed that the increase in diversity of the angiosperms also influenced the diversity of the phytophagous species, which doubled during the Middle Jurassic. However, recently doubts have been raised since the increase of the number of beetle families during the Cretaceous does not correlate with the increase of the number of angiosperm species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Labandeira|first1=C.

Ortuño, Journal of Natural History 2008, 42(19&amp;20), 1405-1408.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the first species with an adaption of both larvae and adults to the aquatic lifestyle are found. [[Whirligig beetle]]s ('''Gyrinidae''') were moderately diverse, although other early beetles (e.i., '''[[Dytiscidae]]''') were less, with the most widespread being the species of '''[[Coptoclavidae]]''', which preyed on aquatic fly larvae.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt;

The time between the [[Paleogene]] and the [[Neogene]], or more recent history is where today's beetles developed. During this time, the continents began to situate themselves to where we see them today. Around 5 million years ago the land bridge between South America and North America was formed, and this is when fauna exchange between Asia and North America started. Even though many recent genera and species already existed during the [[Miocene]], however, their distribution differed considerably from today's.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt;

===Phylogeny===
The suborders diverged in the Permian and [[Triassic]]. Their [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationship is uncertain, with the most popular hypothesis being that [[Polyphaga]] and [[Myxophaga]] are most closely related, with [[Adephaga]] as the [[sister group]] to those two, and [[Archostemata]] as sister to the other three collectively.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;{{rp|186}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Beutel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Phylogenetic relationships of the suborders of Coleoptera (Insecta) | journal = Cladistics | first = R. | last = Beutel | coauthors = F.

The Adephaga is further considered as sister to Myxophaga and Polyphaga, based on their completely sclerotized elytra, reduced number of crossveins in the hind wings, and the folded (as opposed to rolled) hind wings of those three suborders.

Recent cladistic analysis of some of the structural characteristics supports the Polyphaga and Myxophaga hypothesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beutel&quot;/&gt; The membership of the clade Coleoptera is not in dispute, with the exception of the twisted-wing parasites, [[Strepsiptera]]. These odd insects have been regarded as related to the beetle families [[Rhipiphoridae]] and [[Meloidae]], with which they share first-instar larvae that are active, host-seeking triungulins and later-instar larvae that are endoparasites of other insects, or the sister group of beetles, or more distantly related to insects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kukalová&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tolweb.org/coleoptera | title = Coleoptera.

===Taxonomy===
There are about 450,000 species of beetles – representing about 40% of all known insects. Such a large number of species poses special problems for [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification]], with some families consisting of thousands of species and needing further division into subfamilies and tribes. This immense number of species allegedly led evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] to quip, when some theologians asked him what could be inferred about the mind of the Creator from the works of His Creation, that God displayed &quot;an inordinate fondness for beetles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hutchinson | first = G.

* [[Polyphaga]] is the largest suborder, containing more than 300,000 described species in more than 170 families, including [[rove beetle]]s (Staphylinidae), [[scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]]s (Scarabaeidae), [[blister beetle]]s (Meloidae), [[stag beetle]]s (Lucanidae) and [[Curculionidae|true weevils]] (Curculionidae). These beetles can be identified by the cervical [[sclerite]]s (hardened parts of the head used as points of attachment for muscles) absent in the other suborders.
* [[Adephaga]] contains about 10 families of largely predatory beetles, includes [[ground beetle]]s (Carabidae), [[Dytiscidae]] and [[whirligig beetle]]s (Gyrinidae). In these beetles, the [[testes]] are tubular and the first abdominal sternum (a plate of the [[exoskeleton]]) is divided by the hind [[Arthropod leg|coxae]] (the basal joints of the beetle's legs).
* [[Archostemata]] contains four families of mainly wood-eating beetles, including [[reticulated beetle]]s (Cupedidae) and the [[telephone-pole beetle]].
* [[Myxophaga]] contains about 100 described species in four families, mostly very small, including [[Hydroscaphidae]] and the genus ''[[Sphaerius]]''.

==Relationship to people==
===As pests===
[[File:Potato beetle larvae.jpg|thumb|Larvae of the [[Colorado potato beetle]], ''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'']]
Many agricultural, forestry, and household insect pests are beetles. These include the following:
* The [[Colorado potato beetle]], ''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'', is a notorious pest of [[potato]] plants. Crops are destroyed and the beetle can only be treated by employing expensive [[pesticide]]s, many of which it has begun to develop [[pesticide resistance|resistance]] to. As well as potatoes, suitable hosts can be a number of plants from the potato family ([[Solanaceae]]), such as [[nightshade]], [[tomato]], [[aubergine]] and [[capsicum]].
* The [[boll weevil]], ''Anthonomus grandis'', has cost cotton producers in the [[United States]] billions of dollars since it first entered that country.
* The [[bark beetle]]s ''Hylurgopinus rufipes'' and ''[[Scolytus multistriatus]]'', the [[elm leaf beetle]], ''Pyrrhalta luteola'', and other beetles attack [[elm]] trees. The bark beetles are important elm pests because they carry [[Dutch elm disease]] as they move from infected breeding sites to feed on healthy elm trees. The spread of the fungus by the beetle has led to the devastation of elm trees in many parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], notably in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].
[[File:Tribolium castaneum87-300.jpg|thumb|[[Red flour beetle]], ''Tribolium castaneum'']]
* [[Flour beetle]]s are pests of [[cereal]] [[silo]]s. They feed on [[wheat]] and other [[grain]]s and are adapted to survive in very dry environments. They are a major pest in the [[agricultural industry]] and are highly resistant to [[insecticide]]s.
* The [[death watch beetle]], ''Xestobium rufovillosum'', (family [[Anobiidae]]) is of considerable importance as a pest of older wooden buildings in [[Great Britain]]. It attacks [[hardwood]]s such as [[oak]] and [[chestnut]], always where some fungal decay has taken or is taking place. It is thought that the actual introduction of the pest into buildings takes place at the time of construction.
* Coconut hispine beetle, ''[[Brontispa longissima]]'', feeds on young [[leaves]] and damages [[seedlings]] and mature [[coconut]] [[Palm tree|palms]]. On September 27, 2007, [[Philippines]]' [[Metro Manila]] and 26 [[provinces]] were [[quarantined]] due to having been infested with this [[Pest (organism)|pest]] (to save the $800-million Philippine [[coconut]] [[industry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=91109 |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |title=Beetles infest coconuts in Manila, 26 provinces |author=Amy R. Remo |date=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[mountain pine beetle]] normally attacks mature or weakened [[lodgepole pine]]. It can be the most destructive insect pest of mature pine forests. The current infestation in British Columbia is the largest Canada has ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpb.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/biology/introduction_e.html |title=The Mountain Pine Beetle in British Columbia |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=August 19, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As beneficial===
[[File:Lady-beetle-close-up.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Coccinella septempunctata]]'', a beneficial beetle]]
A number of insects are beneficial to humans, usually by controlling the populations of pests.

Both the larvae and adults of some ladybugs (family [[Coccinellidae]]) are found in [[aphid]] colonies. Other ladybugs feed on [[scale insect]]s and [[mealybug]]s. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on other things, such as small [[caterpillar]]s, young [[plant bug]]s, [[honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] and [[nectar]].

[[Ground beetle]]s (family Carabidae) are common [[predator]]s of many different insects and other arthropods, including fly eggs, caterpillars, wireworms and others.

Plant-feeding beetles are often important beneficial insects, controlling problem weeds. Some [[flea beetle]]s of the genus ''[[Aphthona]]'' feed on ''[[Euphorbia esula]]'' (leafy spurge, [[Euphorbiaceae]]), a considerable weed of rangeland in western North America.

Dung beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabidae) have been successfully used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies and parasitic worms that breed in cattle dung. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility and nutrient cycling. The [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] (1965–1985), led by Dr. [[George Bornemissza]] of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization]] introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe and effectively reduced the bush fly (''[[Musca vetustissima]]'') population by 90%. 

Some farmers develop [[beetle bank]]s to foster and provide cover for beneficial beetles.

Some beetles of the family [[Dermestidae]] are often used in [[taxidermy]] and preparation of scientific specimens to clean bones of remaining soft tissue.

===As food===
===In art===
Many beetles have beautiful and durable elytra that have been used as a material in arts, with [[Beetlewing]] the best example. Sometimes they're also incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance.

Whole beetles, either by themselves or encased in clear plastic, are also made into everything from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewelry. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus [[Zopherus]] are made into living [[brooch]]es by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains. This is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.

===In ancient culture===
[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian scene depicting a [[Dung beetle|scarab beetle]]]]

Several species of [[dung beetle]], most notably ''[[Dung beetle#Scarab_in_Ancient_Egypt|Scarabaeus sacer]]'' (often referred to as &quot;scarab&quot;), enjoyed a sacred status among the [[ancient Egyptian]]s, as the creatures were likened to the major god [[Khepri]]. Many thousands of amulets and stamp seals have been excavated that depict the scarab. In many artifacts, the scarab is depicted pushing the sun along its course in the sky, much as scarabs push or roll balls of dung to their brood sites. During and following the [[New Kingdom]], scarab amulets were often placed over the heart of the mummified deceased.

===In modern culture===

Iconic beetles such as [[Coccinellidae|ladybugs]] and [[Lampyridae|fireflies]] are found throughout Western folklore and popular culture.

Large beetles are used for [[insect fighting]] in some Asian countries.

The [[Japanese Rhinoceros Beetle]] is very popular as a childhood pet in Japan, and has found its way into [[anime]], [[Video Game|video games]], etc.

The study of beetles is called '''coleopterology''' (from ''Coleoptera'', see above, and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''), and its practitioners are ''[[list of coleopterists|coleopterists]]''. Coleopterists have formed organizations to facilitate the study of beetles. Among these is [[The Coleopterists Society]], an [[international organization]] based in the United States. Such organizations may have both professionals and amateurs interested in beetles as members. 

Research in this field is often published in [[scientific journal|peer-reviewed journals]] specific to the field of coleopterology, though journals dealing with general entomology also publish many papers on various aspects of beetle biology. Some of the journals specific to beetle research are:
*''[[The Coleopterist]]'' (United Kingdom beetle fauna)
*''[[The Coleopterists Bulletin]]'' (published by The Coleopterists Society)
*''[[Elytron (journal)|Elytron]]'' (published by the [[European Association of Coleopterology]])

The '''Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde''' is a [[turbojet]]-powered [[supersonic]] passenger [[airliner]], a [[supersonic transport]] (SST). It was a product of an Anglo-French government treaty, combining the manufacturing efforts of [[Aérospatiale]] and the [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. First flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued commercial flights for 27 years.

Among other [[#Scheduled flights|destinations]], Concorde flew regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from [[London Heathrow]] (British Airways) and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]] (Air France) to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]], profitably flying these routes at record speeds, in less than half the time of other airliners.

With only 20 aircraft built, their development represented a substantial economic loss, in addition to which [[Air France]] and British Airways were subsidised by their governments to buy them. As a result of the type’s [[Air France Flight 4590|only crash]] on 25 July 2000 and other factors, its [[#Retirement|retirement]] flight was on 26 November 2003.

[[#Naming|Concorde's name]] reflects the development agreement between the United Kingdom and France. In the UK, any or all of the type—unusual for an aircraft—are known simply as &quot;Concorde&quot;. The aircraft is regarded by many as an aviation icon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concorde beats&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1950s, the United Kingdom, France, United States, and [[Soviet Union]] were considering developing supersonic transport. The British [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] and the French [[Sud Aviation]] were both working on designs, called the [[Bristol 223|Type 223]] and [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle|Super-Caravelle]], respectively. Both were largely funded by their respective governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot;&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a &quot;Early History.&quot;] ''concordesst.com''.

The designs were both ready to start prototype construction in the early 1960s, but the cost was so great that the British government made it a requirement that BAC look for international co-operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot;/&gt; Approaches were made to a number of countries, but only France showed real interest. The development project was negotiated as an international [[treaty]] between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 28 November 1962. By this time, both companies had been merged into new ones; thus, the Concorde project was between the [[British Aerospace|British Aircraft Corporation]] and Aérospatiale.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot;/&gt; At first the new consortium intended to produce one long range and one short range version. However, prospective customers showed no interest in the short-range version and it was dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot;/&gt; The consortium secured orders (i.e., non-binding options) for over 100 of the long-range version from the major airlines of the day: [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] and Air France were the launch customers, with six Concordes each. Other airlines in the order book included [[Panair do Brasil]], [[Continental Airlines]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Air India]], [[Air Canada]], [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Iran Air]], [[Olympic Airways]], [[Qantas]], [[Civil Aviation Administration of China|CAAC]], [[Middle East Airlines]] and [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903850,00.html |title = Aerospace: Pan Am's Concorde Retreat |work=Time |date = 12 February 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
Reflecting the treaty between the British and French governments which led to Concorde's construction, the name ''Concorde'' is from the French word ''[[wikt:concorde#French|concorde]]'' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃kɔʁd|IPA}}), which has an English cognate, ''[[wikt:concord#English|concord]]'' ({{IPA-en|ˈkɒŋkɔrd|IPA}}). Both words mean ''agreement'', ''harmony'' or ''union''.

The aircraft was initially referred to in the UK as ''Concorde'', with the French spelling, but was officially changed to ''Concord'' by [[Harold Macmillan]] in response to a perceived slight by [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot;/&gt; In 1967, at the French roll-out in [[Toulouse]] the Br
