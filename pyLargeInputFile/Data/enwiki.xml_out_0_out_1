On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alistair Horne, |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |pages=29–30 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of Algeria by the French was long and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103772b Gallica.bnf.fr], La démographie figurée de l'Algérie, op.cit., p.260 et 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria,&lt;ref&gt;'France – Republic, Monarchy, and Empire' By Keith Randell&lt;/ref&gt; but the conquest was slow because of intense resistance from such people as [[Emir Abdelkader]], [[Cheikh Mokrani]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, [[Cheikh Bouamama]], the tribe of [[Ouled Sid Cheikh]], whose relationships with the French vacillated from cooperation to resistance,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[Ahmed Bey]] and [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer|Fatma N'Soumer]]. Indeed, the conquest was not technically complete until the early 20th century when the last [[Taureg people|Tuareg]] were conquered.

[[File:Mairie d oran.JPG|thumb|[[Oran, Algeria]].]]

Meanwhile, however, the French made Algeria an integral part of France. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Spain, Italy, and [[Malta]] moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupied significant parts of Algeria's cities.

These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alistair Horne, |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6 |oclc=|doi=|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-365.html |title=Country Data |publisher=Country-data.com |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while land development uprooted much of the population.

Starting from the end of the 19th century, people of European descent in Algeria (or natives like [[Spanish people]] in [[Oran]]), as well as the native [[Algerian Jews]] (classified as [[Sephardi Jews]]), became full French citizens. Formally Algeria as a French territory was member of European Communities from the founding of the [[European Communities|European Community of Coal and Steel (ECSC)]] in 1952. Formal membership ended with independence in 1962.

After Algeria's 1962 independence, the Europeans were called ''[[pied-noir|Pieds-Noirs]]'' (&quot;black feet&quot;). Some apocryphal sources suggest the title comes from the black boots settlers wore, but the term seems not to have been widely used until the time of the Algerian War of Independence and it's more likely it started as an insult towards settlers returning from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Memory and Postcolonial Europe, Andrea L. Smith, Indiana University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the vast majority of [[Muslim]] Algerians (even veterans of the French army) received neither French citizenship nor the right to vote.

=== Post-independence ===
In 1954, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) launched the [[Algerian War of Independence]] which was a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign. By the end of the war, newly elected [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] held a [[referendum|plebiscite]], offering Algerians [[Algerian War#End of the war|three options]]. In a famous speech (4 June 1958 in [[Algiers]]) de Gaulle proclaimed in front of a vast crowd of Pieds-Noirs &quot;Je vous ai compris&quot; (I have understood you). Most Pieds-noirs then believed that de Gaulle meant that Algeria would remain French. The poll resulted in a landslide vote for complete independence from France. Over one million people, 10% of the population, then fled the country for France in just a few months in mid-1962. These included most of the 1,025,000 ''Pieds-Noirs'', as well as 81,000 ''[[Harki]]s'' (pro-French Algerians serving in the French Army). In the days preceding the bloody conflict, a group of [[Algerian Rebels]] opened fire on a marketplace in [[Oran]] killing numerous innocent civilians, mostly women. It is estimated that somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 ''Harkis'' and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] or by lynch mobs in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | accessdate = | work=BBC News | title=French 'reparation' for Algerians | date=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria's first president was the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. He was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister, [[Houari Boumédienne]] in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly [[socialism|socialist]] and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and this trend continued throughout Boumédienne's government. However, Boumédienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role. [[Agriculture]] was [[collective farming|collectivised]], and a massive [[industrialization]] drive launched. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. However, the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil which led to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].

In foreign policy Algeria has strained relations with its western neighbor [[Morocco]]. Reasons for this include Morocco's disputed claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] (which led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963), Algeria's support for the [[Polisario Front]] for its right to [[self-determination]], and Algeria's hosting of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] refugees within its borders in the city of [[Tindouf]].

Within Algeria, dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the [[Mass media|media]] and the outlawing of political parties other than the FLN was cemented in the repressive [[Constitution of Algeria|constitution of 1976]].

Boumédienne died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], was little more open. The state took on a strongly [[bureaucratic]] character and [[Political corruption|corruption]] was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable [[demography|demographic]] changes to Algeria. Village traditions underwent significant change as [[urbanization]] increased. New industries emerged and agricultural employment was substantially reduced. [[Education]] was extended nationwide, raising the [[literacy]] rate from less than 10% to over 60%. There was a dramatic increase in the [[fertility rate]] to 7–8 children per mother.

Therefore by 1980, there was a very youthful population and a housing crisis. The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: communists, including [[Berber people|Berber]] identity movements; and [[Islamic]] 'intégristes'. Both groups protested against [[one-party rule]] but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s. Mass protests from both camps in autumn 1988 forced Bendjedid to concede the end of one-party rule.

==== Algerian political events (1991–2002) ====
{{Main|Algerian Civil War}}

The first round of elections were held in 1991. In December 1991, the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round]] of the country's first multi-party elections. The military then intervened, declared a state of emergency that limited freedom of speech and assembly, and canceled the second round of elections. It forced then-president Bendjedid to resign and banned all political parties based on religion (including the Islamic Salvation Front). A political conflict ensued, leading Algeria into the violent [[Algerian Civil War]].

More than 160,000 people were killed between 17 January 1992 and June 2002. Most of the deaths were between militants and government troops, but a great number of civilians were also killed. The question of who was responsible for these deaths was controversial at the time amongst academic observers; many were claimed by the [[Armed Islamic Group]]. Though many of these massacres were undoubtedly carried out by Islamic extremists, some{{who|date=February 2011}} claimed that the Algerian regime used the army, and foreign mercenaries, to conduct attacks on men, women, and children, and then proceeded to blame the attacks upon various Islamic groups within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/analysis/africa/an-overview-of-recent-events-in-algeria.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070807014105/http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/analysis/africa/an-overview-of-recent-events-in-algeria.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 |title=Khilafah – An overview of recent events in Algeria |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections resumed in 1995, and after 1998, the war waned. On 27 April 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the [[military]], [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], the current president, was chosen by the army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/algehis.htm Arabic German Consulting] www.Arab.de. Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post war ====
By 2002, the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an [[amnesty]] program, though fighting and terrorism continues in some areas (See [[Islamic insurgency in Algeria (2002–present)]]).

The issue of [[Amazigh languages]] and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in [[Kabylie]]. The government responded with concessions including naming of Tamazight (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.

Much of Algeria is now recovering and developing into an [[emerging economy]]. The high prices of oil and [[natural gas]] are being used by the new government to improve the country's [[infrastructure]] and especially improve [[industry]] and agricultural land.

==== Popular Protests - 2010-present ====

Following a wave of Protests in the wake of popular uprisings in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[2011 Libyan uprising|Libya]], Algeria has officially lifted its 19-year-old state of emergency on February 24, 2011.

[[File:Algeria Topography.png|thumb|Topographic map of Algeria]]
Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[37th parallel north|37°N]] (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the [[Tell Atlas]] is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape, which ends with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; further south, there is the [[Sahara]] desert.

The [[Ahaggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers and just west of [[Tamanghasset]].

Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], [[Tizi Ouzou]] and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.

Currently the second largest country in Africa after [[Sudan]], Algeria will become the continent's largest country when [[Southern Sudan]] secedes from [[Sudan]] in July 2011.

== Climate ==
{{Main|Climate of Algeria}}
In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

The highest official temperature was {{convert|50.6|°C|°F}} at In Salah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm MHerrera.org] and Burt, Christopher C. 'Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book (W.W. Norton Press, 2007) {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5mgEKD3NJ|date =2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainfall is fairly abundant along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. [[Prevailing winds]] that are easterly and north-easterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December, a decrease in the late winter and spring months, and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months. Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|abbr=on}}.

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Algeria}}
[[File:President-abdelaziz-bouteflika.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], President of Algeria]]

The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on November 11, 2008 removed this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm |title=BBC NEWS | Africa | Algeria deputies scrap term limit |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria has universal [[suffrage]] at 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian [[parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of a lower chamber, the ''National People's Assembly (APN)'', with 380 members; and an upper chamber, the ''Council Of Nation'', with 144 members. The APN is elected every five years.

Under the 1976 [[constitution]] (as modified 1979, and amended in 1988, 1989, and 1996), Algeria is a multi-party state. The Ministry of the Interior must approve all parties. To date, Algeria has had more than 40 legal political parties. According to the constitution, no political association may be formed if it is &quot;based on differences in religion, language, race, gender or region.&quot;

== Foreign relations and military ==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Algeria|Military of Algeria}}
[[File:ANP.gif|50px|thumb|Popular National Army Official sign of the Algerian army]]
The military of Algeria consists of the [[People's National Army]] (ANP), the [[Algerian National Navy]] (MRA), and the [[Algerian Air Force]] (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defense Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; It is the direct successor of the [[Armée de Libération Nationale]] (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front, which fought French colonial [[military occupation|occupation]] during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62). The commander-in-chief of the military is the president, who is also Minister of National Defense.

Total military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate).&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB&gt;{{cite book |title=The Military Balance 2008 |author=Hackett, James (ed.)|others=International Institute for Strategic Studies |date=5 February 2008|publisher=Europa |isbn=978-1-85743-461-3| url=http://www.zawya.com/printstory.cfm?storyid=v51n20-1TS05&amp;l=134200080519|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of 18 months (six training and 12 in civil projects).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The total military expenditure in 2006 was estimated variously at 2.7% of GDP (3,096 million),&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB/&gt; or 3.3% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Algeria has its force oriented toward its western (Morocco) and eastern (Libyan) neighbors borders.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Its primary military supplier has been the former [[Soviet Union]], which has sold various types of sophisticated equipment under military trade agreements, and the People's Republic of China. Algeria has attempted, in recent years, to diversify its sources of military material. Military forces are supplemented by a 70,000-member [[gendarmerie]] or rural police force under the control of the president and 30,000-member ''Sûreté nationale'' or metropolitan [[police]] force under the Ministry of the Interior.

The Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia in 2007, to purchase 49 [[MiG-29]]SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated $1.9 billion. They also agreed to return old [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] purchased from the [[Former USSR]]. Russia is also building two [[Kilo class submarine|636-type]] diesel [[submarines]] for Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=070614062644.0d1z4l69&amp;show_article=1| title=Venezuela's Chavez to finalise Russian submarines deal| publisher=Breitbart| date=2007-06-14| accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2009, it was reported that Algeria had cancelled a weapons deal with France over the possibility of inclusion of Israeli parts in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoprod.co.il/article/2/301 |title=Algeria cancels weapons deal over Israeli parts |publisher=Infoprod.co.il |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the [[Western Sahara]] have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], which was nominally established in 1989 but carried little practical weight with its coastal neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990219/1999021906.html ArabicNews.com], Bin Ali calls for reactivating Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia-Maghreb, Politics, 19 February 1999.

== Provinces and districts ==
{{Main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
[[File:Algeria wilayat.png|thumb|left|Map of the provinces of Algeria numbered according to the official order]]
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daïra]]s'') and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital (political)|seat]], which is usually the largest city.
According to the Algerian constitution, a province is ''a territorial collectivity enjoying some economic freedom''.

The [[People's Provincial Assembly]] is the political entity governing a province, which has a &quot;president&quot;, who is elected by the members of the assembly. They are in turn elected on [[universal suffrage]] every five years. The &quot;[[Wāli#Algerian term|Wali]]&quot; ([[Prefect]] or [[governor]]) directs each province. This person is chosen by the Algerian President to handle the PPA's decisions.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are:&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Algeria}}
[[File:Ministerefinacealger.jpg|thumb|Ministry of Finance of Algeria]]
The fossil fuels energy sector is the backbone of Algeria's economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. The country ranks 14th in [[petroleum]] reserves, containing {{convert|11.8|Goilbbl}} of proven [[oil reserves]] with estimates suggesting that the actual amount is even more. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had {{convert|160|Tcuft}} of proven [[natural gas reserves]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html Retrieved 16 March 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; the eighth largest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;eia&quot;&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/algeria.html Algeria Country Analysis Brief], EIA, March 2005. Retrieved 18 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Average annual non-hydrocarbon GDP growth averaged 6 percent in 2003-2007, with total GDP growing at an average of 4.5 percent during the same period due to less buoyant oil production in 2006-07. External debt has been virtually eliminated, and the government has accumulated large savings in the oil stabilization fund (FRR). Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4 percent on average for 2003-07.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFW4A&quot;&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/algeria/algeria-financial-sector-profile.html Algeria Financial Sector Profile: MFW4A :: Country Focus], MFW4A, Algeria Financial Sector Profile&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria's financial and economic indicators improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[debt]] rescheduling from the [[Paris Club]]. Algeria's finances in 2000 and 2001 benefited from an increase in [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]] and the government's tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in [[foreign debt]].

The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic [[investment]] outside the energy sector have had little success in reducing high [[unemployment]] and improving living standards, however. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with the [[European Union]] that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade. In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era debt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brtsis.com/ |title=Brtsis, brief on Russian defence, trade, security and energy |publisher=Brtsis.com |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a visit by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, president [[Bouteflika]] agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defense systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state arms exporter [[Rosoboronexport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia agrees Algeria arms deal, writes off debt |publisher=Reuters |date=11 March 2006 |url=http://za.today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=businessNews&amp;storyID=2006-03-11T082958Z_01_BAN130523_RTRIDST_0_OZABS-ECONOMY-RUSSIA-ALGERIA-20060311.XML}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite news |title=La Russie efface la dette algérienne |publisher=Radio France International |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/075/article_42379.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria also decided in 2006 to pay off its full $8bn (£4.3bn) debt to the [[Paris Club]] group of rich creditor nations before schedule. This will reduce the Algerian foreign debt to less than $5bn in the end of 2006. The [[Paris Club]] said the move reflected Algeria's economic recovery in recent years.

== Agriculture ==
{{Main|Agriculture in Algeria}}
Algeria has always been noted for the fertility of its soil. 25% of Algerians are employed in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |title=CIA factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5RSu3AP6O | archivedate = 2007-08-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable amount of [[cotton]] was grown at the time of the United States' [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but the industry declined afterwards. In the early years of the 20th century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed. A small amount of [[cotton]] is also grown in the southern oases. Large quantities of dwarf palm are cultivated for the leaves, the fibers of which resemble [[Mane (horse)|horsehair]]. The [[olive]] (both for its fruit and oil) and [[tobacco]] are cultivated with great success.

More than {{convert|30000|km2|acres|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} are devoted to the cultivation of [[cereal grain]]s. The [[Tell Atlas]] is the grain-growing land. During the time of French rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of [[artesian aquifer|artesian wells]] in districts which only required water to make them fertile. Of the crops raised, [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[oat]]s are the principal cereals. A great variety of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s, especially [[citrus]] products, are exported. Algeria also exports [[ficus|figs]], [[date (fruit)|dates]], [[esparto|esparto grass]], and [[cork (material)|cork]]. It is the largest [[oat]] market in Africa.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Algeria}}
The population of Algeria is 34,895,000 (January 2010 est.), with 99% classified ethnically as Arab or Berber.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;
About 90% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the minority who inhabit the [[Sahara]] are mainly concentrated in [[oasis|oases]], although some 1.5 million remain [[nomad]]ic or partly nomadic. Almost 30% of Algerians are under the age of 15. Algeria has the fourth lowest [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|fertility rate]] in the [[Greater Middle East]], after those of [[Cyprus]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Turkey]].

Most Algerians have ancestry coming from Arabs, Berbers, and to a lesser extend Southern Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans. Furthermore, the country has a diverse population ranging from light skinned, blue eyed Kabyles in the atlas mountains to dark skinned Black African looking populations in the Sahara (e.g. the Tuaregs and Gnawa). Descendants of [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] refugees are also present in the population of Algiers and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas Ruedy (2005). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=WIRWgrbE_fEC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Modern Algeria: the origins and development of a nation]''&quot;. Indiana University Press. p.22. ISBN 978-0-253-21782-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistically, ~83% of Algerians speak [[Algerian Arabic]], while ~15% speak Berber dialects who are to be found in the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and Chaoui regions mainly. French is widely understood, and [[Standard Arabic]] (FosHaa) is taught to and understood by most [[Algerian]] Arabic-speaking youth.

Europeans account for less than 1% of the population, inhabiting almost exclusively the largest metropolitan areas. However, during the colonial period there was a large (15.2% in 1962) European population, consisting primarily of [[French people]], in addition to [[Spaniards]] in the west of the country, [[Italians]] and [[Maltese people|Maltese]] in the east, and other Europeans such as [[Greeks]] in smaller numbers. Known as ''[[Pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', European colonists were concentrated on the coast and formed a majority of the population of [[Oran]] (60%) and important proportions in other large cities like [[Algiers]] and [[Annaba]]. Almost all of this population left during or immediately after the country's independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo Cagiano De Azevedo (1994). ''&quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=N8VHizsqaH0C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Migration and development co-operation.]&quot;''. Council of Europe. p.25. ISBN 978-92-871-2611-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortages of housing and medicine continue to be pressing problems in Algeria. Failing infrastructure and the continued influx of people from rural to urban areas has overtaxed both systems. According to the [[UNDP]], Algeria has one of the world's highest per housing unit occupancy rates for housing, and government officials have publicly stated that the country has an immediate shortfall of 1.5 million housing units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Women make up 70 percent of Algeria's lawyers and 60 percent of its judges, and also dominate the field of medicine. Increasingly, women are contributing more to household income than men. Sixty percent of university students are women, according to university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slackman |first=Michael |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html |title=A Quiet Revolution in Algeria: Gains by Women – New York Times |doi=Algeria |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=May 26, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 95,700 [[refugees]] and [[Right of asylum|asylum]]-seekers have sought refuge in Algeria.

=== Ethnic groups ===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Algeria}}
Algerian Arabs compose Algeria's majority ethnic group, while a significant Berber minority of 25% exists mainly in the north east Kabyle region and in Aures mountains in east of Algeria and others ethnic groups.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Algeria}}
The [[official language]] of Algeria is (literary) [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as specified in its constitution since 1963.  In addition to this, [[Berber languages|Berber]] has been recognized as a &quot;[[national language]]&quot; by constitutional amendment since May 8, 2002.  Between them, these two [[language]]s are the [[native language]]s of over 99% of Algerians, with Arabic spoken by about 83% (including bilingual Berbers) and Berber by 15% (excluding Berber-Arabic bilinguals) .&lt;ref name=&quot;leclerc&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The [[Kabyle language]], the most spoken Berber language in the country, is taught and partially co-official (with a few restrictions) in parts of [[Kabylia]].

==== Arabic ====

Algerian colloquial Arabic is spoken as a native language by more than 83%( the figure includes bilingual berbers )  of the population; of these, over 78% speak [[Algerian Arabic]] and around 5% [[Hassaniya]].&lt;ref name=tlfq&gt;{{Fr icon}} – [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/AFRIQUE/algerie-1demo.htm TLFQ.ulaval.ca], [[Jacques Leclerc (linguiste)|Jacques Leclerc]], L’aménagement linguistique dans le monde. CIRAL (Centre international de recherche en aménagement linguistique)&lt;/ref&gt; Algerian Arabic is spoken as a second language by many Berbers. However, in the media and on official occasions the spoken language is [[Standard Arabic]].

==== Berber ====
[[File:Hoggar caravane2.jpg|thumb|170px|The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] once controlled the central Sahara desert and its trade.]]
Berber dialects are spoken by around 40% of Algeria's population, mainly in [[Kabylia]], in the [[Aurès]], and in the [[Sahara]] (by [[Tuaregs]]), and also in and around [[Algiers]], the capital city. Long before the [[Phoenicians]]' arrival, Berber was spoken throughout Algeria, as later attested by early [[Tifinagh]] inscriptions. Despite the growth of [[Punic language|Punic]], [[Latin]] and later, [[Arabic]], Berber remained the main language of Algeria until the invasion of the populous [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] tribal confederation in the 11th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Algerians speak one of the various dialects of Berber (native name: [[Tamazight]]), which add up to around 38%-45% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;tlfq&quot;/&gt; Arabic remains Algeria's only [[official language]], although Berber has recently been recognized as a [[national language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} – [http://www.apn-dz.org/apn/french/constitution96/loi02_03.htm « Loi n° 02-03 portant révision constitutionnelle »], adopted on 10 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== French ====

French is the most widely studied [[foreign language]] in the country, and a majority of Algerians can understand it and speak it, though it is usually not spoken in daily life. Since [[independence]], the government has pursued a policy of linguistic Arabization of [[education]] and bureaucracy, which has resulted in limiting the use of [[Berber languages|Berber]] and the Arabization of many Berber-speakers. The strong position of French in Algeria was little affected by the Arabization policy. All scientific and business [[university]] courses are still taught in French. Recently, schools have begun to incorporate French into the curriculum as early as children are taught written classical Arabic. French is also used in media and business. After a political debate in Algeria in the late 1990s about whether to replace French with English in the educational system, the government decided to retain French. English is taught  in the first year of middle schools.

The Punic tongue, a [[Phoenician language]], is believed to have been spoken in several areas of the country. The Punic language died out after the 6th century AD. Algerian cities have commonly been given Punic and [[Latin|ancient Roman]] names.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Algeria}}

[[Islam]] is the predominant religion with 99% of the population. Almost all Algerian Muslims follow Sunni Islam, with the exception of some 200,000 [[ibadi]]s in the M'zab Valley in the region of [[Ghardaia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/mgcibadi.html |title=Ibadis and Kharijis |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some 250,000 [[Christian]]s in the country, including about 10,000 [[Roman Catholics]] and 150,000 to 200,000 evangelical [[Protestants]] (mainly [[Pentecostal]]), according to the [[Protestant Church of Algeria]]'s leader Mustapha Krim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topchretien.com/topinfo/view/40011/lalgerie-malmene-ses-chretiens.html |title=Top Chrétien |publisher=Topchretien.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vodeo.tv/4-33-5995-le-reveil-des-chretiens-d-algerie.html |title=Vodeo TV |publisher=Vodeo TV |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}} {{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim more than one million Christians in Algeria, most of them live in the [[Kabylie]] area where there are more than 70 underground churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbve.no/nyheter/nyhetsarkiv/over-en-million-jesus-troende-i-algerie///nigeria.html?tx_ttnews[pointer]=8&amp;cHash=fb582259df |title=Over en million Jesus-troende i Algerie |publisher=Troens Bevis - Verdens Evangelisering |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation has experienced a decline in Christianity as a result of Islamization for over a millennium. Catholic French missionaries converted some Muslim Algerians, and their descendants are called ''[[Évolués]]'', who moved on to France following independence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Algeria had an important Jewish community until the 1960s. Nearly all of this community emigrated following the country's independence, although a very small number of [[Algerian Jews|Jews]] continue to live in Algiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90207.htm |title=U.S. Department of State |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==

{{Main|Health in Algeria}}

In 2002 Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1.13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to “improved water sources” was limited to 92 percent of the population in urban areas and 80 percent of the population in rural areas. Some 99 percent of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82 percent of those living in rural areas, had access to “improved sanitation.” According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of “reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015.” Given Algeria’s young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.

== Culture ==

{{Main|Culture of Algeria|Music of Algeria|List of Algerian writers}}

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic,Kabyle and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Kateb Yacine]] and [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of Amnesty International, and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&amp;pid=517 Tahar Djaout] French Publishers' Agency and France Edition, Inc. Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy and the humanities, [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of [[deconstruction]], was born in [[El Biar]] in Algiers; [[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]]; [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (modern-day [[Souk Ahras]]); and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria.
Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], the main religion. The works of the [[Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of [[Emir Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

In painting, [[Mohammed Khadda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khadda.com/ Mohammed Khadda] official site. Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[M'Hamed Issiakhem]] have been notable in recent years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a list of characters in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]].''

==Major characters==
The following are major characters from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Characters are listed as &quot;major&quot; if they meet one of the following criteria:
*they are listed as &quot;major&quot; characters in a widely available study guide, such as [[CliffsNotes]], [[SparkNotes]], or [[Gale (Cengage)|Gale's]] ''Novels for Students'';
*they are listed as &quot;primary heroic&quot; or &quot;arch-villain&quot; characters in Gladstein's ''The New Ayn Rand Companion'';
*they are the focus of an essay in a scholarly book about the novel, such as ''Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged'' or ''Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dagny Taggart===
[[Image:Taylor-Schilling-as-Dagny-Taggart.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|right|[[Taylor Schilling]] as Dagny Taggart in the 2011 film.]]
Dagny Taggart is the [[protagonist]] of the novel. She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. However, due to James' incompetence, it is Dagny who is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

Dagny has three romantic relationships, each with a man of ability: [[Francisco d'Anconia]], [[Hank Rearden]], and [[John Galt]]. Galt marks the pinnacle of everything Dagny seeks in the world and is the kind of man alluded to in her youth when she imagines a man standing off in the distance, at the end of a great set of railroad tracks and all her struggles.

The essential drama of Dagny's character is her struggle to reconcile the life she lives and the railroad which she loves with the moral code of those who wish to destroy it. She believes these destroyers simply want to heap burdens upon her for the sake of others, which she has the ability to carry. Like Hank, she believes they want to live, but are too stupid and incompetent to realize how their duties and altruistic projects impede that goal. It is not until she sees the man most important to her in the world - John Galt - strapped to a torture machine, about to be killed by the looters (who recognize, too, that he is the only man who can save them from economic collapse), that she realizes that the moral code of the looters is one of death: they recognize what is good and necessary for life, but wish to destroy it anyway.

She is a typical [[Randian hero]]ine, similar to [[Dominique Francon]] (''The Fountainhead'') or [[Kira Argounova]] (''We the Living'').

===John Galt===
{{Main|John Galt}}
The enigmatic John Galt is the primary male hero of ''Atlas Shrugged.'' He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employee's cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on; these men are consistently the next to disappear. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.

===Ragnar Danneskjöld===
One of the original strikers, he is now world famous as a [[pirate]]. Ragnar attended [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and became friends with John Galt and Francisco d'Anconia while studying under Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. Danneskjöld seizes relief ships that are being sent from the [[United States]] to The People's States of [[Europe]]. As the novel progresses, Danneskjöld begins to become active in American waters. Danneskjöld's action is to restore to other creative people the money, in gold, which was unjustly taken away from them—specifically, their [[income tax]] payments.  He explains this is not [[altruism]]; his motivation is to ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they will have enough capital to rebuild the world.

Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet ''Hank Rearden'' in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an &quot;advance payment&quot; to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation. Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a [[film star]] who retired and dropped out of sight. It is mentioned that some of the strikers have strong reservations about his way of &quot;conducting the common struggle.&quot;

According to [[Barbara Branden]], who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld's adventures at sea, which were cut from the final published text.&lt;ref&gt;Reedstrom, Karen. [http://barbarabranden.com/interview4.html 1992 Interview with Full Context]. Barbara Branden interview in ''Full Context'', October 1992. Republished on barbarabranden.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.

===Francisco d'Anconia===
Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged'', and owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart.

A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the &quot;climax&quot; of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He attended [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working at a young age, while still in school, proving that he could have made a successful career on his own merits without the aid of his family's wealth and power. 

Francisco is one of the strikers and is slowly destroying the d'Anconia empire to put it out of the raiders' reach. His actions were designed both to &quot;trap&quot; looters into relying upon his worthless ventures in order to disrupt their schemes and to try to show the inevitable consequences of looting. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover. However, he is forced to give up Dagny, knowing that she would not be ready to join the strikers. He remains deeply in love with her throughout the book, while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers, Hank Rearden and John Galt.

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia.

===Dr. Floyd Ferris===
Ferris is a biologist who works as &quot;co-ordinator&quot; at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled ''Why Do You Think You Think?'' He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.

===Wesley Mouch===
The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist  whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Later in the novel, he becomes the country's economic dictator.

===Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Rearden===
Henry (also known as &quot;Hank&quot;) is one of the central characters in ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Like many of Rand's capitalist characters, he is a self-made man. He owns the most important steel company in the United States. He invents Rearden Metal, an [[alloy]] stronger than steel (it is to steel what steel is to iron). He lives in [[Philadelphia]] with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother, all of whom he supports.

Hank Rearden knows something is wrong with the world but he is unable to define the problem. His friend, Francisco d'Anconia, helps him understand and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in [[John Galt|Galt's Speech]]. Rearden also serves to illustrate Rand's [[Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|theory of sex]]. Lillian Rearden cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. Dagny Taggart clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into sexual desire. Rearden is torn because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, but he responds sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict, and in doing so, illustrates Rand's sexual theory.

===Lillian Rearden===
The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden. They have been married eight years as the novel begins. Lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted.

As her motives become more clear, Lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction. Her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed. She seeks, then, to ruin Rearden in an effort to prove her own value, but fails.

Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is 'realistic' enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. She indicates that she abhors Francisco d'Anconia, because she believes he is a sexual adventurer.

===James Taggart===
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is, however, incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed: it is a code of stagnation. The goal of this code is to not exist, to not move forward, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretense that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

===Dr. Robert Stadler===
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]], [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#John Galt|John Galt]] and [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#Ragnar Danneskj.C3.B6ld|Ragnar Danneskjöld]]. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X. The character was, in part, modeled on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;David Harriman, ''[[Journals of Ayn Rand]]'', pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the &quot;man who knew better&quot; but chose not to act for the good.

==Secondary characters==
The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for &quot;major.&quot; Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Hugh Akston''' is identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]], where he taught Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at that. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental.

*'''Jeff Allen''' is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company, as well as a hint of John Galt's true background.

*'''Calvin Atwood''' is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins the strike.

*'''Cherryl Brooks''' is a dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was falsely deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. Upon realizing the nature of the moral code surrounding her, the apparent lack of escape for herself and the heroes she worships, and her unnamed desire to remove support from the machinations she abhors, Cherryl throws herself from a bridge to her death after witnessing her husband James Taggart sleeping with Lillian Rearden and after being beaten for showing James his code of death.

*'''Mayor Bascom''' is the mayor of Rome, Wisconsin, who reveals part of the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.

*'''Bill Brent''' is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel disaster.

*'''Dr. Blodgett''' is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate Project X.

*'''Orren Boyle''' is the head of Associated Steel and a friend of James Taggart. He is an investor in the San Sebastián Mines.

*'''Laura Bradford''' is an actress and Kip Chalmers's mistress.

*'''Kip Chalmers''' is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.

*'''Emma Chalmers''', Kip Chalmers's mother, gains some influence after his death. Known as &quot;Kip's Ma,&quot; she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.

*'''Dan Conway''' is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of [[Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.

*'''Ken Danagger''' owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and join Galt's strike moments before Dagny arrives to try to persuade him otherwise.

*'''Quentin Daniels''' is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galt's motor. Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to &quot;[[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Galt's Gulch|Galt's Gulch]]&quot;.

*'''Sebastian d'Anconia''' was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the d'Anconia dynasty. Escaped from [[Spain]] because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the [[Inquisition]], leaving behind a palace and his beloved. Started a small mine in South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace). Eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years. He is the role model which Francisco d'Anconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart. Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other.

*'''Balph Eubank''' is called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that he has never sold more than three thousand copies of his books. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies.

*The '''Fishwife''' is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammond’s grocery market; she is described as having &quot;dark, disheveled hair and large eyes&quot;, and is a writer. Galt says she &quot;wouldn't be published outside. She believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind.&quot; According to [[Barbara Branden]] in her book ''[[The Passion of Ayn Rand]]'', &quot;The [[Fishwife]] is Ayn's [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Hitchcock-like]] appearance in ''Atlas Shrugged''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Branden|title=The passion of Ayn Rand|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B-AEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 October 2010|date=20 May 1986|publisher=Doubleday|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Lawrence Hammond''' runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, one of the few companies in existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. He eventually quits and joins the strike.

*'''Richard Halley''' is Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24, his opera ''[[Phaethon]]'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, Phaethon was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared.

*'''Mrs. William Hastings''' is the widow of the chief engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her husband quit shortly after Galt did and joined the strike some years later. Her lead allows Dagny to find Hugh Akston.

*'''Dr. Thomas Hendricks''' is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt's strike when the American medical system was put under government control.

*'''Tinky Holloway''' is one of the &quot;looters&quot; and is frequently referred to and quoted by other characters in the story, but he has only has one major appearance: during the Washington meeting with Hank Rearden.

*'''Lee Hunsacker''' is in charge of a company called Amalgamated Service when takes over the Twentieth Century Motor Company. He files a lawsuit that eventually leads to Midas Mulligan and Judge Narragansett joining the strike.

*'''Gwen Ives''' is Hank Rearden's secretary.

*'''Owen Kellogg''' is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in [[New York]]. He catches Dagny Taggart's eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division, she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galt's Gulch.

*'''Fred Kinnan''' is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose. Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galt's 3 hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.

*'''Paul Larkin''' is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them.

*'''Eugene Lawson''' heads the Community Bank of Madison, then gets a job with the government when it &lt;!--the bank, or the government? --&gt;goes bankrupt.

*'''Mort Liddy''' is a [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies to which no one listens. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of Lillian Rearden's friends and a member of the cultural elite.

*'''Clifton Locey''' is a friend of Jim Taggart who takes the position of vice-president of operation when Dagny Taggart quits.

*'''Pat Logan''' is the engineer on the first run of the John Galt Line. He later strikes.

*'''Kay Ludlow''' is a beautiful actress and the wife of Ragnar Danneskjöld.

*'''Dick McNamara''' is a contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line. Dagny Taggart plans to hire him to lay the new Rearden Metal track for the Rio Norte Line, but before she does so, he mysteriously disappears. She later discovers that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.

*'''Cuffy Meigs''' is the Director of Unification for the railroad business. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as &quot;impervious to thought&quot;. Meigs seizes control of Project X and accidentally destroys it, demolishing the country's last railroad bridge across the Mississippi River and killing himself, his men, and Dr. Stadler.

*'''Dave Mitchum''' is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental. He is partially responsible for the Taggart Tunnel disaster.

*'''Chick Morrison''' holds the position of &quot;Morale Conditioner&quot; in the government.

*'''Horace Bussby Mowen''' is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source.

*'''Midas Mulligan''' is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galt's strike. Mulligan's birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him &quot;[[Midas]]&quot; in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment.

*'''Judge Narragansett''' is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. When Narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. At the end of the novel, he is seen editing the [[United States Constitution]], crossing out the contradicting amendments of it and adding an amendment to prohibit Congress from passing laws that restrain freedom of trade.

*'''Ben Nealy''' is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.

*'''Betty Pope''' is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position.

*'''Dr. Potter''' holds some undefined position with the State Science Institute. He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.

*'''Dr. Simon Pritchett''' is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He believes that man is nothing but a collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood.

*'''Rearden's mother''', whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in [[Philadelphia]]. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.

*'''Philip Rearden''' is the younger brother of Hank Rearden. He lives in his brother's home in [[Philadelphia]] and is completely dependent on him. He is resentful of his brother's charity.

*'''Dwight Sanders''' owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike.

*'''Bertram Scudder''' is an editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

*'''Claude Slagenhop''' is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Rearden's friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

*'''Gerald and Ivy Starnes''' are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes; together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program at Twentieth Century Motors which drove the company into bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a [[New Age|pseudo-Buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers.

*'''Andrew Stockton''' runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt's Gulch.

*'''Nathaniel Taggart''' was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. He never earned money by force or fraud, and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters.

*'''Mr. Thompson''' is the &quot;[[Head of State|Head of the State]]&quot; for the [[United States]]. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]], and that she deliberately decided not to call him &quot;[[President of the United States]]&quot; as this title has &quot;honorable connotations&quot; which the character does not deserve.

*'''Lester Tuck''' is the press agent for Kip Chalmers.

*'''Clem Weatherby''' is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains. She notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses.

*The '''Wet Nurse (Tony)''' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden’s mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters’ code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.

*'''Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Willers''' is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with Dagny Taggart. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the Promethean creative ability of The Strikers, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. He sticks it out with the railway to the bitter end, even when the old world is obviously collapsing and Dagny has shifted her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt. In the end, he stays with the broken-down Comet in the middle of the desert, like a captain going down with his ship. It is unclear whether or not the strikers or anyone else will return to save him.

*'''Ellis Wyatt''' is the head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Wyatt Oil]]. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of [[Colorado]] by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: &quot;I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.&quot; One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as &quot;Wyatt's Torch&quot;. Later Dagny meets him in Galt's Gulch.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Anthropology''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|n|θ|r|ɵ|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}) is the study of humanity. It has origins in the [[humanities]], the [[Natural science|natural sciences]], and the [[social science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1994) ''Perilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People.'' ''[[Current Anthropology]]'' 35: 1-7. p.227&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;[[wiktionary:anthropology|anthropology]]&quot; is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''[[Anthropos|anthrōpos]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}}), &quot;human being&quot;, and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' (-λογία), &quot;discourse&quot; or &quot;study&quot;, and was first used in 1501 by German philosopher [[Magnus Hundt]].&lt;ref name=Dieserud&gt;Dieserud, Juul (1908) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZcISAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=the+scope+and+content+of+the+science+of+anthropology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Scope and Content of the Science of Anthropology]'' London:Open Court Publishing ISBN 0802139434&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology's basic concerns are &quot;What defines ''[[Homo sapiens]]''?&quot;, &quot;Who are the ancestors of modern ''Homo sapiens''?&quot;, &quot;What are humans' physical traits?&quot;, &quot;How do humans behave?&quot;, &quot;Why are there variations and differences among different groups of humans?&quot;, &quot;How has the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' influenced its social organization and culture?&quot; and so forth.

In the United States, contemporary anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: [[cultural anthropology]] also known as [[social anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], and [[Biological anthropology|physical (or biological) anthropology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aaanet.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/profdev/careers/Careers.cfm AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''four-field'' approach to anthropology is reflected in many undergraduate textbooks&lt;ref&gt;(Kottak, C)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anthropology programs (e.g. [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]). At universities in the [[United Kingdom]], and much of [[Europe]], these &quot;sub-fields&quot; are frequently housed in separate departments and are seen as distinct disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social and cultural sub-field has been heavily influenced by [[structuralist]] and post-modern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies (an arena more typically in the remit of [[sociologist]]s). During the 1970s and 1990s there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt; During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology, biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in [[epistemology]], anthropology as a discipline has lacked cohesion over the last several decades. This has even led to departments diverging, for example in the 1998&amp;ndash;9 academic year at Stanford University, where the &quot;scientists&quot; and &quot;non-scientists&quot; divided into two departments: anthropological sciences and cultural &amp; social anthropology;&lt;ref&gt;Stanford University Bulletin 1998-1999 pg. 213, [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002257&amp;mediaType=application/pdf Sul-derivatives.stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; these departments later reunified in the 2008&amp;ndash;9 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin_past/bulletin07-08/pdf/0708_Bulletin.pdf Stanford University Bulletin 2007-2008 pg. 269]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Anthropology is traditionally divided into four sub-fields, each with its own further branches: [[Biological anthropology|biological or physical anthropology]], [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[archaeology]] and [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aaanet.org&quot;/&gt; These fields frequently overlap, but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

[[Biological anthropology]], or [[physical anthropology]], focuses on the study of human populations using an evolutionary framework. Biological anthropologists have theorized about how the globe has become populated with humans (e.g. the &quot;[[Out of Africa theory|Out Of Africa]]&quot; and &quot;[[Multiregional origin of modern humans|multi-regional evolution]]&quot; debate), as well as tried to explain geographical human variation and [[race (classification of human beings)|race]]. Many biological anthropologists studying modern human populations identify their field as [[human ecology]], itself linked to [[sociobiology]]. Human ecology uses evolutionary theory to understand phenomena among contemporary human populations. Another large sector of biological anthropology is [[primatology]], where anthropologists focus on understanding other primate populations. Methodologically, primatologists borrow heavily from field biology and ecology in their research. 

[[Cultural anthropology]] is also called socio-cultural anthropology or [[social anthropology]] (especially in the United Kingdom). It is the study of culture, and is mainly based on [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research, namely a monograph or book. Ethnography is a grounded, inductive method that heavily relies on participant-observation. [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic point of view; which would otherwise be unattainable by simply reading from a book. In some European countries, all cultural anthropology is known as [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783).&lt;ref&gt;Han F. Vermeulen, &quot;The German Invention of ''Völkerkunde:'' Ethnological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1740-1798.&quot; In: Sara Eigen and Mark Larrimore, eds. ''The German Invention of Race.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of cultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Cultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Archaeology is the study of human material culture, including both [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (older pieces of human culture) carefully gathered ''in situ'', museum pieces and modern garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913924,00.html | work=Time | title=The Nation: Truth in Garbage | date=26 January 1976 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists work closely with biological anthropologists, art historians, physics laboratories (for dating), and museums. They are charged with preserving the results of their excavations and are often found in museums. Typically, archaeologists are associated with &quot;digs,&quot; or excavation of layers of ancient sites.

Archaeologists subdivide time into cultural periods based on long-lasting artifacts: the [[Paleolithic]], the [[Neolithic]], the [[Bronze Age]], which are further subdivided according to artifact traditions and culture region, such as the [[Oldowan]] or the [[Gravettian]]. In this way, archaeologists provide a vast frame of reference for the places human beings have traveled, their ways of making a living, and their [[demographics]]. Archaeologists also investigate nutrition, symbolization, art, systems of writing, and other physical remnants of human cultural activity.

[[Linguistic anthropology]] (also called [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropology is divided into its own sub-fields: [[descriptive linguistics]] the construction of grammars and lexicons for unstudied languages; [[historical linguistics]], including the reconstruction of past languages, from which our current languages have descended; [[ethnolinguistics]], the study of the relationship between language and culture, and [[sociolinguistics]], the study of the social functions of language. Anthropological linguistics is also concerned with the evolution of the parts of the brain that deal with language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.net/2007/08/15/new-york-times-reviews-kenneallys-the-first-word/ Anthropology.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of Anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. 2003. p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Stocking, &quot;Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology.&quot; In George Stocking, The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992):342-361.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray. ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand this has led to instability in many American anthropology departments, resulting in the division or reorganization of sub-fields (e.g. at Stanford, Duke, and most recently at Harvard).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2009/05.28/newdept.html News.harvard.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; However, seen in a positive light, anthropology is one of the few places in many American universities where humanities, social, and natural sciences are forced to confront one another. As such, anthropology has also been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as [[cognitive science]], [[global studies]], [[human-computer interaction]], and various [[ethnic studies]].

Because of the holistic nature of anthropological research, all branches of anthropology have widespread practical application in diverse fields. This is known as [[applied anthropology]]. Thus military expeditions employ anthropologists to discern strategic cultural footholds; marketing professionals employ anthropology to determine propitious placement of advertising; and humanitarian agencies depend on anthropological insights as means to fight poverty. Examples of applied anthropology are ubiquitous.

==Basic trends==
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia. 

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato.  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo.  ''The Anthropology of Globalization. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jurmaiine, Lynn Kiilgore, Wenda Treavathan, and Russell L. Ciochon.  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. 2007, chapters I, III and IV.''; Wompack, Mari.  ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. 2001, pp. 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures)&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald.  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill. 1991; Roughley, Neil.  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists &quot;into the field&quot; which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called &quot;fieldwork.&quot;  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs. Due to the interest in variation, anthropologists are drawn to the study of human extremes, aberrations and other unusual circumstances, such as [[headhunting]], [[whirling dervishes]], whether there were real [[Homo floresienses|Hobbit people]], [[snake handling]], and [[Glossolalia|glossolalia (speaking in tongues)]], just to list a few.

At the same time, anthropologists urge, as part of their quest for scientific objectivity, [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology. This is the notion that particular cultures should not be judged by one culture's values or viewpoints, but that all cultures should be viewed as relative to each other. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude.  ''The Savage Mind''. 1962; Womack, Mari.  ''Being Human.'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]], and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery or human sacrifice, therefore, attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin.  ''Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Timeshighereducation.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of  [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as &quot;racism&quot; and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm; AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/282/5389/654?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;titleabstract=DNA+challenges+race&amp;searchid=QID_NOT_SET&amp;FIRSTINDEX=; Sciencemag.org], Shanklin, Eugenia. 1994. Anthropology &amp; Race; Faye V. Harrison. 1995. &quot;The Persistent Power of 'Race' in the Cultural and Political Economy of Racism.&quot; Annual Review of Anthropology. 24:47-74. Allan Goodman. 1995. &quot;The Problematics of &quot;Race&quot; in Contemporary Biological Anthropology.&quot; In Biological Anthropology: The State of the Science.; Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, 1945-.  &quot;Melanin, Afrocentricity...,&quot; 36(1993):33-58.; see Stanford's recent collection of overarching bibliographies on race and racism, [http://library.stanford.edu/depts/ssrg/misc/race.html Library.stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology. Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past. Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[Culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]], which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is made up of Anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Kate Wong.

==History==
{{Main|History of anthropology}}
The first use of the term &quot;anthropology&quot; in English to refer to a natural science of humanity was apparently in 1593, the first of the &quot;[[-logy|logies]]&quot; to be coined.&lt;ref&gt;Urbanowicz, Charles. In the Newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, reprinted online, [http://www.csuchico.edu/~curbanowicz/Pub_Papers/4field.html Csuchico.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It took [[Immanuel Kant]] 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, his ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View''.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel.  &quot;Introduction&quot; to his 1961 translation of Kant's work, reprinted, [http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm Generation-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, however, as he never left his region of Germany nor did he study any cultures besides his own, and in fact, describes the need for anthropology as a corollary field to his own primary field of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant's Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., ISBN 0521790387.&lt;/ref&gt;  He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772. Anthropology is thus primarily an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] endeavor.

Historians of anthropology, like Marvin Harris,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin.  ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory.''  Alta Mira Press. 2000 (revised from 1968); Harris, Marvin.  ''Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times. Altamira. 1998''&lt;/ref&gt; indicate two major frameworks within which empirical anthropology has arisen: interest in comparisons of people over space and interest in longterm human processes or humans as viewed through time. Harris dates both to [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome]], specifically [[Herodotus]], often called the &quot;father of history&quot; and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]], who wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]]. Herodotus first formulated some of the persisting problems of anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1968, op cit. pp. 8-52; Leaf 1970, op cit. pp. 1-13; Erickson and Murph, 2003, pp. 21-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered &quot;different&quot; from themselves in terms of geography.  [[John of Plano Carpini]] reported of his stay among the [[Mongols]]. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm Resources for a History of Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]]'s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tk421.net/essays/polo.html Marco Polo's Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name &quot;the father of modern anthropology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf The Renaissance Foundations of Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the 11th century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | url = | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that he can hardly be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). &quot;Islamic Anthropology&quot; and the &quot;Anthropology of Islam&quot;, ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and especially [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/jhi.1998.0030 | last1 = Walbridge | first1 = J.

Most scholars{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], a period when Europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the 15th century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], [[history]], [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part.

Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the &quot;culture concept,&quot; which is central to the discipline.
[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Table of natural history, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the &quot;human primitives&quot; overseen by colonial administrations.

There was a tendency in late 18th century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most 19th-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.

As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the 19th century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism has been that many social science scholars (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focus disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuses disproportionately on the &quot;Other&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; this has changed over the last part of the 20th century as anthropologists increasingly also study Western subjects, particularly variation across class, region, or ethnicity within Western societies, and other social scientists increasingly take a global view of their fields.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural and biological ''[[sciences]]'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''[[humanities]]'' generally study local traditions, through their [[history]], [[literature]], [[music]], and [[art]]s, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras.

The ''[[social sciences]]'' have generally attempted to develop [[scientific method]]s to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences. In particular, social sciences often develop [[statistics|statistical]] descriptions rather than the general laws derived in [[physics]] or [[chemistry]], or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of [[psychology]]. Anthropology (like some fields of [[history]]) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/375868 | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = Immanuel | year = 2003 | title = Anthropology, sociology, and other dubious disciplines | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 453–466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) &quot;Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason,&quot; in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32-58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building nationalist perspectives. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (eg, museums of several kinds).&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, anthropology in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) ''Soviet and Western anthropology''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==
===Britain===
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|right|[[E. B. Tylor]], 19th-century British anthropologist.]]
[[Edward Burnett Tylor|E. B. Tylor]] ( 2 October 1832 – 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] ( 1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Though Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not fieldwork, mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.

Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of &quot;uniformity of mankind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) &quot;Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention,&quot; ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: &quot;independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race [sic] to another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as &quot;that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.

Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious feelings in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that &quot;religion&quot; has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally.

Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, were particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. Toward the turn of the 20th century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative.

Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a [[William Rivers#Torres Straits Expedition|multidisciplinary expedition]] to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by [[Alfred Court Haddon]] and including a physician-anthropologist, [[William Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.

A decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the Austro-Hungarian Empire resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting &quot;the native's point of view&quot; through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributions coming from the Polish-British [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970]'' review at [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0094-0496(199702)24%3A1%3C211%3ATEMTRO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-I Links.jstor.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism|structural-functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for &quot;Social Anthropology&quot; by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.''

[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it &quot;contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Heyck at [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762%28199712%29102%3A5%3C1486%3AATBSA1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-7 Links.jstor.org] The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486-1488 doi:10.2307/2171126&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

Anthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. [[Gillian Tett]], a [[Cambridge University]] trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the [[Financial Times]] is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.

===United States===
====19th Century to 1940s====
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies.

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the &quot;Father of American Anthropology&quot;]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].

[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.

====Boasian anthropology====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little &quot;civilization&quot; they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called &quot;Four Field Approach&quot; has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 17th century, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Domain of Canada.

True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910. Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===France===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.

Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's [[Année Sociologique]] group; and while Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states.

Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]]'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) &quot;A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self.,&quot; in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as &quot;Une categorie de l'Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de 'Moi',&quot; for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]] which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

Above all, however, it was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence his [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]] who would prove influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities.

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that &quot;primitive societies&quot; actively oppose the institution of the [[state (polity)|state]]. Therefore, these stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but took the active choice of conjuring the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups (&quot;international relations&quot;) but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean “Critical Re-vision: Clastres' Chronicle and the optic of [[primitivism]]”, 2002 In ''Best of Anthropology Today, 1974-2000'', ed. J. Benthall, with a preface by M. Sahlins. London: Routledge. [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415262550 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important French social theorist since [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, however, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the Kabyles of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

Anthropology in [[Greece]] and [[Portugal]] is much influenced by British anthropology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In [[Greece]], there was since the 19th century a science of the [[folklore]] called ''laographia'' (laography), in the form of &quot;a science of the interior&quot;, although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science &quot;of the outside&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Zoïa, « L'anthropologie en Grèce », Terrain, Numéro 14—L'incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990) , [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005,  [http://terrain.revues.org/document3641.html Terrain.revues.org], Consulté le 15 juin 2007. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Italy]], the development of [[ethnology]] and related studies did not receive as much attention as other branches of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Grottanelli, Vinigi ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0011-3204(197712)18%3A4%3C593%3AEACAII%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z Ethnology and/or Cultural Anthropology in Italy: Traditions and Developments (and Comments and Reply)]''.

==Post–World War II==
Before [[World War II|WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the [[natural science]]s. Some anthropologists, such as [[Lloyd Fallers]] and [[Clifford Geertz]], focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Leslie White]], focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche—an approach popularized by [[Marvin Harris]].

[[Economic anthropology]] as influenced by [[Karl Polanyi]] and practiced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[George Dalton]] challenged standard neoclassical [[economics]] to take account of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as [[Max Gluckman]] and [[Peter Worsley]] experimented with Marxism and authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] incorporated Lévi-Strauss's structuralism into their work.

Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in 1960s and 1970s, including [[Psychological anthropology#Cognitive Anthropology|cognitive anthropology]] and componential analysis. Authors such as [[David Schneider (anthropologist)|David Schneider]], [[Clifford Geertz]], and [[Marshall Sahlins]] developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the [[Algerian War of Independence]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]];&lt;ref&gt;Fanon, Frantz. (1963) The Wretched of the Earth, transl. Constance Farrington. New York, Grove Weidenfeld.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism]] became an increasingly popular theoretical approach in the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Stephen ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=anthropology&amp;title_type=tka&amp;year_from=1998&amp;year_to=2007&amp;database=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;index=4 Some reflections on anthropological structural Marxism]'' The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Volume 13, Number 2, June 2007, pp. 419-431(13)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as ''Reinventing Anthropology'' worried about anthropology's relevance.

Since the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in [[Eric Wolf]]'s ''[[Europe and the People Without History]]'', have been central to the discipline. In the 80s books like ''Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter'' pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Michel Foucault]] moved issues of power and [[hegemony]] into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became popular topics, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] (again), who drew on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency. Also influential in these issues were [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], the critical theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Derrida]] and [[Lacan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294(199809)2%3A100%3A3%3C716%3ATMOAAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-3 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100:&quot; 716-731&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as [[George Marcus]] and [[James Clifford]] pondered ethnographic authority, particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. They were reflecting trends in research and discourse initiated by Feminists in the academy, although they excused themselves from commenting specifically on those pioneering critics.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, key aspects of feminist theorizing and methods became ''de rigueur'' as part of the 'post-modern moment' in anthropology: Ethnographies became more reflexive, explicitly addressing the author's methodology, cultural, gender and racial positioning, and their influence on his or her ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of [[postmodernism]] that was popular contemporaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-50&lt;/ref&gt; Currently anthropologists pay attention to a wide variety of issues pertaining to the contemporary world, including [[globalization]], [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]], [[indigenous rights]], [[virtual communities]], and the anthropology of [[industrial society|industrialized societies]].

==Controversies about its history==
Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = &quot;pbuteh&quot;&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:

*That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derived some of its key notions from it, consciously or not.   (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion''. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*That ethnographic work was often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were &quot;out of time&quot; in an &quot;ethnographic present&quot; ([[Johannes Fabian]], ''Time and Its Other'').

===Military===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in [[World War I]], and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the &quot;Axis&quot; (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist Hugo Nutini was active in the stillborn [[Project Camelot]]).&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Lewis ed.(1967) The Rise and Fall of Project Camelot.&lt;/ref&gt; Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement and a great many resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments ... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;

However, anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm CSmonitor.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Science Monitor]] reports that &quot;Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs&quot; [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; additionally, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/professionalwriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html Army.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major discussions==
===Focus on other cultures===&lt;!-- title wikilinked from [[Urban anthropology]] --&gt;
Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-[[Western world|Western]] societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh Univeristy Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al , Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in &quot;other cultures&quot; looked for them far away and started to look &quot;across the tracks&quot; only in late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz]] (1980) &quot;Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology&quot;, ISBN 0231083769, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's &quot;home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot; /&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like [[History]] and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]'' Cambridge University Press ISBN 0521870690&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field | url = http://www.jstor.org/view/08867356/ap020057/02a00050/3?frame=noframe | journal = [[Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like [[Isac Chiva]] and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' (&quot;fieldwork&quot;), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies). The same approach of focusing on &quot;modern world&quot; topics by ''Terrain'', was also present in the British [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]] of the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social sciences]] that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture and agricultural science==

The two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:
*[[Agriculture]] is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
*[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:
* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Transformation of primary products into end-[[consumer]] products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse

==Agricultural science: a local science==

With the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.

==History of agricultural science==
{{Main|History of agricultural science}}

Agricultural science began with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiology|plant physiological]] understanding in eighteenth century [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887, which used the term &quot;agricultural science&quot;. The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996). [http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf The Origins of Agriscience: Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From?]. ''Journal of Agricultural Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.&lt;ref name=ScienceForAg&gt;Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

==Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==
Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing [[biosafety]] problems that may affect human health and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This requires promoting good management of [[natural resources]] and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.

Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as avian influenza, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and issues such as the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

'''Alchemy''' is an ancient tradition, the primary objective of which is the creation of the [[Philosopher's Stone]], capable of turning [[base metal|base metals]] into [[gold]] or [[silver]], and acting as a universal medicine. This [[philosophy]] and practice is said to help the alchemist prolong youth, resist death, and attain ultimate [[wisdom]]. The alchemists stress an adherence to nature, mirroring her principles in the plant, animal, and mineral microcosms they observe. Some alchemical sources treat the various substances, equipment, and processes in an allegorical sense, as metaphors for a spiritual discipline. Practical alchemy, on the other hand, can be viewed as a [[protoscience]], the precursor to modern [[inorganic chemistry]], having provided many procedures, equipment and names of substances that are still in use.

Alchemy has been practiced in [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, [[Rasayana|India]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, [[Chinese alchemy|China]], [[Japan]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, [[Korea]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, the [[Classical Antiquity|classical]] [[Greco-Roman world]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, the [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic world]], and then [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] up to the modern era, in a complex [[Social network|network]] of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2,500 years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Etymology==
{{Main|Chemistry (etymology)}}
The word alchemy derives from the [[Old French]] ''alquimie'', which is from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''alchimia'', and which is in turn from the [[Arabic]] ''al-kimia'' (الكيمياء).  This term itself is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''chemeia'' (χημεία) or ''chemia'' (χημία) &lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0017630#DWS-M_EN_GB-037342 alchemy], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of the Arabic [[definite article]] ''[[al-]]'' (الـ‎).&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|alchemy}} Or see {{OEtymD|alchemy|accessdate=2010-04-07}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek word may have been derived from&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the etymology for χημεία in {{Cite book| edition = Eighth edition, revised throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George| coauthors = Robert Scott| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1901| isbn = 0199102058}}&lt;/ref&gt; a version of the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name for Egypt, which was itself based on the Ancient Egyptian word ''kēme'' (hieroglyphic Khmi, ''black earth'', as opposed to desert sand).&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;  The word could also have originally derived from ''chumeia'' (χυμεία) meaning &quot;mixture&quot; and referring to [[pharmaceutical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, both the etymology given in the Oxford English Dictionary and also that for χυμεία in {{Cite book| edition = A new edition, revised and augmented throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George| coauthors = Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1940|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=xumeia&amp;la=greek#lexicon| isbn = 0199102058}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the later rise of alchemy in Alexandria, the word may have derived from Χημία, and thus became spelled as χημεία, and the original meaning forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;The original source for this analysis is the article on pp.&amp;nbsp;81&amp;ndash;85 of {{Cite book| publisher = F. Duemmler| last = Mahn| first = Carl August Friedrich| title = Etymologische untersuchungen auf dem gebiete der romanischen sprachen| year = 1855| url = http://books.google.com/?id=-BMLAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology is still open, and recent research indicates that the Egyptian derivation may be valid.&lt;ref&gt;The article by David Bain, entitled &quot;Μελανίτις γή, an unnoticed Greek name for Egypt: New evidence for the origins and etymology of alchemy?&quot; expresses the current debate. {{Cite book| publisher = The Norwegian Institute at Athens| title = The world of ancient magic| location = Bergen| year = 1999|url = http://www.norwinst.gr/Publikasjoner/Papers.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alchemy as a philosophical and spiritual discipline==
[[File:Raimundus Lullus alchemic page.jpg|thumb|right|Page from alchemic treatise of [[Ramon Llull]], 16th century]]

Alchemy became known as the ''spagyric art'' after Greek words meaning ''to separate'' and ''to join together'' in the 16th century, the word probably being coined by [[Paracelsus]]. Compare this with one of the [[dictum]]s of Alchemy in Latin: [[Solve et Coagula]]&amp;nbsp;— ''Separate, and Join Together'' (or ''&quot;dissolve and coagulate&quot;'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.techgnosis.com/gaiman.html |title = The Gods of the Funny Books: An Interview with Neil Gaiman and Rachel Pollack |accessdate = 2007-02-04 |last = Davis |first = Erik |publisher = Techgnosis (reprint from Summer 1994 issue) |work=[[Gnosis (magazine)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known goals of the [[List of alchemists|alchemist]]s were the [[wiktionary:transmutation|transmutation]] of common metals into [[gold]] (called [[chrysopoeia]]) or [[silver]] (less well known is plant alchemy, or &quot;[[spagyric]]&quot;); the creation of a &quot;[[panacea (medicine)|panacea]]&quot;, or the [[elixir of life]], a remedy that, it was supposed, would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely; and the discovery of a [[Alkahest|universal solvent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alchemy Alchemy at Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Although these were not the only uses for the discipline, they were the ones most documented and well-known. Certain Hermetic schools argue that the transmutation of lead into gold is analogical for the transmutation of the physical body (Saturn or lead) into (Gold) with the goal of attaining immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golden-dawn.com/eu/displaycontent.aspx?pageid=102 The True Nature of Hermetic Alchemy].&lt;/ref&gt; This is described as Internal Alchemy. Starting with the [[Middle Ages]], [[Persian scientists|Persian]] and European alchemists invested much effort in the search for the &quot;[[philosopher's stone]]&quot;, a legendary substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals. Pope John XXII issued a [[Papal bull|bull]] against alchemical counterfeiting, and the [[Cistercians]] banned the practice amongst their members. In the late 14th century, [[Piers the Ploughman]] and [[Chaucer]] both painted unflattering pictures of Alchemists as thieves and liars; and in 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of Alchemy without first receiving a licence to practise it from the King. However, by the 16th C, Elizabeth I employed the polymath [[John Dee]], regarded by many as an alchemist, as her astrologer and occasional advisor. By contrast, [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the late 16th century, sponsored various alchemists in their work at his court in Prague, one of which was a particular alchemist named [[Edward Kelley]]. Kelley had been a protegee of John Dee in England.

It is a popular belief that Alchemists made contributions to the &quot;chemical&quot; industries of the day—ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of gunpowder, ink, dyes, paints, cosmetics, [[Tanning|leather tanning]], ceramics, glass manufacture, preparation of extracts, liquors, and so on (it seems that the preparation of ''[[aqua vitae]]'', the &quot;water of life&quot;, was a fairly popular &quot;experiment&quot; among European alchemists). Alchemists contributed [[distillation]] to Western Europe.
The double origin of Alchemy in Greek philosophy as well as in Egyptian and Mesopotamian technology set, from the start, a double approach: the technological, operative one, which [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] call [[extravert]], and the mystic, contemplative, psychological one, which von Franz names as [[introvert]]. These are not mutually exclusive, but complementary instead, as meditation requires practice in the real world, and conversely.&lt;ref name=&quot;FRAALC97&quot;&gt;von Franz, M-L. Alchemical Active Imagination. Shambala. Boston. 1997. ISBN 0-87773-589-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early alchemists, such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]], are recorded as viewing alchemy as a spiritual discipline, and, in the Middle Ages, metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and molecular material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformations. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]], which being at odds with the Medieval Christian Church was a necessity that could have otherwise led them to the &quot;stake and rack&quot; of the Inquisition under charges of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Blavatsky |first= H.P. |title= [[The Secret Doctrine]] |publisher= Theosophical Publishing Company |year= 1888 |isbn= 978-1557000026 |volume=ii |page=238 |url=http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/SDVolume2.htm |nopp= true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state; and the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously &quot;decoded&quot; in order to discover their true meaning.

In his ''Alchemical Catechism'', [[Paracelsus]] clearly denotes that his usage of the metals was a symbol:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/alc/tschoudy.htm |title=Alchemical Catechism |accessdate=2007-04-18 |author=Paracelsus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Psychology ===

Alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used by [[psychology|psychologists]] and philosophers. [[Carl Jung]] reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C. G. 1944&quot;&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 ISBN 0-691-01831-6). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Hinkle, B. M. (1912). Psychology of the Unconscious : a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido, a contribution to the history of the evolution of thought. London: Kegan Paul Trench Trubner. (revised in 1952 as Symbols of Transformation, Collected Works Vol.5 ISBN 0-691-01815-4).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung saw alchemy as a Western proto-psychology dedicated to the achievement of [[individuation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C. G. 1944&quot;/&gt; In his interpretation, alchemy was the vessel by which [[Gnosticism]] survived its various purges into the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Jaffe A. (1962). Memories, Dreams, Reflections. London: Collins. This is Jung's autobiography, recorded and edited by Aniela Jaffe, ISBN 0-679-72395-1.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept also followed by others such as [[Stephan A. Hoeller]]. In this sense, Jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a [[Yoga]] of the East, and more adequate to the Western mind than Eastern religions and philosophies. The practice of Alchemy seemed to change the mind and spirit of the Alchemist. Conversely, spontaneous changes on the mind of Western people undergoing any important stage in [[individuation]] seems to produce, on occasion, imagery known to Alchemy and relevant to the person's situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. - Psychology and Alchemy; Symbols of Transformation.&lt;/ref&gt;

His interpretation of [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemical texts]] in terms of his [[analytical psychology]] also served the function of comparing Eastern and Western alchemical imagery and core concepts and hence its possible inner sources ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]).&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Louise von Franz]], a disciple of Jung, continued Jung's studies on Alchemy and its psychological meaning.

== Alchemy as a subject of historical research ==

The history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field. As the obscure hermetic language of the alchemists is gradually being &quot;deciphered&quot;, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[kabbala|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements, [[cryptography]], [[witchcraft]], and the evolution of [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

===History===
{{Main|History of alchemy}}

Alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in [[China]] and its zone of cultural influence; [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centred around the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[ancient Egypt]], to the [[Greco-Roman world]], to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

== Modern connections to alchemy ==

In the Islamic world, [[Alchemy (Islam)|alchemy]] was a forerunner of modern scientific [[chemistry]], with alchemists such as [[Al-Kindi]], [[Rhazes]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ahmad ibn Imad al-din|Imad ul-din]] and [[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Hayyān]].

Up to the 17th century, alchemy was practiced by scientists, such as [[Isaac Newton]] &amp;ndash; who devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other alchemists of the [[Western world]] who were eminent in their other studies include [[Roger Bacon]], and [[Tycho Brahe]].

During the 17th century, practical alchemy started to evolve into modern chemistry,&lt;ref&gt;William R Newman &amp; Lawrence M Principe (1998) &quot;The Etymological Origins of an Historiographic Mistake&quot; in ''Early Science and Medicine'', Vol. 3, No. 1 pp.32-65&lt;/ref&gt; as it was renamed by [[Robert Boyle]], the &quot;father of modern chemistry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Deem, Rich |title=The Religious Affiliation of Robert Boyle the father of modern chemistry. From: Famous Scientists Who Believed in God |year=2005 |publisher=adherents.com |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Robert_Boyle.html |accessdate=2009-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''The Skeptical Chymist'', Boyle attacked [[Paracelsus]] and the venerable [[natural philosophy]] of [[Aristotle]], which was taught at universities.  However, Boyle's biographers, in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry, neglect how steadily he clung to the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic sciences]] and to Alchemy, in theory, practice and doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2707281 | last = More | first = Louis Trenchard | title = Boyle as Alchemist | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–76 | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | date = January 1941 | accessdate = 30 March 2010 | jstor = 2707281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of alchemy continued in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework within a new view of the universe based on rational [[materialism]].

=== Alchemy in traditional medicine ===
Traditional medicines involve transmutation by alchemy, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques. In [[Chinese medicine]] the alchemical traditions of [[pao zhi]] will transform the nature of the temperature, taste, body part accessed or toxicity. In [[Ayurveda]] the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are used to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Junius, Manfred M; ''The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs''; Healing Arts Press 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In literature ===
Sir [[Thomas Malory]] uses Alchemy as a motif that underlies the personal, psychological, and aesthetic development of Sir Gareth of Orkney in [[Le Morte d'Arthur]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Sir Gareth's quest parallels the process of Alchemy in that he first undergoes the ''nigredo'' phase by defeating the black knight and wearing his armor. After this, Gareth defeats knights representing the four elements, thereby subsuming their power. In fighting and defeating the Red Knight (the overall purpose of his quest), he undergoes and passes the ''rubedo'' phase. Gareth, toward the end of his quest, accepts a ring from his paramour, Lyoness, which transforms his armor into multicolors. This alludes to the panchromatic philosopher's stone, and while he is in multicolored armor, he is unbeatable.

The award-winning novel by [[Paulo Coelho]], [[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]], is largely about a boy named Santiago and his travels with an Alchemist.

A play by [[Ben Jonson]], [[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]], is a satirical and skeptical take on the subject.

Part 2 of [[Goethe]]'s [[Faust]], is full of alchemical symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;see Alice Raphael: Goethe and the Philosopher's Stone, symbolical patterns in 'The Parable' and the second part of 'Faust', London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Hermetic Fictions: Alchemy and Irony in the Novel'' ([[Keele University]] Press, 1995), by David Meakin, alchemy is also featured in such novels and poems as those by [[William Godwin]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Emile Zola]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[James Joyce]], [[Gustav Meyrink]], [[Lindsay Clarke]], [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Michel Butor]], [[Paulo Coelho]], [[Amanda Quick]], [[Gabriel García Marquez]] and [[Maria Szepes]]. The 19th-century Austrian dramatist, [[Friedrich Halm]], also wrote a major drama, ''Der Adept'', in 1836 on the direful moral and psychological consequences of an alchemist's success in transmuting base metals into gold.&lt;ref&gt;''Werke Friedrich Halm's'', Vol. 2, Carl Gerold's Sohn, Vienna, 1856&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hilary Mantel]], in her novel ''[[Fludd (novel)|Fludd]]'' (1989, Penguin), mentions the spagyric art. 'After separation, drying out, moistening, dissolving, coagulating, fermenting, comes purification, recombination: the creation of substances the world until now has never beheld. This is the opus contra naturam, this is the spagyric art, this is the Alchymical Wedding'. (page 79)

In Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', it is placed within the Tenth ring of the 8th circle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/dante/in29.htm Dante's Divine Comedy, Inferno, Canto 29], hosted on the [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', real-life alchemist [[Nicolas Flamel]] is supposed to have successfully created the [[Philosopher's stone]], which could turn metal into gold and create an elixir of immortality that enabled him to live into the 1990s, when the book is set. 

The manga and anime series ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' bases itself on a more fantasised version of alchemy, based on the principle of equivalent exchange. 

In the manga and anime series ''[[Buso Renkin]]'', alchemy is used to form Kakugane, which transforms into a weapon based on a human's fighting instincts.

The main character in the play ''[[Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)]]'', by Ann-Marie MacDonald, attempts (and succeeds) at determining the alchemy behind Shakespeare's work, ''[[Othello]]''.

Alchemy plays a central role in the [[Baroque Cycle]] novels of [[Neil Stephenson]].

=== In contemporary art ===
In the twentieth century alchemy was a profoundly important source of inspiration for the Surrealist artist [[Max Ernst]], who used the symbolism of alchemy to inform and guide his work. M.E. Warlick wrote his ''Max Ernst and Alchemy'' describing this relationship in detail.

Contemporary artists use alchemy as inspiring subject matter, like [[Odd Nerdrum]], whose interest has been noted by [[Richard Vine]], and the painter [[Michael Pearce]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.callutheran.edu/schools/cas/programs/art/faculty/?profile_id=207 Cal Lutheran | Department of Art - Faculty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; whose interest in alchemy dominates his work.

The installation, video and performance artist [[Matthew Barney]] has also made reference to alchemical ingredients in his work, notably in his performance pieces ''Ren'' (2008), ''Guardian of the Veil'' (2007) and ''Khu'' (2010) which reference the book [[Ancient Evenings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sadiecoles.com/matthew_barney/press.html].&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental filmmaker [[James Whitney]] planned a series of four alchemical films in the mid-1970s.

More recently, the German experimental filmmaker [[Jürgen Reble]] has referenced alchemical processes in his physical and chemical manipulation of the filmstrip, describing one particular work, ''Alchemy'', as bridging the gap between the &quot;processing and fixing&quot; of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Reble, Jurgen. &quot;Chemistry and the Alchemy of Colour&quot;. Millennium Film Journal, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the moving image artist [[Richard Ashrowan]] created a video installation, ''Alchemist'', which used texts by the twelfth century alchemist [[Michael Scot]] and included performances related to alchemical themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashrowan.com/works/alchemist/ ''Alchemist'' Artist's web page and documentation, accessed 03/03/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Galileo]] is often referred to as the Father of Modern Astronomy.]]
An '''astronomer''' is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Celestial body|celestial bodies]] such as [[planet]]s, [[star]]s and [[Galaxy|galaxies]].

Historically, [[astronomy]] was more concerned with the classification and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms &quot;astronomer&quot; and &quot;astrophysicist&quot; are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a [[PhD]] in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or [[University|universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=NOAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory. The number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small. The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,700 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=AAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of professional astronomers worldwide is not much larger than the population of a small [[town]], there is a huge community of [[amateur]] astronomers. Most cities have [[amateur astronomy]] clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties in their communities. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; to the very ambitious, who own science-grade [[telescope]]s and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

==Modern astronomers==
Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night, it is very rare for a modern professional astronomer to use an eyepiece on a larger [[telescope]]. It is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, photographic plates were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes - most spend a few weeks per year observing, and the rest of their time reducing the data (changing it from raw data to processed images) and analyzing it. Many astronomers work entirely from [[Astronomical surveys|astronomical survey]] or [[space observatory]] data. Others work with [[radio telescopes]] like the [[Very Large Array]], which is entirely automated, although it is maintained by telescope operators.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service and to encourage interest in the field.

&lt;/ref&gt; and especially refer to a creature moving by using [[pseudopod]]ia.  Most references to &quot;amoebas&quot; or &quot;amoebae&quot; are to amoeboids in general rather than to the specific genus ''[[Amoeba]]''.  The genus ''Amoeba'' and amoeboids in general both derive their names from the ancient Greek word for change.

==Structure==
Amoeboids [[Amoeboid movement|move using pseudopodia]], which are bulges of [[cytoplasm]]. 

Amoebas breathe using their entire cell membrane that is constantly immersed in water. Excess water can cross into the [[cytosol]]. Amoebas have a contractile [[vacuole]] to expel excess water. 

Food sources vary in rhizopoda. They may consume bacteria or other protists. Some are detritivores and eat dead organic material. They extend a pair of pseudopodia around food. They fuse to make a food vacuole which then fuses with a [[lysosome]] to add digestive chemicals. Undigested food is expelled at the cell membrane.

Amoebas use pseudopodia to move and feed. They are powered by flexible microfilaments near the membrane. Microfilaments are at least 50% of the [[cytoskeleton]]. The other parts are more stiff and are composed of intermediate filaments and macrotubules. These are not used in amoeboid movement, but are stiff skeletons on which [[organelles]] are supported or can move on.

The shells of amoebas are often composed of calcium. The proteins or materials are synthesised in the cell and exported just outside the cell membrane.

Amoebas seem to have connections with two phyla of the lineage fungus-like protists. The two phyla are [[myxomycota]] (plasmodial slime molds), and [[acrasiomycota]] (cellular slime molds). These two phyla use amoeboid movement in their feeding stage. One is basically a giant multinucleate amoeba, while the other lives solitary until food runs out; in which a colony of these functions as a unit. Myxomycotes use amoeboid gametes, as well.

==Diversity==
They have appeared in a number of different groups. Some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid, for instance human [[white blood cell]]s, which consume pathogens. Many [[protist]]s also exist as individual amoeboid cells, or take such a form at some point in their life-cycle. The most famous such organism is ''[[Amoeba|Amoeba proteus]]''; the name amoeba is variously used to describe its close relatives, other organisms similar to it, or the amoeboids in general.

As amoebas themselves are [[polyphyletic]] and subject to some imprecision in definition, the term &quot;amoeboid&quot; does not provide identification of an organism, and is better understood as description of locomotion.

When used in the broader sense, the term can include many different groups. One source includes 97 different genera.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Amoebae&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/amoebae.htm |title=The Amoebae |work= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include far fewer.

In older classification systems, amoeboids have been divided into several [[Morphology_(biology)#Morphology_and_classification|morphological categories]] based on the form and structure of the pseudopods. Those where the [[pseudopod]]s are supported by regular arrays of [[microtubule]]s are called actinopods, and forms where they are not are called rhizopods, further divided into lobose, filose, and reticulose amoebae. There is also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids, the [[xenophyophore]]s, that do not fall into any of these categories.

More modern classifications are based upon [[cladistics]]. It has been stated that most amoeboid are now grouped in Amoebozoa or Rhizaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19335771&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pawlowski J, Burki F |title=Untangling the phylogeny of amoeboid protists |journal=J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |year=2009 |pmid=19335771 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2008.00379.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contexts where &quot;amoeboid&quot; is defined more loosely, there are many amoeboid species that are in the [[Excavata]] clade.

Phylogenetic analyses place these genera into the following groups (not all of these are considered amoeboid (or &quot;amoebas&quot;) by all sources):

* Filose pseudopods ([[Filosa]]): Filose pseudopods are narrow and tapering. The vast majority of filose amoebae, including all those that produce shells, are placed within the [[Cercozoa]] together with various flagellates that tend to have amoeboid forms. The naked filose amoebae also includes [[vampyrellid]]s.

* Reticulose pseudopods ([[Endomyxa]]): Reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net. They are found most notably among the [[Foraminifera]], a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi-chambered shells. There are only a few sorts of naked reticulose amoeboids, notably the [[gymnophryid]]s, and their relationships are not certain.

While most morphologies can be mapped to modern classification systems, the older grouping &quot;actinopods&quot; is [[polyphyletic]]. Actinopods are divided into the [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]] (itself a polyphyletic grouping).

==Pathogenic interactions with other organisms==
Some amoeboids can infect other organisms [[pathogen]]ically (causing disease):

*''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' is the cause of [[amoebiasis]], or ''amoebic dysentery''.
*''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'' (the &quot;brain-eating amoeba&quot;) is a fresh-water-native species that can be fatal to humans if introduced through the nose.
*''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' can cause amoebic [[keratitis]] and [[encephalitis]] in humans.
*''[[Balamuthia mandrillaris]]'' is the cause of (often fatal) [[granulomatous amoebic meningoencephalitis]]

ASCII codes represent [[character (computing)|text]] in [[computer]]s, [[telecommunication|communications]] equipment, and other devices that use text. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, though they support many more characters than ASCII does.

'''US-ASCII''' is the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) preferred charset name for ASCII.

Historically, ASCII developed from [[Telegraph code|telegraphic codes]]. Its first commercial use was as a seven-[[bit]] [[teleprinter]] code promoted by Bell data services. Work on ASCII formally began on October 6, 1960, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published during 1963,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot;&gt;Mary Brandel (July 6, 1999).

==History==
[[Image:ASCII Code Chart-Quick ref card.png|thumb|361px|The US ASCII 1968 Code Chart was structured with two columns of control characters, a column with special characters, a column with numbers, and four columns of letters]]
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association, called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group. The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately the [[American National Standards Institute]].

The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on earlier [[teleprinter]] encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols.
To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique]] standard, [[Fieldata]], and early [[EBCDIC]], more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.

The committee debated the possibility of a [[shift key]] function (like the [[Baudot code]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by six [[bit]]s. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes.
It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]]; an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 4. Mackenzie, p.215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee considered an [[8-bit|eight-bit]] code, since eight bits would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[Error detection and correction|error checking]] if desired.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 5. Mackenzie, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; Machines with [[octet (computing)|octets]] as the native [[data type]] that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to ''0''.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer A. Sawyer and Steven George Krantz (January 1, 1995). ''A Tex Primer for Scientists''. CRC Press. ISBN 0-8493-7159-7. p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 8,9. Mackenzie, p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position [[hexadecimal|0x]]20;&lt;ref&gt;Decision 10. Mackenzie, p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; for the same reason, many special signs commonly-used as separators were placed before digits.  The committee decided it was important to support [[upper case]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 14. Mackenzie, p.228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lower case]] letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case. To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter 'A' was placed in position 0x41 to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 18. Mackenzie, p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; The digits 0–9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters. Thus #, $ and % were placed to correspond to 3, 4, and 5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. Since many European typewriters placed the parentheses with 8 and 9, those corresponding positions were chosen for the parentheses. The @ symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented À in the French variation, so the @ was placed in position 0x40 next to the letter A.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), &quot;who are you?&quot; (WRU), &quot;are you?&quot; (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.66, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.435.&lt;/ref&gt; The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7,&lt;ref&gt;Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13–15, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.&lt;ref&gt;Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 – Meeting of October 29–31, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Task Group X3.2.4, June 11, 1963, Pentagon Building, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [[case-insensitive]] character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the [[bracket|brace]] and vertical line characters),&lt;ref&gt;Report of Meeting No. 8, Task Group X3.2.4, December 17 and 18, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was subsequently updated as USASI X3.4-1967, then USASI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986 (the first two are occasionally retronamed ANSI X3.4-1967, and ANSI X3.4-1968).

The X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted ([[least significant bit]] first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some forms of [[punched card]] formats.

ASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]'s TWX (Teletype Wide-area eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit Baudot code, which was also used by the competing Telex teleprinter system. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the escape sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot;/&gt; His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work—according to Bemer, &quot;so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Bemer (n.d.). [http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/EUROPE.HTM Bemer meets Europe]. ''Trailing-edge.com''. Accessed 2008-04-14. Employed at [[IBM]] at that time&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called &quot;the father of ASCII.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;

&lt;!-- &quot;The endorsement of the Federal government, then the largest purchaser of computer equipment, was probably the single most important reason for the subsequent wide adoption of ASCII.&quot; – Martha M. Gray [http://csrc.nist.gov/fips/fips1861.pdf]. /* ?? */ --&gt;
On March 11, 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.&lt;ref&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson (March 11, 1968). [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange]. ''The American Presidency Project''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO/IEC 646]] that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[pound sterling]] (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII since ASCII only suited the needs of the USA and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. Other adapted encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam), and [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is  defined strictly only by ANSI standard.

ASCII was incorporated into the [[Unicode]] character set as the first 128 symbols, so the ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with ASCII, a significant advantage.

==ASCII control characters==
{{main|Control character}}

ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printer]]s) that make use of ASCII, or to provide [[Metadata|meta-information]] about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. For example, character 10 represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents &quot;backspace&quot;. RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2822 (April 2001). &quot;NO-WS-CTL&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional (where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]]) and sometimes accidental (such as what &quot;delete&quot; means).

Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[ASR-33 Teletype]] series, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage through the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 [[Delete key|(Delete)]] became de facto standards. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as &quot;delete previous character&quot; was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

The use of Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off) as a &quot;handshaking&quot; signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow, and Control-Q (XON, &quot;transmit on&quot;) to resume sending, persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.

Code 127 is officially named &quot;delete&quot; but the Teletype label was &quot;rubout&quot;. Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it. Tapes designed to be &quot;hand edited&quot; could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be &quot;rubbed out&quot; and then replacements put into the empty space.

As video terminals began to replace printing ones, the value of the &quot;rubout&quot; character was lost. DEC systems, for example, interpreted &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character before the cursor,&quot; and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems. Most other systems used &quot;Backspace&quot; for that meaning and used &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character at the cursor&quot;. That latter interpretation is the most common now.

Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The &quot;escape&quot; character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of &quot;escape&quot; encountered in URL encodings, [[C programming language|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of a so-called &quot;[[ANSI escape code]]&quot; (or, more properly, a &quot;Control Sequence Introducer&quot;) beginning with ESC followed by a &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (operating system)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.

The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring &quot;plain text&quot; files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletypes required that a line of text be terminated with both &quot;Carriage Return&quot; and &quot;Linefeed&quot;. The first returns the printing carriage to the beginning of the line and the second advances to the next line without moving the carriage. However, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduced unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters, [[plain text]] files on [[Unix-like|Unix]] and [[Amiga]] systems use line feeds alone to separate lines. Similarly, older Macintosh systems, among others, use only carriage returns in plain text files. Various [[IBM]] operating systems used both characters to mark the end of a line, perhaps for compatibility with [[Teleprinter|teletypes]].
This de facto standard was copied into [[CP/M]] and then into [[MS-DOS]] and eventually into [[Microsoft Windows]]. Transmission of text over the [[Internet]], for protocols as [[E-mail]] and the [[World Wide Web]], uses both characters.

Some operating systems such as the pre-[[OpenVMS|VMS]] [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems, along with CP/M, tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used Control-Z (SUB) to mark the end of the actual text in the file.  For this reason, [[End-of-file|EOF]], or end-of-file, was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[Three Letter Acronym|TLA]] for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  For a variety of reasons, the end-of-text code, [[End-of-text character|ETX]] aka [[Control-C]], was inappropriate and using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet, a very convenient [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]].  Text [[string (computer science)|strings]] ending with the [[null character]] are known as [[ASCIZ]], [[ASCIIZ]] or [[C string]]s.

To delete the previous character you had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the &quot;rubout&quot; code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo &quot;^H&quot; for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any &quot;Delete&quot; key produce something other than the Delete character.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASCII printable characters==
Codes 0x20 to 0x7E, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation marks]], and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Code [[hexadecimal|0x]]20, the [[Space (punctuation)|space character]], denotes the space between words, as produced by the space-bar of a keyboard. Since the space character is considered an invisible graphic (rather than a control character)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackenzie 223&quot;&gt;Mackenzie, p.223.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus would not normally be visible, it is represented here by [[Unicode]] character U+2420 &quot;␠&quot;; [[Unicode]] characters U+2422 &quot;␢&quot; or U+2423 &quot;␣&quot; are also available for use when a visible representation of a space is necessary.

Code 0x7F corresponds to the non-printable &quot;Delete&quot; (DEL) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart; it is covered in the previous section's chart.

Earlier versions replaced the [[Caret]] (0x5E) with an up-arrow.

==Aliases==
A June 1992 RFC&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1345 (June 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] registry of character sets&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA&quot; /&gt; recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet:&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;
* ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name)
* iso-ir-6
* ANSI_X3.4-1986
* ISO_646.irv:1991
* ASCII (with ASCII-7 and ASCII-8 variants)
* ISO646-US
* US-ASCII (preferred [[MIME]] name)&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA&quot;&gt;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (May 14, 2007). &quot;[http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets Character Sets]&quot;. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* us
* IBM367
* cp367
* csASCII
&lt;/div&gt;

Of these, the IANA encourages use of the name &quot;US-ASCII&quot; for [[Internet]] uses of ASCII. One often finds this in the optional &quot;charset&quot; parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent &quot;meta&quot; element of some [[HTML]] documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some [[XML]] documents.

==Variants==
As computer technology spread throughout the world, different [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;[[Extended ASCII|ASCII extensions]]&quot;, although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range.

The [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] and [[Galaksija#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.

===Incompatibility vs interoperability===
From early in its development,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Specific Criteria,&quot; attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, &quot;X3-2 Meeting – September 14 and 15,&quot; September 18, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard, ultimately published as [[ISO/IEC 646]] (1972), which would share most characters in common but assign other locally-useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for &quot;national use.&quot;  However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967&lt;ref&gt;R. Maréchal, ISO/TC 97 – Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052, December 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, was a 7-bit character set. It did not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented, and text-processing systems could generally cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to &quot;national use&quot; code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc., programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as
:&lt;code&gt;ä aÄiÜ='Ön'; ü&lt;/code&gt;
instead of
:&lt;code&gt;{ a[i]='\n'; }&lt;/code&gt;
[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use.

Eventually, as 8-, 16-, and [[32-bit]] computers began to replace 18- and 36-bit computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ASCII, with the 128 additional characters providing room to avoid most of the ambiguity that had been necessary in 7-bit codes.

For example, [[IBM]] developed 8-bit [[code page]]s, such as [[code page 437]], which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware.  [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]].

Eight-bit standards such as [[ISO/IEC 8859]] (derived from the DEC-MCS) and [[Mac OS Roman]] developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters. This enabled representation of characters used in a broader range of languages. Because there were several competing 8-bit code standards, they continued to suffer from incompatibilities and limitations. Still, [[ISO-8859-1]] (Latin 1), its variant [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), and the original 7-bit ASCII remain the most common character encodings in use today.

===Unicode===
[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).

To allow backward compatibility, the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards. Therefore, ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS, and, conversely, the UTF-8 encoding forms are binary-compatible with ASCII for code points below 128, meaning all ASCII is valid UTF-8. The other encoding forms resemble ASCII in how they represent the first 128 characters of Unicode, but use 16 or 32 bits per character, so they require conversion for compatibility. (similarly [[UCS-2]] is upwards compatible with UTF-16)

==Order==
ASCII-code order is also called ''ASCIIbetical'' order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ASCIIbetical&amp;i=38025,00.asp ASCIIbetical definition]. ''[[PC Magazine]]''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). The main deviations in ASCII order are:
* All uppercase come before lowercase letters, i.e. &quot;Z&quot; before &quot;a&quot;
* Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters, i.e. &quot;4&quot; is before &quot;one&quot;
An intermediate order which can easily be programmed on a computer converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.

'''Animation''' is the rapid display of a sequence of images of 2-D or 3-D artwork or model positions in order to create an [[illusion]] of movement. The effect is an [[optical illusion]] of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] due to the phenomenon of [[persistence of vision]], and can be created and demonstrated in several ways. The most common method of presenting animation is as a motion picture or video program, although there are other methods.

== Origin of the name ==
&quot;Animation&quot; derivated from the Latin ''anima'', the &quot;animating principle&quot;, the vital force inside every living creature. It is often used as a translation for the Greek word ''psyche'', and related to the Christian concept of ''soul''. &quot;Animation&quot; would be the technique of giving &quot;soul&quot; to inanimate objects, drawings, etc.

== Early examples ==
{{Main|History of animation}}
[[File:Vase animation.svg|thumb|300px|Five images sequence from a vase found in [[Iran]]]]
[[File:Egyptmotionseries.jpg|thumb|300px|An [[Egypt]]ian [[burial chamber]] [[mural]], approximately 4000 years old, showing [[wrestler]]s in action. Even though this may appear similar to a series of animation drawings, there was no way of viewing the images in motion. It does, however, indicate the artist's intention of depicting motion.]]
Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion drawing can be found in [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, where animals are depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.

A 5,000 year old earthen bowl found in Iran in [[Shahr-e Sukhteh|Shahr-i Sokhta]] has five images of a goat painted along the sides. This has been claimed to be an example of early animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Tehran Times Art Desk | url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=164429 | title=CHTHO produces documentary on world’s oldest animation | publisher=[[Tehran Times]] | date=2008-03-04 | accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since no equipment existed to show the images in motion, such a series of images cannot be called animation in a true sense of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Cohn | first=Neil | url=http://www.emaki.net/blog/2006/02/burnt-city-animation-vl.html | title=Burnt City &lt;s&gt;animation&lt;/s&gt; VL | publisher=Emaki Productions | date=2006-02-15 | accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Chinese [[zoetrope]]-type device had been invented in 180&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ronan | first = Colin A | coauthors = Joseph Needham | year = 1985 | title = The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 2 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | id = ISBN 978-0-521-31536-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[phenakistoscope]], [[praxinoscope]], and the common [[flip book]] were early popular animation devices invented during the 19th century.

These devices produced the appearance of movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but animation did not really develop much further until the advent of [[cinematography]].

There is no single person who can be considered the &quot;creator&quot; of film animation, as there were several people ẁorking on projects which could be considered animation at about the same time.

[[Georges Méliès]] was a creator of special-effect films; he was generally one of the first people to use animation with his technique. He discovered a technique by accident which was to stop the camera rolling to change something in the scene, and then continue rolling the film. This idea was later known as stop-motion animation. Méliès discovered this technique accidentally when his camera broke down while shooting a bus driving by. When he had fixed the camera, a hearse happened to be passing by just as Méliès restarted rolling the film, his end result was that he had managed to make a bus transform into a hearse. This was just one of the great contributors to animation in the early years.

The earliest surviving stop-motion advertising film was an English short by [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]] called ''Matches: An Appeal'' (1899). Developed for the [[Bryant and May]] Matchsticks company, it involved stop-motion animation of wired-together matches writing a patriotic call to action on a blackboard.

[[J. Stuart Blackton]] was possibly the first American film-maker to use the techniques of stop-motion and hand-drawn animation. Introduced to film-making by [[Thomas Edison|Edison]], he pioneered these concepts at the turn of the 20th century, with his first copyrighted work dated 1900. Several of his films, among them ''[[The Enchanted Drawing]]'' (1900) and ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) were film versions of Blackton's &quot;lightning artist&quot; routine, and utilized modified versions of Méliès' early stop-motion techniques to make a series of [[blackboard]] drawings appear to move and reshape themselves. 'Humorous Phases of Funny Faces' is regularly cited as the first true animated film, and Blackton is considered the first true [[animator]].

[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|300px|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by Emile Cohl, 1908]]

Another French artist, [[Émile Cohl]], began drawing cartoon strips and created a film in 1908 called ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]''. The film largely consisted of a [[stick figure]] moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. There were also sections of live action where the animator’s hands would enter the scene. The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto [[negative film]], which gave the picture a blackboard look. This makes ''Fantasmagorie'' the first animated film created using what came to be known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].

Following the successes of Blackton and Cohl, many other artists began experimenting with animation. One such artist was [[Winsor McCay]], a successful newspaper cartoonist, who created detailed animations that required a team of artists and painstaking attention for detail. Each frame was drawn on paper; which invariably required backgrounds and characters to be redrawn and animated. Among McCay's most noted films are ''[[Little Nemo]]'' (1911), ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914) and ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]'' (1918).

The production of animated short films, typically referred to as &quot;cartoons&quot;, became an industry of its own during the 1910s, and cartoon shorts were produced to be shown in [[movie theaters]]. The most successful early animation producer was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with [[animator]] [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.

== Techniques ==
=== Traditional animation ===
{{Main|Traditional animation}}
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|left|250px|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th century photos]]

Traditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, which are first drawn on paper. To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one onto motion picture film against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]].

The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system. Various [[software]] programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects. The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and newer media such as [[digital video]]. The &quot;look&quot; of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years. Some animation producers have used the term &quot;tradigital&quot; to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technology.

Examples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940), ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), and ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988). Traditional animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994) ''[[Spirited Away|Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away)]]'' (Japan, 2001), and ''[[Les Triplettes de Belleville]]'' (2003).

* '''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films, which regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement. Fully animated films can be done in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works such as those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Lion King]]'') to the more 'cartoony' styles of those produced by the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works such as ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007).
* '''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed and/or more stylized drawings and methods of movement. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]], limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and much of the [[anime]] produced in Japan. Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media such as television (the work of [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Filmation]], and other TV animation studios) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s). Some recent examples are; [[Spongebob Squarepants]] (USA, 1999–present), [[The Fairly OddParents]] (USA, 2001–present) and [[Invader Zim]] (USA, 2001–2002, 2006).
* '''[[Rotoscoping]]''' is a technique, patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917, where animators trace live-action movement, [[frame (film)|frame]] by frame. The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are: [[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|''Fire and Ice'']] (USA, 1983) and [[Heavy Metal (film)|''Heavy Metal'']] (1981).
* '''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique, when combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots. One of the earlier uses of it was [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage. Other examples would include ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit?]]'' (USA, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (USA, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (USA, 2002).

=== Stop motion ===
[[File:Moving Penny.gif|thumb|225px|right|A [[stop-motion animation]] of a moving coin]]
{{Main|Stop motion}}

Stop-motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement. There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the type of media used to create the animation. Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation.
* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting with each other in a constructed environment, in contrast to the real-world interaction in model animation. The puppets generally have an [[armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady as well as constraining them to move at particular joints. Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Jiří Trnka]] and the TV series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005–present).
** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]], are puppet-animated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet. [[File:Animacion-con-plastilina-y-clay-animation-pelicula-Kuzmich-153.jpg|thumb|250px|Clay animation]]
* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or Plasticine animation often abbreviated as ''claymation'', uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation. The figures may have an [[armature]] or wire frame inside of them, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated in order to pose the figures. Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, such as in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957–1967) ''[[Morph (character)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977–2000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan Švankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and [[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]].
* '''[[Cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving 2-dimensional pieces of material such as paper or cloth. Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969–1974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; ''[[Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the TV series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997). [[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|225px|left|A [[clay animation]] scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[television commercial]]]]
** '''[[Silhouette animation]]''' is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes. Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Princes et princesses]]'' (France, 2000).
* '''[[Model animation]]''' refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world. Intercutting, [[matte]] effects, and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings. Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films such ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1961), and the work of [[Willis O'Brien]] on films such as ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933 film).
** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation which uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion. The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effects]] scenes for the film ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980). Another example is the dragon named ''Vermithrax'' from [[Dragonslayer]] (1981 film).
* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.
** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.) which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement. At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.
* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters. This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other such effects. Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts.

=== Computer animation ===
{{Main|Computer animation}}
[[File:Rotating earth (large).gif|thumb|300px|A short [[gif]] animation of [[Earth]]]]
Computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.

==== 2D animation ====
[[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created and/or edited on the computer using 2D [[bitmap graphics]] or created and edited using 2D [[vector graphics]]. This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques such as of [[tweening]], [[morphing]], [[onion skinning]] and [[interpolated]] rotoscoping.

Examples: ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', ''[[Danny Phantom]]'', ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', ''[[The Secret of Kells]]''
* [[Scanimate|Analog computer animation]]
* [[Flash animation]]
* [[PowerPoint animation]]

==== 3D animation ====
[[3D animation]] is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. In order to manipulate a mesh, it is given a digital skeletal structure that can be used to control the mesh. This process is called rigging. Various other techniques can be applied, such as mathematical functions (ex. gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, effects such as fire and water and the use of [[motion capture]] to name but a few, these techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics. Well-made [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[animations]] can be difficult to distinguish from live action and are commonly used as [[visual effects]] for recent movies.  [[Toy Story]] (1995, USA) is the first feature-length film to be created and rendered entirely using 3D graphics.

===== Terms =====
* [[Computer animation|Photo realistic animation]], is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life. Using advanced rendering that makes detailed skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc. to mimic real life. Examples include [[Up (2009 film)|Up]] (2009, USA), [[Kung-Fu Panda]] (2008, USA), [[Ice Age (film)|Ice Age]] (2002, USA).
* [[Cel-shaded animation]], is used to mimic traditional animation using CG software. Shading looked stark and less blending colors. Examples include, [[Skyland]] (2007, France), [[Appleseed]] (2007, Japan), [[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]] (2002, Japan)
* [[Motion capture]], is used when live action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters. Examples include [[Polar Express]] (2004, USA), [[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]] (2007, USA), [[Disney's A Christmas Carol]] (2009, USA), [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]] (2009, USA), and [[Mars Needs Moms]] (2011, USA).

2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact. 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.

=== Other animation techniques ===
* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]], [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].
* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of [[glass]], for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].
* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using tradition 2D medium, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image. For example, [[William Kentridge]] is famous for his [[charcoal]] erasure films.
* '''[[Pinscreen animation]]''': makes use of a screen filled with movable pins, which can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen. The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.
* '''[[Sand animation]]''': sand is moved around on a back- or front-lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film. This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the [[light]] [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].
* '''[[Flip book]]''': A flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change. Flip books are often illustrated books for children, but may also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners. Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.

=== Other techniques and approaches ===
* [[Character animation]]
* [[Chuckimation]]
* [[Multi-sketch]]ing
* [[Special effects animation]]
* [[Animatronics]]
* [[Stop motion]]

'''Apollo''' ([[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], and [[Homeric Greek]]: Ἀπόλλων, ''Apollōn'' (gen.: Ἀπόλλωνος); [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: Ἀπέλλων, ''Apellōn''; [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]]: Ἀπείλων, ''Apeilōn''; [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]: Ἄπλουν, ''Aploun''; {{lang-la|Apollō}}) is one of the most important and diverse of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] in [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]].  The ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of light and the sun, truth and prophecy, medicine, healing, plague, music, poetry, arts and more.  Apollo is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and has a [[twin]] sister, the chaste huntress [[Artemis]]. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''Apulu''. Apollo was worshiped in both [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]], as well as in the modern [[Hellenic neopaganism|Greco]]–[[Nova Roma|Roman]] [[Neopaganism]].

As the patron of [[Delphi]] (''Pythian Apollo''), Apollo was an [[oracular]] god—the prophetic deity of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]]. Medicine and healing were associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]], yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]].  Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]], and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.  As the leader of the [[Muse]]s (''Apollon Musegetes'') and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and [[poetry]].  [[Hermes]] created the [[lyre]] for him, and the instrument became a common [[Apollo#Attributes and symbols|attribute]] of Apollo. Hymns sung to Apollo were called [[paean]]s.

In Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[solar deity|god of the sun]], and his sister Artemis similarly equated with [[Selene]],  Titan [[lunar deity|goddess of the moon]].&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexander–Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. &quot;Helios&quot;, in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117–23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, on the other hand, Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] among the [[Classical Latin|Augustan poets]] of the 1st century, not even in the conjurations of [[Aeneas]] and [[Latinus]] in [[Aeneid]] XII (161–215).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439–55; &quot;Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid&quot;, ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429–44; and  &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus&quot; ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.

==Etymology==
The etymology of ''Apollo'' is uncertain.
The spelling Ἀπόλλων had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form Απέλλων is more archaic, derived from an earlier *Απέλjων. The name is certainly cognate with the Doric month name Απέλλαιος and the Doric festival [[Apellai|απελλαι]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;&gt;[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]], s.v. &quot;Apollo&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instances of [[popular etymology]] are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb ἀπόλλυμι (''apollymi''), &quot;to destroy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=apollo Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Apollo]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus]]'' connects the name with {{polytonic|ἀπόλυσις}} (''apolysis''), &quot;redeem&quot;, with {{polytonic|ἀπόλουσις}} (''apolousis''), &quot;purification&quot;, and with {{polytonic|ἁπλοῦν}} (''aploun''), &quot;simple&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The {{polytonic|ἁπλοῦν}} suggestion is repeated by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' in the sense of &quot;[[1 (number)|unity]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, {{polytonic|Ἄπλουν}}, and finally with {{polytonic|Ἀει-βάλλων}} (''aeiballon''), &quot;ever-shooting&quot;. [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric απέλλα (''apella''), which means &quot;assembly&quot;, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation σηκός (''sekos''), &quot;fold&quot;, in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.

Following the tradition of these Ancient Greek folk etymologies, in the Doric dialect the word {{polytonic|απέλλα}} originally meant wall, fence from animals and later assembly within the ''[[agora]]''. In the Macedonian dialect {{polytonic|πέλλα}} (pella) means stone, and some [[toponyms]] are derived from this word: {{polytonic|Πέλλα}} (''[[Pella]]''), {{polytonic|Πελλήνη}} (''Pellini'').

The form  ''[[Apaliunas]]'' (''{{lang|hit-Latn|]x-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš}}'') is attested as a god of [[Wilusa]] in a treaty between [[Alaksandu]] of Wilusa interpreted as &quot;[[Paris (mythology)|Alexander]] of [[Troy|Ilios]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Latacz, Joachim, ''Troia und Homer: Der Weg zur Lösung eines alten Rätsels.'' (Munich) 2001:138.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hittite great king [[Muwatalli II]] ''ca'' 1280 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;The reading of ''Apaliunas'' and the identification with Apollo is due to [[Emil Forrer]] (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; The Hittite testimony reflects an early form ''{{lang|grc-Latin|*Apeljōn}}'', which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot Απειλων with Doric Απελλων.&lt;ref&gt;
Hans G. Güterbock, &quot;Troy in Hittite Texts?&quot; in: Mellink (ed.), ''Troy and the Trojan War: a symposium held at Bryn Mawr College, October 1984'', Bryn Mawr Archaeological Monographs
Authors	John Lawrence Angel, Machteld Johanna Mellink, 1986, ISBN 9780929524597, p. 42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name,&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', vol. I (C.H. Beck) 1955:555-564.&lt;/ref&gt; among them a [[Hurrian]] and [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] divinity, ''Aplu'', who was widely invoked during the &quot;plague years&quot;.  Aplu, it is suggested, comes from the [[Akkadian]] ''Aplu Enlil'', meaning &quot;the son of Enlil&quot;, a title that was given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to [[Shamash]], Babylonian god of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;de Grummond, Nancy Thomson (2006) ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend''. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:  University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology); Mackenzie, Donald A. (2005) ''Myths of Babylonia and Assyria'' (Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Luwian]] etymology suggested for ''Apaliunas'' makes Apollo &quot;The One of Entrapment&quot;, perhaps in the sense of &quot;Hunter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Greco-Roman epithets ===
Apollo, like other Greek deities, had a number of [[epithet]]s applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in [[Latin literature]], chief among them '''[[Phoebus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə|s}} {{respell|FEE|bəs}}; Φοίβος, ''Phoibos'', literally &quot;radiant&quot;), which was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans in Apollo's role as the god of light.

As sun-god and god of light, Apollo was also known by the epithets '''Aegletes''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|ɡ|l|iː|t|iː|z}} {{respell|ə|GLEE|teez}}; Αἰγλήτης, ''Aiglētēs'', from αἴγλη, &quot;light of the sun&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], iv. 1730;'' [[Bibliotheke|Biblioteca]]'', i. 9. § 26&lt;/ref&gt; '''Helius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|iː|l|i|ə|s}} {{respell|HEE|lee-əs}}; Ἥλιος, ''[[Helios]]'', literally &quot;sun&quot;),&lt;ref name=simbolismo&gt;{{cite book |title=Simbolismo divino |last=Álvaro, Jr., Santos |first=Allan |year= |publisher=Allan Álvaro, Jr., Santos |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=uAiConL3xyYC&amp;dq=articenens |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Phanaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|n|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|fə|NEE|əs}}; Φαναῖος, ''Phanaios'', literally &quot;giving or bringing light&quot;), and '''[[Apollo Lyceus|Lyceus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|s|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|ly|SEE|əs}}; Λύκειος, ''Lukeios'', from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *λύκη, &quot;light&quot;). The meaning of the epithet &quot;Lyceus&quot; later became associated Apollo's mother [[Leto]], who was the patron goddes of [[Lycia]] (Λυκία) and who was identified with the wolf (λύκος),&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On the Nature of Animals'' 4. 4 (A.F. Scholfield, tr.).&lt;/ref&gt; earning him the epithets '''Lycegenes''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|s|ɛ|dʒ|ən|iː|z}} {{respell|ly|SEJ|ə-neez}}; Λυκηγενής, ''Lukēgenēs'', literally &quot;born of a wolf&quot; or &quot;born of Lycia&quot;) and '''Lycoctonus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|t|ən|ə|s}} {{respell|ly|KOK|tə-nəs}}; Λυκοκτόνος, ''Lukoktonos'', from λύκος, &quot;wolf&quot;, and κτείνειν, &quot;to kill&quot;). As god of the sun, the Romans referred to Apollo as '''[[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|l}} {{respell|SOL|'}}; literally &quot;sun&quot; in Latin).

In association with his birthplace, [[Cynthus|Mount Cynthus]] on the island of [[Delos]], Apollo was called '''Cynthius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|θ|i|ə|s}} {{respell|SIN|thee-əs}}; Κύνθιος, ''Kunthios'', literally &quot;Cynthian&quot;), '''Cynthogenes''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|n|ˈ|θ|ɒ|dʒ|ɨ|n|iː|z}} {{respell|sin|THOJ|i-neez}}; Κύνθογενης, ''Kunthogenēs'', literally &quot;born of Cynthus&quot;), and '''Delius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|l|i|ə|s}} {{respell|DEE|lee-əs}}; Δήλιος, ''Delios'', literally &quot;Delian&quot;). As [[Artemis]]'s twin, Apollo had the epithet '''Didymaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|d|ɨ|ˈ|m|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|did-i|MEE|əs}}; Διδυμαιος, ''Didumaios'', from δίδυμος, &quot;twin&quot;).

Apollo was worshipped as '''Actiacus''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|k|ˈ|t|aɪ|.|ə|k|ə|s}} {{respell|ak|TY|ə-kəs}}; Ἄκτιακός, ''Aktiakos'', literally &quot;Actian&quot;), '''Delphinius''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɛ|l|ˈ|f|ɪ|n|i|ə|s}} {{respell|del|FIN|ee-əs}}; Δελφίνιος, ''Delphinios'', literally &quot;Delphic&quot;), and '''Pythius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|θ|i|ə|s}} {{respell|PITH|ee-əs}}; Πύθιος, ''Puthios'', from Πυθώ, ''Pūthō'', the area around Delphi), after [[Actium]] (Ἄκτιον) and [[Delphi]] (Δελφοί) respectively, two of his principal places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xiii. 715&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], x. p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; An [[etiology]] in the [[Homeric hymns]] associated the epithet &quot;Delphinius&quot; with [[dolphin]]s. He was worshipped as '''Acraephius''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|r|iː|f|i|ə|s}} {{respell|ə|KREE|fee-əs}}; Ἀκραιφιος, ''Akraiphios'', literally &quot;Acraephian&quot;) or '''Acraephiaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|k|r|iː|f|i|ˈ|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|ə|KREE|fee|EE|əs}}; Ἀκραιφιαίος, ''Akraiphiaios'', literally &quot;Acraephian&quot;) in the [[Boeotia]]n town of [[Acraephia]] (Ἀκραιφία), reputedly founded by his son [[Acraepheus]]; and as '''[[Hamaxitus#Apollo_Smintheus|Smintheus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|m|ɪ|n|θ|j|uː|s}} {{respell|SMIN|thews}}; Σμινθεύς, ''Smintheus'', &quot;Sminthian&quot;—that is, &quot;of the town of Sminthos or Sminthe&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*sminqeu%2Fs Σμινθεύς] in [[LSJ]]&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[Troad]] town of [[Hamaxitus]]. The epithet &quot;Smintheus&quot; has historically been confused with σμίνθος, &quot;mouse&quot;, in association with Apollo's role as a god of disease. For this he was also known as '''Parnopius''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɑr|ˈ|n|oʊ|p|i|ə|s}} {{respell|par|NOH|pee-əs}}; Παρνόπιος, ''Parnopios'', from πάρνοψ, &quot;locust&quot;) and to the Romans as '''Culicarius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|juː|l|ɨ|ˈ|k|ær|i|ə|s}} {{respell|KEW|li|KARR|ee-əs}}; from Latin ''culicārius'', &quot;of midges&quot;).

In Apollo's role as a healer, his appellations included '''Acesius''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|iː|ʒ|ə|s}} {{respell|ə|SEE|zhəs}}; Ἀκέσιος, ''Akesios'', from ἄκεσις, &quot;healing&quot;), '''[[Acestor]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|s|t|ər}} {{respell|ə|SES|tər}}; Ἀκέστωρ, ''Akestōr'', literally &quot;healer&quot;), '''[[Paean (god)|Paean]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|ən}} {{respell|PEE|ən}}; Παιάν, ''Paiān'', from παίειν, &quot;to touch&quot;), and '''Iatrus''' ({{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|æ|t|r|ə|s}} {{respell|eye|AT|rəs}}; Ἰατρός, ''Iātros'', literally &quot;physician&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''[[Andromache (play)|Andromache]]'' 901&lt;/ref&gt; Acesius was the epithet of Apollo worshipped in [[Elis]], where he had a temple in the [[agora]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;&quot;Acesius&quot;. ''Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''. London, 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans referred to Apollo as '''Medicus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|d|ɨ|k|ə|s}} {{respell|MED|i-kəs}}; literally &quot;physician&quot; in Latin) in this respect. A [[Roman temple|temple]] was dedicated to ''Apollo Medicus'' at Rome, probably next to the temple of [[Bellona]].

As a protector and founder, Apollo had the epithets '''[[Alexicacus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|l|ɛ|k|s|ɨ|ˈ|k|eɪ|k|ə|s}} {{respell|ə|LEK|si|KAY|kəs}}; Ἀλεξίκακος, ''Alexikakos'', literally &quot;warding off evil&quot;), '''Apotropaeus''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|p|ɒ|t|r|ə|ˈ|p|iː|ə|s}} {{respell|ə|POT|rə|PEE|əs}}; Ἀποτρόπαιος, ''Apotropaios'', from ὰποτρέπειν, &quot;to avert&quot;), and '''Epicurius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|p|ɨ|ˈ|k|j|ʊr|i|ə|s}} {{respell|EP|i|KEWR|ee-əs}}; Ἐπικούριος, ''Epikourios'', from ἐπικουρέειν, &quot;to aid&quot;),&lt;ref name=simbolismo/&gt; as well as '''Archegetes''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|ɛ|dʒ|ə|t|iː|z}} {{respell|ar|KEJ|ə-teez}}; Ἀρχηγέτης, ''Arkhēgetēs'', literally &quot;founder&quot;), '''Clarius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ær|i|ə|s}} {{respell|KLARR|ee-əs}}; Κλάριος, ''Klārios'', from [[Doric Greek|Doric]] κλάρος, &quot;allotted lot&quot;), and '''Genetor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ɨ|t|ər}} {{respell|JEN|i-tər}}; Γενέτωρ, ''Genetōr'', literally &quot;ancestor&quot;).&lt;ref name=simbolismo/&gt; To the Romans, he was known in this capacity as '''Averruncus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|v|ə|ˈ|r|ʌ|ŋ|k|ə|s}} {{respell|AV|ər|RUNG|kəs}}; from Latin ''āverruncare'', &quot;to avert&quot;). He was also called '''[[Agyieus]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|.|ɨ|j|uː|s}} {{respell|ə|JY|i|ews}}; Ἀγυιεύς, ''Aguīeus'', from ὰγυιά, &quot;street&quot;) for his role in protecting roads and homes; and as '''Nomius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|m|i|ə|s}} {{respell|NOH|mee-əs}}; Νόμιος, ''Nomios'', literally &quot;pastoral&quot;) and '''Nymphegetes''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|m|ˈ|f|ɛ|dʒ|ɨ|t|iː|z}} {{respell|nim|FEJ|i-teez}}; Νυμφηγέτης, ''Numphēgetēs'', from Νύμφη, &quot;Nymph&quot;, and ἡγέτης, &quot;leader&quot;) in his role as a protector of shepherds and pastoral life.

In his role as god of prophecy and truth, Apollo had the epithets '''Manticus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|n|t|ɨ|k|ə|s}} {{respell|MAN|ti-kəs}}; Μαντικός, ''Mantikos'', literally &quot;prophetic&quot;), '''Leschenorius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|s|k|ɨ|ˈ|n|ɔər|i|ə|s}} {{respell|LES|ki|NOHR|ee-əs}}; Λεσχηνόριος, ''Leskhēnorios'', from λεσχήνωρ, &quot;converser&quot;), and '''Loxias''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɒ|k||s|i|.|ə|s}} {{respell|LOK|see-əs}}; Λοξίας, ''Loxias'', from λέγειν, &quot;to say&quot;).&lt;ref name=simbolismo/&gt; The epithet &quot;Loxias&quot; has historically been associated with λοξός, &quot;ambiguous&quot;. In this respect, the Romans called him '''Coelispex''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|ɨ|s|p|ɛ|k|s}} {{respell|SEL|i-speks}}; from Latin ''coelum'', &quot;sky&quot;, and ''specere'', &quot;to look at&quot;). The epithet '''Iatromantis''' ({{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˌ|æ|t|r|ə|ˈ|m|æ|n|t|ɪ|s}} {{respell|eye|AT|rə|MAN|tis}}; Ἰατρομάντις, ''Iātromantis'', from ὶατρός, &quot;physician&quot;, and μάντις, &quot;prophet&quot;) refers to both his role as a god of healing and of prophecy. As god of music and arts, Apollo had the epithet '''Musagetes''' ({{IPAc-en|m|juː|ˈ|s|æ|dʒ|ɨ|t|iː|z}} {{respell|mew|SAJ|i-teez}}; [[Doric Greek|Doric]] Μουσαγέτας, ''Mousāgetās'')&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]] entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*mousage%2Ftas Μουσαγέτας]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Musegetes''' ({{IPAc-en|m|juː|ˈ|s|ɛ|dʒ|ɨ|t|iː|z}} {{respell|mew|SEJ|i-teez}}; Μουσηγέτης, ''Mousēgetēs'', from Μούσα, &quot;[[Muse]]&quot;, and ἡγέτης, &quot;leader&quot;).

As a god of archery, Apollo was known as '''Aphetor''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|f|iː|t|ər}} {{respell|ə|FEE|tər}}; Ἀφήτωρ, ''Aphētōr'', from ὰφίημι, &quot;to let loose&quot;) or '''Aphetorus''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|f|ɛ|t|ər|ə|s}} {{respell|ə|FET|ər-əs}}; Ἀφητόρος, ''Aphētoros'', of the same origin), '''Argyrotoxus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑr|dʒ|ɨ|r|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|k|s|ə|s}} {{respell|AR|ji-rə|TOK|səs}}; Ἀργυρότοξος, ''Argurotoxos'', literally &quot;with silver bow&quot;), '''Hecaërgus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɛ|k|i|ˈ|ɜr|ɡ|ə|s}} {{respell|HEK|ee|UR|gəs}}; Ἑκάεργος, ''Hekaergos'', literally &quot;far-shooting&quot;), and '''Hecebolus''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɨ|ˈ|s|ɛ|b|əl|ə|s}} {{respell|hi|SEB|ə-ləs}}; Ἑκηβόλος, ''Hekēbolos'', literally &quot;far-shooting&quot;). The Romans referred to Apollo as '''Articenens''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|t|ɪ|s|ɨ|n|ən|z}} {{respell|ar|TISS|i-nənz}}; &quot;bow-carrying&quot;). Apollo was called '''Ismenius''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|z|ˈ|m|iː|n|i|ə|s}} {{respell|iz|MEE|nee-əs}}; Ἰσμηνιός, ''Ismēnios'', literally &quot;of Ismenus&quot;) after Ismenus, the son of [[Amphion]] and [[Niobe]], whom he struck with an arrow.

=== Celtic epithets and cult titles ===
Apollo was worshipped throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. In the traditionally [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with [[List of Celtic gods|Celtic gods]] of similar character.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda J. Green, ''Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend'',  Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Apollo Atepomarus]]''' (&quot;the great horseman&quot; or &quot;possessing a great horse&quot;). Apollo was worshipped at [[Mauvières]] ([[Indre]]). Horses were, in the Celtic world, closely linked to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' XIII, 1863–1986; A. Ross,, ''Pagan Celtic Britain'',  1967;  M.J. Green, ''The Gods of the Celts'', 1986, London&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Apollo Belenus]]''' ('bright' or 'brilliant'). This epithet was given to Apollo in parts of [[Gaul]], Northern Italy and [[Noricum]] (part of modern Austria). Apollo Belenus was a healing and sun god.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zwicker, ''Fontes Historiae Religionis Celticae'', 1934–36, Berlin; ''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' V, XI, XII, XIII; J. Gourcest, &quot;Le culte de Belenos en Provence occidentale et en Gaule&quot;,  ''Ogam'' '''6'''.6 (1954:257–262); E.

* '''[[Apollo Cunomaglus]]''' ('hound lord'). A title given to Apollo at a shrine in [[Wiltshire]]. Apollo Cunomaglus may have been a god of healing. Cunomaglus himself may originally have been an independent healing god.&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Wedlake, ''The Excavation of the Shrine of Apollo at Nettleton, Wiltshire, 1956–1971'', Society of Antiquaries of London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Apollo Grannus]]'''. Grannus was a healing spring god, later equated with Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;M.

* '''[[Apollo Virotutis]]''' ('benefactor of mankind?'). Apollo Virotutis was worshipped, among other places, at Fins d'Annecy ([[Haute-Savoie]]) and at [[Jublains]] ([[Maine-et-Loire]]).&lt;ref name=devries/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' XIII&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to [[Artemis]], Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of [[Pytho]].

A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship, but be established conclusively.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;/&gt; [[Walter Burkert]]&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:144.&lt;/ref&gt; discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed &quot;a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.&quot; The connection with Dorians and their initiation festival ''[[apella]]i'' is reinforced by the month ''Apellaios'' in northwest Greek calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, ''Apollo'' p. 104-113; Burkert also notes in this context [[Archilochus]] ''Fr.'' 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homer]] pictures Apollo on the side of the [[Troy|Trojan]]s, fighting against the [[Achaean]]s, during the [[Trojan War]], a connection seemingly confirmed by the discovery of ''Apalunias'' as a tutelary god of [[Wilusa]].&lt;ref&gt;Croft, John (2003) wrote in the [https://listhost.uchicago.edu/pipermail/ane/2003-May/009551.html Ancient Near East mail list hosted by the University of Chicago] that &quot;Apollo does not have a Greek provenance but an Anatolian one.  Luwian Apaliuna seems to have travelled west from further East.  Hurrian Aplu was a god of the plague, and resembles the mouse god Apollo Smintheus.  Hurrian Aplu itself seems derived from the Babylonian &quot;Aplu&quot; meaning a &quot;son of&quot;—a title that was given to the Babylonian plague God, Nergal (son of Enlil)&quot;{{verify credibility|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks gave to Apollo the name αγυιεύς [[agyieus]] as the protector god who wards off evil.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion.'' vol. I (C.H. Beck) 1955:563f.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Late Bronze Age]] (from 1700–1200 BCE) [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] ''Aplu'', like the Homeric Apollo, was a god of [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s, and resembles the mouse god ''Apollo Smintheus''. Here we have an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it, merging over time through fusion with the [[Mycenae]]an healer-god Paeon (PA-JA-WO in [[Linear B]]); [[Paeon (god)|Paeon]], in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', was the Greek healer of the wounded gods [[Ares]] and [[Hades]]. In later writers, the word, usually spelled &quot;Paean&quot;, becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of [[healing]],&lt;ref&gt;Graf, ''Apollo'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=it9n9_I-UOkC&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now known from Linear B that Paeon was originally a separate deity.

Homer illustrated Paeon the god, as well as the song both of [[apotropaic]] thanksgiving or triumph,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Paean]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hesiod]] also separated the two; in later poetry Paeon was invoked independently as a god of healing. It is equally difficult to separate Paeon or Paean in the sense of &quot;healer&quot; from Paean in the sense of &quot;song.&quot;
Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to [[Dionysus]], to Apollo [[Helios]], to Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] the healer. About the  4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be sung by an [[army]] on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

==Mythology==
===Birth===

When Zeus' wife [[Hera]] discovered that Leto was pregnant and that he was the father, she banned [[Leto]] from giving birth on &quot;terra firma&quot;.  In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island, so she gave birth there, where she was accepted by the people, offering them her promise that her son will be always favourable toward the city. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. This island later became sacred to Apollo.

It is also stated that Hera kidnapped [[Ilithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace, nine yards (8 m) long, of amber. Mythographers agree that [[Artemis]] was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of [[Ortygia]] and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the seventh day ({{polytonic|ἑβδομαγενής}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%28bdomagenh%2Fs ἑβδομαγενής],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) of the month Thargelion —according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.

=== Youth ===
Four days after his birth, Apollo killed the [[chthonic]] dragon [[Python (mythology)|Python]], which lived in [[Delphi]] beside the [[Castalian Spring]]. This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at Delphi to give her prophecies. Hera sent the serpent to hunt Leto to her death across the world. In order to protect his mother, Apollo begged [[Hephaestus]] for a bow and arrows. After receiving them, Apollo cornered Python in the sacred cave at Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;''Children of the Gods'' by Kenneth McLeish, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].

Hera then sent the giant [[Tityos]] to kill Leto. This time Apollo was aided by his sister Artemis in protecting their mother. During the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to [[Tartarus]]. There he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, where a pair of [[vulture]]s feasted daily on his liver.

=== Trojan War ===
Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the [[Trojan War]] in retribution for [[Agamemnon]]'s insult to [[Chryses]], a priest of Apollo whose daughter  [[Chryseis]] had been captured. He demanded her return, and the Achaeans complied, indirectly causing the anger of Achilles, which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.

In the ''[[Iliad]]'', when [[Diomedes]] injured [[Aeneas]], Apollo rescued him.  First, [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well.  Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Apollo, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]].

Apollo aided [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] in the killing of [[Achilles]] by guiding the arrow of his bow into [[Achilles]]' heel. One interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for Achilles' sacrilege in murdering [[Troilus]], the god's own son by [[Hecuba]], on the very altar of the god's own temple.

=== Admetus ===
When Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] from the dead (transgressing [[Themis]] by stealing [[Hades]]'s subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliothke]]'' iii. 10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] forever, but was instead sentenced to one year of [[Penal labour|hard labor]] as punishment, due to the intercession of his mother, [[Leto]]. During this time he served as shepherd for [[Admetus|King Admetus]] of [[Pherae]] in [[Thessaly]]. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus.

Apollo helped Admetus win [[Alcestis]], the daughter of [[Pelias|King Pelias]] and later convinced the [[Moirae|Fates]] to let Admetus live past his time, if another took his place. But when it came time for Admetus to die, his parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. Instead, Alcestis took his place, but [[Heracles]] managed to &quot;persuade&quot; [[Thanatos]], the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.

[[Image:Niobe JacquesLouisDavid 1772 Dallas Museum of Art.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Artemis and Apollo Piercing Niobe’s Children with their Arrows by [[Jacques-Louis David]] ]]

=== Niobe ===

[[Niobe]], the queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]], boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two.  Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life, and Artemis her daughters.  Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared ([[Chloris]], usually).  Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.  A devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept.  Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]].  Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

=== Consorts and children ===
Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;&quot;The love-stories themselves were not told until later.&quot; ([[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951:140.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made favorites some of them of painters since the Renaissance, so that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

====Female lovers====
{{Main|Apollo and Daphne}}

[[Image:ApolloAndDaphne.JPG|left|200px|thumb|Apollo and Daphne by [[Bernini]] in the Galleria Borghese]]

In explanation of the connection of Apollo with δάφνη (''daphnē''), the [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] whose leaves his priestess employed at [[Delphi]], it is told&lt;ref&gt;The ancient Daphne episode is noted in late narratives, notably in [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]], in [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'', 203 and by the fourth-century-CE teacher of rhetoric and Christian convert, [[Libanius]], in ''Narrationes''.&lt;/ref&gt; that Apollo chased a nymph, [[Daphne]], daughter of the [[Sea and river deity|river god]] [[Peneus]], who had scorned him. In [[Ovid]]'s telling for a Roman audience, Phoebus Apollo chaffs Cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man, whereupon Cupid wounds him with a golden dart; simultaneously, however, Cupid shoots a leaden arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prays to her father, Peneus, for help, and he changes her into the laurel tree, sacred to Apollo.

Apollo had an affair with a human princess named [[Leucothea]], daughter of [[Orchamus]] and sister of [[Clytia]]. Leucothea loved Apollo who disguised himself as Leucothea's mother to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive. Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died. Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.

[[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well.  [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved.  She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire poets.

By [[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]], Apollo had a son named [[Aristaeus]], who became the patron god of cattle, [[fruit trees]], hunting, husbandry and [[bee-keeping]]. He was also a [[culture-hero]] and taught humanity dairy skills and the use of nets and traps in hunting, as well as how to cultivate olives.

With [[Hecuba]], wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], Apollo had a son named [[Troilus]].  An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive.  He was ambushed and killed by [[Achilles]].

Apollo also fell in love with [[Cassandra]], daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilus' half-sister.  He promised Cassandra the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards.  Enraged, Apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future, with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her.

[[Coronis]], daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]], was another of Apollo's liaisons.  Pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]].  A crow informed Apollo of the affair. When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for spreading untruths. When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis (in other stories, Apollo himself had killed Coronis). As a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths. Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise. Phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Apollo then killed him for what he did.

In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', Apollo fathered [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa]], wife of [[Xuthus]].  Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, but Apollo asked [[Hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[Delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess.

[[Image:Hyacinthus.jpg|thumb|''Apollo and Hyacinthus''&lt;br&gt;Jacopo Caraglio; 16th c. Italian engraving]]

One of his other liaisons was with [[Acantha]], the spirit of the [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] tree. Upon her death, Apollo transformed her into a sun-loving herb.

According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Biblioteca]]'', the &quot;library&quot; of mythology mis-attributed to Apollodorus, he fathered the [[Corybantes]] on the Muse [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html ''Bibliotheca'', 1.3.4]. Other ancient sources, however, gave the Corybantes different parents; see [[James George Frazer|Sir James Frazer]]'s [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Ap1a.html#46 note] on the passage in the ''Bibliotheca''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Male lovers====

[[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] or Hyacinthus was one of Apollo's male lovers. He was a [[Sparta]]n prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair was practicing throwing the [[Discus throw|discus]] when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous [[Zephyrus]] and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief: out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a [[hyacinth (plant)|flower]] named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with ''άί'' ''άί'', meaning alas. The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta.

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[Pilum|javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]] named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

=== Apollo's lyre ===
[[Hermes]] was born on [[Mount Kyllini|Mount Cyllene]] in Arcadia. The story is told in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Hermes]]. His mother, [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], had been secretly impregnated by [[Zeus]]. Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep. Hermes ran to [[Thessaly]], where Apollo was grazing his cattle. The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first [[lyre]]. Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo's claim. Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became a master of the lyre.

===Apollo in the ''Oresteia''===
In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[Clytemnestra]] kills her husband, [[King Agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[Iphigenia]] in order to proceed forward with the Trojan war, as well as [[Cassandra]], a prophetess of Apollo. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] (Furies, female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]). Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's supplicant. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules with Apollo.

=== Other stories ===
Apollo killed the [[Aloadae]] when they attempted to storm [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mt. Olympus]].

[[Callimachus]] sang&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Apollo''2.5&lt;/ref&gt; that Apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the [[Hyperboreans]] during the winter months.

Apollo turned [[Cephissus]] into a [[sea monster]].

Another contender for the birthplace of Apollo is the Cretan islands of [[Paximadia (islands)|Paximadia]].

==== Musical contests ====
===== Pan =====
Once [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge Apollo, the god of the [[kithara]], to a trial of skill.  [[Tmolus]], the mountain-god, was chosen to umpire.  Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present.  Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre.  Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment.  He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.  Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].

===== Marsyas =====

[[Image:05apol1.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Apollo and Marsyas by [[Palma il Giovane]]]]

Apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague-bringing, death-dealing arrows: [[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who challenged Apollo to a contest of music. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s. After they each performed, both were deemed equal until Apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time. As Apollo played the [[lyre]], this was easy to do. Marsyas could not do this as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time. Apollo was declared the winner because of this. Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then nailed Marsyas' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree. Marsyas' blood turned into the river [[Marsyas (river)|Marsyas]].

Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the [[flute]]), and so Apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cinyras =====
Apollo also had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], his son, who [[Suicide|committed suicide]] when he lost.

===Roman Apollo===

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. As a quintessentially [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]], Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as [[Phoebus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Koronis.html Theoi: &quot;KORONIS&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.56 1.56].&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus|first temple]] at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the &quot;Apollinare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=63 3.63.7], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0145:book=4:chapter=25 4.25.3].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Punic War]] in 212 BCE, the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' (&quot;Apollonian Games&quot;) were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0147:book=25:chapter=12 25.12].&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz |title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-814822-4 |pages=82–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[battle of Actium]], which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted [[quinquennial]] games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars#Life of Augustus|Augustus]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#18.2 18.2]; [[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#1 51.1.1&amp;ndash;3].&lt;/ref&gt; He also erected [[Temple of Apollo (Palatine)|a new temple]] to the god on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#1.3 53.1.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] formed the culmination of the [[Secular Games]], held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 5050, translated by {{cite book |author=Mary Beard |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |coauthors=John North and Simon Price |title=Religions of Rome: Volume 2: A Sourcebook |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-45015-2 (hbk.); ISBN 0-521-45646-0 (pbk.) |page=5.7b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oracular cult==
[[File:Apollo Anzio Musei Capitolini MC286.jpg|thumb|Head of Apollo. Marble, Roman copy of a Greek original of the 4th century BCE, from the collection of [[Cardinal Albani]]]]
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]]. In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985:143.&lt;/ref&gt;
Apollo's [[Cult (religion)|cult]] was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE.
Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the [[Classical Greece|classical period]], and the frequency of [[theophoric names]] such as ''Apollodorus'' or ''Apollonios'' and cities named [[Apollonia]] testify to his popularity.
Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites, including [[Didyma]] and [[Clarus]] in Asia Minor. A notable group of oracular pronouncements from Didyma and Clarus, the  so-called &quot;theological oracles&quot;, date to the 2nd and 3rd century CE. In these, Apollo proclaims that there is [[monotheism|only one highest god]], of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants. In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. [[Julian the Apostate]] in the 4th century tried to revive the oracle at Delphi, but failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDD&quot;/&gt;

===Oracular shrines===
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in Delphi, and other notable ones in [[Clarus]] and [[Branchidae]]. His oracular shrine in [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]], where he bore the [[toponym]]ic epithet ''[[Abaeus]]'' ({{polytonic|Ἀπόλλων Ἀβαῖος}}, ''Apollon Abaios'') was important enough to be consulted by [[Croesus]] ([[Herodotus]], 1.46).
His oracular shrines include:
* [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]]
* [[Bassae]] in the [[Peloponnese]]
* At [[Clarus]], on the west coast of [[Asia Minor]]; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a ''pneuma'', from which the priests drank.
* In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of [[Tenea]], from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
* At [[Khyrse]], in [[Troad]], the temple  was built for [[Apollon]] Smintheus
* In [[Delos]], there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
* In [[Delphi]], the [[Pythia]] became filled with the ''[[pneuma]]'' of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the [[Adyton]].
* In [[Didyma]], an oracle on the coast of [[Anatolia]], south west of [[Lydia]]n ([[Luwian]]) [[Sardis]], in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by [[Branchus]], son or lover of Apollo.
* In [[Manbij|Hierapolis Bambyce]], Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'', the sanctuary of the [[Atargatis|Syrian Goddess]] contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]] (attrib.), ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/tsg07.htm#35 35–37].&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Patara]], in [[Lycia]], there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
* In [[Segesta]] in [[Sicily]]

Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
* In [[Oropus]], north of [[Athens]], the oracle [[Amphiaraus]], was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
* in Labadea, {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Delphi, [[Trophonius]], another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.

==Festivals==
The chief Apollonian festivals were the [[Boedromia]], [[Carneia]], Carpiae, [[Daphnephoria]], [[Delia (festival)|Delia]], [[Hyacinthia]], [[Metageitnia]], [[Pyanepsia]], [[Pythia]] and [[Thargelia]].

==Attributes and symbols==
[[File:Ai-Khanoum-gold stater of Antiochos1.jpg|right|thumb|Gold stater of the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus I Soter]] (reigned 281-261 BCE) showing on the reverse a nude Apollo holding his key attributes: two arrows and leaning on a bow.]]
[[Image:Apolocitaredo8.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Apollo Citharoedus]]'' (&quot;Apollo with a kithara&quot;), [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]
Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and [[arrow]]. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]), the [[plectrum]] and the sword. Another common emblem was the [[sacrificial tripod]], representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[bay laurel]] plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the [[laurel wreath|crown of victory]] at these games. The [[palm tree|palm]]  was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included [[wolf|wolves]], [[dolphin]]s, [[roe deer]], [[swan]]s, [[cicada]]s (symbolizing music and song), [[hawk]]s, [[raven]]s, [[crow]]s, [[snake]]s (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), [[mice]] and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.

As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization,  750–550 BCE.  According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia]]n colonists found the city of [[Troy]]. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention a Minor Asian god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]].

Apollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]]. This is the Greek [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[moderation]] and a [[virtue]] that opposes [[gluttony]].

== Apollo in the arts ==

[[Image:Roman Statue of Apollo.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Apollo (the &quot;Adonis&quot; of Centocelle), Roman after a Greek original ([[Ashmolean Museum]])]]

In art, Apollo is depicted as a handsome beardless young man, often with a [[kithara]] (as [[Apollo Citharoedus]]) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the [[Apollo Lykeios]] and [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] types). The [[Apollo Belvedere]] is a [[marble]] [[sculpture]] that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of [[Classical Antiquity]] for Europeans, from the [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century. The marble is a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor [[Leochares]], made between 350 and 325 BCE.

The lifesize so-called &quot;[[Adonis]]&quot; found in 1780 on the site of a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' near the [[Via Labicana]] in the Roman suburb of Centocelle and now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford, is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. It was probably never intended as a [[cult object]], but was a [[pastiche]] of several 4th-century and later Hellenistic model types, intended to please a Roman connoisseur of the 2nd century CE, and to be displayed in his villa.

[[Image:Apollo1.JPG|thumb|right|Apollo with a radiant [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] in a Roman floor mosaic, [[El Djem]], Tunisia, late 2nd century]]

In the late 2nd  century CE floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman ''Thysdrus'', he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], though now even a god's divine [[nudity|nakedness]] is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |accessdate= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]] (Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980). Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

==Modern reception==

Apollo has often featured in postclassical art and literature. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] composed a &quot;Hymn of Apollo&quot; (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Apollon musagète]]'' (1927–1928). The name ''Apollo'' was given to [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program|Apollo Lunar program]] in the 1960s.

The statue of Apollo from the west pediment of the [[Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] (currently in the [[Archaeological Museum of Olympia]]) was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Greek 1000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1987–2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en Bank of Greece]. Drachma Banknotes &amp; Coins: [http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/Banknotes/banknote_selection.asp?Value=1.000 1000 drachmas]. Retrieved on 27 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Archetypal psychology]], the [[Apollo archetype]] is one of the [[Jungian archetypes]], which according to [[Swiss]]  [[psychiatrist]] [[Carl Jung]] are the innate universal psychic dispositions that form the substrate from which the basic symbols or representations of unconscious experience emerge.

After suffering from [[sciatica]] caused by two bulging discs in his back, a [[spondylolisthesis]] ([[vertebrae|vertebral]] displacement) and a [[bone spur]] that interfered with the [[nerve]], Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].

Mike Agassi reportedly banged on the fences with a hammer during Andre's matches when his son lost a point, screamed at officials and was ejected more than once.

In a passage from the book ''Open'', Agassi details how his father made him play a match for money with football legend [[Jim Brown]], in 1979, when Agassi was just 9 years old. Brown was at a Vegas tennis club complaining to the owner about a money match that was canceled. Agassi's father stepped in and told Brown that he could play his son and put up his house for the wager. Brown countered with a $10,000 bet instead. After asking the 9-year-old some questions about his skills (Agassi told him he never loses) and getting warned by the club owner not to take the bet, Brown and Mike Agassi agreed that they'd set the amount after he and Andre played two sets. After dropping two straight sets by a score of 3–6, Brown politely declined the 10K wager and offered $500 for the third. Agassi, relieved that his family's life savings were no longer riding on him, won the match, 6–2.&lt;ref name=Open&gt;{{cite book|last=Agassi|first=Andre|title=Open: An Autobiography|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=978-0307388407|pages=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 13, Andre was sent to [[Nick Bollettieri]]'s Tennis Academy in Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen|first1=Jeffry |editor1-first=Dawn P |editor1-last=Dawson|title=Great Athletes |edition=Revised|volume=1|year=2002|origyear=1992 |publisher=Salem Press|isbn=1-58765-008-8|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was meant to stay for only 3 months because that was all his father could afford. After ten minutes of watching Agassi play, Bollettieri called Mike and said: &quot;Take your check back. He's here for free&quot;, claiming that Agassi had more natural talent than anyone else he had seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;lxbpdn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/magazine/08/30/agassi0717/index.html

==International tennis career biography==
===1986–1993===
He turned professional at the age of 16 and his first tournament was in [[La Quinta, California]]. He won his first match against [[John Austin (tennis)|John Austin]] 6–4, 6–2 but then lost his second match to [[Mats Wilander]] 6–1, 6–1. By the end of the year, Agassi was ranked World No. 91.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis28&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennis28.com/rankings/history/agassi.html|title=Tennis28-Bio:Andre Agassi |accessdate=June 12, 2009 |publisher=Tennis28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassi won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the [[ATP Itaparica|Sul American Open]] in [[Itaparica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He ended the year ranked World No. 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, [[1988 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships|U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]], [[World Championship Tennis#WCT 1988|Forest Hills WCT]], Stuttgart Outdoor, [[1988 Volvo International|Volvo International]] and [[1988 Livingston Open|Livingston Open]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; and, by December of that year, he had surpassed US$1&amp;nbsp;million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1152468/bio Andre Agassi – Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the year, he set the Open Era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager, a record that would stand for 17 years until being broken by [[Rafael Nadal]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Teen Nadal gives Spain reign over French Open | date=June 5, 2006 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/french/2005-06-05-day-14_x.htm |agency=Associated Press   (USA Today) | accessdate =April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His year-end ranking was World No. 3, behind second-ranked [[Ivan Lendl]] and top-ranked [[Mats Wilander]]. Both the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] and ''Tennis'' magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

In addition to not playing the Australian Open (which would later become his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly white&quot; dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semi-finals of both the French Open and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1988, and made the US Open semifinals in 1989. He began the 1990s, however, with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to [[Andrés Gómez]]. He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion [[Boris Becker]] in the semifinals. His opponent in the final was [[Pete Sampras]]; a year earlier, Agassi had beaten Sampras 6–2, 6–1 after which he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras 6–4, 6–3, 6–2.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade. Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first [[Davis Cup]] in 8 years and won his only [[Tennis Masters Cup]], beating reigning Wimbledon champion [[Stefan Edberg]] in the final.

In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus [[Jim Courier]]. Courier emerged the victor in a five set final. Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear. He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit. He went on to reach the quarter-finals on that occasion, losing in five sets to [[David Wheaton]].

Agassi's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open where he had previously enjoyed success. In 1992, he defeated [[Goran Ivanišević]] in a five set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions in [[Boris Becker]] and [[John McEnroe]]. No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until [[Lleyton Hewitt]] ten years later. Agassi was named the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality|BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1992. Agassi once again played on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team in 1992. It was their second Davis cup title in three years.

1993 saw Agassi win the only doubles title of his career, at the [[Cincinnati Masters]], partnered with [[Petr Korda]]. Agassi missed much of the early part of that year with injuries. Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and World number one Pete Sampras in five-sets. Agassi lost in the first-round at the US Open to [[Thomas Enqvist]] and required wrist surgery late in the year.

===1994–1997===
With new coach [[Brad Gilbert]] on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence. Agassi started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the French Open and Wimbledon. Nevertheless, Agassi emerged during the hard court season, winning the [[Canada Masters|Canadian Open]]. His comeback culminated at the [[1994 US Open (tennis)|1994 US Open]] with a 5-set fourth-round victory against compatriot [[Michael Chang]] and then becoming the first man to capture the US Open as an [[Seed (tennis)|unseeded]] player, beating [[Michael Stich]] in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

In 1995, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old &quot;image is everything&quot; style. He competed in the [[1995 Australian Open]] (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating Sampras in a four set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on [[hardcourt]], with Agassi winning three. Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 ([[Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati]], [[Miami Masters|Key Biscayne]], and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hardcourt circuit, which ended when he lost the [[1995 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] final to Sampras.

Agassi reached the [[World No. 1 (tennis)|World No. 1]] ranking for the first time in April 1995. He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks. In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year. He won 73 matches and lost only 9. Agassi was also once again a key player on the United States' [[Davis Cup]] winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of Agassi's career.

1996 was a less successful year for Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final. He suffered two early round losses at the hands of compatriots [[Chris Woodruff]] and [[Doug Flach]] at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semifinals. At the time, Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play [[Boris Becker]] whom he would have faced in that final. The high point for Agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], beating [[Sergi Bruguera]] of Spain in the final 6–2, 6–3, 6–1.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;  Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne.

1997 was the low point of Agassi's career. His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year. He would later confess that he started using [[methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]] at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports.espn.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=4600027 |title=Andre Agassi book says he used crystal meth |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=Jan 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed an ATP drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend spiked a drink. The ATP dropped the failed drug test as a warning. He stated upon admitting to his drug use that the letter was a lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/8329193.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Agassi admits use of crystal meth | date=October 28, 2009 | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quit the drug soon after. He won no top-level titles and his ranking sank to World No. 141 on November 10, 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;

===1998–2003===
[[File:Agassi-Auopen2005.jpg|thumb|Agassi serving]]
In 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world's top 50. He also played classic matches in this period against [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Patrick Rafter]].

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from World No. 110 to No. 6, the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.atptennis.com/5/en/players/playerprofiles/highlights.asp?playernumber=A092 Andre Agassi player profile]&lt;/ref&gt; At Wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to ATP player Tommy Haas. He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the [[Miami Masters|Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne]], losing to [[Marcelo Ríos]], who became World No. 1 as a result.

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat [[Andrei Medvedev]] in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining [[Rod Laver]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Don Budge]]—these have since been joined by a sixth, [[Roger Federer]] and a seventh, [[Rafael Nadal]]) to have won all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career. This win also made him the first (of only three, the second being [[Roger Federer]] and the third being [[Rafael Nadal]]) male player in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass, and hard courts), a tribute to his adaptability, as the other four men had won their Grand Slam titles on clay and grass courts. Agassi also became the first (of only two, the second being [[Rafael Nadal]]) male player to win the [[Career Golden Slam]], consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal.

Agassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], beating [[Todd Martin]] in five sets (rallying from a 2 sets to 1 deficit) in the final. Agassi ended 1999 as the World No. 1, ending Sampras's record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt;  This was the only time Agassi ended the year at number one.

Agassi began the next year by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semifinal and [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] in a four-set final.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since [[Rod Laver]] achieved the Grand Slam in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Federer]] has since duplicated this feat, appearing in ten consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005–2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pete Sampras]] held the 1993 Wimbledon, 1993 [[1993 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], and [[1994 Australian Open]] titles simultaneously. [[Jimmy Connors]] won all three of those events in 1974, although at the time all three were on [[Tennis court#Grass courts|grass courts]]. [[Mats Wilander]] won all but Wimbledon in 1988 during his similar rise to be the year-end World No. 1. Federer has since duplicated this feat, holding all Grand Slam titles except the French Open at the end of 2004 as well as throughout 2006 and 2007. [[Rafael Nadal]] won the 2008 French Open, 2008 Wimbledon, and 2009 Australian Open.&lt;/ref&gt;

2000 also saw Agassi reach the semifinals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742067.stm |title=Classic Matches: Rafter v Agassi |date=May 31, 2004 |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr2GUooH | archivedate = January 17, 2010| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the inaugural [[2000 Tennis Masters Cup|Tennis Masters Cup]] in Lisbon, Agassi reached the final after defeating [[Marat Safin]] 6–3, 6–3 in the semifinals to end the Russian's hopes to become the youngest World No. 1 in the history of tennis. Agassi then lost to [[Gustavo Kuerten]] in the final, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end World No. 1.

Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over [[Arnaud Clément]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greatath&quot; /&gt; Enroute, he beat a cramping Rafter (7–5, 2–6, 6–7, 6–2, 6–3) in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie's last Australian Open. At Wimbledon, they met again in the semifinals, where Agassi lost another close match to Rafter, 8–6 in the fifth set. In the quarterfinals at the US Open, Agassi lost a 3 hour, 33&amp;nbsp;minute epic match&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/sampras_agassi Believe the hype]&lt;/ref&gt; with Sampras 6–7(7), 7–6(7), 7–6(2), 7–6(5),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/05/agassi_sidebar_ap |title=Unbreakable | date=September 6, 2001 |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no breaks of serve during the 48-game match. Despite the setback, Agassi finished 2001 ranked World No. 3, becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 10 in three different decades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsline.com/tennis/players/playerpage/201490/2006 |title=SportsLine:Andre Agassi |year=2006 | publisher=Sportsline |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1980s—finishing World No. 3 in 1988 and No. 7 in 1989; 1990s—finishing World No. 4 in 1990, No. 10 in 1991, No. 9 in 1992, No. 2 in 1994 and 1995, No. 8 in 1996, No. 6 in 1998 and No. 1 in 1999; 2000s—finishing World No. 6 in 2000, No. 3 in 2001, No. 2 in 2002, No. 4 in 2003, No. 8 in 2004 and No. 7 in 2005). He also was the oldest player (age 31) to finish in the top three since 32-year old Connors finished at World No. 2 in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion. The last duel between Agassi and Sampras came in the final of the US Open, which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings. The match was the last of Sampras's career. Agassi's US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, [[Rome Masters|Rome]], and [[Madrid Masters|Madrid]], helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end World No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat [[Rainer Schüttler]] in straight sets in the final. In March, he won his sixth career and third consecutive [[Key Biscayne]] title, in the process surpassing his wife, [[Steffi Graf]], who was a 5-time winner of the event. The final was his 18th straight win in that tournament, which broke the previous record of 17 set by Sampras from 1993–1995. (Agassi's winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to [[Agustín Calleri]].) With the victory, Agassi became the youngest (19 years old) and oldest (32) winner of the Key Biscayne tournament. On April 28, 2003, he recaptured the World No. 1 ranking after a quarterfinal victory over [[Xavier Malisse]] at the [[Queen's Club Championships]] to become the oldest top ranked male player since the ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days. He held the World No. 1 ranking for two weeks when [[Lleyton Hewitt]] took it back on May 12, 2003. Agassi then recaptured the World No. 1 ranking once again on June 16, 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until September 7, 2003. During his career, Agassi held the World No. 1 ranking for a total of 101 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tenniscorner.net/index.php?corner=m&amp;action=stats&amp;stats=no1 |title=Weeks at Number One | date = |publisher=TennisCorner.net | accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassi's ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from many events. He did manage to reach the US Open semifinals, where he lost to [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] and surrendered his World No. 1 ranking to Ferrero. At the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer and finished the year ranked World No. 4. At age 33, he was the oldest player to rank in the top five since Connors, at age 35, was World No. 4 in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt;

===2004–2006===
In 2004, Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semifinals of the Australian Open to [[Marat Safin]]; the loss ended Agassi's 26-match winning streak at the event, a record that still stands. Agassi won the [[Cincinnati Masters|Masters series event in Cincinnati]] to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] and [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]]. At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), surpassed only by [[Ken Rosewall]] who won the title in 1970 at age 35. He finished the year ranked World No. 8, the oldest player to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was World No. 7 in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;atpbio&quot; /&gt; Agassi also became only the sixth male player during the [[Tennis open era|open era]] to reach 800 career wins with his first round victory over [[Alex Bogomolov]] in [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles.

Agassi's 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open. Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments but had to withdraw from several events due to injury. He lost to [[Jarkko Nieminen]] in the first round of the French Open. He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] before falling to World No. 2 [[Rafael Nadal]]. Agassi's 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final. After beating [[Răzvan Sabău]] and [[Ivo Karlović]] in straight sets and [[Tomáš Berdych]] in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final. The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over [[James Blake]], where he rallied from two sets down to win 3–6, 3–6, 6–3, 6–3, 7–6(6). His other five-set victims were [[Xavier Malisse]] in the fourth round and [[Robby Ginepri]] in the semifinals. In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years. Federer defeated Agassi in four sets, although Agassi gave him a scare when Agassi was up a break in the third set after splitting the first two sets.

Before the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, Agassi rolled his ankle in a [[racquetball]] accident and tore several ligaments. He was unable to walk for weeks. He nevertheless committed to the tournament, in which he was seeded third, and played [[Nikolay Davydenko]] in his first round robin match. Agassi's movement was noticeably hindered, particularly on his backhand return of serve, and he lost in straight sets. He then withdrew from the tournament.

Agassi finished 2005 ranked World No. 7, his 16th time in the year-end top 10 rankings, which tied Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year's end. In 2005, Agassi left [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2116135 |title=Agassi signs Adidas deal after long-term deal with Nike |author=Darren Rovell | date=July 25, 2005 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to Agassi's charities and Adidas was more than happy to do so.

Agassi had a poor start to 2006. He was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play. Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay court season, including the French Open. This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time.

Agassi returned for the grass court season, playing a tune-up and then [[2006 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Singles|Wimbledon]]. He was defeated in the third round by World No. 2 (and eventual runner-up) [[Rafael Nadal]] 7–6(5), 6–2, 6–4. Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13653101 |title=Upsetting day: Agassi, then Roddick ousted |date=June 1, 2006|accessdate=October 27, 2007 |agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open.

Agassi played only two events during the summer hardcourt season, with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the [[Countrywide Classic]] in Los Angeles to [[Fernando González]] of Chile 6–4, 3–6, 7–5. As a result, he was unseeded at the US Open.

Agassi had a short but dramatic run in his final US Open. Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match. After a tough four-set win against [[Andrei Pavel]], Agassi faced eighth-seeded [[Marcos Baghdatis]] in the second round, who had earlier advanced to the [[2006 Australian Open]] final and Wimbledon semifinals. Agassi won 6–4, 6–4, 3–6, 5–7, 7–5 as the younger Baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set. In his last match, Agassi fell to 112th ranked big-serving [[Benjamin Becker]] of Germany in four sets. Agassi received an eight minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a memorable retirement speech.

===Earnings===
Agassi earned more than US$ 30&amp;nbsp;million in prize-money during his career, fourth only to Federer, Sampras and Nadal to date. He also earned more than US$25&amp;nbsp;million a year through endorsements, during his career and fourth in all sports at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/53/1YUQ.html | title=Forbes:Andre Agassi |work=Forbes | accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-retirement===
Since retiring after the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]], Agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity. On September 5, 2007, Agassi was a surprise guest commentator for the [[Andy Roddick]]/[[Roger Federer]] [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] quarter-final. He played an exhibition match at Wimbledon, teaming with his wife, Steffi Graf, to play with [[Tim Henman]] and [[Kim Clijsters]]. He played [[World Team Tennis]] for the [[Philadelphia Freedoms]] in the summer of 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/02/26/agassi.ap/index.html Andre Agassi Will Play WTT] SI.com, March 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and played at the [[Outback Champions Series]] event for the first time. He played the [[Cancer Treatment Centers of America Championship at Surprise|Cancer Treatment Centers of America Tennis Championships]] at [[Surprise, Arizona]] where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion [[Todd Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://championsseriestennis.com/arizona2009/ | title=Champions Series Tennis – Arizona 2009 | year=2009 | accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the way to the final, Agassi beat [[Mikael Pernfors]] in the quarter-finals and [[Wayne Ferreira]] in the semi-finals. He also announced that he will not be playing the tour on a full-time basis, and played the tournament as a favor to long-time friend [[Jim Courier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/tennis/story/12343241 |title=Agassi reaches Outback Champions Series final | date = | publisher=CBS Sports |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andre played a charity tournament with Sampras, Federer, and Nadal for Haitian earthquake relief. In early 2011, Agassi will play a series of exhibition matches [http://www.riseoflegends2011.com/ &quot;Rise of Legends&quot;] in Taiwan with [[Marat Safin]] at the [[Taipei Arena]] on Jan. 6, 2011 and [[Kaohsiung Arena]] on Jan. 8, 2011. On August 2010 he made an exhibition game in [[Coliseo Cubierto El Campin]] in [[Bogota]], Colombia with [[Pete Sampras]], [[Anna Kournikova]] and other professional tennis players.

==Playing style==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2009}}
Early in his career, Agassi would look to end points quickly, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. His return of serve, baseline game, and keen sense of anticipation were among the best in the game, and helped him win the Wimbledon title in 1992. On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner.

Agassi continually put pressure on opponents with a preference to taking the ball early and was known for swinging deep angles like a powerful backhand up the line. His strength was in dictating play from the back of the court. While growing up his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Open: Andre Agassi HarpersCollins 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more.

Agassi's serve was never the strength of his game, but it improved steadily over the course of his career to being above average. He often used his hard slice serve in the deuce service box to send his opponent off the court, followed by a shot to the opposite corner. Agassi's service speed when hitting a flat first serve would range between {{convert|110|and|125|mph|0|abbr=on}}. His second serve was usually heavy kick serve in the mid 80s.

==Personal and family life==
Agassi married actress [[Brooke Shields]] on April 19, 1997. In February 1998, they filed suit against ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' claiming it printed &quot;false and fabricated&quot; statements about the couple, but the case was dismissed. The couple later filed for divorce, which was granted on April 9, 1999.

At the 1999 French Open, Agassi and [[Steffi Graf]] were the surprise champions, since he had not won a Grand Slam title since 1995 and she since 1996. At the winners' ball, they met each other for the second time. Shortly after, they started dating. Graf retired after they both reached the Wimbledon final in July. They were married on October 22, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101751&amp;page=1 Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf Wed]&lt;/ref&gt; Their son, Jaden Gil, was born four days later, October 26. Their daughter, Jaz Elle, was born on October 3, 2003. The couple live in the Las Vegas area and own several vacation homes.

Agassi's older sister, Rita, was married to tennis player [[Pancho Gonzales]]. In 1995, when Gonzales died in Las Vegas, Andre paid for the funeral. Andre's other sister, Tami, like their mother, Betty, is a breast cancer survivor.

Long-time trainer [[Gil Reyes (tennis)|Gil Reyes]] has been called one of Agassi's closest friends; some have described him as being a &quot;father figure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1999/year_in_review/flashbacks/father_best/ |title=Father Knew Best | date = |work=Sports Illustrated | accessdate =January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://safinhantuchova.blogspot.com/2008/07/papa-gil.html | title=Peter Bodo Blog: Papa Gil | date = | publisher=| accessdate =January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Agassi's childhood friend and former business manager Perry Rogers sued Graf for $50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.lasvegassun.com/media/pdfs/blogs/documents/2008/12/06/Complaint_and_Summons.pdf ''Alliance Sports Management v.

Agassi's autobiography, ''Open'' (written with assistance from [[J. R.

==Politics==
Agassi has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsmeat.com/sports_political_donations/Andre_Agassi.php | title=Andre Agassi's Federal Campaign Contribution Report | date = | publisher=NewsMeat | accessdate =January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on September 1, 2010, when Agassi appeared on daily WNYC public radio program &quot;The Brian Lehrer Show,&quot; Agassi stated that he is a registered Independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://beta.wnyc.org/shows/bl/2010/sep/01/net-effects/ | title=Andre Agassi: Net Effects | date = | publisher=&quot;The Brian Lehrer Show&quot; | accessdate =January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Agassi founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas' young people. Agassi was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth. He is regularly cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis. It has also been claimed that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blackvoices.com/black_sports/columnists/roysjohnson/_a/sportsmanperson-of-the-year/20061002123009990001 | title=Sportsman/Person of the Year | date = | publisher=| accessdate =January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agassi's charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential. His Boys &amp; Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world class junior tennis team. It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.

In 2001, Agassi opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy&lt;ref name=Prep&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agassiprep.org | title=Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy | accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Las Vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area. In 2009, the graduating class had 100 percent graduation rate and expected a 100 percent college acceptance rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cw.edu/page.php?subj=about&amp;page=president-blog&amp;id=20 College of Westchester – CW President's Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Among other child-related programs that Agassi supports through his Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation is Clark County's only residential facility for abused and neglected children, Child Haven. In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the Agassi Center for Education. His foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children. This 20 bed facility opened in December 2001 and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athlete.com/profile.php?id=351 Andre Agassi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Agassi, [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Lance Armstrong]], [[Warrick Dunn]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Mia Hamm]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Andrea Jaeger]], [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]], [[Mario Lemieux]], [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] founded the charity [http://www.athletesforhope.org Athletes for Hope],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.athletesforhope.org/ | title=Athletes For Hope | accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and aims to inspire all people to volunteer and support their communities.

==Recognition==
In 2005, [[TENNIS Magazine|''Tennis'' magazine]] named him the 7th greatest male player—and 12th greatest player overall—for the period 1965 through 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;tennis&quot;/&gt;

{{No footnotes|date=November 2010}}

The '''Austro-Asiatic languages''' are a large [[language family]] of [[Southeast Asia]], also scattered throughout [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. The name comes from the [[Latin]] word for &quot;south&quot; and the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of [[Asia]], hence &quot;[[South Asia]]&quot;. Among these languages, only [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Mon language|Mon]] have a long established recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively). The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups. [[Ethnologue]] identifies 168 Austro-Asiatic languages. These are traditionally divided into two families, [[Mon-Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. Two recent classifications have abandoned Mon–Khmer as a valid node, although this is tentative and not generally accepted.

Austro-Asiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. It is widely believed{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} that the Austro-Asiatic  languages are the [[autochthonous language]]s of Southeast Asia and the eastern [[Indian subcontinent]], and that the other languages of the region, including the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Kradai languages|Kradai]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], are the result of later [[human migration|migrations of people]].

==Morphology==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}

The Austro-Asiatic languages are well known for having a &quot;sesqui-syllabic&quot; pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced [[minor syllable]] plus a full syllable. Many of them also have [[infix]]es.

==Proto-language==
{{Main|Proto-Mon-Khmer language}}

Much work has been done on the reconstruction of [[Proto-Mon-Khmer|Proto-Mon–Khmer]] in [[Harry L. Shorto]]'s ''Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. However, very little work has been done on Proto-Austro-Asiatic itself, since the [[Munda languages]] are not well documented.

Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:

{| class=&quot;IPA wikitable&quot;
|*p||*t||*c||*k||*ʔ
|-
|*b||*d||*ɟ||*ɡ||
|-
|*ɓ||*ɗ||*ʄ|| ||
|-
|*m||*n||*ɲ||*ŋ||
|-
|*w||*l, *r||*j|| ||
|-
| ||*s|| || ||*h
|}

This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for {{IPA|*ʄ}}.  {{IPA|*ʄ}} is better preserved in the [[Katuic languages]], which [[Paul Sidwell]] specializes more in than the other branches of Austro-Asiatic.

==Classification==
Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austro-Asiatic: the [[Mon–Khmer languages]] of Southeast Asia, [[North-East India|Northeast India]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]], and the [[Munda languages]] of [[East India|East]] and Central India and parts of Bangladesh. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.

Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade. By contrast, the relationships ''between'' these families within Austro-Asiatic is debated. In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accept traditional &quot;Mon–Khmer&quot; as a valid unit. However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.

===Gérard Diffloth (2005)===
[[Gérard Diffloth|Diffloth]] compares reconstructions of various clades, and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations, though like other classifications the evidence has not been published. As a schematic, we have:

This family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of Y-Chromosomal haplogroup O2b-M95. However, the dates obtained from DNA studies are several times older than that given by linguists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kumar&quot;&gt;Kumar, Vikrant et al, Y-chromosome evidence suggests a common paternal heritage of Austro-Asiatic populations, BMC Evol Biol. 2007, 7: 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The route map of the people with haplogroup O2b, speaking this language can be seen in this link.[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/47/figure/F1]

Peiros is a [[lexicostatistics|lexicostatistic]] classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary. This means that a language may appear to be more distantly related than it actually is due to [[language contact]], so it is only a starting point for a proper genealogical classification.

The '''Afroasiatic languages''' constitute one of the world's largest [[language family| language families]] with about 375 living languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=52-16 Ethnologue family tree for Afroasiatic languages]&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 350 million speakers spread throughout [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Southwest Asia]], as well as parts of the [[Sahel]], and [[East Africa]]. The most widely spoken Afroasiatic language is [[Arabic]], with 230 million speakers (all the colloquial varieties).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PxJrB_OKn04C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA27,M1 Languages of the World]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to languages now spoken, Afroasiatic includes several ancient languages, such as [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]], [[Biblical Hebrew]], and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].

The term &quot;Afroasiatic&quot; (often now spelled as Afro-Asiatic) was coined by [[Maurice Delafosse]] (1914). It did not come into general use until it was adopted by [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) to replace the earlier term &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot;, following his demonstration that [[Hamitic]] is not a valid grouping. The term &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries. Some authors now replace &quot;Afro-Asiatic&quot; with &quot;Afrasian&quot;, or, reflecting an opinion that it is more African than Asian, &quot;Afrasan&quot;. Individual scholars have called the family &quot;Erythraean&quot; (Tucker 1966) and &quot;Lisramic&quot; (Hodge 1972).

==Distribution and branches==
[[Image:afroasiatic.svg|thumb|right|500px|Some linguists' proposals for grouping within Afroasiatic]]
The Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches:
* [[Berber languages|Berber]]
* [[Chadic languages|Chadic]]
* [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]
* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]
* [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]
* [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]

While there is general agreement on these six families, there are some points of disagreement among [[linguistics|linguists]] who study Afroasiatic. In particular:
* Omotic is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic since the grammatical formatives &quot;to which Afroasiaticists have tended to attach the greatest importance are either absent or distinctly wobbly&quot; (Hayward 1995). Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic, while others have raised doubts about it being part of Afroasiatic at all (e.g. Theil 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands2009&quot;/&gt;
* The Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the &quot;mixed&quot; appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&amp;T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045}]&lt;/ref&gt; Bonny Sands (2009) believes the most convincing proposal is by Savà and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a Nilo-Saharan [[substratum]]. In other words, the Ongota people would appear to have once spoken a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language, while retaining some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands2009&quot;/&gt;
* [[Beja language|Beja]] is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic but is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a high degree of internal diversity.
* Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.
* There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see &quot;Overview of classifications&quot; below). This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.

==Classification history==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Berber people]] --&gt;
In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]] in [[Algeria]] was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.

In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter &quot;Ethiopic&quot;). In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.

[[Friedrich Müller (linguist)|Friedrich Müller]] named the traditional &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; family in 1876 in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft''. He defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a &quot;Hamitic&quot; group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments (see [[Hamitic hypothesis]]).

Leo Reinisch (1909) proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging a more distant affinity to Egyptian and Semitic, thus foreshadowing Greenberg, but his suggestion found little resonance.

[[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct Hamitic subgroup and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.

[[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) strongly confirmed Cohen's rejection of &quot;Hamitic&quot;, added (and sub-classified) the Chadic branch, and proposed the new name &quot;Afroasiatic&quot; for the family. Nearly all scholars have accepted Greenberg's classification.

In 1969, [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]. This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.

Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and [[Robert Hetzron]], have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.

Little agreement exists on the [[subgrouping (linguistics)|subgrouping]] of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic (if Omotic is not included in Cushitic). However, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.
Otherwise:
* [[Paul Newman (linguist)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic. Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.
* [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]].
* [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995) groups Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic together in a &quot;North Afro-Asiatic&quot; subgroup.
* [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.
* [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot;. He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.
* Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.

==Position among the world's languages==
Afroasiatic is one of the four [[languages of Africa|language families of Africa]] identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is the only one that extends outside of Africa, via the Semitic branch.

There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:
* [[Hermann Möller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by some linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]) but has little currency today.
* Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] macro-family (cf. Pedersen 1931:336–338), which also included the Indo-European, [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]], [[Samoyed languages|Samoyed]], [[Turkic languages|Turkish]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolian]], [[Tungusic languages|Manchu]], and [[Yukaghir languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].
* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].
* Most recently, [[Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian, and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. An even larger [[Borean]] group would contain Nostratic as well as [[Dene-Caucasian]] and [[Austric]].

{{See|Proto-Afroasiatic language|Afroasiatic Urheimat}}

Common (but not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:
* a two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the /t/ sound
* [[Verb Subject Object|VSO]] [[linguistic typology|typology]] with [[Subject Verb Object|SVO]] tendencies
* a set of [[emphatic consonant]]s, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive
* [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] in which words inflect by changes within the root (vowel changes or [[gemination]]) as well as with prefixes and suffixes

All Afroasiatic subfamilies show evidence of a [[causative]] affix ''s''.
Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic support [[possessive suffix]]es.

[[Tonal language]]s appear in the Omotic, Chadic, and Cushitic branches of Afroasiatic, according to Ehret (1996). The Semitic, Berber, and Egyptian branches do not use tones [[phoneme|phonemically]].

==Cognates==
Some Afroasiatic [[cognate]]s are:
* ''*b-n-'' 'build' (Ehret: *''bĭn''), attested in Chadic, Semitic (''*bny''), Cushitic (*''mĭn''/*''măn'' 'house'), Berber (*''bn'') and Omotic (Dime ''bin-'' 'build, create').
* ''*m-t'' 'die' (Ehret: *''maaw''), attested in Chadic (for example, Hausa ''mutu''), Egyptian (''mwt'' ''*muwt'', ''mt'', Coptic ''mu''), Berber (''mmet'', pr. ''immut''), Semitic (*''mwt''), and Cushitic (Proto-Somali *''umaaw''/*''-am-w(t)-'' 'die'). Also [[Mot (Semitic god)|''Mot'']], Canaanite god of death.
* ''*s-n'' 'know', attested in Chadic (for example, Hausa ''san''), Berber, Egyptian and Semitic (Hebrew ''š-n-n'' 'learn, study').
* ''*l-s'' 'tongue' (Ehret: ''*lis' '' 'to lick'), attested in Semitic (*''lasaan/lisaan'' 'tongue'), Egyptian (''ns'' *''ls'', Coptic ''las''), Berber (''ils''), Chadic (for example, Hausa ''harshe''), and possibly Omotic (Dime ''lits'-'' 'lick').
* ''*s-m'' 'name' (Ehret: *''sŭm'' / *''sĭm''), attested in Semitic (*''sm''), Berber (''ism''), Chadic (for example, Hausa ''suna''), Cushitic, and Omotic (though some see the Berber form, ''ism'', and the Omotic form, ''sunts'', as Semitic loanwords.) The Egyptian ''smi'' 'report, announce' offers another possible cognate.
* ''*d-m'' 'blood' (Ehret: *''dîm'' / *''dâm''), attested in Berber (''idammen''), Semitic (*''dam''), and Chadic. Compare Cushitic *''dîm''/*''dâm'', 'red'.

'''Andorra''' ({{IPAc-en|en-us-Andorra.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|d|ɒr|ə}}, {{IPA-ca|ənˈdorə}}, {{IPA-ca|anˈdɔra|local}}), officially the '''Principality of Andorra''' ({{lang-ca|Principat d'Andorra}}), also called the '''Principality of the Valleys of Andorra''',&lt;ref&gt;Funk and Wagnalls Encyclopedia, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ca|Principat de les Valls d'Andorra}}), is a small [[landlocked country]] in southwestern [[Europe]], located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountains and bordered by [[Spain]] and [[France]]. It is the sixth [[European microstates|smallest nation in Europe]] having an area of {{convert|468|km²|0|abbr=on}} and an estimated population of 83,888 in 2009. Its capital, [[Andorra la Vella]], is the highest capital city in Europe, being at an elevation of 1023&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AN/0/Andorra_la_Vella.html Maps, Weather, and Airports for Andorra la Vella, Andorra]&lt;/ref&gt; The official language is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], although Spanish, French, and Portuguese are also commonly spoken.

The Principality was formed in 1278. The [[coregency|role of monarch]] is exercised jointly by the two co-princes, the [[President of France|President of the French Republic]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

Andorra is a prosperous country mainly because of its [[tourism industry]], which services an estimated 10.2&amp;nbsp;million visitors annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;es2&quot;&gt;[http://www.estadistica.ad/serveiestudis/web/exportar_banc_dades_csv.asp?formules=anual|inici&amp;any1=01/01/2008&amp;any2=01/01/2008&amp;codi_divisio=380&amp;lang=1&amp;codi_subtemes=59&amp;codi_tema=10 Estadistica.ad], Departament d'Estadística, Govern d'Andorra. {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also because of its status as a [[tax haven]]. It is not a member of the [[European Union]], but the [[euro]] is the ''de facto'' currency.

==History==
{{main|History of Andorra}}
[[File:97183442 f55d8aa568 b.jpg|thumb|left|Scenery of Andorran mountains]]
Tradition holds that Charles the Great ([[Charlemagne]]) granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the [[Moors]]. [[Feudalism|Overlordship]] of the territory was by the [[Count of Urgell]] and eventually by the bishop of the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. In 988, Borrell II, Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;histo1&quot;&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in [[la Seu d'Urgell|Seu d'Urgell]], has owned Andorra.&lt;ref name=elements&gt;[http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm Things about the history of Andorra] French Co-prince {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; asked for help and protection from the Lord of Caboet. In 1095, the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; married Roger Bernat II, the [[France|French]] [[Count of Foix]]. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and also co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of [[Aragon]] by the signing of the first [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|paréage]] which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the [[count of Foix]]&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in [[Catalonia]]. This gave the [[principality]] its territory and political form.

Over the years, the French co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After Henry of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France]], he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra. In 1812–13, the [[First French Empire]] annexed [[Catalonia]] and divided it in four [[département]]s, with Andorra being made part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre]]).

===20th century===
Andorra declared war on [[Imperial Germany]] during [[World War I]], but did not actually take part in the fighting. It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1957 as it was not included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

In 1933, France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On July 12, 1934, adventurer [[Boris Skossyreff]] issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and [[Franco's Spain]]. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war. During [[World War II]], Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy France]] and Spain.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and Spain. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Its political system was modernised in 1993, when it became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]].

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Andorra}}&lt;!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series--&gt;

[[File:Andorra-coa-old.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Coat of arms of Andorra|Andorran coat of arms]] at Andorran parliament.]]

Andorra is a parliamentary [[co-principality]] with the [[President of the French Republic|President of France]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain), as [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes]]. This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as [[Prince of Andorra]], an elected reigning monarch, even though he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Andorra]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The current Prime Minister is [[Antoni Martí]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both  government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councilors, as the members of the legislative branch are called. The Councilors serve for four-year terms and elections are held between the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous Council. The Councilors can be elected on two equal constituencies.

Half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councilors are elected from a single national constituency. 15 days after the election, the Councilors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government, the Prime Minister of Andorra, is chosen from among the Councilors.

[[File:Andorralavella02.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Casa de la Vall, Andorran Parliament.]]
Candidates for the prime-ministerial nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councilors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-princes who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Prime Minister of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the Local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councilors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councilors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Prime Minister is removed.

==Law and criminal justice==
The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Coprinces, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, and so is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Coprinces and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will be the leader of the Court.

==Foreign relations and defence==
{{main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}
Andorra maintains a small Army, and all able-bodied men who own firearms must serve. The Army is unique in that all men are treated as officers. The Army's main responsibility is to present the national flag at ceremonies. The country also has an internal police force. Responsibility for defending Andorra rests primarily with France and Spain. Andorra is a full member of the [[United Nations]], the [[OSCE]], and has a special agreement with the [[European Union]].

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Andorra|Geology of Andorra}}
[[File:Andorramap.png|thumb|right|Map of Andorra with its seven parishes labeled.]]

===Parishes===
{{main|Parishes of Andorra}}
Andorra consists of seven parishes:
* [[Andorra la Vella]]
* [[Canillo]]
* [[Encamp]]
* [[Escaldes-Engordany]]
* [[La Massana]]
* [[Ordino]]
* [[Sant Julià de Lòria]]

===Physical geography===
[[File:Andorra topographic map-en.svg|thumb||right|Topographic map of Andorra.]]

[[File:Caldea.jpg|thumb|right|Caldea spa in [[Escaldes-Engordany]], heated by natural [[hot spring]] water which is plentiful in the parish.]]
Due to its location in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at {{convert|2942|m|ft|0}}, and the average elevation of Andorra is {{convert|1996|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Andorra (1991), Andorran Government. ISBN 0099913910391. {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Gran Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}). Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of [[Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests]].

===Climate===
Andorra has an [[alpine climate]] and [[continental climate]]. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer. There are, on average, 300&amp;nbsp;days per year of sunshine.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Andorra}}
[[Tourism]], the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. An estimated 10.2&amp;nbsp;million tourists visit annually,&lt;ref name=&quot;es2&quot;/&gt; attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's relative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower [[tariff]]s.

The banking sector, with its [[tax haven]] status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html|title=CIA World Factbook entry: Andorra}}&lt;!-- {{dead link|date=October 2009}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra is not a member of the [[European Union]], but enjoys a [[Microstates and the European Union|special relationship]] with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a [[currency]] of its own and used both the [[French franc]] and the [[Spanish peseta]] in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the [[euro]]. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra is negotiating to issue its own euro coins.

Andorra has one of the world's lowest unemployment rates, with the statistics on June 2009 showing almost 100% employment within the country.

==Demography==
{{main|Demographics of Andorra}}

===Population===
The population of Andorra is estimated to be 83,888 (July 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;ciafb2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact2009/index.html CIA World Factbook (2009)]&lt;!-- {{dead link|date=October 2009}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.

Andorran nationals are a plurality in the country (31,363);&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;Departament d'Estadistica, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; other nationalities including Spaniards (27,300),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; Portuguese (13,794),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; French (5,213),&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; Britons (1,085)&lt;ref name=&quot;de1&quot;/&gt; and Italians altogether make up a total of 67.7% of Andorra's population.

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Andorra}}
The historic and [[official language]] is [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a [[Romance language]]. The Andorran government is keen to encourage the use of Catalan. It funds a commission for Catalan [[toponymy]] in Andorra (Catalan: ''la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra''), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants. Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are also commonly spoken. Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan. [[English language|English]] is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts. Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/default_en.asp Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM) : National Minorities], ''Council of Europe'', 14 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; that have never signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=157&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Council of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The population of Andorra is predominantly (90%) [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html|title=CIA&amp;nbsp;– The World Fact Book&amp;nbsp;– Andorra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their patron saint is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]]. Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the [[Catholic Church]], offering some special privileges to that group. The [[Muslim]] community is primarily made up of North African immigrants. Other Christian denominations include the [[Anglican Church]], the [[Reunification Church]], the [[New Apostolic Church]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], and the [[Jehovah's Witness|Jehovah’s Witnesses]]. There is a small community of [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in Andorra|Bahá'ís]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ARDA05&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Andorra | work = International &gt; Regions &gt; Southern Europe | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_6_2.asp | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfram&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Andorra: population, capital, cities, GDP, map, flag, currency, languages, ... | encyclopedia = [[Wolfram Alpha]] | volume = Online | publisher = Wolfram - Alpha (curated data( | date = March 13, 2010 | url =http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/countries/andorra/xy/p0/k6/ | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andorra also hosts a population of roughly 100 Jews (see: [[Andorran Jews]]).

==Education==
===Schools===
Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education. Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of schools&amp;nbsp;– Andorran, French and Spanish&amp;nbsp;– which use Catalan, French and Spanish, respectively, as the main language of instruction. Parents may choose which system their children attend. All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain. About 50% of Andorran children attend the French primary schools, and the rest attend Spanish or Andorran schools.

===University of Andorra===
The [[University of Andorra]] (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra. It was established in 1997. The University provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses. The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

====Virtual Studies Centre====
The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic programme, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities. The Virtual Studies Centre (''Centre d’Estudis Virtuals'') at the University runs in the region of twenty degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies. The Centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals.

==Healthcare==
Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, [[Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social|CASS]] (Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;travenand&quot;&gt;''Travailler en Andorre'' (May 2006), Govern d'Andorra, Servei d'Ocupació, p.30. {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents. The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance. Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.&lt;ref name=&quot;travenand&quot;/&gt;

The main hospital, Meritxell, is in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cassps&quot;&gt;List of specialities with coverage by CASS at Hospital Nostra Senyora de Meritxell (2009), [http://online.cass.ad/web/lacass/professionalSalut/hospitals/Andorra Cass.ad], Retrieved 2009-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the Principality.&lt;ref name=&quot;cassps&quot;/&gt;

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in Andorra}}
Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation. Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of {{convert|279|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|76|km|0|abbr=on}} is unpaved. The two main roads out of [[Andorra la Vella]] are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the [[Envalira Tunnel]] near [[Pas de la Casa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mobi&quot;&gt;[http://www.mobilitat.ad/CA/default.asp Agència de Mobilitat, Govern d'Andorra]&lt;/ref&gt; Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times. There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to [[Barcelona]] and [[Toulouse]]. Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.

There are no railways, ports, or airports for fixed-wing aircraft in Andorra. There are, however, heliports in [[La Massana]], [[Arinsal]] and [[Escaldes-Engordany]] with commercial helicopter services.&lt;ref name=&quot;heliand&quot;&gt;Heliand&amp;nbsp;– Serveis (2009). [http://www.heliand.com/ Heliand.com] {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;helitrans&quot;&gt;Helitrans&amp;nbsp;– Services (2009). [http://www.helitrans.ad/ Helitrans.ad] {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby airports are located in Barcelona, Toulouse, Perpignan, Reus, and Girona. The closest public airport is [[Perpignan - Rivesaltes Airport]], which is {{convert|160|km|0|abbr=on}} away and has short-haul services to several destinations in the United Kingdom and France. [[La Seu d'Urgell Airport]], a small airfield {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} south of Andorra currently used only by private aeroplanes, is being studied by the Catalan government as a possible future airport for public aviation services.&lt;ref name=&quot;gdc2008&quot;&gt;La Generalitat es reuneix amb els pobles afectats per l'aeroport (31 October 2008). [http://www.viurealspirineus.cat/not%C3%ADcies/pol%C3%ADtica/La+Generalitat+es+reuneix+amb+els+pobles+afectats+per+l%27aeroport Viurealspirineus.cat] {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearest railway station is [[L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre]] {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Andorra which is on the {{RailGauge|1435mm}}[[Standard gauge|-gauge]] line from [[Latour-de-Carol]], ({{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on|disp=s}}) southeast of Andorra, to [[Toulouse]] and on to [[Paris]] by the French [[TGV|high-speed trains]]. This line is operated by the [[SNCF]]. Latour-de-Carol has a scenic [[metre gauge]] [[Yellow Train|trainline]] to [[Villefranche-de-Conflent]], as well as the SNCF's {{RailGauge|1435mm}}-gauge line connecting to [[Perpignan]], and the [[RENFE|RENFE's]] {{RailGauge|1668mm}} [[Iberian gauge|-gauge]] line to [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bueker.net/trainspotting/map.php?file=maps/french-network/french-network.gif SNCF Map]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maplandia.com/france/languedoc-roussillon/pyrenees-orientales/prades/latour-de-carol/ Google map]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and telecommunications==
{{Update section|date=February 2011}}
{{Main|Telecommunications in Andorra}}
In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephony and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as ''Servei de Telecomunicacions d'Andorra'' (STA). The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.

By the end of 2010, it is planned that every home in the country will have [[Fiber to the x|fibre-optic to the home]] for internet access at a minimum speed of 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;somfo&quot;&gt;SOM Newsletter, March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one Andorran television station, ''[[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra]]'' (RTVA). ''Radio Nacional d’Andorra'' operates two radio stations, ''[[Radio Andorra]]'' and ''Andorra Música''. There are three national newspapers, ''[[Diari d'Andorra]]'', ''[[El Periòdic d'Andorra]]'', and ''[[Bondia (newspaper)|Bondia]]'' as well as several local newspapers.

==Culture==
[[File:HPIM0309.JPG|thumb|right|Andorran flag on balcony, Ordino]]
{{main|Culture of Andorra}}
The official and historic language is Catalan. Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity.

Andorra is home to folk dances like the [[contrapàs]] and [[marratxa]], which survive in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially [[music of Catalonia|Catalan]] in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the [[sardana]]. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in [[Andorra la Vella]] and [[Saint Anne's dance]] in Escaldes-Engordany. Andorra's national holiday is [[Our Lady of Meritxell]] Day, September 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;  American Folk Artist Pete Seeger, intrigued by its defense budget of $4.90, wrote a song &quot;Andorra&quot; and sang it on his 1962 album &quot;The Bitter and the Sweet.&quot;.

{{see also|Music of Andorra}}

==Sports==
Andorra is famous by the practice of [[Winter Sports]] and also by [[Roller hockey (quad)|Roller Hockey]]. Andorra usually plays in [[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|CERH Euro Cup]] and in [[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup]].
In 2011, Andorra will be the host country to the [[2011 European League Final Eight]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{More footnotes|date=May 2010}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], the '''arithmetic mean''', often referred to as simply the '''mean''' or '''average''' when the context is clear, is a method to derive the central tendency of a [[sample space]]. The term &quot;arithmetic mean&quot; is preferred in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other [[average|mean]]s such as the [[geometric mean|geometric]] and [[harmonic mean]].

In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[history]], though it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. For example, [[per capita GDP]] gives an approximation of the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.

While the arithmetic mean is often used to report [[central tendency|central tendencies]], it is not a [[robust statistic]], meaning that it is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s. Notably, for [[skewed distribution]]s, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of &quot;middle&quot;, and robust statistics such as the [[median]] may be a better description of central tendency.

==Definition==
Suppose we have sample space &lt;math&gt;\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the arithmetic mean &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined via the equation
:&lt;math&gt;A:=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i&lt;/math&gt;.

If the list is a [[statistical population]], then the mean of that population is called a '''population mean'''. If the list is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]], we call the resulting [[statistic]] a '''sample mean'''.

==Motivating properties==
The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:

*If numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; have mean X, then &lt;math&gt;(x_1-X) + \ldots + (x_n-X) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;x_i-X&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the residuals defined this way sum to zero.
*If it is required to use a single number ''X'' as an estimate for the value of numbers &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the arithmetic mean does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squares (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''X'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]]. (It follows that the mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest [[root mean squared error]].)
*For a [[normal distribution]], the arithmetic mean is equal to both the median and the mode, other measures of central tendency.

==Problems==
[[Image:Comparison_mean_median_mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of [[mean]], [[median]] and [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with different [[skewness]].]]
The arithmetic mean may be misinterpreted as the median to imply that most values are higher or lower than is actually the case. If elements in the sample space [[arithmetic progression|increase arithmetically]], when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the sample space {1,2,3,4}. The average is 2.5, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample space that cannot be arranged into an arithmetic progression, such as {1,2,4,8,16}, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. When one looks at the arithmetic average of a sample space, one must note that the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample space.

There are applications of this phenomenon in fields such as economics. For example, since the 1980s in the United States median income has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income. [[Ben Bernanke]], has speculated that the difference can be accounted for through technology, and less so via the decline in labour unions and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Level and Distribution of Economic Well-Being|author=Ben S. Bernanke|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070206a.htm|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angles==
{{Main|Directional statistics}}

Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or [[angle]]s. Naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°.
This is incorrect for two reasons:
*Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to a factor of [[Degree (angle)|360°]] (or 2π, if measuring in [[radian]]s). Thus one could as easily call these 1° and &amp;minus;1°, or 1° and 719° – each of which gives a different average.
*Secondly, in this situation, 0° (equivalently, 360°) is geometrically a better ''average'' value: there is lower [[statistical dispersion|dispersion]] about it (the points are both 1° from it, and 179° from 180°, the putative average).

In general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (viz, define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).

The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two [[Conference (sports)|conferences]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). This conference and its counterpart, the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL.

The American Football Conference originated as the [[American Football League]] (AFL), which joined with the NFL in the [[AFL–NFL merger]] of 1970. As such most of its teams originally played in the AFL, while three others were NFL teams that were added to the AFC to equalize the number of franchises, and another three are more recent expansion teams.

==Current teams==
Since 2002, the AFC has comprised 16 teams, organized into four [[Division (sport)|divisions]] each containing four teams: [[AFC East|East]], [[AFC North|North]], [[AFC South|South]], and [[AFC West|West]].

==Season structure==
{{main|National Football League#Season structure}}

[[Image:NFL Schedule Sample.PNG|thumb|right|386px|A sample scheduling grid, with a single team's (the Browns) schedule highlighted. Under this hypothetical schedule, the Browns would play the teams in blue twice and the teams in yellow once, for a total of 16 games.]]

Each AFC team plays the other teams in its division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL the previous May. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the team's final division standing in the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year. For instance, in the [[2007 NFL season|2007 regular season]], each team in the [[AFC West]] played one game against each team in both the [[AFC South]] and the [[NFC North]]. In this way division competition consists of common opponents, with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of each team's prior division standing. (i.e. the division winner will face the other two division winners in the AFC divisions that they are not scheduled to play) The NFC operates according to the same system.

At the end of each football [[season (sport)|season]], there are [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] games involving the top six teams in the AFC (the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non-division-champion teams (&quot;[[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]]&quot;) by record). The last two teams remaining play in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC champion plays the NFC champion in the [[Super Bowl]]. After [[Super Bowl XLIII]] the AFC has won 19 Super Bowls to the 21 won by the NFC. Since losing 13 consecutive Super Bowls in the 1980s and 1990s ([[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XXXI|XXXI]]), the AFC has won 9 of the last 12. The losing coach of the AFC Championship game is the coach of the [[Pro Bowl]].

==History==
[[Image:American Football Conference logo old.svg|right|thumb|200px|American Football Conference logo From 1970 to 2009]]
The AFC was created after the NFL [[AFL-NFL Merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-fo055624a&amp;article_id=608&amp;chapter_id=13&amp;chapter_title=Sports&amp;article_title=Pro_Football_History|title=Pro Football - HISTORY|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the 10 former AFL teams along with the NFL's [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] joined the AFC. The two AFL divisions (East and West) were more or less intact, while the NFL's Century Division became the AFC Central.

Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion_and_realignment|2002 realignment]]. The expansion [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the AFC in 1995.

Due to the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|relocation controversy]] of the Cleveland Browns, a new AFC franchise called the [[Baltimore Ravens]] was officially established in 1996 while the Browns were reactivated in 1999.

The [[Houston Texans]] were then added to the league in 2002, joining the AFC.

==Logo==
[[File:Oldafclogo.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Original American Football Conference logo]]

The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the &quot;A&quot; and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/|title=But I Absolutely Refuse to Write About the Draft Caps |author=Paul Lukas |publisher=Uni Watch blog |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Animal Farm''''' is a [[dystopian]] [[allegory|allegorical]] [[novella]] by [[George Orwell]]. Published in England on 17 August [[1945 in literature|1945]], the book reflects events leading up to and during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Stalin era]] before [[World War II]]. Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1936) (''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1&amp;nbsp;– An Age Like This 1945-1950'' p.23 (Penguin))&lt;/ref&gt; was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to [[Moscow]]-directed [[Stalinism]], especially after his experiences with the [[NKVD]], and what he saw of the  results of the influence of Communist policy (&quot;ceaseless arrests, censored newspapers, prowling hordes of armed police&quot; - &quot;Communism is now a counter-revolutionary force&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide]], 31 July 1937, and ''Spilling the Spanish Beans'', New English Weekly, 29 July 1937&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as his novel &quot;contre Stalin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav&quot; /&gt;

The original title was '''''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story''''', but the subtitle was dropped by the US publishers for its 1946 publication and subsequently all but one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime omitted the addition. Other variations in the title include: ''A Satire'' and ''A Contemporary Satire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav&quot; /&gt; Orwell suggested for the [[French language|French]] translation the title ''Union des républiques socialistes animales'', recalling the French name of the [[Soviet Union]], ''Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques'', and which abbreviates URSA, which is the [[Latin]] for &quot;bear&quot;, a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav&quot; /&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gr|Grossman 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; it also places at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]]. It won a Retrospective [[Hugo Award]] in 1996 and is also included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]].

The novel addresses not only the corruption of the revolution by its leaders but also how wickedness, indifference, ignorance, greed and [[Myopia#Society and culture|myopia]] destroy any possibility of a Utopia. While this novel portrays corrupt leadership as the flaw in revolution (and not the act of revolution itself), it also shows how potential ignorance and indifference to problems within a revolution could allow horrors to happen if smooth transition to a people's government is not satisfied.

==Plot summary==
[[Old Major]], the old boar on the Manor Farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to [[parasite]]s and teaches the animals a revolutionary song, &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot;.

When Major dies three days later, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and turn his dream into a [[Political philosophy|philosophy]]. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] from the farm, renaming it &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.

The Seven Commandments of Animalism are written on the wall of a barn. The most important is the seventh, &quot;All animals are [[Social equality|equal]].&quot; All the animals work, but the [[horse|workhorse]], [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]], does more than others and adopts the [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]]&amp;nbsp;— &quot;I will work harder.&quot;

Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful; and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon takes the pups from the farm dogs and trains them privately. When Mr. Jones tries retaking the farm, the animals defeat him at what they call the &quot;Battle of the Cowshed.&quot; Napoleon and Snowball struggle for leadership. When Snowball announces his idea for a [[windmill]], Napoleon opposes it. Snowball makes a speech in favour of the windmill, whereupon Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away. In Snowball's absence, Napoleon declares himself leader and makes changes. Meetings will no longer be held and instead a committee of pigs will run the farm.

Using a young pig named Squealer as a mouthpiece, Napoleon announces that Snowball stole the idea for the windmill from him. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. After a violent storm, the animals find the windmill annihilated. Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball destroyed the windmill, although the scorn of the neighbouring farmers suggests the windmill's walls were too thin. Once Snowball becomes a [[scapegoat]], Napoleon begins [[Reign of Terror|purging]] the farm, killing animals he accuses of consorting with Snowball. Meanwhile, Boxer takes up a second [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]: &quot;Napoleon is always right.&quot;

Napoleon abuses his powers, making life harder for the animals; the pigs impose more control while reserving privileges for themselves. The pigs rewrite history, villainizing Snowball and glorifying Napoleon. Squealer justifies every statement Napoleon makes, even the pigs' alteration of the Seven Commandments of Animalism. &quot;No animal shall sleep in beds&quot; is changed to &quot;No animal shall sleep in beds with sheets&quot; when the pigs are discovered to have been sleeping in the old farmhouse. &quot;No animal shall drink alcohol&quot; is changed to &quot;No animal shall drink alcohol ''to excess''&quot; when the pigs discover the farmer's whisky. &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned as inappropriate, as according to Napoleon the dream of Animal Farm has been realized. It is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals, though cold, starving, and overworked, remain convinced through [[psychological conditioning]] that they are better off than they were when ruled by Mr. Jones. Squealer abuses the animals' poor memories and invents numbers to show their improvement.

[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]], one of the neighbouring farmers, swindles Napoleon by buying old wood with forged money, and then attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including Boxer, are wounded. Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinarian, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin the donkey, who &quot;could read as well as any pig&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George (1946). Animal Farm. London: Penguin Group. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; notices that the van belongs to &quot;Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler&quot;, and attempts to mount a rescue; but the animals' attempts are futile. Squealer reports that the van was purchased by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner had not been repainted. He recounts a tale of Boxer's death in the hands of the best medical care. Shortly after Boxer's death, it is revealed that the pigs have purchased more whisky.

Years pass, and the pigs learn to walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single phrase: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot; Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and the humans of the area, who congratulate Napoleon on having the hardest-working animals in the country on the least feed. Napoleon announces an alliance with the humans, against the labouring classes of both &quot;worlds&quot;. He abolishes practices and traditions related to the Revolution, and reverts the name of the farm to &quot;Manor Farm&quot;.

The animals, overhearing the conversation, notice that the faces of the pigs have begun changing. During a poker match, an argument breaks out between Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington when they both play the [[Ace of Spades]], and the animals realize that the faces of the pigs look like the faces of humans and no one can tell the difference between them.

===Animalism===
{{redirect|Seven Commandments|the Noahide code|Seven Laws of Noah}}
The pigs [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]], [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], and Squealer adapt [[Old Major]]'s ideas into an actual [[political philosophy|philosophy]], which they formally name Animalism. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer indulge in the vices of humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading). Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for his humanization, which represents the Soviet government's tweaking of communist theory to make it more a reformation of capitalism than a replacement.

The Seven Commandments are laws that were supposed to keep order and ensure elementary Animalism within Animal Farm. The Seven Commandments were designed to unite the animals together against the humans and prevent animals from following the humans' evil habits. Since not all of the animals can remember them, they are boiled down into one basic statement: &quot;Four legs good, two legs bad!&quot; (with wings counting as legs for this purpose, Snowball arguing that wings count as legs as they are objects of propulsion rather than manipulation), which the sheep constantly repeat, distracting the crowd from the lies of the pigs. The original commandments were:

# Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
# Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
# No animal shall wear clothes.
# No animal shall sleep in a bed.
# No animal shall drink alcohol.
# No animal shall kill any other animal.
# All animals are equal.

Later, Napoleon and his pigs are [[Political corruption|corrupted]] by the absolute [[Power (sociology)|power]] they hold over the farm. To maintain their popularity with the other animals, [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] secretly paints additions to some commandments to benefit the pigs while keeping them free of accusations of breaking the laws (such as &quot;No animal shall drink alcohol&quot; having &quot;to excess&quot; appended to it and &quot;No animal shall sleep in a bed&quot; with &quot;with sheets&quot; added to it). The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:

# No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets.'''
# No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess.'''
# No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause.'''

Eventually the laws are replaced with
&quot;All animals are equal, ''but some animals are more equal than others''&quot;, and &quot;Four legs good, two legs ''better!''&quot; as the pigs become more human.

He begins to gradually build up his power, using the dogs Jessie and Bluebell, whom he he took from their parents as puppies and raised to be vicious dogs, as his [[secret police]]. After driving Snowball off the farm, Napoleon usurps full power, using false propaganda from Squealer and threats and intimidation from the dogs to keep the other animals in line. Among other things, he gradually changes the Commandments for his benefit. By the end of the book, Napoleon and his fellow pigs have learned to walk upright and started to behave similarly to the humans against whom they originally revolted.

;[[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]]
:Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones' overthrow. He is mainly based on [[Trotsky]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RoddenIntro&quot;/&gt; but also combines elements from [[Lenin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchens&quot;&gt;According to [[Christopher Hitchens]], &quot;the persons of Lenin and Trotsky are combined into one [i.e., Snowball], or, it might even be [...] to say, there is no Lenin at all.&quot; (Christopher Hitchens, ''Why Orwell Matters'', Basic Books (2002), p. 186f).&lt;/ref&gt; He wins over most animals and gains their trust by leading a very successful first harvest, but is driven out of the farm by Napoleon. Snowball genuinely works for the good of the farm and the animals and devises plans to help the animals achieve their vision of an [[egalitarian]] utopia, but Napoleon and his dogs chase him from the farm, and Napoleon spreads rumours to make him seem evil and corrupt and that he had secretly sabotaged the animals' efforts to improve the farm.

; [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]]

: A small white fat porker who serves as Napoleon's right hand pig and minister of propaganda, holding a position similar to that of [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RoddenIntro&quot;/&gt; Squealer manipulates the language to excuse, justify, and extol all of Napoleon's actions. Squealer limits debate by complicating it and he confuses and disorients, making claims that the pigs need the extra luxury they are taking in order to function properly, for example. However, when questions persist, he usually uses the threat of the return of Mr Jones, the former owner of the farm, to justify the pigs' privileges. Squealer uses statistics to convince the animals that life is getting better and better. Most of the animals have only dim memories of life before the revolution; therefore, they are convinced. In the end, he is the first pig to walk on his hind legs.

; Minimus

: A poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of ''Animal Farm'' after the singing of &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned.

; The Piglets

: Hinted to be the children of Napoleon (albeit not truly noted in the novel) and are the first generation of animals actually subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.

; The young pigs

: Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed.

; Pinkeye

: A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.

===Humans===
; [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]]

: The former owner of the farm, Jones is a very heavy drinker and the animals revolt against him after he drinks so much that he does not feed or take care of them. The attempt by Jones and his farmhands to recapture the farm is foiled in the Battle of the Cowshed.

; Frederick

: The tough owner of Pinchfield, a well-kept neighbouring farm. He buys wood from the animals for forged money and later attacks them, destroying the windmill but being finally beaten in the resulting Battle of the Windmill. There are stories of him mistreating his own animals, such as throwing dogs into a furnace. Pinchfield is noted as being smaller than Pilkington's Foxwood farm but more efficiently run, and Frederick briefly enters into an &quot;alliance&quot; with Napoleon by offering to buy wood from him but then betrays the deal and mounts a bloody invasion of Animal Farm.

; [[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr. Pilkington]]

: The easy-going but crafty owner of Foxwood, a neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds, as described in the book. At the end of the game, both Napoleon and Pilkington draw the Ace of Spades and then begin fighting loudly. Foxwood is described as being much larger than Pinchfield, but not as efficiently run.

; Mr. Whymper

: A man hired by Napoleon for the public relations of Animal Farm to human society.  Whymper is used as a go-between to trade with human society for things the animals can't produce on their own:  at first this is a legitimate need because the animals can't manufacture their own windmill components, but eventually Whymper is used to procure luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.

===Equines===
; [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]]

: Boxer is a loyal, kind, dedicated, and respectable horse. He is physically the strongest animal on the farm, but impressionable (a major theme in the book), which leaves him stating &quot;I will work harder&quot; and &quot;Napoleon is always right&quot; despite the corruption.

; Clover

: Clover, a mare, is Boxer's companion, constantly caring for him; she also acts as a matriarch of sorts for the other horses and the other animals in general (such as the ducklings she shelters with her forelegs and hooves during Old Major's speech).

; Mollie

: Mollie is a self-centred, self-indulgent and vain young white mare whose sole enjoyments are wearing ribbons in her mane, eating sugar cubes, and being pampered and groomed by humans. She quickly leaves for another farm and is only once mentioned again.

; [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]]

: Benjamin, a donkey, is one of the longest-lived animals. He has the worst temper, but is  also one of the wisest animals on the farm, and is one of the few who can actually read. He is able to &quot;read as well as any pig.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell 1946 40&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Orwell |first=George |authorlink=George Orwell |title=Animal Farm |year=1946 |publisher=The New American Library |location=New York |page=40 |isbn=141936524X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin is a very dedicated friend to Boxer, and does nothing to warn the other animals of the pigs' corruption, which he secretly realizes is steadily unfolding. When asked if he was happier after the revolution than before it, Benjamin remarks, &quot;Donkeys live a long time. None of you has ever seen a dead donkey.&quot; He is skeptical and pessimistic, his most-often-made statement being &quot;Life will go on as it has always gone on — that is, badly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell 1946 40&quot;/&gt;

===Other animals===

; Muriel

: A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. She, like Benjamin and Snowball, is one of the few animals on the farm who can read (with some difficulty as she has to spell the words out first) and helps Clover discover that the Seven Commandments have been continually changed.

; The Puppies

: Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, taken away from them by Napoleon at birth and reared by Napoleon to be his security force. These dogs are trained to be vicious, going so far as to rip many of the animals to shreds including the four young pigs, a sheep and various hens. They attempt to do the same to Boxer, who halts one of the puppies under his hoof. The puppy begs for mercy and through Napoleon's orders, Boxer sets the puppy free.

; Moses the Raven

: An old crow who occasionally visits the farm, regaling its denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called Sugarcandy Mountain, where he avers that all animals go when they die—but only if they work hard. He is interpreted as symbolising the Russian Orthodox Church, with Sugarcandy Mountain an allusion to Heaven for the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm |title=Animal Farm |publisher=SparkNotes |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spends his time turning the animals' minds to thoughts of Sugarcandy Mountain (rather than their work) and yet does no work himself. He feels unequal in comparison to the other animals, so he leaves after the rebellion, for all animals were supposed to be equal. However, much later in the novel he returns to the farm and continues to proclaim the existence of Sugarcandy Mountain. The other animals are confused by the pigs' attitude towards Moses; they denounce his claims as nonsense, but allow him to remain on the farm. The pigs do this to keep any doubting animals in line with the hope of a happy afterlife, keeping their minds on Sugarcandy Mountain and not on possible uprisings. In the end, Moses is one of the few animals to remember The Rebellion, along with Clover, Benjamin, and the pigs.

; The Sheep

: They show limited understanding of the situations but nonetheless blindly support Napoleon's ideals. They are regularly shown repeating the phrase &quot;four legs good, two legs bad&quot;. At the end of the novel, one of the Seven Commandments is changed after the pigs learn to walk on two legs and their shout changes to &quot;four legs good, two legs better&quot;. They can be relied on by the pigs to shout down any dissent from the others.

; The Hens

: The hens are among the first to rebel against Napoleon: in response to their being forced to give more eggs, they destroy their eggs instead of handing them to the higher powers (the pigs), who want to sell them to humans. Napoleon then uses fear and starves them until the pigs get what they want.

; The Cows

: Their milk is stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them, and is stirred into the pigs' mash every day while the other animals are not given any such luxuries.

; The Cat

: Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods, and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she &quot;purred so affectionately that is was impossible not to believe in her good intentions&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;p.47 of book&lt;/ref&gt; She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election she was found to have actually &quot;voted on both sides&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Origin==
George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in his 1938 ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.   In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him &quot;how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries.&quot; This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original [[socialism|socialist]] ideals.&lt;ref name=&quot;GO47&quot;&gt;[[#Or|Orwell 1947]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately prior to his writing, the Ministry of Information had put out a booklet for propagandists with instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, which included directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination, and Orwell had quit the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''Why the Allies Won'', p 297 ISBN 0-393-03925-0&lt;/ref&gt;

In that preface, Orwell also described what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm:&lt;ref name=&quot;GO47&quot; /&gt;
{{quote|...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.}}

Orwell encountered great difficulty getting the manuscript published, as it was feared that the book might upset the alliance between the US, UK and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dag 2004&quot;&gt;[[#Dag|Dag 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 page 25 ''La libertà di stampa'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.

==Significance==
[[File:Animalism flag.svg|thumb|The Horn and Hoof Flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]].]]

In the [[Eastern Bloc]] both ''Animal Farm'' and later, also ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' were on the list of forbidden books up until ''[[die Wende]]'' in 1989, and were only available via clandestine [[Samizdat]] networks.

The novel's ''Battle of the Windmill'' is referred to by Sant Singh Bal as one &quot;of the important episodes which constitute the essence of the plot of the novel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sant Singh Bal, ''George Orwell'' (1981), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Bloom writes that the &quot;Battle of the Windmill rings a special bell: the [[Brunswick Manifesto (1792)|repulse]] of the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Brunswick]] in 1792, following the Prussian bombardment that made the windmill of [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] famous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harold Bloom 2007&quot;&gt;Harold Bloom, ''George Orwell'' (2007), 148.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Peter Edgerly Firchow and Peter Hobley Davison consider that in real life, with events in ''Animal Farm'' mirroring those in the [[Soviet Union]], this fictional battle represents the [[Great Patriotic War]] ([[World War II]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot;&gt;Peter Edgerly Firchow, ''Modern Utopian Fictions from H.G. Wells to Iris Murdoch'' (2008), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot;&gt;Peter Hobley Davison, ''George Orwell'' (1996), 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Prestwick House's ''Activity Pack'' for ''Animal Farm'' also identifies the Battle of the Windmill as an allegory for World War II, while noting that the &quot;catalyst for the Battle of the Windmill, though, is less clear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''Animal Farm&amp;nbsp;— Activity Pack'' (Prestwick House, Inc., 2004), T-3, T-23, S-23.&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, Fredrick drills a hole and places [[explosive]]s inside, and it is followed by &quot;All the animals, except Napoleon&quot; took cover; Orwell had the publisher alter this from &quot;All the animals, including Napoleon&quot; in recognition of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Conrad and Paul Kirschner, ''Under Western Eyes'' (1996), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Battle of the Cowshed'' represents the allied invasion of the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot; /&gt; and the defeat of the [[White movement|White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot; /&gt;

==Efforts to find a publisher==
During [[World War II]], it became apparent to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch&amp;nbsp;— including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) also rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising its &quot;good writing&quot; and &quot;fundamental integrity&quot; but declaring that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint &quot;which I take to be generally Trotskyite&quot;. Eliot said he found the view &quot;not convincing&quot;, and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue &quot;what was needed .. was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot&quot;&gt;Richard
Brooks, &quot;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5993099.ece TS Eliot’s snort of rejection for Animal Farm]&quot;, ''Sunday Times'', 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09-004&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09|title=T.S.

Eliot rejection letter|publisher=The Times|accessdate=2009-04-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One publisher he sought during the war, who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected his book after an official at the British [[UK Ministry of Information|Ministry of Information]] warned him off&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7719633.stm |title=The whitewashing of Stalin|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ta|Taylor page 337]] Writing to Leonard Moore, a partner in the literary agency of Christy &amp; Moore, publisher &quot;Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable: and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. The 'important official' was, or so it may reasonably be assumed, a man named [[Peter Smollett]], later unmasked as a Soviet agent.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher then wrote to Orwell, saying:&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.

Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offense to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.}}

==&quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;==
Orwell originally wrote a preface which complains about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally. &quot;The sinister fact about literary [[censorship]] in England is that it is largely voluntary.&amp;nbsp;... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.&quot; Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dag 2004&quot; /&gt; and as of June 2009 has not been published with most editions of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ba|Bailey83221]] (Bailey83221 includes a preface and two cites: 1995-08-26 The Guardian page 28; 1995-08-26 New Statesman &amp; Society 8 (366): 11. ISSN: 0954-2361)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secker and Warburg published the first edition of Animal Farm in 1945 without any introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied and all the page numbers needed to be redone at the last minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOIT15&quot;&gt;[[#GOIT|Orwell page 15]]. introduction by Bernard Crick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TFOTP&quot;&gt;George Orwell: ''[http://www.orwell.ru/library/novels/Animal_Farm/english/efp_go The Freedom of the Press&amp;nbsp;– Orwell's Proposed Preface to 'Animal Farm’.]'' 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, in 1972, Ian Angus found the original typescript titled &quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;, and Bernard Crick published it, together with his own introduction in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 15 September 1972&lt;ref name=&quot;GOIT15&quot; /&gt; as &quot;How the essay came to be written&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TFOTP&quot; /&gt; Orwell's essay criticized British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.&lt;ref name=&quot;TFOTP&quot; /&gt; The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 Animal Farm edition, with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOIT15&quot; /&gt; Other publishers were still declining to publish it.{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=more details needed, were some actively refusing, unaware of the preface?}}

==Cultural references==
{{Main|Animal Farm in popular culture}}

References to the novella are frequent in other works of popular culture, particularly in popular music and television series.

==Adaptations==
''Animal Farm'' has been adapted to film twice. The [[Animal Farm (1954 film)|1954 ''Animal Farm'' film]] was an animated feature and the [[Animal Farm (1999 film)|1999 ''Animal Farm'' film]] was a TV live action version, both differ from the novel. In the 1954 film Napoleon is overthrown in a second revolution while the 1999 film shows Napoleon's regime collapsing in on itself, as happened in the Soviet Union.

'''Amphibians''' (class '''Amphibia''', from Amphi- meaning &quot;on both sides&quot; and -bios meaning &quot;life&quot;) are a class of [[vertebrate]] [[animals]], characterized as non-[[amniote]] [[ectotherm]]ic (or cold-blooded) [[tetrapods]]. Most Amphibians undergo [[metamorphosis]] from a juvenile water-breathing form to an adult air-breathing form, but some are [[Pedomorphosis|paedomorphs]] that retain the juvenile water-breathing form throughout life. [[Mudpuppies]], for example, retain juvenile gills in adulthood. The three modern orders of amphibians are Anura ([[frog]]s and [[toad]]s), Caudata ([[salamander]]s and [[newt]]s), and Gymnophiona ([[caecilian]]s, limbless amphibians that resemble snakes), and in total they number approximately 6,500 species.&lt;ref name=species&gt;[http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/13/9780199541188_chapter1.pdf Amphibian diversity and life history].&lt;/ref&gt; Many amphibians lay their eggs in water. Amphibians are superficially similar to [[reptile]]s, but reptiles are [[amniotes]], along with mammals and birds.  The study of amphibians is called batrachology.

Amphibians are [[ecological indicator]]s,&lt;ref name=Waddle&gt;[http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0016760/waddle_j.pdf Waddle, J, USE OF AMPHIBIANS AS ECOSYSTEM INDICATOR SPECIES]&lt;/ref&gt; and in recent decades there has been a dramatic [[decline in amphibian populations]] around the globe. Many species are now threatened or extinct.

Amphibians evolved in the [[Devonian|Devonian Period]] and were top predators in the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] Periods, but many lineages were wiped out during the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic extinction]]. One group, the [[Metoposauridae|metoposaurs]], remained important predators during the [[Triassic]], but as the world became drier during the [[Early Jurassic]] they died out, leaving a handful of relict [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyls]] like ''[[Koolasuchus]]'' and the modern orders of [[Lissamphibia]].

==Etymology==
''Amphibian'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] term ἀμφίβιος ''amphíbios'' which means both kinds of life, ''amphi'' meaning “both” and ''bio'' meaning life. The term was initially used for all kinds of combined natures. Eventually it was used to refer to animals that live both in the water and on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=amphibious&amp;db=luna |title=Amphibious definition |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary history==
{{Main|Labyrinthodontia}}
{{see also|List of prehistoric amphibians}}
The first major groups of amphibians developed in the [[Devonian|Devonian Period]] from fish similar to the modern [[coelacanth]] and [[lungfish]] which had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. These amphibians were as much as one to five meters in length. However, amphibians never developed the ability to live their entire lives on land, having to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs.

In the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]], the amphibians moved up in the food chain and began to occupy the ecological position currently occupied by crocodiles. These amphibians were notable for eating the mega insects on land and many types of fishes in the water. During the [[Triassic|Triassic Period]], the better land-adapted proto-crocodiles began to compete with amphibians, leading to their reduction in size and importance in the biosphere.

==Taxonomic history==
Traditionally, amphibians have included all [[tetrapod]] vertebrates that are not [[amniote]]s.  They are divided into three [[Class (biology)|subclasses]], of which two are only known as extinct subclasses: 
* Subclass [[Labyrinthodontia]]† (diverse Paleozoic and early Mesozoic group)
* Subclass [[Lepospondyli]]† (small Paleozoic group, sometimes included in the Labyrinthodontia, which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than Lissamphibia)
* Subclass [[Lissamphibia]] (frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, etc.)

Of these only the last subclass includes recent species.

With the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] classification Labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group without unique defining features apart from [[Cladistics#plesiomorphy|shared primitive characteristics]]. Classification varies according to the preferred [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of the author, whether they use a [[Cladistics#Three definitions of clade|stem-based or node-based]] classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all [[tetrapods]] with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of [[Paleozoic]] amphibians is by no means satisfactory understood, and lissamphibia may possibly include extinct groups like the [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyls]] (traditionally placed in the subclass “Labyrinthodontia”), and the Lepospondyls, and in some analysis even the [[Amniota|amniots]]. This means that [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] list a large number of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] [[tetrapod]] groups, undoubtedly were “amphibians” in biology, that are formally placed in Amphibia in [[Linnaean taxonomy]], but not in [[cladistic taxonomy]].

All recent amphibians are included in the subclass Lissamphibia, superorder Salientia, which is usually considered a [[clade]] (which means that it is thought that they evolved from a common ancestor apart from other extinct groups), although it has also been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a temnospondyl-like ancestor, and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced [[reptiliomorpha|reptiliomorph]] amphibians, and thus of amniots.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson J. S., Reisz R. R., Scott D., Fröbisch N. B., &amp; Sumida S. S. (2008): A stem batrachian from the Early Permian of Texas and the origin of frogs and salamanders. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' No 453, pp 515–518 {{doi|10.1038/nature06865}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Authorities also disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. Practical considerations seem to favor using the former arrangement now. The Lissamphibia, superorder Salientia, are traditionally divided into three [[Order (biology)|order]]s, but an extinct salamander-like family, the Albanerpetontidae, is now considered part of the Lissamphibia, besides the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus a single [[Triassic]] proto-frog, ''[[Triadobatrachus]]''.

Class '''Amphibia'''
* Subclass [[Lissamphibia]]
*** Family [[Albanerpetontidae]] — Jurassic to Miocene (extinct)
** Superorder [[Salientia]]
*** Genus ''[[Triadobatrachus]]'' — Triassic (extinct) - A stem Anuran
*** Order Anura ([[frog]]s and [[toad]]s): Jurassic to recent — 5,602 recent species in 48 families
*** Order Caudata or Urodela ([[salamander]]s, [[newt]]s): Jurassic to recent — 571 recent species in 9 families
*** Order Gymnophiona or Apoda ([[caecilian]]s): Jurassic to recent — 174 recent species in 3 families

The actual number of species partly also depends on the taxonomic classification followed, the two most common classifications being the classification of the website AmphibiaWeb, University of California (Berkeley) and the classification by [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] Darrel Frost and The American Museum of Natural History, available as the online reference database Amphibian Species of the World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.amnh.org/herpetology/amphibia/ Amphibian Species of the World] The online database by Darrel Frost and The American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of species cited above follow Frost.

===Respiration===

The lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to that of the [[amniotes]], possessing few internal [[alveolar septum|septa]], large [[alveoli]] and therefore a slow diffusion rate of oxygen into the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by [[buccal pumping]].  However, most amphibians are able to exchange gasses with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularized skin must remain moist in order for the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficient rate.  Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the [[Telmatobius culeus|Titicaca water frog]] or [[Cryptobranchus|hellbender salamanders]].  In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the [[Plethodontidae|plethodontid salamanders]] which have neither lungs nor gills.  Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the [[axolotl]]) retaining gills as aquatic adults.

===Reproduction===
[[Image:Caecilian.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caecilian]] from the [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] zoo]]

For the purpose of [[Biological reproduction|reproduction]] most amphibians require [[fresh water]]. A few (e.g. ''[[Fejervarya raja]]'') can inhabit [[brackish water]] and even survive (though not thrive) in [[seawater]], but there are no true [[marine (ocean)|marine]] amphibians. Several hundred frog species in [[adaptive radiation]]s (e.g., ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'', the Pacific Platymantines, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for [[breeding in the wild]]. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and [[evolution]]ary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforests]] and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the [[tadpole]] stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 ''Abiotic factor''. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment]. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species have also adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, but most of them still need water to lay their eggs. [[Symbiosis]] with single celled [[algae]] that lives in the jelly-like layer of the eggs has evolved several times. The larvae of frogs (tadpoles or polliwogs) breathe with exterior [[gill]]s at the start, but soon a pouch is formed that covers the gills and the front legs. Lungs are also formed quite early to assist in breathing. Newt larvae have large external gills that gradually disappear and the larvae of newts are quite similar to the adult form from early age on.  

Frogs and toads however have a tadpole stage, which is a totally different organism that is a grazing algae or ongrowth or filtering plankton until a certain size has been reached, where metamorphosis sets in. This [[metamorphosis]] lasts typically only 24 hours and  consists of:
* The disappearance of the gill pouch, making the front legs visible.
* The transformation of the jaws into the big jaws of predatory frogs (most tadpoles are scraping of algae or are filter feeders)
* The transformation of the digestive system: the long spiral gut of the larva is being replaced by the typical short gut of a predator.
* An adaptation of the nervous system for stereoscopic vision, locomotion and feeding
* A quick growth and movement of the eyes to higher up the skull and the formation of eyelids.
* Formation of skin glands, thickening of the skin and loss of the lateral line system
* An [[eardrum]] is developed to lock the middle [[ear]].
The disappearance of the tail is somewhat later (occurs at higher thyroxin levels) and after the tail has been resorbed the animals are ready to leave the water. The material of the tail is being used for a quick growth of the legs. The disappearance of the larval structures is a regulated process called [[apoptosis]].

The transformation of newts when leaving the water is reversible except for the loss of the external gills. When the animals enter the water again for reproduction changes are driven by [[prolactin]], when they return to the land phase by [[thyroxin]]

==Conservation==
{{main|Decline in amphibian populations}}

[[Image:Bufo periglenes1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Golden Toad]] of [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]] was among the first casualties of amphibian declines. Formerly abundant, it was last seen in 1989.]]

Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized [[extinction]], have been noted in the past two decades from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived as one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]]. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including [[habitat destruction]] and modification, [[over-exploitation]], [[pollution]], [[introduced species]], [[climate change]], endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the [[ozone layer]] (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like [[chytridiomycosis]].  However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion. A [[global strategy]] to stem the crisis has been released in the form of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (available at http://www.amphibians.org). Developed by over 80 leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the next 5 years - and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. [[Amphibian Ark]] is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the [[Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project]] that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of [[chytridiomycosis]] rapidly spreading into eastern Panama&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphibianrescue.org Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project] http://amphibianrescue.org/?page_id=91&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 21, 2008, Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE), as given by chief Helen Meredith, identified nature's most [[endangered]] [[species]]: &quot;The EDGE amphibians are amongst the most remarkable and unusual species on the planet and yet an alarming 85% of the top 100 are receiving little or no conservation attention.&quot; The top 10 endangered species (in the [[List of endangered animal species]]) 
include: the [[Chinese giant salamander]], a distant relative of the [[newt]], the tiny [[Gardiner's Seychelles Frog|Gardiner's Seychelles]], the limbless Sagalla caecilian, [[South Africa]]n [[ghost frog]]s, lungless Mexican salamanders, the [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] rainbow [[frog]], Chile's Darwin frog ([[Rhinoderma rufum]]) and the Betic Midwife Toad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL2038808 |title=Reuters, Giant newt, tiny frog identified as most at risk |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2008-01-20 |accessdate=2009-04-07 | first=Jeremy | last=Lovell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jan/21/conservation |title= Drive to save weird and endangered amphibians |accessdate=2009-04-07 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Sample | date=2008-01-20 | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2008/jan/21/wildlife.conservation?picture=332110244 |title=/environment, images of the species |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2009-04-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2008/jan/21/wildlife.conservation |title=/environment, Gallery: the world's strangest amphibians |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2009-04-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alaska''' ({{IPAc-en|en-us-Alaska.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|æ|s|k|ə}}) is the largest [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]] by area. It is situated in the northwest extremity of the [[North America]]n continent, with [[Canada]] to the east, the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west and south, with [[Russia]] further west across the [[Bering Strait]]. Approximately half of Alaska's 710,231 residents (as per the [[2010 United States Census]]) live within the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]]. Alaska is the least densely populated state of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US02&amp;-ds_name=PEP_2007_EST&amp;-mt_name=PEP_2007_EST_G2007_T001 |title=Census Bureau |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska was [[Alaska Purchase|purchased]] from the [[Russian Empire]] on March 30, 1867, for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|7200000|1867|r=2}}}} in today's dollars) at about two cents per acre ($4.74/km²). The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an [[Territories of the United States|organized (or incorporated) territory]] on May 11, 1912, and the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.

The name &quot;Alaska&quot; (Аляска) was already introduced in the Russian colonial period, when it was used only for the [[Alaska Peninsula|peninsula]] and is derived from the [[Aleut language|Aleut]] ''alaxsxaq'', meaning &quot;the mainland&quot; or more literally, &quot;the object towards which the action of the sea is directed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, J. Ellis. 1940. ''Derivation of the Word &quot;Alaska&quot;'. American Anthropologist n.s., 42: pp. 550–551&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as [[Alyeska]], the &quot;great land&quot;, an Aleut word derived from the same root.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Alaska}}
{{Wikisource|Portal:Alaska|Alaska}}
Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF14/1404.html |title=Alaska's Size in Perspective |accessdate=2007-11-19 |author=Benson, Carl|date=1998-09-02 |publisher=[[Geophysical Institute]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only non-[[contiguous]] U.S. state on continental North America; about {{convert|500|mi|km|-1}} of British Columbia (Canada) separate Alaska from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]]. Alaska is thus an [[exclave]] of the United States. It is technically part of the [[Continental United States|continental U.S.]], but is often not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;the Lower 48'']].&lt;ref&gt;The other three exclaves of the United States are the [[Northwest Angle]] of [[Minnesota]], [[Point Roberts, Washington]] and [[Alburgh, Vermont]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The capital city, [[Juneau]], is situated on the mainland of the North American continent, but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.

The state is bordered by the [[Yukon Territory]] and [[British Columbia]] in Canada, to the east, the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the Pacific Ocean to the south, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian [[Big Diomede Island]] and Alaskan [[Little Diomede Island]] are only {{convert|3|mi|km}} apart.  With the extension of the [[Aleutian Islands]] into the eastern hemisphere, it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States, as well as also being the northernmost.

[[File:Alaska area compared to conterminous US.svg|thumb|Alaska's size compared with the [[contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]].]]
Alaska is the largest state in the United States in land area at {{convert|586412|sqmi|km2|0}}, over twice the size of [[Texas]], the next largest state. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries. 
Counting territorial waters, Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states: [[Texas]], [[California]], and [[Montana]]. It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U.S. states.

===The regions===
There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six generally accepted regions:

====[[South Central Alaska|Southcentral]]====
The most populous region of Alaska, containing [[Anchorage]], the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] and the [[Kenai Peninsula]].  Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the [[Alaska Range]] and west of the [[Wrangell Mountains]] also fall within the definition of Southcentral, as well as the [[Prince William Sound]] area and the communities of [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]] and [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].

====[[Southeast Alaska|Southeast or Panhandle]]====
This is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States, and hence, was where most of the initial non-Native settlement of Alaska occurred following the [[Alaska Purchase]]. It contains the state capital, Juneau, the former capital, [[Sitka]], and the large town of [[Ketchikan]].  The road systems leading from these communities are strictly local;  no roads connect these communities to each other or any other communities apart from their own suburbs.  The region is dominated by the [[Alexander Archipelago]] as well as the [[Tongass National Forest]], the largest national forest in the United States.

====[[Alaska Interior|Interior]]====
[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount McKinley]] is both the highest peak in Alaska and in all of North America.]]
The largest region of Alaska, much of it uninhabited wilderness.  [[Fairbanks]] is the only community of any significant size.  Small towns and Native villages are scattered throughout, mostly along the highway and river systems.  [[Denali National Park and Preserve]] is located here, home to [[Mount McKinley]] (also widely known by its local name of Denali), the highest point in North America.

====[[Southwest Alaska|Southwest]]====
[[File:Grizzly Bear Fishing Brooks Falls.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Grizzly bear]] fishing for [[salmon]] at [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Brooks Falls]].]]
A sparsely inhabited region stretching some {{convert|500|mi|km}} inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. Kodiak Island is also located in Southwest. The massive [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta]], one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here.  Portions of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).

====[[Alaska North Slope|Arctic or North Slope]]====
The North Slope is mostly [[tundra]] peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the [[National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska]] and the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alaska.com |url=http://www.alaska.com/regions/ |title=Alaska.com |publisher=Alaska.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], the northernmost city in the United States, is located here.  The [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic area]], anchored by [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]] and also containing the [[Kobuk River]] valley, is often regarded as being part of this region.  However, the respective [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom think of themselves as one.

====[[Aleutian Islands]]====
More than 300 small, volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over {{convert|1200|mi}} into the Pacific Ocean. The [[International Date Line]] was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day.  However, because some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, this makes Alaska the northernmost, easternmost and westernmost state in the union, with the southernmost state being [[Hawaii]].  Two of the islands were occupied by the [[Japan]]ese during [[World War II]].

===Natural features===
[[File:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006 edited-1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Augustine Volcano]] erupting on January 12, 2006.]]
With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly {{convert|34000|mi|km|-1}} of tidal shoreline. The [[Aleutian Islands]] chain extends west from the southern tip of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. Many active [[volcano]]es are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. [[Unimak Island]], for example, is home to [[Mount Shishaldin]], which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's [[Mount Fuji]]. The chain of volcanoes extends to [[Mount Spurr]], west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of [[Wrangellia]], a large region consisting of multiple [[U.S. state|states]] and Canadian provinces in the [[Pacific Northwest]] which is actively undergoing [[plate tectonics|continent building]].

One of the world's largest tides occurs in [[Turnagain Arm]], just south of Anchorage&amp;nbsp;– tidal differences can be more than {{convert|35|ft|m|1}}. (Many sources say Turnagain has the second-greatest tides in North America, but several areas in Canada have larger tides.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Porco, Peter|date = June 23, 2003 | title = Long said to be second to Fundy, city tides aren't even close | journal = [[Anchorage Daily News]] | pages = A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of lakes in Alaska}}
Alaska has more than three million lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Alaska Hydrology Survey | publisher=Division of Mining, Land, and Water; [[Alaska Department of Natural Resources]] | url=http://www.dnr.state.ak.us/mlw/water/hydro/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knls.org/English/akfact.htm |title=Alaska Facts |publisher=Knls.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080228134807/http%3A//www.knls.org/English/akfact.htm |archivedate = February 28, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshland]]s and wetland [[permafrost]] cover {{convert|188320|sqmi|km2|0}} (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers some {{convert|16000|sqmi|km2|-1}} of land and {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2|-1}} of tidal zone. The [[Bering Glacier]] complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers {{convert|2250|sqmi|km2|0}} alone. With over 100,000, Alaska has half of the world's glaciers.

===Land ownership===
[[File:Public-Lands-Western-US.png|thumb|300px|Alaska has more public land owned by the federal government than any other state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm |title=Western States Data Public Land Acreage |publisher=Wildlandfire.com |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to an October 1998 report by the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]], approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] as public lands, including a multitude of [[United States National Forest|national forests]], national parks, and [[national wildlife refuge]]s. Of these, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] manages 87 million acres (350,000&amp;nbsp;km²), or 23.8% of the state. The [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising {{convert|16|e6acre|km2}}.

Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns {{convert|101|e6acre|km2}};  its entitlement under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]].  A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly-formed boroughs.  Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities, though these are infrequently popular due to the often remote and roadless locations.  The [[University of Alaska]], as a [[land grant university]], also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.

Another {{convert|44|e6acre|km2}} are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]].  [[Alaska Native Regional Corporation|Regional Native corporation]] [[Doyon, Limited]] often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications.  Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect.  Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land.  [[Alaska Native Allotment Act|Individual Native allotments]] can be and are sold on the open market, however.

Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state.  Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Alaska}}
The climate in Juneau and the southeast panhandle is a mid-latitude [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfc'') in the northern parts. On an annual basis, the panhandle is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over {{convert|50|in|mm|-1}} of precipitation a year, while other areas receive over {{convert|275|in|mm|-1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-YK Precip&quot;&gt;[http://www.ocs.orst.edu/pub/maps/Precipitation/Total/States/AK/ak_ppt.gif Mean Annual Precipitation in Alaska-Yukon]. Oregon Climate Service at [[Oregon State University]]. Retrieved October 23, 2006. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, Anchorage receives {{convert|16|in|mm|0}} of precipitation a year, with around {{convert|75|in|mm|0}} of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate (Köppen ''Dfc'') due to its brief, cool summers.

[[File:Barrow beach.jpg|thumb|[[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], known colloquially for many years by the nickname &quot;Top of the World,&quot; is the northernmost city in the United States.]]
The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation.  An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the [[Kobuk River]] valley is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than {{convert|10|in|mm|-1}} of precipitation annually.  On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around {{convert|100|in|mm|-1}} of precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-YK Precip&quot;/&gt;

The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s°F (the low to mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below −60&amp;nbsp;°F (−52&amp;nbsp;°C). Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than {{convert|10|in|mm|-1}} a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.

The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is 100&amp;nbsp;°F (38&amp;nbsp;°C) in [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] (which is just {{convert|8|mi|km}} inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards Information&amp;nbsp;— Alaska Weather Interesting Facts and Records | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | format = PDF | url = http://www.arh.noaa.gov/docs/AKWXfacts.pdf | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI&gt;{{cite web | title = State Extremes | publisher = Western Regional Climate Center, [[Desert Research Institute]] | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making Alaska tied with [[Hawaii]] as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SD Weather History and Trivia for May: May 1 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia05 NOAA&amp;nbsp;– National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FAQ ALASKA&amp;nbsp;— Frequently Asked Questions About Alaska: Weather | publisher = Statewide Library Electronic Doorway, [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] | date= 2005-01-17 | url=http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html#wea | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest official Alaska temperature is −80&amp;nbsp;°F (−62&amp;nbsp;°C) in [[Prospect Creek, Alaska|Prospect Creek]] on January 23, 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI/&gt; one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in [[Snag, Yukon|Snag, Yukon, Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Ned Rozell | title = The Coldest Place in North America | publisher = Geophysical Institute of the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] | date= 2003-01-23 | url = http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is [[polar climate|Arctic]] (Köppen ''ET'') with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]] is 34&amp;nbsp;°F (1&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/PABR/2006/7/23/MonthlyHistory.html History for Barrow, Alaska.

==History==
{{Main|History of Alaska}}

===[[Alaska natives]]===
{{see also|Prehistory of Alaska}}
[[File:AlutiiqDancer.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Alutiiq dancer in traditional festival garb.]]
Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. The [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people developed a matriarchal society in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the [[Haida people|Haida]], now well known for their unique arts, and the [[Tsimshian]] people, whose population were decimated by a smallpox epidemic in the 1860s. The Aleutian Islands are still home to the [[Aleut people|Aleut]] people's seafaring society, although they were among the first to be exploited by the Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the [[Yup'ik]], while their cousins the [[Alutiiq]] lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The [[Gwich’in]] people of the northern Interior region are primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. The North Slope and [[Little Diomede Island]] are occupied by the widespread [[Inuit]] people.

===Colonization===
[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].]]
The first European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when [[Vitus Bering]] led an [[second Kamchatka expedition|expedition]] for the Russian Navy aboard the ''St. Peter''. After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia towards the Aleutian islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784. Between 1774 and 1800 [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.

[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]] and remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the [[colony]] was never very profitable. 

[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the president of the United States, as well as a [[United States territorial court|district court]] headquartered in Sitka.

For most of Alaska's first decade under the American flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers.  They organized a &quot;provisional city government,&quot; which was Alaska's first city government, but not in a legal sense.  Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and [[Home rule#Home rule in the United States|home rule]] for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect.

===U.S. Territory===
Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, [[Klondike Gold Rush|gold rushes]] in Alaska and the nearby [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska.  Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912.  Alaska's capital, which had been in Sitka until the 1900 legislation mandated its transfer to Juneau (the actual move took place in 1906, after initial questions arose), begun to take shape with the construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] that same year.

[[File:AttuSnow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|U.S. troops negotiate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943.]]
During World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands&amp;nbsp;– [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu Island|Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]]&lt;ref&gt;these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from continental USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from continental Alaska (U.S.), {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943. Unalaska/Dutch Harbor became a significant base for the U.S. Army Air Corps and Navy submariners.

The U.S. [[Lend-Lease]] program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and thence Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.

===Statehood===
Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate.  Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946.  The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow.  Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska.  Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.

On April 27, 1964, the massive &quot;[[Good Friday Earthquake]]&quot; killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides. It was the third most powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world, with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 9.2. It was over one thousand times more powerful than the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 San Francisco earthquake]].  The time of day (5:36 pm), time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.

The 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] led to an oil boom.  Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward.  That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.  In 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], spilling over {{convert|11000000|USgal|m3|sigfig=2}} of crude oil over 1,100&amp;nbsp;miles (1,600&amp;nbsp;km) of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].

Alaska is the largest U.S. state by [[List of U.S. states by area|area]], and the sixth wealthiest (per capita income).  As of January 2010, the state's unemployment rate is 8.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and ancestry===

According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], Alaska had a population of 710,231. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.7% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 3.3% Black or African American, 14.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.4% Asian, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from Some Other Race, and 7.3% from Two or More Races.

===Languages===
According to the 2005–2007 American Community Survey, 84.7% of people over the age of five speak only English at home. About 3.5% speak Spanish at home. About 2.2% speak another [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] at home and about 4.3% speak an [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]] at home.

A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 22 [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]], known locally as &quot;native languages&quot;. These languages belong to two major language families: [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]] and [[Na-Dené languages|Na-Dene]]. As the homeland of these two major language families of North America, Alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent, providing evidence for the recent settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]].

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Alaska}}
[[File:Alaska Pipeline Closeup Underneath.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] transports oil, Alaska's most financially important export, from the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]. Pertinent are the [[heat pipe]]s in the column mounts, which disperses heat upwards and prevents melting of [[permafrost]].]]
The 2007 [[gross state product]] was $44.9 billion, 45th in the nation. Its [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|per capita personal income]] for 2007 was $40,042, ranking 15th in the nation. The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.

Agriculture represents only a fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.

Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

===Energy===
{{See also|Natural gas in Alaska|Energy law#Alaska law}}
[[File:Alaska Crude Oil Reserves.PNG|thumb|300px|Alaska oil reserves peaked in 1978 and have declined 60% thereafter.]]
Alaska has vast energy resources. Major oil and gas reserves are found in the [[Alaska North Slope]] (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Alaska ranks second in the nation in crude oil production. Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is the highest yielding oil field in the United States and on North America, typically producing about {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.

The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] can transport and pump up to {{convert|2.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins.  The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are {{convert|85.4|Tcuft|km3}} of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74 |title=Gas Hydrates on Alaska's North Slope |publisher=Usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=AK |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Alaska |publisher=Tonto.eia.doe.gov |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alaska Crude Oil Production.PNG|thumb|300px|Alaska oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined 65% since.]]
Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g. with special [[single-wire earth return#Use in interties|low-cost electric interties]]) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (&lt;$0.50/Gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}, April, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  The cost of a US gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually $0.30–$0.60 higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.

Alaska accounts for one-fifth (20 percent) of domestically produced United States oil production. Prudhoe Bay (North America's largest oil field) alone accounts for 8% of the U.S. domestic oil production.

====Permanent Fund====
The [[Alaska Permanent Fund]] is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of same from the recently constructed [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]].  The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million (US)) at once, and was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone.  It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.

The [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.  The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation.  From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $40 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfc.org/ Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska.  This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never really gained momentum.

Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000.00 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269.00 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200.00 &quot;Resource Rebate&quot;). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8 percent from the earnings, puts 3 percent back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5 percent is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |title=State of Alaska Permanent Fund Division |publisher=Pfd.state.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.

===Cost of living===
The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. This has changed for the most part in Anchorage and to a lesser extent in Fairbanks, where the cost of living has dropped somewhat in the past five years. Federal government employees, particularly [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.

The introduction of [[big-box store]]s in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau also did much to lower prices.  [[Wal-Mart]] opened their first Anchorage store in 1993, and debuted in Fairbanks in 2004.  The company currently has locations covering most of the population centers of Alaska, including Juneau, Ketchikan and Kodiak.  However, rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods, compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure. Many rural residents come into these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]]. Some have embraced the free shipping offers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeshipping.org/category/alaska-free-shipping-coupons/ FreeShipping.org] for examples of companies offering free shipping to Alaska&lt;/ref&gt; of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities, if they are available at all.

===Agriculture===
Due to the northern climate and steep terrain, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.  The [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, also has a sizable concentration of farms, which mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]].  This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor.  Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay.

Alaska, with no counties, also lacks county fairs.  However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the [[Alaska State Fair]] in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] the largest), are held mostly in the late summer.  The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food.  &quot;Alaska Grown&quot; is used as an agricultural slogan.

[[File:Pacific Halibut Fileting.JPG|thumb|150px|left|[[Halibut]] is important to the state's economy as both a commercial and sport-caught fish.]]
Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific, and seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it.  Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport.  This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main&lt;/ref&gt;   

Hunting for subsistence, primarily [[caribou]], [[moose]], and [[Dall sheep]] is still common in the state, particularly in remote [[Bush Alaska|Bush]] communities. An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.

Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]] where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating  with the domesticated reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;Outside&quot;]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. The cost of importing food to villages begins at 7¢ per pound (15¢/kg) and rises rapidly to 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost can exceed $8.00 per gallon.

== Transportation ==
{{Main|Transportation in Alaska}}

=== Roads ===
[[File:Seward Highway.jpg|thumb|[[Sterling Highway]].]]
{{See also|List of Alaska Routes}}
Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.

[[File:Susitnabridge.JPG|thumb|The [[Susitna River]] bridge on the [[Denali Highway]] is {{convert|1036|ft}} long.]]
One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], an active [[Alaska Railroad]] tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] on [[Prince William Sound]] to the [[Seward Highway]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Anchorage at [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]]. At {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;completion of the 3.5&amp;nbsp;mile (5.6&amp;nbsp;km) [[Interstate 93]] tunnel as part of the &quot;[[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]]&quot; project in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel is the longest combination [[List of road-rail tunnels|road and rail tunnel]] in North America.

[[Hyder, Alaska]], in south Southeast Alaska is linked to [[Stewart, British Columbia]], via 37A Stewart Cassiar Highway/Glacier Highway, which eventually heads north to connect to the [[Alaska Highway|ALCAN highway]] near [[Watson Lake, Yukon]]. The road between Hyder (population 100) to southeastern Alaskan cities like Ketchikan heads through British Columbia, Yukon, and returns south into Alaska.  The 100-air-mile distance between Hyder and Ketchikan is {{convert|1078|mi|km}} by road.

=== Rail ===
[[File:AlaskaRailroad.jpg|thumb|Alaska Railroad &quot;[[Glacier Discovery]]&quot; train.]]
Built around 1915, the [[Alaska Railroad]] (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna, Alaska|Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as &quot;The Railbelt&quot;. In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.

The railroad, though famed for its summertime tour passenger service, played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage).

The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area; until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.

In northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the State from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series [[Great Little Railways]].

The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.

[[Alaska Rail Marine]] provides [[car float]] service between [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Seattle]].

=== Marine transport ===
Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.
[[File:Tustumena, Alaska Marine Highway.jpg|right|thumb|The [[MV Tustumena|M/V ''Tustumena'']] (named after [[Tustumena Glacier]]) is one of the state's many ferries, providing service between the [[Kenai Peninsula]] and [[Kodiak Island]].]]
Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]]) serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|southeast]], the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers. The system also operates a ferry service from [[Bellingham, Washington]] and [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] in [[Canada]] through the [[Inside Passage]] to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. The [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]] also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.

In recent years, large cruise ships began creating a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along the north gulf coast. Several times each summer, the population of [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] sharply rises for a few hours when two ships dock to debark more than a thousand passengers each while four other ships lie at anchor nearby, waiting their turn at the dock.

=== Air transport ===
Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed [[Alaskan Bush|bush]] air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage itself, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks, are served by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport#Airlines and destinations|many major airlines]]. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2000–2001, the latest year for which data is available, 2.4&amp;nbsp;million total arrivals to Alaska were counted, 1.7&amp;nbsp;million by air travel; 1.4&amp;nbsp;million were visitors).&lt;ref&gt;State of Alaska Office of Economic Development.

[[File:Alaska-737-4QB-YVR.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alaska Airlines]] [[Boeing 737]] airliner]]

Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the [[Essential Air Service]] program. [[Alaska Airlines]] is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.

The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as [[Era Aviation]], [[PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.

Many communities have small air taxi services.  These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas.  Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. Alaska has the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state: out of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 are pilots, or about one in 78.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration. ''[http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/2005/ 2005 U.S. Civil Airman Statistics]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other transport ===
Another Alaskan transportation method is the [[dogsled]]. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], a 1150-mile (1850&amp;nbsp;km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at {{convert|1049|mi|km}}). The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The &quot;Serum Run&quot; is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serumrun.org/ |title=Norman Vaughan Serum Run |publisher=Serumrun.org |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by [[all-terrain vehicle]] and in winter by [[snowmobile]] or &quot;snow machine,&quot; as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.

== Law and government ==
{{Main|Government of Alaska}}

=== State government ===
[[File:Juneau, Alaska Downtown.jpg|thumb|The center of state government in [[Juneau]].  The large buildings in the background are, from left to right: the Court Plaza Building (colloquially known as the [[Spam (food)|&quot;Spam Can&quot;]]), the State Office Building (behind), the Alaska Office Building, the [[List of Justices of the Alaska Supreme Court|John H. Dimond]] State Courthouse, and the [[Alaska State Capitol]].  Many of the smaller buildings in the foreground are also occupied by state government agencies.]]
Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: an [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[Governor of Alaska]] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; a [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] and [[Alaska Senate]]; and a [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska Supreme Court]] and lower courts.

The state of Alaska employs approximately 15,000 employees statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dop.state.ak.us/employeeOrientation/introduction |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Dop.state.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Legislature]] consists of a 40-member [[Alaska House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a 20-member [[Alaska Senate|Senate]]. Senators serve four year terms and House members two. The [[Governor of Alaska]] serves four-year terms. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]] runs separately from the governor in the [[Primary election|primaries]], but during the [[general election]], the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket.

Alaska's court system has four levels: the [[Alaska Supreme Court]], the court of appeals, the superior courts and the district courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm |title=About the Alaska Court System |publisher=State.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superior and district courts are [[trial court]]s. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts only hear certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt;  The Supreme Court and the Court Of Appeals are [[appellate court]]s. The Court Of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and [[habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt; The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt;

=== State politics ===
{{further|[[Political party strength in Alaska]]}}

Although Alaska entered&lt;!--&quot;entered&quot;?--&gt; the union as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state, since the early 1970s Alaska has been characterized as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://election.nationaljournal.com/states/ak.htm |title=National Journal Alaska State Profile |publisher=Election.nationaljournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights. [[Alaska Native]]s, while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Native corporations]]. These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.

Alaska is the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home is completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.&lt;ref name=seattle_times&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html |title=Judge rules against Alaska marijuana law |accessdate=2008-05-22 |last=Volz |first=Matt |date=2006-07-11 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |publisher=Frank A. Blethen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the [[Alaskan Independence Party]] labeled as one of &quot;the most significant state-level third parties operating in the 20th century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Doughtery, J. (2001, February 25). Alaska party stumps for independence. World Net Daily. Retrieved from [http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=21840 A Free Press for a Free People]&lt;/ref&gt;

Six [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and four [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have served as governor of Alaska.  In addition, Republican Governor [[Walter Joseph Hickel|Wally Hickel]] was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected. He subsequently officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.

=== Taxes ===
To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;CNN Money (2005). &quot;How tax friendly is your state?&quot; Retrieved from [http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/taxesbystate2005/index.html CNN website].&lt;/ref&gt; and be one of only five states with no state [[sales tax]], one of seven states that do not levy an individual [[income tax]], and one of two states that has neither. The Department of Revenue Tax Division&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.state.ak.us/ |title=Department of Revenue Tax Division |publisher=Tax.state.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  reports regularly on the state's revenue sources. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.

While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, [[severance tax]]es, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.

[[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]] (FNSB). A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on other goods such as liquor and tobacco.

In 2008 the [[Tax Foundation]] ranked Alaska as having the 4th most &quot;business friendly&quot; tax policy. More &quot;friendly&quot; states were [[Wyoming]], [[Nevada]], and [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/11.html |title=Educating Taxpayers Since 1937 |publisher=The Tax Foundation |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In presidential elections, the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] votes have been won by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee in every election since statehood, except for 1964. No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the landslide year of [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964]], and the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]] elections were close. Since [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972]], however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008]], Republican [[John McCain]] defeated Democrat [[Barack Obama]] in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%.  McCain's running mate was [[Sarah Palin]], the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. 

The [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaska Bush]], central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the area surrounding the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] campus have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. Matanuska-Susitna Borough and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing. As of 2004, well over half of all registered voters have chosen &quot;Non-Partisan&quot; or &quot;Undeclared&quot; as their affiliation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080225223222/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm|archivedate=2008-02-25 |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite recent attempts to close primaries.

Because of its population relative to other U.S. states, Alaska has only one member in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. This seat is currently being held by Republican [[Don Young]], who was re-elected to his 19th consecutive term in 2008.  [[Alaska's At-large congressional district]] is currently the world's second-largest parliamentary constituency by area, behind only the Canadian territory of [[Nunavut]].

In 2008, Governor [[Sarah Palin]] became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became [[John S. McCain|John McCain]]'s Vice Presidential running mate.  She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor's job in July 2009.

[[List of United States Senators from Alaska|Alaska's United States Senators]] belong to [[Classes of United States Senators|Class 2 and Class 3]].  In 2008, Democrat [[Mark Begich]], mayor of Anchorage, defeated long-time Republican senator [[Ted Stevens]]. Stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election. The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.

Republican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State Representative [[Lisa Murkowski]] as his successor. She won a full six-year term in 2004 and 2010.

Alaska is not divided into [[County (United States)|counties]], as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into ''[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]''. Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].

The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.

Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]] which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government. Currently ([[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]]) 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.

For statistical purposes the [[United States Census Bureau]] divides this territory into [[census area]]s. Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]]) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).

The state's most populous city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest [[Alaska locations by per capita income|location in Alaska by per capita income]] is [[Halibut Cove, Alaska|Halibut Cove]] ($89,895). [[Yakutat City]], Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four [[List of U.S. cities by area|largest cities in the U.S. by area]].

== Education ==
[[File:Kachcampus.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kachemak Bay]] campus of the [[University of Alaska Anchorage]].]]
The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development administers many [[List of school districts in Alaska|school districts]] in Alaska. In addition, the state operates a boarding school, [[Mt. Edgecumbe High School]] in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]; and provides partial funding for other boarding schools including, [[Nenana Student Living Center]] in [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], and The Galena Interior Learning Academy in [[Galena, Alaska|Galena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaice.org/material.php?matID=138 |title=Alaska ICE |publisher=Alaska ICE |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than a dozen [[List of colleges and universities in Alaska|colleges and universities in Alaska]]. Accredited universities in Alaska include the [[University of Alaska Anchorage]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], [[University of Alaska Southeast]], and [[Alaska Pacific University]].&lt;ref&gt;These are the only three universities in the state ranked by [[US News and World Report]]. [http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankindex_brief.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development operates [http://avtec.labor.state.ak.us/|AVTEC, Alaska's Institute of Technology].  Campuses in Seward and Anchorage offer 1 week to 11 month training programs in areas as diverse as Information Technology, Welding, Nursing, and Mechanics.

Alaska has had a problem with a &quot;[[brain drain]]&quot;. Many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state after high school graduation and do not return. The [[University of Alaska]] has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alaska.edu/scholars/faq.xml#scholars_award |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080309023826/http://www.alaska.edu/scholars/faq.xml |archivedate=2008-03-09 |title=UA Scholars Program&amp;nbsp;– Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2009-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public health and public safety ==
{{See also|Dentistry in rural Alaska}}
The [[Alaska State Troopers]] are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on &quot;Public Safety Officers&quot; who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles. 

Many rural communities in Alaska are considered &quot;dry,&quot; having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dps.state.ak.us/abc/restrictions.aspx |title=AK Dept. of Public Safety Alcoholic Beverage Control Board |publisher=Dps.state.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.state.ak.us/suicideprevention/statistics_pages_sspc/AKsuiciderate_rural_urban_90-00.htm |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Hss.state.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic abuse]] and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notes5.state.ak.us/pn/pubnotic.nsf/0/8dad412f35cf9ba1892574e30001c413/$FILE/JAG+supplemental+program+narrative.pdf |title=Alaska State Troopers FY 2008 Byrne Grant Application |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska also has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation. The average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old. In four out of five cases, the suspects were relatives, friends or acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-01-29-alaska-sexualassaults_N.htm |title=Rural Alaska steeped in sexual violence |publisher=USA Today |date= 2008-01-30|accessdate=2010-12-31 |first=Rachel |last=D'oro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

[[File:Iditarod Ceremonial start in Anchorage, Alaska.jpg|thumb|right|A dog team in the Iditarod race, arguably the most popular winter event in Alaska.]]
Some of Alaska's popular annual events are the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] that starts in Anchorage and ends in Nome, World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, the Alaska Hummingbird Festival in [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], the [[Sitka Whale Fest]], and the Stikine River Garnet Fest in [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]]. The [[Stikine River]] features the largest springtime concentration of [[American Bald Eagle]]s in the world.

The [[Alaska Native Heritage Center]] celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups. Their purpose is to enhance self-esteem among Native people and to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people. The [[Alaska Native Arts Foundation]] promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, both on the internet; at its gallery in Anchorage, 500 West Sixth Avenue, and at the [http://www.alaskahouseny.org/index.aspx?ModuleID=1  Alaska House New York], 109 Mercer Street in [[New York City|SoHo]].&lt;ref&gt;www.alaskanativearts.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Alaska}}
Influences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe. Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], traditional Aleut flautist [[Mary Youngblood]], folk singer-songwriter [[Libby Roderick]], Christian music singer/songwriter [[Lincoln Brewster]], metal/post hardcore band [[36 Crazyfists]] and the groups [[Pamyua]] and [[Portugal. The Man]].

There are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the [[Alaska Folk Festival]], the [[Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival]], the [http://anchoragefolkfestival.org/ Anchorage Folk Festival], the [[Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival]], the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the [[Sitka Summer Music Festival]]. The most prominent [[symphony]] in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the [[Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable. The [[Anchorage Opera]] is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.

The official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Alaska is &quot;[[Alaska's Flag]]&quot;, which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the [[flag of Alaska]].

=== Movies filmed in Alaska ===
{{see also|List of films set in Alaska}}
[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|left|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated  [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]
Alaska's first independent picture all made on place was in the silent years.  ''[[The Chechahcos]]'' was produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage.  It was released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation and was the only film the company made.

One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]].  In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in [[Hollywood]] to Alaska to film what was then billed as &quot;The Biggest Picture Ever Made.&quot;  Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up &quot;Camp Hollywood&quot; in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming.  [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in [[Hollywood]] to prepare meals.  When ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre (New York)|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history to that point.  ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide;  as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and was also responsible for showcasing and preserving aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.

The 1983 Disney movie [[Never Cry Wolf (film)|''Never Cry Wolf'']] was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film [[White Fang (1991 film)|''White Fang'']], starring [[Ethan Hawke]], was filmed in and around Haines, Alaska. [[Steven Seagal]]'s 1994 ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]], was filmed in part at the [[Worthington Glacier]] near [[Valdez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/OnDeadlyGround/ |title=On Deadly Ground |publisher=Filminamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 John Sayles film ''[[Limbo (film)|Limbo]]'', starring David Strathairn, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Kris Kristofferson, was filmed in Juneau.

The psychological thriller ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robin Williams]], was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska. The 2007 horror feature ''[[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]]'' is set in [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], Alaska, but was filmed in New Zealand. Most films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was actually filmed in [[Roslyn, Washington]].

The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of [[Christopher McCandless]], who died in a remote abandoned bus along the [[Stampede Trail]] west of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] in 1992.

'''Agriculture''' is the cultivation of [[animals]], [[plant]]s, [[fungi]] and other life forms for [[food]], [[fiber]], and other products used to sustain life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=International Labour Office|title=Safety and health in agriculture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=13 September 2010|year=1999|publisher=International Labour Organization|isbn=978-92-2-111517-5|pages=77–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key implement in the rise of sedentary [[human]] [[civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that nurtured the development of [[civilization]]. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. Agriculture is also observed in certain species of ant and termite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527481.300-for-sustainable-architecture-think-bug.html?page=1 |title=For sustainable architecture, think bug |publisher=NewScientist |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=B.

The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, cultures, and technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands suitable for raising domesticated species. For plants, this usually requires some form of [[irrigation]], although there are methods of [[dryland farming]]; [[pastoralism|pastoral]] herding on [[rangeland]] is still the most common means of raising [[livestock]]. In the developed world, [[industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for [[sustainable agriculture]] (e.g. [[permaculture]] or [[organic agriculture]]).

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[pesticides]] and [[fertilizers]], and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/health/human.htm |title=Human Health Issues &amp;#124; Pesticides &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in animal husbandry such as [[intensive pig farming]] have similarly increased the output of [[meat]], but have raised concerns about [[animal cruelty]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormones]], and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organicconsumers.org/toxic/hormone042302.cfm |title=EU Scientists Confirm Health Risks of Growth Hormones in Meat |publisher=Organicconsumers.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into [[food]]s, [[fiber]]s, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. In the 21st century, plants have been used to grow [[biofuel]]s, [[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[bioplastic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bioengineers-aim-to-cash-in-on-plants-that-make-green-plastics

[[Fiber]]s include cotton, wool, [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. [[Raw material]]s include lumber and bamboo. Other useful materials are produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s. Biofuels include [[methane]] from [[biomass]], [[ethanol]], and [[biodiesel]]. [[Floriculture|Cut flowers]], [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]], tropical fish and birds for the pet trade are some of the ornamental products.

In 2007, one third of the world's workers were employed in agriculture. The [[service (economics)|services]] sector has overtaken agriculture as the [[economic sector]] employing the most people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/strat/kilm/index.htm |title=Key Indicators of the Labour Market Programme |date=September 7, 2009 |publisher=International Labour Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the size of its workforce, agricultural production accounts for less than five percent of the [[gross world product]] (an aggregate of all [[gross domestic product]]s).

== Etymology ==
The word ''agriculture'' is the English adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', &quot;a field&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholic.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=ager&amp;ending= Latin Word Lookup]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''cultūra'', &quot;[[cultivation]]&quot; in the strict sense of &quot;[[tillage]] of the soil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholic.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=cultura&amp;ending= Latin Word Lookup]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a literal reading of the word yields &quot;tillage of a field / of fields&quot;.

== Overview ==
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|thumb|300px|right|[[Colin Clark|Clark]]'s Sector Model (1950): The percent of the human population working in [[primary sector]] activities such as agriculture has decreased over time.]]
Agriculture has played a key role in the development of human [[civilization]]. Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture.  The type of agriculture they developed was typically [[subsistence agriculture]] in which farmers raised most of their crops for consumption on farm, and there was only a small portion left over for the payment of taxes, dues, or trade.  In [[subsistence agriculture]] cropping decisions are made with an eye to what the family needs for food, and to make clothing, and not the world marketplace.  Development of agricultural techniques has steadily increased agricultural productivity, and the widespread diffusion of these techniques during a time period is often called an [[agricultural revolution]]. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the development of world markets. This also led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques, such as the [[Haber-Bosch]] method for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] which made the traditional practice of recycling [[nutrients]] with [[crop rotation]] and animal [[manure]] less necessary.

Synthetic nitrogen, along with mined [[rock phosphate]], [[pesticides]] and [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]], have greatly increased [[crop yields]] in the early 20th century. Increased supply of [[grain]]s has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when [[high-yield varieties]] of common staple grains such as [[rice]], [[wheat]], and corn ([[maize]]) were introduced as a part of the [[Green Revolution]]. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world. [[Thomas Malthus]] famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.&lt;ref name=&quot;BumperCrop&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/business/worldbusiness/08farmers.html |newspaper =The New York Times
|title=Sometimes a Bumper Crop Is Too Much of a Good Thing |last=Barrionuevo |first=Alexei |coauthors=Bradsher, Keith |date=December 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many governments have subsidized agriculture to ensure an adequate food supply. These [[agricultural subsidies]] are often linked to the production of certain commodities such as [[wheat]], corn ([[maize]]), [[rice]], [[soybean]]s, and [[milk]]. These subsidies, especially when instituted by [[developed country|developed countries]] have been noted as [[protectionist]], inefficient, and environmentally damaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Keith |date=September 8, 1989

|title=Science Academy Recommends Resumption of Natural Farming |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced [[productivity]], the use of synthetic [[fertilizers]] and pesticides, [[selective breeding]], [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]], [[water contamination]], and [[farm subsidies]]. Proponents of [[organic farming]] such as [[Sir Albert Howard]] argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term fertility of the soil. While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as [[environmental awareness]] has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards [[sustainable agriculture]] by some farmers, consumers, and policymakers.

In recent years there has been a backlash against perceived [[externalities|external]] environmental effects of mainstream agriculture, particularly regarding water pollution,&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank (1995), [http://www.worldbank.org/fandd/english/0996/articles/0100996.htm Overcoming Agricultural Water Pollution in the European Union].&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the [[organic movement]]. One of the major forces behind this movement has been the [[European Union]], which first certified [[organic food]] in 1991 and began reform of its [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2003), [http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/index_en.htm CAP Reform].&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Decouple#Economics|decoupling]]. The growth of [[organic farming]] has renewed research in alternative technologies such as [[integrated pest management]] and [[selective breeding]]. Recent mainstream technological developments include [[genetically modified food]].

In late 2007, several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans as well as used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle, causing higher prices of wheat (up 58%), soybean (up 32%), and maize (up 11%) over the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Main|History of agriculture}}
[[File:ClaySumerianSickle.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sumer]]ian harvester's sickle made from baked clay (ca. 3000&amp;nbsp;BC).]]

Agricultural practices such as [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], [[fertilizers]], and [[pesticides]] were developed long ago, but have made great strides in the past century. The [[history of agriculture]] has played a major role in [[history of the world|human history]], as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide [[social change|socio-economic change]]. [[Division of labor]] in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures. So, too, are arts such as epic literature and monumental architecture, as well as codified legal systems. When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition. Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible. The total [[world population]] probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the invention of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''&quot;. PUQ. p.26. ISBN 2760515885&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient origins ===
{{See|Neolithic Revolution}}

The [[Fertile Crescent]] of [[Western Asia]], Egypt, and India were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild. Independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and southern China, Africa's [[Sahel]], [[New Guinea]] and several regions of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;In particular, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25creature.html?_r=1 the history of maize cultivation in southern Mexico dates back 9000 years.] ''New York Times'', accessdate=2010-5-4&lt;/ref&gt; The eight so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] of agriculture appear: first [[emmer wheat]] and [[einkorn wheat]], then hulled [[barley]], [[peas]], [[lentils]], [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]], [[chick pea]]s and [[flax]].

By 7000&amp;nbsp;BC, small-scale agriculture reached [[Egypt]]. From at least 7000&amp;nbsp;BC the [[Indian subcontinent]] saw farming of wheat and barley, as attested by archaeological excavation at [[Mehrgarh]] in [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] in what is present day [[Pakistan]]. By 6000&amp;nbsp;BC, mid-scale farming was entrenched on the banks of the [[Nile River|Nile]]. This, as irrigation had not yet matured sufficiently. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, with [[rice]], rather than [[wheat]], as the primary crop. Chinese and Indonesian farmers went on to domesticate [[taro]] and [[beans]] including [[mung bean|mung]], [[soy]] and [[azuki]]. To complement these new sources of carbohydrates, highly organized net fishing of rivers, lakes and ocean shores in these areas brought in great volumes of essential protein. Collectively, these new methods of farming and fishing inaugurated a human population boom that dwarfed all previous expansions and continues today.

By 5000&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Sumer]]ians had developed core agricultural techniques including large-scale intensive cultivation of land, [[monocropping]], organized [[irrigation]], and the use of a specialized labor force, particularly along the waterway now known as the [[Shatt al-Arab]], from its [[Persian Gulf]] delta to the confluence of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. Domestication of wild [[aurochs]] and [[mouflon]] into cattle and sheep, respectively, ushered in the large-scale use of animals for food/fiber and as beasts of burden. The [[shepherd]] joined the farmer as an essential provider for sedentary and seminomadic societies. [[Maize]], [[manioc]], and [[arrowroot]] were first domesticated in the Americas as far back as 5200&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucalgary.ca/news/feb2007/early-farming/ &quot;Farming older than thought&quot;], University of Calgary, February 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[potato]], [[tomato]], [[Capsicum|pepper]], [[squash (plant)|squash]], several varieties of [[bean]], [[tobacco]], and several other plants were also developed in the Americas, as was extensive [[terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] of steep hillsides in much of [[Andes|Andean]] South America. The [[Agriculture of ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Farming in ancient Rome|Romans]] built on techniques pioneered by the Sumerians, but made few fundamentally new advances. Southern Greeks struggled with very poor soils, yet managed to become a dominant society for years. The Romans were noted for an emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade.

In the same region, a parallel agricultural revolution occurred, resulting in some of the most important crops grown today. In Mesoamerica wild [[teosinte]] was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern [[maize]], more than 6000 years ago. It gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration.&lt;ref&gt;S. Johannessen and C. A. Hastorf (eds.) ''Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World'', Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of [[Squash (plant)|squash]] and [[bean]]s. [[Theobroma cacao|Cocoa]] was also a major crop in domesticated Mexico and Central America. The [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], one of the most important meat birds, was probably domesticated in Mexico or the U.S. Southwest. In the Andes region of South America the major domesticated crop was [[potatoes]], domesticated perhaps 5000 years ago. Large varieties of beans were domesticated, in South America, as well as animals, including [[llamas]], [[alpacas]], and [[guinea pigs]]. [[Coca]], still a major crop, was also domesticated in the Andes.

A minor center of domestication, the indigenous people of the Eastern U.S. appear to have domesticated numerous crops. [[Sunflowers]], [[tobacco]],&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, Carl B., Jr. (1992) On Possible Sources of the Tobacco of Prehistoric Eastern North America. ''Current Anthropology'' 33:54-56.&lt;/ref&gt; varieties of squash and [[Chenopodium]], as well as crops no longer grown, including [[marshelder]] and [[little barley]] were domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistoric Food Production in North America'', edited by Richard I. Ford. Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Anthropological Papers 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adair, Mary J. (1988) ''Prehistoric Agriculture in the Central Plains.'' Publications in Anthropology 16. University of Kansas, Lawrence.&lt;/ref&gt; Other wild foods may have undergone some selective cultivation, including [[wild rice]] and [[maple sugar]]. The most common varieties of [[Garden strawberry|strawberry]] were domesticated from Eastern North America.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Minnis (editor) (2003) ''People and Plants in Ancient Eastern North America.'' Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 3500 BC, the simplest form of the [[plough]] was developed, called the [[ard (plough)|ard]].&lt;ref&gt;Plough used in the South-English South Street, in 3500&lt;/ref&gt; Before this period, simple [[digging stick]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]s were used. These tools would have also been easier to transport, which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soil's nutrients were depleted. However, through excavations in Mexico it has been found that the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land would also have been a sustaining practice. Additional research in central Europe later revealed that agriculture was indeed practiced at this method. For this method, ards were thus much more efficient than digging sticks.&lt;ref&gt;The seventy great inventions of the ancient world by Brian M.Fagan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
During the Middle Ages, farmers in North Africa, the Near East, and Europe began making use of agricultural technologies including irrigation systems based on [[hydraulic]] and [[hydrostatic]] principles, machines such as [[Water wheel|norias]], water-raising machines, dams, and reservoirs. This combined with the invention of a [[three-field system]] of crop rotation and the [[Plough#Mouldboard plough|moldboard plow]] greatly improved agricultural efficiency.

In the European medieval period, agriculture was considered part of the set of ''[[mechanic arts|seven mechanical arts]]''.

After 1492, a [[Columbian exchange|global exchange]] of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred. Key crops involved in this exchange included the [[tomato]], [[maize]], [[potato]], [[manioc]], [[cocoa bean]] and [[tobacco]] going from the New World to the Old, and several varieties of [[wheat]], [[spices]], [[coffee]], and [[sugar cane]] going from the Old World to the New. The most important animal exportation from the Old World to the New were those of the [[horse]] and dog (dogs were already present in the pre-Columbian Americas but not in the numbers and breeds suited to farm work). Although not usually food animals, the horse (including donkeys and ponies) and dog quickly filled essential production roles on western-hemisphere farms.

The [[potato]] became an important staple crop in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/potato.html &quot;The Impact of the Potato&quot;], ''History Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since being introduced by Portuguese in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/suprtubr.htm Super-Sized Cassava Plants May Help Fight Hunger In Africa].

By the early 19th century, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks and [[cultivar]] had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages. Although there is a vast and interesting history of crop cultivation before the dawn of the 20th century, there is little question that the work of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]] created the scientific foundation for plant breeding that led to its explosive impact over the past 150 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingsbury&quot;&gt;Noel Kingsbury (2009) ''Hybrid. The History and Science of Plant Breeding'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid rise of [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]] in the late 19th century and the 20th century, particularly in the form of the [[tractor]], farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible. These advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States, [[Argentina]], [[Israel]], Germany, and a few other nations to output volumes of high-quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit.

The [[Haber-Bosch]] method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed [[crop yields]] to overcome previous constraints. In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, [[water pollution]], and [[farm subsidies]]. In recent years there has been a backlash against the [[externalities|external]] environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the [[organic movement]].

The cereals rice, corn, and wheat provide 60% of human food supply.&lt;ref name=Matson1997 /&gt; Between 1700 and 1980, &quot;the total area of cultivated land worldwide increased 466%&quot; and yields increased dramatically, particularly because of [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] high-yielding varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, and machinery.&lt;ref name=Matson1997&gt;Matson et al. (1997). [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/277/5325/504?ck=nck Agricultural Intensification and Ecosystem Properties]. ''Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, irrigation increased corn yields in eastern [[Colorado]] by 400 to 500% from 1940 to 1997.&lt;ref name=Matson1997/&gt;

However, concerns have been raised over the [[sustainability]] of intensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture has become associated with decreased soil quality in India and Asia, and there has been increased concern over the effects of fertilizers and pesticides on the environment, particularly as population increases and food demand expands. The monocultures typically used in intensive agriculture increase the number of pests, which are controlled through pesticides. [[Integrated pest management]] (IPM), which &quot;has been promoted for decades and has had some notable successes&quot; has not significantly affected the use of pesticides because policies encourage the use of pesticides and IPM is knowledge-intensive.&lt;ref name=Matson1997/&gt;

Agricultural exploration expeditions, since the late 19th century, have been mounted to find new species and new agricultural practices in different areas of the world.

In 2009, the [[Agriculture in China|agricultural output of China]] was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States, according to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (''[[Agriculture#List of countries by agricultural output|see below]]''). Economists measure the [[total factor productivity]] of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States is roughly 2.6 times more productive than it was in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;USDA ERS.

Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO FS&quot;&gt;U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Rome. [http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm &quot;Analysis of farming systems&quot;].

Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283-317 in &quot;Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology&quot;. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shifting cultivation]] (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. &quot;Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability&quot;. pp. 25-57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10-20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients ([[fertilizer]] or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Further industrialization lead to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;/&gt; Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

In [[tropics|tropical]] environments, all of these cropping systems are practiced. In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring [[irrigation]]. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown ([[coffee]], [[chocolate]]) and systems are practiced such as [[agroforestry]]. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt;

The last century has seen the [[intensive farming|intensification]], [[market concentration|concentration]] and [[economic specialization|specialization]] of agriculture, relying upon new technologies of agricultural chemicals ([[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s), [[agricultural machinery|mechanization]], and [[plant breeding]] ([[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] and [[GMO|GMO's]]). In the past few decades, a move towards [[sustainable agriculture|sustainability]] in agriculture has also developed, integrating ideas of socio-economic justice and conservation of resources and the environment within a farming system.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDA sust&quot;&gt;Gold, M.V. 1999.

== Livestock production systems ==
{{Main|Livestock}}

[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|right|Ploughing rice paddies with [[water buffalo]], in [[Indonesia]].]]
[[Animal]]s, including [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, and [[dog]]s, are often used to help [[cultivation|cultivate]] fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and [[transport]] farm products to buyers. [[Animal husbandry]] not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like [[milk]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.
[[Livestock]] production systems can be defined based on feed source, as [[grassland]] - based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;&gt;Sere, C.; Steinfeld, H.; Groeneweld, J. 1995. [http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents &quot;Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems - Current status issues and trends&quot;]. U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Rome. Retrieved December 7, 2008. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30-40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastic (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops. Approximately 68% of all agricultural land is permanent pastures used in the production of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;FAO Database, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[OECD]] member countries. In the U.S., 70% of the grain grown is fed to animals on feedlots.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.

== Production practices ==
[[File:Mt Uluguru and Sisal plantations.jpg|thumb|300px|Road leading across the farm allows machinery access to the farm for production practices.]]
'''[[Tillage]]''' is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soil&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils.

Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pest control]]''' includes the management of [[weed]]s, [[insect|insects/mites]], and [[disease]]s. Chemical ([[pesticide]]s), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical ([[tillage]]), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include [[crop rotation]], [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, [[intercropping]], [[composting]], avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. [[Integrated pest management]] attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Pest&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production&quot; pp.240-282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Nutrient management]]''' includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of [[manure]] produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic [[fertilizers]], [[manure]], [[green manure]], [[compost]] and mined [[minerals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Soil&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Soil and Land&quot; pp.165-210 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as [[crop rotation]] or a [[fallow]] period.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS nutrient&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. &quot;Nutrition from the Soil&quot; pp.187-218 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''.

Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in [[managed intensive rotational grazing]], or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or [[pasture]]s.

'''[[Water management]]''' is where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Some farmers use [[irrigation]] to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the [[Great Plains]] in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a [[fallow]] year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Water&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Plants and Soil Water&quot; pp.211-239 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

== Processing, distribution, and marketing ==
{{Main|Food processing}}
{{Main|Agricultural marketing}}
In the United States, food costs attributed to [[food processing|processing]], distribution, and [[agricultural marketing|marketing]] have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of value addition (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. From 1960 to 1980 the farm share was around 40%, but by 1990 it had declined to 30% and by 1998, 22.2%. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, with the top 20 food manufacturers accounting for half the food-processing value in 1995, over double that produced in 1954. As of 2000 the top six US supermarket groups had 50% of sales compared to 32% in 1992. Although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sexton,R.J.

== Crop alteration and biotechnology ==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|[[Tractor]] and [[Chaser bin]].]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel. His work on dominant and recessive alleles gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and brought great insights to the techniques utilized by plant breeders. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html History of Plant Breeding]. Retrieved December 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved [[disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|disease resistance]] and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray an ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to increase yield many folds by creating &quot;high-yielding varieties&quot;. For example, average yields of corn ([[maize]]) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, [[Egypt]] and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical [[pest control]], growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ruttan | first = Vernon W.

=== Genetic engineering ===
{{Main|Genetic Engineering}}
[[Genetically Modified Organism]]s (GMO) are [[organism]]s whose [[Genetics|genetic]] material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as [[recombinant DNA technology]]. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. After mechanical tomato-harvesters were developed in the early 1960s, agricultural scientists [[genetically modified tomato]]es to be more resistant to mechanical handling. More recently, genetic engineering is being employed in various parts of the world, to create crops with other beneficial traits. New research on woodland strawberry genome was found to be short and easy to manipulate.  Researchers now have tools to improve strawberry flavors and aromas of cultivated strawberries as stated in a publication by Nature Genetics.  http://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=7160

=== Herbicide-tolerant GMO crops ===
[[Roundup (herbicide)|''Roundup Ready'']] seed has a herbicide resistant gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to [[glyphosate]]. ''Roundup'' is a trade name for a glyphosate-based product, which is a systemic, nonselective herbicide used to kill weeds. ''Roundup Ready'' seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with glyphosate to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. Today, 92% of soybean acreage in the US is planted with genetically modified herbicide-tolerant plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/BiotechCrops/adoption.htm Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the US: Extent of Adoption]. Retrieved December 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.

=== Insect-resistant GMO crops ===
Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops protect plants from damage by insects; one such crop is [[transgenic maize|Starlink]]. Another is cotton, which accounts for 63% of US cotton acreage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/BiotechCrops/adoption.htm]|Genetically Engineered Crops in the US: Extent of Adoption]. Retrieved December 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Kimbrell, A. ''Faltal Harvest: The Tragedy of Industrial Agriculture,'' Island Press, Washington, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs and benefits of GMOs ===
Genetic engineers may someday develop [[transgenic plants]] which would allow for [[irrigation]], [[drainage]], [[conservation biology|conservation]], sanitary engineering, and maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil fuel derived inputs than conventional crops. Such developments would be particularly important in areas which are normally arid and rely upon constant irrigation, and on large scale farms.
However, genetic engineering of plants has proven to be controversial. Many issues surrounding food security and environmental impacts have risen regarding GMO practices. For example, GMOs are questioned by some ecologists and economists concerned with GMO practices such as [[terminator seeds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol4/iss1/art2/#GeneticModificationAndTheSustainabilityOfTheFoodSystem

Retrieved December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversial issue is the patent protection given to companies that develop new types of seed using genetic engineering. Since companies have intellectual ownership of their seeds, they have the power to dictate terms and conditions of their patented product. Currently, ten seed companies control over two-thirds of the global seed sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etcgroup.org/en/materials/publications.html?pub_id=706 Who Owns Nature?]. Retrieved December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vandana Shiva]] argues that these companies are guilty of [[biopiracy]] by patenting life and exploiting organisms for profit&lt;ref name=&quot;Shiva, Vandana 1997&quot;&gt;Shiva, Vandana. ''Biopiracy'', South End Press, Cambridge, MA, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers using patented seed are restricted from saving seed for subsequent plantings, which forces farmers to buy new seed every year. Since seed saving is a traditional practice for many farmers in both developing and developed countries, GMO seeds legally bind farmers to change their seed saving practices to buying new seed every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmers Guide to GMOs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shiva, Vandana 1997&quot;/&gt;

Locally adapted seeds are an essential heritage that has the potential to be lost with current hybridized crops and GMOs. Locally adapted seeds, also called land races or crop eco-types, are important because they have adapted over time to the specific microclimates, soils, other environmental conditions, field designs, and ethnic preference indigenous to the exact area of cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Nabhan, Gary Paul. ''Enduring Seeds,'' The University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing GMOs and hybridized commercial seed to an area brings the risk of cross-pollination with local land races Therefore, GMOs pose a threat to the sustainability of land races and the ethnic heritage of cultures. Once seed contains transgenic material, it becomes subject to the conditions of the seed company that owns the patent of the transgenic material.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva, Vanadana.

== Modern agriculture ==
{{multiple issues|section=y|POV=August 2010|advert=August 2010|globalize=August 2010}}
&lt;!-- Heavy pro-intensive POV, advertising style, America-centric world view etc. Repeats material in other sections. --&gt;
Modern agriculture is a term used to describe the wide majority of production practices employed by America’s farmers. The term depicts the push for innovation, stewardship and advancements continually made by growers to sustainably produce higher-quality products with a reduced environmental impact. Intensive scientific research and robust investment in modern agriculture during the past 50 years has helped farmers double food production.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;USDA/ERS Data - Agricultural Productivity in the United States&quot;. USDA Economic Research Service. August 17, 2010 [http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/AgProductivity/].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruben N. Lubowski, Marlow Vesterby, Shawn Bucholtz, Alba Baez and Michael J. Roberts. Major Uses of Land in The United States, 2002. USDA Economic Research Service, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
The agriculture industry works with government agencies and other organizations to ensure that farmers have access to the technologies required to support modern agriculture practices. Farmers are supported by education and certification programs that ensure they apply agricultural practices with care and only when required.{{Clarify|date=December 2010|Reason=What agenicies and organizations? Which country? ANY facts to back this meaningless text up?}}

=== Sustainability ===
Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;Safefood Consulting, Inc., Benefits of Crop Protection Technologies on Canadian Food Production, Nutrition, Economy and the Environment. Guelph, ON: 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies have given rise to innovations like conservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;Trewavas, Anthony. &quot;A critical assessment of organic farming-and-food assertions with particular respect to the UK and the potential environmental benefits of no-till agriculture&quot;. Crop Protection 2004: 757-781.&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Affordability ===
The goal of modern agriculture practices is to help farmers provide an affordable supply of food to meet the demands of a growing population.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Cornejo, J. &quot;Issues in the Economics of Pesticide Use in Agriculture: A Review of the Empirical Evidence&quot;. Review of Agricultural Economics 1998: 462-488.&lt;/ref&gt; With modern agriculture, more crops can be grown on less land allowing farmers to provide an increased supply of food at an affordable price.

== Food safety, labeling and regulation ==
Food security issues also coincide with [[food safety]] and [[food labeling regulations|food labeling]] concerns. Currently a global treaty, the BioSafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. The EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, whereas the US does not require transparent labeling of GMO foods. Since there are still questions regarding the safety and risks associated with GMO foods, some believe the public should have the freedom to choose and know what they are eating and require all GMO products to be labeled.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva, Vandana. ''Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace,'' South End Press, Cambridge, MA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a neutral forum where nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate food policy and the regulation of agriculture. According to Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, lobbying by &quot;powerful&quot; big food corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. The &quot;real, true issues are not being addressed by the political process because of the influence of lobbyists, of the true powerful entities,&quot; he said, speaking at the [[Compassion in World Farming]] annual forum. For example, recent proposals for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi|title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Juliette | last=Jowit | date=September 22, 2010}}, The Guardian (UK), 2010 Sept. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
{{Main|Environmental issues with agriculture}}
Agriculture imposes [[externalities|external costs]] upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total [[externality|external costs]] for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pretty et al. | year = 2000 | title = An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture | journal = Agricultural Systems | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–136 | doi = 10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7
| url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/bs/staff/pretty/AgSyst%20pdf.pdf | first1 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million.&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tegtmeier | first1 = E.M. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = M. | year = 2005 | title = External Costs of Agricultural Production in the United States

Both focused on purely fiscal impacts. The 2000 review included reported pesticide poisonings but did not include speculative chronic effects of pesticides, and the 2004 review relied on a 1992 estimate of the total impact of pesticides.

Agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of withdrawals of freshwater resources.&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/About_IWMI/Strategic_Documents/Annual_Reports/2006_2007/ca.html ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture''] Earthscan/IWMI, 2007, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing pressure being placed on water resources by industry, cities and the involving biofuels industry means that [[water scarcity]] is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with fewer water resources. Scientists are also realising that water resources need to be allocated to maintain natural environmental services, such as protecting towns from flooding, cleaning ecosystems and supporting fish stocks. In the book ''Out of Water: From abundance to scarcity and how to solve the world's water problems'', authors Colin Chartres and Samyukta Varma of the [[International Water Management Institute]] lay down a six-point plan of action for addressing the global challenge of producing sufficient food for the world with dwindling water resources. One of the actions they say is required is to ensure all water systems, such as lakes and rivers, have water allocated to [[environmental flow]].&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

A key player who is credited to saving billions of lives because of his revolutionary work in developing new agricultural techniques is Norman Borlaug. His transformative work brought high-yield crop varieties to developing countries and earned him an unofficial title as the father of the Green Revolution.

=== Livestock issues ===
A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem, Henning Steinfeld, said &quot;Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |title=Livestock a major threat to environment |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |date=November 29, 2006 |accessdate=&lt;!---August 7, 2009---&gt;|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080328062709/http%3A//www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |archivedate = March 28, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt;) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It also generates 64% of the ammonia, which contributes to acid rain and acidification of ecosystems. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation, in the Amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEAD&quot;&gt;Steinfeld, H.; Gerber, P.; Wassenaar, T.; Castel, V.; Rosales, M.; de Haan, C. 2006.

=== Land transformation and degradation ===
Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39–50%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vitousek&quot;&gt;Vitousek, P.M.; Mooney, H.A.; Lubchenco, J.; Melillo, J.M. 1997. &quot;Human Domination of Earth's Ecosystems&quot;.

Degradation can be [[deforestation]], [[desertification]], [[soil erosion]], mineral depletion, or chemical degradation (acidification and [[salinization]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt;

=== Eutrophication ===
[[Eutrophication]], excessive nutrients in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s resulting in [[algal bloom]]s and [[anoxic waters|anoxia]], leads to [[fish kill]]s, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) [[surface runoff|runoff]] and [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] from agricultural land. These nutrients are major [[nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint pollutants]] contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutr&quot;&gt;Carpenter, S.R., N.F. Caraco, D.L.

=== Pesticides ===
Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pimentel pesticide&quot;&gt;Pimentel, D. T.W. Culliney, and T. Bashore. 1996.

Our planet, our health: Report of the WHU commission on health and environment.

=== Climate change ===
[[Climate change]] has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in [[temperature]], [[rainfall]] (timing and quantity), [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[solar radiation]] and the interaction of these elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E.: [http://www.vulnerablefoodsystems.com/ “Crop yield and climate change”], Retrieved on September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture can both mitigate or worsen [[global warming]]. Some of the increase in [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] comes from the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the [[soil]], and much of the [[methane]] emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as [[rice paddy|rice paddies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R.

== Energy and agriculture ==
Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive [[mechanization]], [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s.

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1) direct consumption on the farm and 2) indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gas, liquid propane, and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1 percent of the nation's total energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;&gt;Randy Schnepf (2004). &quot;Energy use in Agriculture: Background and Issues,&quot; CRS Report for Congress. http://ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/04nov/RL32677.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt; The energy used to manufacture farm machinery is also a form of indirect agricultural energy consumption, but it is not included in [[USDA]] estimates of U.S. agricultural energy use. Together, direct and indirect consumption by U.S. farms accounts for about 2 percent of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt;

[[Food systems]] encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;css.snre.umich.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ers.usda.gov&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, higher incentives for farmers to grow non-food [[biofuel]] crops&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Kate; Edwards, Rob (March 8, 2008).[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2104849.0.2008_the_year_of_global_food_crisis.php &quot;2008: The year of global food crisis&quot;], ''The Herald'' (Glasgow).&lt;/ref&gt; combined with other factors (such as over-development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, [[climate change]], growing consumer demand in China and India, and [[population growth]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0118/p08s01-comv.html &quot;The global grain bubble&quot;], ''The Christian Science Monitor'' (Boston), January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to cause [[food security|food shortages]] in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico, as well as rising [[food]] prices around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/7284196.stm &quot;The cost of food: Facts and figures&quot;], ''BBC News Online'' (London), October 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walt, Vivienne (February 27, 2008).[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1717572,00.html &quot;The World's Growing Food-Price Crisis&quot;], ''Time'' (New York).&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. Some of these shortages resulted in [[2007-2008 world food price crisis|food riots]] and even deadly stampedes.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The biggest fossil fuel input to agriculture is the use of natural gas as a hydrogen source for the [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch]] fertilizer-creation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/statistics/indicators/ind_reserves.asp Raw Material Reserves - International Fertilizer Industry Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas is used because it is the cheapest currently available source of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Integrated Crop Management-[[Iowa State University]] January 29, 2001 [http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/icm/2001/1-29-2001/natgasfert.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071126035318/http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-57/iss-12/p39.html &quot;The Hydrogen Economy&quot;], ''Physics Today'', December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; When oil production becomes so scarce that natural gas is used as a partial stopgap replacement, and hydrogen use in transportation increases, natural gas will [[supply and demand|become much more expensive]]. If the Haber Process is unable to be commercialized using renewable energy (such as by [[electrolysis]]) or if other sources of hydrogen are not available to replace the Haber Process, in amounts sufficient to supply transportation and agricultural needs, this major source of fertilizer would either become extremely expensive or unavailable. This would either cause food shortages or dramatic rises in food prices.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=== Mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages ===
In the event of a petroleum shortage (see [[peak oil]] for global concerns), [[organic agriculture]] can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some farmers using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Realities of organic farming&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;extension.agron.iastate.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeley1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;terradaily1&quot;/&gt; Organic farming may however be more [[labour (economics)|labor]]-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L. (2007). [http://www.cirsinc.org/Documents/Pub0207.1.PDF Conventional, Mixed, and &quot;Deregistered&quot; Organic Farmers: Entry Barriers and Reasons for Exiting Organic Production in California]. California Institute for Rural Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; The reconditioning of soil to restore nutrients lost during the use of [[monoculture]] agriculture techniques also takes time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Realities of organic farming&quot;&gt;[http://www.biotech-info.net/Alex_Avery.html Realities of organic farming]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;extension.agron.iastate.edu&quot;&gt;http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/researchreports/nk01ltar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeley1&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/~christos/articles/cv_organic_farming.html Organic Farming can Feed The World!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;terradaily1&quot;&gt;[http://www.terradaily.com/news/farm-05c.html Organic Farms Use Less Energy And Water]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the [[biochar]] and [[synfuel]] process, which uses agricultural ''waste'' to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel ''and'' food, instead of the normal [[food vs fuel]] debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsnz.org/topics/energy/ccmgmt.php#2 &quot;Carbon cycle management with increased photo-synthesis and long-term sinks&quot;], (2007) Royal Society of New Zealand. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Nathanael (December 2004). [http://www.bio.org/ind/GrowingEnergy.pdf How biofuels can help end America's energy dependence].&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that some [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic plants]] may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil-fuel-derived inputs than conventional crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and one of the most prominent members of the famous [[Huxley family]]. He spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death in 1963. Best known for his novels including ''[[Brave New World]]'' and a wide-ranging output of essays, Huxley also edited the magazine ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', and published short stories, poetry, travel writing, and film stories and scripts.

Aldous Huxley was a [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[pacifist]], and he was latterly interested in spiritual subjects such as [[parapsychology]] and philosophical [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;David King Dunaway (1998) [http://books.google.com/books?id=UFasAs0EHU8C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Aldous+Huxley++parapsychology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=puQOTY6JBITChAf5poy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aldous%20Huxley%20%20parapsychology&amp;f=false Aldous Huxley recollected: an oral history] p.90. Rowman Altamira, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He is also well known for advocating and taking [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]].

By the end of his life Huxley was considered, in some academic circles, a leader of modern thought and an intellectual of the highest rank, and highly regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thody|first=Philipe|year=1973|title=Huxley: A Biographical Introduction|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0289701880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
{{See also|Huxley family}}
[[File:Huxley-Arnold family tree.png|600px|right|Family tree]]

Aldous Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], Surrey, UK, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded Prior's Field School. Julia was the niece of educator [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphrey Ward]]. Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the zoologist, agnostic and controversialist (&quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot;). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding biologists. Huxley had another brother, Noel Trevelyan (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Charles Mason (1978) ''Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality'' p.5. Greewwood Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley began his learning in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, then continued in a school named Hillside. His teacher was his mother who supervised him for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside, he was educated at [[Eton College]]. Huxley's mother died in 1908, when he was 14. In 1911, he suffered an illness ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which &quot;left [him] practically blind for two to three years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|year=1939|chapter=biography and bibliography (appendix)|title=After Many A Summer Dies The Swan (1st Perennial Classic Ed.)|page=243|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldous's near-blindness disqualified him from service in the [[First World War]]. Once his eyesight recovered sufficiently, he was able to study English literature at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. In 1916 he edited ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' and later graduated with first class honours. His brother Julian wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. p22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following his education at Balliol, Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. He taught French for a year at Eton, where Eric Blair (later to become [[George Orwell]]) and [[Stephen Runciman]] were among his pupils, but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who couldn’t keep discipline. Nevertheless, Blair and others were impressed by his use of words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crick&quot;&gt;
{{Cite book|last = Crick|first = Bernard|title= George Orwell: A Life|year=1992|publisher= Penguin Books|location = London|isbn= 014014563X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short while in 1918, he was employed acquiring provisions at the [[Air Ministry]].

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time in the 1920s at the technologically-advanced [[Brunner Mond|Brunner and Mond]] chemical plant in [[Billingham]], Teesside, and the most recent introduction to his famous science fiction novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) states that this experience of &quot;an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence&quot; was one source for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Baggini, Julian (2009) ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22an+ordered+universe+in+a+world+of+planless+incoherence%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yRpLTMyVGcGjsQaCg41G&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22an%20ordered%20universe%20in%20a%20world%20of%20planless%20incoherence%22&amp;f=false Atheism, A Brief insight]'' Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s. His first published novels were social satires, beginning with ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921).

=== Bloomsbury set ===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Left to right: [[Bloomsbury Group]] members - [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]].]]
During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]], home of Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. Here he met several [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] figures including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Clive Bell]]. Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. In 1919 he married Maria Nys, a Belgian woman he met at Garsington; they had one son. The family lived in Italy part of the time in the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1933).

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'' Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F.M. Alexander|F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'',  and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley|date= |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The U.S. ===
In 1937, Huxley moved to [[Hollywood, California]], with his wife Maria, son Matthew, and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the U.S., mainly in southern [[California]], until his death, but also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). In this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilization agree that they want a world of &quot;liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love&quot;, they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it.

[[File:Aldous Huxley.gif|thumb|210px|Aldous Huxley in his youth]]
Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] (Veda-Centric Hinduism), meditation, and [[vegetarianism]] through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938 Huxley befriended [[J. Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu [[Swami]] [[Swami Prabhavananda|Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &quot;five senses&quot; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as &quot;Tarzana College&quot; in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley that year's [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p.103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period Huxley earned some Hollywood income as a writer. In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (1943 film)|Madame Curie]]'' which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (The film was eventually filmed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and stars.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1944 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944).

However, his experience in Hollywood was not a success. When he wrote a synopsis of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Walt Disney]] rejected it on the grounds that &quot;he could only understand every third word&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Huxleys p. 295&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last = Clark |first = Ronald William |title=The Huxleys |year=1968 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location = New York |page=295 |isbn = 0434135801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's leisurely development of ideas, it seemed, was not suitable for the movie moguls, who demanded fast, dynamic dialogue above all else. For Dick Huemer, during the 1940s, Huxley went to the first of a five meetings' session to elaborate the script of ''Alice in Wonderland'' but never came again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mouse Under Glass p82&quot;&gt;{{en}} David Koenig, ''Mouse Under Glass'', p.82&lt;/ref&gt; For author John Grant, although the movie's character the Caterpillar displays some characteristics familiar from Huxley's discussion of his experiments with [[hallucinogens]], Huxley's contribution to the movie is nonexistent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Animated Characters 233&quot;&gt;{{en}} John Grant, ''The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters'', p.233.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is&quot;. In his letter to Orwell, he predicted: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last = Huxley |first = Aldous |editor = Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location = London |isbn= 070111312X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Post World War II ===
After the Second World War, Huxley applied for United States citizenship. His application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the U.S. He claimed a philosophical, rather than a religious objection, and therefore was not exempt under the [[McCarran Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.charlestonvt.com/Holly/BCL/MCV%20Aldous%20Huxley/Originals/Derbyshire_WhatHappened.ORG.pdf|title=What Happened to Aldous Huxley?author=J Derbyshire|publisher=The New Criterion|date=2003|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, he withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the country, and in 1959 he turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957–1963)|Macmillan government]]. During the 1950s Huxley's interest in the field of [[psychical research]] grew keener, and his later works are strongly influenced by both mysticism and his experiences with psychedelic drugs.

In October 1930, the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] dined with Huxley in Berlin, and to this day rumours persist that Crowley introduced Huxley to [[peyote]] on that occasion. He was introduced to [[mescaline]] (considered to be the key active ingredient of peyote) by the psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas. Friday, 22 August 2008 &quot;Humphry Osmond, 86, Who Sought Medicinal Value in Psychedelic Drugs, Dies&quot;. New York: ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Through Dr. Osmond, Huxley met millionaire [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard]] who would deal with [[LSD]] on a wholesale basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stevens |first=Jay |title=Storming heaven: LSD and the American dream |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rKlGAdNUDAkC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Storming+heaven+Noonday+Sun#v=onepage&amp;q= |pages=47–64 |isbn=0802135872 |year=1998 |publisher=Grove Press |quote=All sorts of crazy things started happening... }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 December 1955, Huxley took his first dose of LSD. Indeed, Huxley was a pioneer of self-directed psychedelic drug use &quot;in a search for enlightenment&quot;, famously taking 100 micrograms of LSD as he lay dying. His psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (the title deriving from some lines in the book ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[William Blake]]), and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]''. Some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early [[hippies]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. While living in Los Angeles, Huxley was a friend of [[Ray Bradbury]]. According to Sam Weller's biography of Bradbury, the latter was dissatisfied with Huxley, especially after Huxley encouraged Bradbury to take psychedelic drugs.

== Association with Vedanta ==
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.

In 1944 Huxley wrote the introduction to the &quot;Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Isherwood|first1=Christopher|last2=Swami Prabhavananda|last3=Aldous|first3=Huxley|title=Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God|year=1987|publisher=Vedanta Press|location=Hollywood, Calif|isbn=978-0-87481-043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by Swami Prabhavanada and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 through 1960 Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the Society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''Knowledge and Understanding'' and ''Who Are We'' from 1955.

After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Huxley and the Swami disagreed about the meaning and importance of the LSD drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the Society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.

== Eyesight ==
With respect to details about the true quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life, there are differing accounts. Around 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates Method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Corbett]], who was able to teach him in the method. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano]], California, in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK). It was from this period, with the publication of the generally disputed theories contained in the latter book, that a growing degree of popular controversy arose over the subject of Huxley’s eyesight.

It was, and to a noticeable extent still is, widely held that, for most of his life, since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, that his eyesight was exceedingly poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford). For instance, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: &quot;Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;From Bennet Cerf’s column in ''The Saturday Review'', 12 April 1952, quoted in
{{Cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|authorlink = Martin Gardner|title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]|year=1957|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Archera Huxley]], would later emphasize in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': &quot;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight.&quot; Here, she portrays the accomplishment as both metaphorical and considerably physiological in nature, attributing that which she cites [[J. Krishnamurti]] as naming the spirit of &quot;freedom from the known&quot;, which she suggests that Huxley applied, non-exhaustively, in writing ''The Art of Seeing'' and utilizing the Bates Method. After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &quot;poor fellow who can hardly see&quot; by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempers this: &quot;Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Huxley|first = Laura|title=This Timeless Moment|year=1968|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |location = New York|isbn = 0890879680}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Huxley proceeds to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing''. &quot;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable.&quot; Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley’s eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary L.A.'' p.50. Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at Garsington, in 1919. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html &quot;Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84&quot;.] February 17, 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955, Maria died of breast cancer. 

In 1956 he married [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]] (1911–2007), also an author. She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a biography of Huxley. In 1960 Huxley himself was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer, and in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (novel)|Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969 ASIN B0006CDQZ8&lt;/ref&gt; and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; at the [[Esalen]] institute, which were fundamental to the forming of the [[Human Potential Movement]].

== Death ==
On his deathbed, unable to speak, Huxley made a written request to his wife for &quot;LSD, 100 µg, intramuscular&quot;. According to her account of his death&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html Account of Huxley's death on Letters of Note]&lt;/ref&gt; in ''This Timeless Moment'', she obliged with an injection at 11:45 am and another a couple of hours later. He died, aged 69, at 5:20 pm on 22 November 1963, several hours after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Huxley's ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] in Compton, a village near [[Guildford]], Surrey, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|8707127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of Huxley's passing was overshadowed by the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], on the same day, and the death of the Irish author [[C. S. Lewis]], who also died on 22 November. This coincidence was the inspiration for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, &amp; Aldous Huxley]]''. Huxley's literary legacy continues to be represented by the literary agency headed by [[Georges Borchardt]].

'''Algae''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|l|dʒ|iː}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|iː}}; singular ''alga'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə}}, [[Latin language|Latin]] for &quot;seaweed&quot;) are a large and diverse group of simple, typically [[autotrophic]] organisms, ranging from [[unicellular]] to [[multicellular]] forms, such as the [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelps]] that grow to 65 meters in length. They are [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] like [[plant]]s, and &quot;simple&quot; because their tissues are not organized into the many distinct organs found in [[embryophyte|land plants]].  The largest and most complex marine forms are called [[seaweed]]s.

Though the [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] [[cyanobacteria]] (commonly referred to as blue-green algae) were traditionally included as &quot;algae&quot; in older textbooks, many modern sources regard this as outdated&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroBot&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabors|first=Murray W.|year=2004|title=Introduction to Botany|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-8053-4416-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are now considered to be bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Guiry, M.D., John, D.M., Rindi, F and McCarthy, T.K. 2007. ''New Survey of Clare Island Volume 6: The Freshwater and Terrestrial Algae.'' Royal Irish Academy. {{ISBN-13|978-1-904890-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''algae'' is now restricted to [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allaby 92&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Allaby|first=M ed.|year=1992|encyclopedia=The Concise Dictionary of Botany|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|title=Algae}}&lt;/ref&gt; All true algae therefore have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane and [[plastid]]s bound in one or more membranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroBot&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Round 81&quot;&gt;Round (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Algae constitute a [[paraphyletic]] and [[polyphyletic]] group,&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroBot&quot;/&gt; as they do not include all the descendants of the [[last universal ancestor]] nor do they all descend from a common algal ancestor, although their plastids seem to have a single origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;keeling&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J.

Algae are found in the fossil record dating back to approximately 3 billion years in the [[Precambrian]]. They exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple, [[asexual]] cell division to complex forms of [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian National Musem of Natural History; Department of Botany. http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/introduction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as phyllids (leaves) and [[rhizoid]]s in nonvascular plants, or [[leaf|leaves]], [[root]]s, and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] that are found in [[tracheophyte]]s (vascular plants). Many are [[autotrophic|photoautotrophic]], although some groups contain members that are [[mixotrophic]], deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by [[osmotrophy]], [[myzocytosis|myzotrophy]], or [[phagocytosis|phagotrophy]]. Some unicellular [[species]] rely entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus.

Nearly all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the [[Cyanobacteria]], and so produce [[oxygen]] as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike other photosynthetic [[bacteria]] such as [[Purple sulfur bacteria|purple]] and [[green sulfur bacteria]]. Fossilized filamentous algae from the [[Vindhya]] basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|19416859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gmelin - Historia Fucorum (Titelblatt).png|thumb|left|190px|Title page of [[Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin]], ''Historia Fucorum'', dated 1768.]] The singular ''alga'' is the Latin word for a particular seaweed and retains that meaning in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=alga, algae|encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged with Seven Language Dictionary|volume=1|year=1986|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology]] is obscure. Although some speculate that it is related to Latin ''algēre'', &quot;be cold&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Eric|last=Partridge|title=algae|encyclopedia=Origins|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no known reason to associate seaweed with temperature. A more likely source is ''alliga'', &quot;binding, entwining.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=alga|first=Charlton T.|last=Lewis|coauthors=Charles Short|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1879|id=ISBN 0-19-864201-6|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?layout.reflang=la;layout.refdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059;layout.reflookup=Alga;layout.refcit=;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%231812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Algae has become a biological classification, alga can also mean one classification under Algae, parallel to a fungus being a species of fungi, a plant being a species of plant, and so on.

The [[ancient Greek]] word for seaweed was ''φῦκος'' (fūkos or phykos), which could mean either the seaweed, probably Red Algae, or a red dye derived from it. The Latinization, ''fūcus'', meant primarily the cosmetic rouge. The etymology is uncertain, but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical ''פוך'' (pūk), &quot;paint&quot; (if not that word itself), a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean. It could be any color: black, red, green, blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Biblica–A Dictionary of the Bible|first=Thomas Kelly|last= Cheyne|coauthors= John Sutherland Black|title=Paint|pages=3524–3525|volume=3|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan Co.|date=1899–1903}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=GccVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA3525&amp;dq=puk+paint&amp;lr=&amp;ei=Ye9RSYPEAYjcygSSyrW3BA#PPA2689,M1 Downloadable Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either [[phycology]] or algology. The name Fucus appears in a number of [[taxon|taxa]].The singular form is alga.

==Classification==
[[File:Gephyrocapsa oceanica color.jpg|thumb|300px|False-colour [[Scanning electron micrograph]] of the unicellular [[coccolithophore]], ''[[Gephyrocapsa]] oceanica''.]]
While ''[[Cyanobacteria]]'' have been traditionally included among the Algae, recent works usually exclude them due to large differences such as the lack of membrane-bound [[organelle]]s, the presence of a single circular [[chromosome]], the presence of [[peptidoglycan]] in the cell walls, and [[ribosome]]s different in size and content from those of the [[Eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name=BioRaven&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology|edition=8|last=Losos|first=Jonathan B.|coauthors=Mason, Kenneth A.; Singer, Susan R.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year= 2007|isbn=0-07-304110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jochemnet.de/fiu/bot4404/BOT4404_12.html|title=Botany 4404 Lecture Notes|first=Frank J|last=Jochem|publisher=Florida International University (FIU)|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than in [[chloroplast]]s, they conduct photosynthesis on specialized infolded cytoplasmic membranes called [[thylakoid membranes]]. Therefore, they differ significantly from the Algae despite occupying similar [[ecological niche]]s.

By modern definitions Algae are [[Eukaryotes]] and conduct photosynthesis within membrane-bound organelles called [[chloroplasts]]. Chloroplasts contain circular [[DNA]] and are similar in structure to Cyanobacteria, presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbionts]]. The exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among the different lines of Algae, reflecting different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of Algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain [[plastid]]s, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely. The singular form is alga.

* [[Chlorophyta]]
* [[Rhodophyta]]
* [[Glaucophyta]]
|Cyanobacteria
|These Algae have ''primary'' [[chloroplast]]s, i.e. the chloroplasts are surrounded by ''two membranes'' and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event. The chloroplasts of Red Algae have [[chlorophyll]]s ''a'' and ''c'' (often), and [[phycobilin]]s, while those of Green Algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b''. Higher plants are pigmented similarly to Green Algae and probably developed from them, and thus [[Chlorophyta]] is a sister [[taxon]] to the plants; sometimes they are grouped as [[Viridiplantae]].
|-
| [[Excavata]] and [[Rhizaria]]

|Green Algae
|
These groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRaven&quot;/&gt; Their chloroplasts are surrounded by ''four and three membranes'', respectively, and were probably retained from ingested Green Algae.

'''Chlorarachniophytes''', which belong to the phylum [[Cercozoa]], contain a small [[nucleomorph]], which is a [[relict]] of the algae's [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].

'''Euglenids''', which belong to the phylum [[Euglenozoa]], live primarily in freshwater and have chloroplasts with only three membranes. It has been suggested that the endosymbiotic Green Algae were acquired through [[myzocytosis]] rather than [[phagocytosis]].

* [[Heterokonts]]
* [[Haptophyta]]
* [[Cryptomonad]]s
* [[Dinoflagellates]]
|Red Algae
|
These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'', and phycobilins.The shape varies from plant to plant. they may be of discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped. They have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch. The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts, but genetic similarities with the Red Algae suggest a relationship there{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

In the first three of these groups ('''Chromista'''), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a [[nucleomorph]] in [[Cryptomonad]]s, and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor, although other evidence casts doubt on whether the [[Heterokonts]], [[Haptophyta]], and [[Cryptomonad]]s are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;parfrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Evaluating Support for the Current Classification of Eukaryotic Diversity | author = Laura Wegener Parfrey, Erika Barbero, Elyse Lasser, Micah Dunthorn, Debashish Bhattacharya, David J Patterson, and Laura A Katz | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020220 | journal = PLoS Genet. |date=December 2006| volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e220 | pmid = 17194223 | pmc = 1713255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burki F, Shalchian-Tabrizi K, Minge M, Skjæveland Å, Nikolaev SI, et al. | year = 2007 | title = Phylogenomics Reshuffles the Eukaryotic Supergroups | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 8: e790 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000790 | pages = e790 | pmid = 17726520 | pmc = 1949142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W.H.Harvey]] (1811—1866) was the first to divide the Algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation. This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics. Harvey's four divisions are: Red Algae (Rhodophyta), Brown Algae (Heteromontophyta), Green Algae (Chlorophyta) and Diatomaceae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon 73&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=P S|year=1973|title=Biology of the Rhodophyta|publisher=Oliver &amp; Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-05-002485-X|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to higher plants==
The first plants on earth evolved from shallow freshwater algae much like ''Chara'' some 400 million years ago. These probably had an isomorphic [[alternation of generations]] and were probably filamentous. Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = When plants conquered land | author = Ivan Noble | date = 18 September 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3117034.stm | publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellman2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Most of the simpler algae are [[unicellular]] [[flagellate]]s or [[amoeboid]]s, but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a species, are
* ''Colonial'': small, regular groups of motile cells
* ''Capsoid'': individual non-motile cells embedded in [[mucilage]]
* ''Coccoid'': individual non-motile cells with cell walls
* ''Palmelloid'': non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
* ''Filamentous'': a string of non-motile cells connected together, sometimes branching
* ''Parenchymatous'': cells forming a [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] with partial differentiation of tissues

The point where these non-algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other alga groups.

==Symbiotic algae==
Some species of algae form [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with other organisms. In these [[symbioses]], the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae. Examples are as follows.

===Lichens===
{{Main|Lichens}}
[[File:Lichens near Clogher Head (stevefe).jpg|thumb|left|Rock lichens in Ireland.]]''[[Lichen]]s'' are defined by the [[International Association for Lichenology]] to be &quot;an association of a [[fungus]] and a photosynthetic [[symbiont]] resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lichens of North America|first=Irwin M|last=Brodo|first2=Sylvia Duran|last2=Sharnoff|first3=Stephen|last3=Sharnoff|first4=Susan|last4= Laurie-Bourque|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|location=New Haven|isbn= 978-0-300-08249-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi, or mycobionts, are from the [[Ascomycota]] with a few from the [[Basidiomycota]]. They are not found alone in nature but when they began to associate is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Diversity and Evolution of Plants|first=Lorentz C|last=Pearson|publisher=CRC Press|year=1995|isbn= 978-0-8493-2483-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species, rarely two, from the [[Green Algae]], except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with the same species of [[Cyanobacteria]] (hence &quot;photobiont&quot; is the more accurate term). A photobiont may be associated with many specific mycobionts or live independently; accordingly, lichens are named and classified as fungal species.&lt;ref&gt;Brodo et al. (2001), page 6: &quot;A species of lichen collected anywhere in its range has the same lichen-forming fungus and, generally, the same photobiont. (A particular photobiont, on the other hand, may associate with scores of different lichen fungi).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated). It is possible that the photobiont triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont.&lt;ref&gt;Brodo et al. (2001), page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coral reefs===
{{Main|Coral|Coral reef|Zooxanthella}}
[[File:Coral Reef.jpg|thumb|left|Floridian coral reef]] [[Coral reef]]s are accumulated from the [[calcareous]] [[exoskeleton]]s of [[marine invertebrate]]s of the [[Scleractinia]] order; i.e., the Stony [[Coral]]s. As [[Animal#Food and energy sourcing|animals]] they [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[Sugar#Chemistry|sugar]] and [[oxygen]] to obtain [[energy]] for their cell-building processes, including [[secretion]] of the exoskeleton, with [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]] as byproducts. As the reef is the result of a favorable equilibrium between construction by the corals and destruction by marine [[erosion]], the rate at which metabolism can proceed determines the growth or deterioration of the reef.

Algae of the [[Dinoflagellate]] phylum are often [[endosymbiont]]s in the cells of marine invertebrates, where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through [[photosynthesis]] using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced in the host. Endosymbiont algae in the Stony Corals are described by the term [[zooxanthella]]e, with the host Stony Corals called on that account [[hermatypic coral]]s, which although not a [[taxon]] are not in healthy condition without their endosymbionts. Zooxanthellae belong almost entirely to the genus ''Symbiodinium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|contribution=The coral-algal symbiosis|first=Dennis L|last=Taylor|title=Algal Symbiosis: A Continuum of Interaction Strategies|editor-first=Lynda J|editor-last=Goff|publisher=CUP Archive|year=1983|pages=19–20|isbn= 978-0-521-25541-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of ''Symbiodinium'' from the host is known as [[coral bleaching]], a condition which unless corrected leads to the deterioration and loss of the reef.

===Sea sponges===
{{Main|Sea sponge}}
Green Algae live close to the surface of some sponges, for example, breadcrumb sponge (''[[Halichondria panicea]]''). The alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species.&lt;ref&gt;http://uwsp.edu/cnr/UWEXlakes/laketides/vol26-4/vol26-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life-cycle==
[[Rhodophyta]], [[Chlorophyta]] and [[Heterokontophyta]], the three main algal [[phylum|Phyla]], have life-cycles which show tremendous variation with considerable complexity. In general there is an asexual phase where the seaweed's cells are [[diploid]], a sexual phase where the cells are [[haploid]] followed by fusion of the male and female [[gametes]]. Asexual reproduction is advantageous in that it permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Sexual reproduction allows more variation, but is more costly. Often there is no strict alternation between the sporophyte and also because there is often an asexual phase, which could include the fragmentation of the thallus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lobban and Harrison 94&quot;&gt;Lobban, C S and Harrison, P J (1997) ''Seaweed Ecology and Physiology.''

==Numbers==
[[Image:Taiwan 2009 East Coast ShihTiPing Giant Stone Steps Algae FRD 6581.jpg|thumb|Algae on coastal rocks at [[:zh:石梯坪|Shihtiping]] in [[Taiwan]]]]

The ''Algal Collection of the U.S. National Herbarium'' (located in the [[National Museum of Natural History]]) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens, which, although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists), gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algae Herbarium|publisher=National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|year=2008|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary widely. For example, according to one standard textbook,&lt;ref name=&quot;John 02&quot;&gt;John (2002), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; in the British Isles the ''UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report'' estimated there to be 20000 algal species in the UK. Another checklist reports only about 5000 species. Regarding the difference of about 15000 species, the text concludes: &quot;It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species ....&quot;

Regional and group estimates have been made as well: 5000—5500 species of Red Algae worldwide, &quot;some 1300 in Australian Seas,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huisman 00&quot;&gt;Huisman (2000), page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; 400 seaweed species for the western coastline of South [[Africa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Stegenga 97&quot;&gt;Stegenga (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; 669 marine species from California (U.S.A.),&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott and Hollenberg 76&quot;&gt;Abbott and Hollenberg (1976), page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 642 in the check-list of Britain and Ireland,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy nad Guiry 06&quot;&gt;Hardy and Guiry (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and so on, but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources, these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above. Most estimates also omit the microscopic Algae, such as the [[phytoplankton|phytoplankta]], entirely.

==Distribution==
The topic of distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of [[phytogeography]] in the mid-19th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), Chapter 8, Dispersal, continuity and phytogeography.&lt;/ref&gt; Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of [[spore]]s analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores. Spores are everywhere in all parts of the Earth: the waters fresh and marine, the atmosphere, free-floating and in precipitation or mixed with dust, the [[humus]] and in other organisms, such as humans. Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions of where the spore lands.

The spores of fresh-water Algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of water into which they are transported are chemically selective. Marine spores are spread by currents. Ocean water is temperature selective, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions and provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

To some degree the distribution of Algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as [[Antarctica]], long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as &quot;Pacific Algae&quot; or &quot;North Sea Algae&quot;. When they occur out of their localities, it is usually possible to hypothesize a transport mechanism, such as the hulls of ships. For example, ''Ulva reticulata'' and ''Ulva fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to [[Hawaii]] in this manner.

Mapping is possible for select species only: &quot;there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), Page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 371.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the &quot;difficulties of undertaking such studies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
[[File:Phytoplankton Lake Chuzenji.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Phytoplankton, [[Lake Chuzenji]]]]Algae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments, such as [[Snow algae|on snow]] and [[Ice algae|on ice]]. Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters, under {{convert|100|m|ft|abbre=on}}; however some have been recorded to a depth of {{convert|360|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column ([[phytoplankton]]) provide the food base for most marine [[food chain]]s. In very high densities ([[algal bloom]]s) these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or asphyxiate other life forms.

Algae are variously sensitive to different factors, which has made them useful as biological indicators in the [[Ballantine Scale]] and its modification.

To be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from (local) policy on the long run, biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels. Here, algae based fuels hold great promise, directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass. The break-even point for algae-based biofuels should be within reach in about ten to fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Barbosa &amp; Wijffels&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertilizer===

{{Details|Seaweed fertiliser}}
For centuries seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; [[George Owen of Henllys]] writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in [[South Wales]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England|volume=10|pages=142–143|title=On the Farming of South Wales: Prize Report|first=Clare Sewell|last=Read|authorlink=Clare Sewell Read|year=1849|location=London|publisher=John Murray}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=UJYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22this+kind+of+ore+they+often+gather%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPR4,M1 Downloadable Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes, where it heteth and rotteth, and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land, as they do their muck, and thereof springeth good corn, especially barley ... After spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea, they fetch it in sacks on horse backes, and carie the same three, four, or five miles, and cast it on the lande, which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today Algae are used by humans in many ways; for example, as [[fertilizer]]s, [[soil conditioner]]s and livestock feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Seaweed Industry: FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 441|first=Dennis J.|last=McHugh|location=Rome|year=2003|publisher=Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations|isbn=9251049580, ISBN 0499345|chapter=9, Other Uses of Seaweeds|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y4765E/y4765e0c.htm#TopOfPage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds. [[Algaculture]] on a large scale is an important type of [[aquaculture]] in some places. [[Maerl]] is commonly used as a soil conditioner.

Naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food, especially in Asia. They provide many vitamins including: A, [[Thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[niacin]] and [[Vitamin C|C]], and are rich in [[iodine]], [[potassium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry|first=Frederick J|last=Simoons|publisher=CRC Press|year=1991|isbn=0-936923-29-6|chapter=6, Seaweeds and Other Algae|pages=179–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition commercially cultivated [[Microphyte|microalgae]], including both Algae and [[Cyanobacteria]], are marketed as nutritional supplements, such as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm|work=Ethnobotanical Leaflets|title=Modern Uses of Cultivated Algae|publisher=Southern Illinois University Carbondale|first=Steve L|last=Morton|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chlorella]] and the Vitamin-C supplement, [[Dunaliella]], high in [[beta-carotene]].

===Pollution control===
* Sewage can be treated with algae, reducing the need for greater amounts of toxic chemicals than are already used.
* Algae can be used to capture [[fertilizers]] in runoff from farms. When subsequently harvested, the enriched algae itself can be used as fertilizer.
* Aquariums and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an [[Algae scrubber]], also known as an &quot;ATS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reefbase.org/resource_center/publication/main.aspx?refid=10859 Nutrient Cycling In The Great Barrier Reef Aquarium. Proceedings of the 6th International Coral Reef Symposium, Australia, 1988, Vol. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=NogyAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=U.S.+Patent+4333263 U.S. Patent 4333263, Issue Date June 8, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydromentia.com/Products-Services/Algal-Turf-Scrubber/Product-Documentation/Assets/ATS-Technical-Brochure.pdf Hydromentia Water Treatment Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120083425/abstract Algal Response To Nutrient Enrichment In Forested Oligotrophic Stream.

[[Agricultural Research Service]] scientists found that 60-90% of nitrogen runoff and 70-100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from [[manure effluents]] using an [[algal turf scrubber]] (ATS). Scientists developed the ATS, which are shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. The enriched algae itself also can be used as a fertilizer. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 --&gt;
In [[statistics]], '''analysis of variance (ANOVA)''' is a collection of [[statistical model]]s, and their associated procedures, in which the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form ANOVA provides a [[statistical test]] of whether or not the [[mean]]s of several groups are all equal, and therefore generalizes [[Student's t-test#Independent two-sample t-test|''t''-test]] to more than two groups.  ANOVAs are helpful because they possess an advantage over a two-sample t-test.  Doing multiple two-sample t-tests would result in an increased chance of committing a [[type I error]].  For this reason, ANOVAs are useful in comparing two, three or more means.

==Overview==
There are three classes of ANOVA models:
#[[Fixed-effects model]]s assume that the data came from [[normal distribution|normal populations]] which may differ only in their means. (Model 1)
#[[Random effects model]]s assume that the data describe a hierarchy of different populations whose differences are constrained by the hierarchy. (Model 2)
#Mixed-effect models describe the situations where both fixed and random effects are present. (Model 3)

==Models==
===Fixed-effects models (Model 1)===
{{Main|Fixed effects model}}
The fixed-effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see if the [[response variable]] values change. This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole.

===Random-effects models (Model 2)===
{{Main|Random effects model}}
Random effects models are used when the treatments are not fixed. This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population. Because the levels themselves are [[random variables]], some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments differ from ANOVA model 1.

Most random-effects or mixed-effects models are not concerned with making inferences concerning the particular sampled factors. For example, consider a large manufacturing plant in which many machines  produce the same product. The statistician studying this plant would have very little interest in comparing the three particular machines to each other. Rather, inferences that can be made for ''all'' machines are of interest, such as their variability and the mean. However, if one is interested in the realized value of the random effect [[best linear unbiased prediction]] can be used to obtain a &quot;prediction&quot; for the value.

==Assumptions of ANOVA==
The analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches, the most common of which use a [[linear model]] that relates the response to the treatments and blocks. Even when the [[statistical model]] is [[nonlinear regression|nonlinear]], it can be approximated by a linear model for which an analysis of variance may be appropriate.

===A model often presented in textbooks===
Many textbooks present the analysis of variance in terms of a [[linear model]], which makes the following assumptions about the [[probability distribution]] of the responses:
* [[Statistical independence|Independence]] of cases &amp;ndash; this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis.
* [[normal distribution|Normality]] &amp;ndash; the distributions of the residuals are [[Normal distribution|normal]].
* Equality (or &quot;homogeneity&quot;) of variances, called [[homoscedasticity]] &amp;mdash; the variance of data in groups should be the same. Model-based approaches usually assume that the variance is constant. The constant-variance property also appears in the randomization (design-based) analysis of randomized experiments, where it is a necessary [[logical consequence|consequence]] of the randomized design and the assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'' (Hinkelmann and Kempthorne 2008): If the responses of a randomized balanced experiment fail to have constant variance, then &lt;!-- by [[contraposition]] --&gt; the assumption of  ''unit treatment additivity'' is necessarily violated.

To test the hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect, the [[F-test]]'s p-values closely approximate the [[permutation test]]'s p-values: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced (Hinkelmann and Kempthorne 2008). Such [[permutation test]]s characterize [[uniformly most powerful test|tests with maximum power]] against all [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], as observed by Rosenbaum (Rosenbaum 2002, page 40).&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum cites Section 5.7, Theorem 2.3 of [[Erich Leo Lehmann|Lehmann]]'s ''Testing Statistical Hypotheses'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; The anova F–test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions (Moore and McCabe).&lt;ref&gt;Non-statisticians may be confused because another F-test is nonrobust: When used to test the equality of the variances of two populations, the [[F-test]] is unreliable if there are deviations from normality (Lindman, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kruskal&amp;ndash;Wallis test]] is a [[nonparametric]] alternative that does not rely on an assumption of normality. And the [[Friedman test]] is the [[nonparametric]] alternative for a one-way repeated measures ANOVA.

The separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]] are independently, identically, and normally distributed for fixed effects models, that is, that the errors are independent and

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2).\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Randomization-based analysis===
{{See also|Random assignment|Randomization test}}
In a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled experiment]], the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units, following the experimental protocol. This randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out. The objective random-assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis, following the ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher]]. This design-based analysis was discussed and developed by [[Francis J. Anscombe]] at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] and by [[Oscar Kempthorne]] at [[Iowa State University]] (Anscombe 1948). Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'', which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and [[David R. Cox]].

====Unit-treatment additivity====

In its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity states that the observed response &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; from experimental unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; when receiving treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the sum of the unit's response &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and the treatment-effect &lt;math&gt; t_j&lt;/math&gt;, that is
: &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}=y_i+t_j&lt;/math&gt; (Kempthorne and Cox, Chapter 2; Hinkelmann and Kempthorne 2008, Chapters 5-6).
The assumption of unit-treatment addivity implies that, for every treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th treatment have  exactly the same effect &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; on every experiment unit.

The assumption of unit treatment additivity  usually cannot be directly [[falsificationism|falsified]], according to Cox and Kempthorne. However, many ''consequences'' of treatment-unit additivity can be falsified. For a randomized experiment, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity ''implies'' that the variance is constant for all treatments. Therefore, by [[contraposition]], a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.

The property of unit-treatment additivity is not invariant under a &quot;change of scale&quot;, so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity. If the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions, then the statistician may specify (in the protocol for the experiment or observational study) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance (Hinkelmann and Kempthorne 2008, Chapter 7 or 8). Also, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses, which are believed to follow a multiplicative model (Cox, Chapter 2; Bailey 2008). 

According to Cauchy's [[functional equation]] theorem, the [[logarithm]] is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition.

The assumption of unit-treatment additivity was enunciated in experimental design by Kempthorne and Cox. Kempthorne's use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population [[survey sampling]].

====Derived linear model====
Kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'' to produce a ''derived linear model'', very similar to the textbook model discussed previously.

The test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model, according to approximation theorems and simulation studies by Kempthorne and his students (Hinkelmann and Kempthorne 2008). However, there are differences. For example, the randomization-based analysis results in a small but (strictly) negative correlation between the observations (Hinkelmann and Kempthorne 2008, volume one, chapter 7; Bailey chapter 1.14). In the randomization-based analysis, there is ''no assumption'' of a ''normal'' distribution and certainly ''no assumption'' of ''independence''. On the contrary, ''the observations are dependent''!

The randomization-based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time. &lt;!-- See [[John Nelder]]'s expression of pity for Kempthorne's poor students! --&gt; Since the randomization-based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model, most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach. Few statisticians object to model-based analysis of balanced randomized experiments.

====Statistical models for observational data====

However, when applied to data from non-randomized experiments or observational studies, model-based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization. For observational data, the derivation of confidence intervals must use ''subjective'' models, as emphasized by [[Ronald A. Fisher]] and his followers. In practice, the estimates of treatment-effects from observational studies  generally are often inconsistent.  In practice, &quot;statistical models&quot; and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public (Freedman).

==Logic of ANOVA==
===Partitioning of the sum of squares===
The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total [[sum of squares (statistics)|sum of squares]] S into components related to the effects used in the model. For example, we show the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels.

: &lt;math&gt;S_{\hbox{Total}} = S_{\hbox{Error}} + S_{\hbox{Treatments}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

So, the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] f can be partitioned in a similar way and specifies the [[chi-square distribution]] which describes the associated sums of squares.

: &lt;math&gt;\text{f}_{\hbox{Total}} = \text{f}_{\hbox{Error}} + \text{f}_{\hbox{Treatments}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Lack-of-fit sum of squares]].

===The F-test===
{{Main|F-test}}
The [[F-test]] is used for comparisons of the components of the total deviation. For example, in one-way, or single-factor ANOVA, statistical significance is tested for by comparing the F test statistic

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\text{variance between items}}{\text{variance within items}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F^* = \frac{\text{MSTR}}{\text{MSE}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\text{MSTR} = \frac{\text{SSTR}}{I-1},&lt;/math&gt; ''I''  = number of treatments

and

:&lt;math&gt;\text{MSE} = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n_T-I},&lt;/math&gt; ''n&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' = total number of cases

to the [[F-distribution]] with ''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,''n''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''I''  degrees of freedom. Using the [[F-distribution]] is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled [[chi-square distribution]].

==Power analysis==
[[Statistical power|Power analysis]] is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and alpha level. Power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.

==Effect size==
{{Main|Effect size}}

Several standardized measures of effect gauge the strength of the association between a predictor (or set of predictors) and the dependent variable. Effect-size estimates facilitate the comparison of findings in studies and across disciplines. Common effect size estimates reported in univariate-response anova and multivariate-response manova include the following: eta-squared, partial eta-squared, omega, and intercorrelation.

'''η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' ( ''eta-squared'' ):
Eta-squared describes the ratio of variance explained in the dependent variable by a predictor while controlling for other predictors. Eta-squared is a biased estimator of the variance explained by the model in the population (it estimates only the effect size in the sample). On average it overestimates the variance explained in the population. As the sample size gets larger the amount of bias gets smaller.
: &lt;math&gt; \eta ^2 = \frac{S_\text{treatment}}{S_\text{total}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Partial η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' (''Partial eta-squared''):
Partial eta-squared describes the &quot;proportion of total variation attributable to the factor, partialling out (excluding) other factors from the total nonerror variation&quot; (Pierce, Block &amp; Aguinis, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;918). Partial eta squared is often higher than eta squared.
: &lt;math&gt; \text{Partial } \eta^2 = \frac{S_\text{treatment}}{S_\text{treatment}+S_\text{error}} &lt;/math&gt;

Cohen (1992) suggests effect sizes for various indexes, including ƒ (where 0.1 is a small effect, 0.25 is a medium effect and 0.4 is a large effect). He also offers a conversion table (see Cohen, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;283) for eta squared (η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) where 0.0099 constitutes a small effect, 0.0588 a medium effect and 0.1379 a large effect. Though, considering that η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are comparable to r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; when df of the numerator equals 1 (both measures proportion of variance accounted for), these guidelines may overestimate the size of the effect. If going by the r guidelines (0.1 is a small effect, 0.3 a medium effect and 0.5 a large effect) then the equivalent guidelines for eta-squared would be the squareroot of these, i.e. 01 is a small effect, 0.09 a medium effect and 0.25 a large effect, and these should also be applicable to eta-squared. When the df of the numerator exceeds 1, eta-squared is comparable to R-squared (Levine &amp; Hullett, 2002).

'''Omega&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' ( ''omega-squared'' ):
An estimator of the variance explained in the population is omega-squared (see Bortz, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;269f.; Bühner &amp; Ziegler, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;413f.; Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;55):
: &lt;math&gt;{\hat\omega}^2 = \frac{S_\text{treatment}-df_\text{treatment} * MS_\text{error}}{S_\text{total} + MS_\text{error}}&lt;/math&gt;

This form of the formula is limited to between-subjects analysis with equal sample sizes in all cells (Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;55).

&lt;!-- '''Omega Squared '''
Omega squared provides a relatively unbiased estimate of the variance explained in the population by a predictor variable. It takes random error into account more so than eta squared, which is biased upwards. The calculations for omega squared differ depending on the experimental design. For a fixed experimental design (in which the categories are explicitly set), omega squared is calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uccs.edu/lbecker/SPSS/glm_effectsize.htm#Omega%20squared,%20w2]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\hat\omega}^2 = \frac{S_\text{treatments}-f_\text{treatments}MS_\text{error}}{S_\text{total} + MS_\text{error}}&lt;/math&gt; THIS STUFF lacks a reliable reference and was so (e.g. &quot;incredibly&quot;) sloppily written that was hid. --&gt;

'''Cohen's ''ƒ'''''
This measure of effect size represents the square root of variance explained over variance not explained.

==Follow up tests==
A statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often followed up with one or more different follow-up tests. This can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses.
Follow up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned ([[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]) or [[Post-hoc analysis|post hoc]]. Planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data.
Post hoc tests such as [[Tukey's range test]] most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for Type I errors.
Comparisons, which are most commonly planned, can be either simple or compound. Simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean. Compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups (e.g., compare average group means of group A, B and C with group D). Comparisons can also look at tests of trend, such as linear and quadratic relationships, when the independent variable involves ordered levels.

==Study designs and anovas==

There are several types of ANOVA. Many statisticians base ANOVA on the [[experimental design|design of the experiment]], especially on the protocol that specifies the [[random assignment]] of treatments to subjects; the protocol's description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]]. It is also common to apply ANOVA to observational data using an appropriate statistical model. 

Some popular designs use the following types of ANOVA:
*[[One-way ANOVA]] is used to test for differences among two or more [[statistical independence|independent]] groups. Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a [[t-test]] (Gosset, 1908). When there are only two means to compare, the [[t-test]] and the ANOVA [[F-test]] are equivalent; the relation between ANOVA and ''t'' is given by ''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*[[Factorial experiment|Factorial]] ANOVA is used when the experimenter wants to study the interaction effects among the treatments.
*[[Repeated measures]] ANOVA is used when the same subjects are used for each treatment (e.g., in a [[longitudinal study]]).
*[[Multivariate analysis of variance]] (MANOVA) is used when there is more than one [[dependent variable|response variable]].

==History==

The analysis of variance was used informally by researchers in the 1800s using least squares.{{Reference necessary|date=November 2010}} In physics and psychology, researchers included a term for the operator-effect, the influence of a particular person on measurements, according to Stephen Stigler's histories.{{Reference necessary|date=November 2010}}

Sir Ronald Fisher proposed a formal analysis of [[variance]] in a 1918 article [[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]].  His first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921.  Analysis of variance became widely known after being included in Fisher's 1925 book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]''.

[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of [[methane]], the simplest alkane]]

'''Alkanes''' (also known as [[paraffin]]s or '''saturated hydrocarbons''') are [[chemical compound]]s that consist only of the [[Chemical element|elements]] [[carbon]] (C) and [[hydrogen]] (H) (i.e., [[hydrocarbon]]s), wherein these atoms are linked together exclusively by [[single bond]]s (i.e., they are [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated compounds]])&lt;!-- CONFLICT WITH SECTION BELOW *Cyclic alkanes*: without any [[Cyclic compound|cyclic structure]] (i.e. loops)--&gt;. Alkanes belong to a [[homologous series]] of organic compounds in which the members differ by a constant relative [[molecular mass]] of 14.

Each carbon atom must have 4 bonds (either [[C-H bond|C-H]] or [[C-C bond]]s), and each hydrogen atom must be joined to a carbon atom (H-C bonds). A series of linked carbon atoms is known as the [[skeletal formula|carbon skeleton]] or carbon backbone. In general, the number of carbon atoms is often used to define the size of the alkane (e.g., C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-alkane).

An Alkyl group, generally abbreviated with the symbol R, is a [[functional group]] or side-chain that, like an alkane, consists solely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms, for example a [[methyl]] or [[ethyl group]].

The simplest possible alkane (the parent molecule) is [[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. There is no limit to the number of carbon atoms that can be linked together, the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic, is [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]], and is a [[hydrocarbon]]. Saturated [[oils]] and [[waxes]] are examples of larger alkanes where the number of carbons in the carbon backbone tends to be greater than 10.

Alkanes are not very reactive and have little [[biological activity]]. Alkanes can be viewed as a molecular tree upon which can be hung the interesting biologically active/reactive portions ([[functional groups]]) of the molecule.

==Structure classification==

Saturated hydrocarbons can be:
* linear (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}}) wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snake-like structure
* branched (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}}, ''n'' &gt; 3) wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions
* [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]] (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''}}, ''n'' &gt; 2) wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop.

According to the definition by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called [[cycloalkane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title=alkanes | file = A00222 | date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures, and they are still alkanes (no general formula) as long as they are [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] (i.e., having no loops).

==Isomerism==
[[Image:Saturated C4 hydrocarbons ball-and-stick.png|thumb|right| Different C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-alkanes and -cycloalkanes (left to right): [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]] are the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; isomers; [[cyclobutane]] and [[methylcyclopropane]] are the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; isomers.&lt;br /&gt; Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane is the only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compound and has no isomer; [[tetrahedrane]] (not shown) is the only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compound and has also no isomer.]]

Alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in numerous different ways, forming different [[structural isomer]]s. An isomer is like a chemical [[anagram]], in which the atoms of a [[chemical compound]] are arranged or joined together in a different order. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the ''n''-isomer (''n'' for &quot;normal&quot;, although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms {{OEIS|id=A000602}}. For example:
* C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: no isomers: [[methane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: no isomers: [[ethane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: no isomers: [[propane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: 2 isomers: [[n-butane|''n''-butane]], [[isobutane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;: 3 isomers: [[pentane]], [[isopentane]], [[neopentane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 isomers: [[hexane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;: 355 isomers
* C&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;: 27,711,253,769 isomers
* C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;: 22,158,734,535,770,411,074,184 isomers, many of which are not stable.

Branched alkanes can be chiral: [[3-methylhexane]] and its higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]] are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] due to their [[stereogenic center]] at carbon atom number 3. Chiral alkanes are of certain importance in biochemistry, as they occur as sidechains in [[chlorophyll]] and [[tocopherol]] ([[vitamin E]]). Chiral alkanes can be resolved into their [[enantiomers]] by enantioselective [[chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.springer.com/chemistry/organic/book/978-3-540-76885-2 | accessdate = 18 October 2008 | author = [[Uwe Meierhenrich|Meierhenrich, U.]] | title = Amino Acids and the Asymmetry of Life | year = 2008 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-3-540-76885-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called [[cycloalkane]]s.

==Nomenclature==
{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}
The [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Alkanes|IUPAC nomenclature]] (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains. Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix &quot;-ane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_184.htm | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | chapter = R-2.2.1: Hydrocarbons | author = IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry | title = A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (Recommendations 1993) | year = 1993 | publisher = Blackwell Scientific | isbn = 0632034882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the [[hydrocarbons]]. The first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds; &quot;-one&quot; represents a [[ketone]]; &quot;-ol&quot; represents an alcohol or OH group; &quot;-oxy-&quot; means an [[ether]] and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxy-methane is the IUPAC name for dimethyl ether.

It is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one IUPAC name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible, so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group; &quot;1-&quot; is implied in nitro-octane. Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.

===Linear alkanes===
Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix ''n-'' (for ''normal'') where a non-linear [[isomer]] exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g., [[hexane|''n''-hexane]] or 2- or 3-methylpentane.

The members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
:[[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; - one carbon and four hydrogen
:[[ethane]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; - two carbon and six hydrogen
:[[propane]], C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; - three carbon and 8 hydrogen
:[[butane]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; - four carbon and 10 hydrogen
:[[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; - five carbon and 12 hydrogen
:[[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; - six carbon and 14 hydrogen

These names were [[back-formation|derived]] from [[methanol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[propionic acid]] and [[butyric acid]], respectively. Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the [[Affix|suffix]] '''-ane''' to the appropriate [[IUPAC numerical multiplier|numerical multiplier]] prefix&lt;ref name = reusch-nom&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Nomenclature - Alkanes | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomen1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with elision of any terminal vowel (''-a'' or ''-o'') from the basic numerical term. Hence, [[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;; [[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;; [[heptane]], C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;; [[octane]], C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, with the exceptions of nonane which has a [[Latin language|Latin]] prefix, and undecane and tridecane which have mixed-language prefixes. For a more complete list, see [[List of alkanes]].

===Branched alkanes===
[[Image:Isopentane-numbered-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of [[isopentane]] (common name) or 2-methylbutane (IUPAC systematic name)]]
Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example [[pentane|''n''-pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]].

IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.

The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Examples of the IUPAC Rules in Practice | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomexmp1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms
* Name this longest root chain using standard naming rules
* Name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from &quot;-ane&quot; to &quot;-yl&quot;
* Number the root chain so that sum of the numbers assigned to each side group will be as low as possible
* Number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain
* If there are multiple side chains of the same type, use prefixes such as &quot;di-&quot; and &quot;tri-&quot; to indicate it as such, and number each one.
* Add side chain names in alphabetical (disregarding &quot;di-&quot; etc. prefixes) order in front of the name of the root chain

===Cyclic alkanes===
{{Main|Cycloalkane}}

So-called cyclic alkanes are, in the technical sense, ''not'' alkanes, but cycloalkanes. They are hydrocarbons just like alkanes, but contain one or more rings.

Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix &quot;cyclo-&quot; to distinguish them from alkanes. Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms, e.g., [[cyclopentane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like [[pentane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, [[propane]] and [[cyclopropane]], [[butane]] and [[cyclobutane]], etc.

Substituted cycloalkanes are named similar to substituted alkanes — the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules]].&lt;ref name=reusch-nom/&gt;

===Trivial names===
The trivial (non-[[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic]]) name for alkanes is &quot;[[paraffin]]s.&quot; Together, alkanes are known as the ''paraffin series''. Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.

It is almost certain that the term [[paraffin]] stems from the petrochemical industry. Branched-chain alkanes are called ''[[isoparaffins]]''. The use of the term &quot;paraffin&quot; is a general term and often does not distinguish between a pure compounds and mixtures of [[isomers]] with the same [[chemical formula]] (i.e., like a chemical [[anagram]]), e.g., [[pentane]] and [[isopentane]].

;Examples
The following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system:
* [[isobutane]] for 2-methylpropane
* [[isopentane]] for 2-methylbutane
* [[neopentane]] for 2,2-dimethylpropane.

===Boiling point===
[[Image:Alkanschmelzundsiedepunkt.png|right|thumb|300px|Melting (blue) and boiling (pink) points of the first 14 ''n''-alkanes in °C.]]

Alkanes experience inter-molecular [[van der Waals force]]s. Stronger inter-molecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes.&lt;ref name=m&amp;b&gt;{{cite book|title = Organic Chemistry | author = R. T. Morrison, R. N. Boyd | isbn = 0-13-643669-2 | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = New Jersey | edition = 6th|year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces:
* the number of electrons surrounding the molecule, which increases with the alkane's molecular weight
* the surface area of the molecule

Under [[standard conditions]], from CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes are gaseous; from C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; they are liquids; and after C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt; they are solids. As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size ([[molecular weight]]) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20 - 30 °C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt;

A straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare [[isobutane]] (2-methylpropane) and [[n-butane]] (butane), which boil at -12 and 0 °C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 °C, respectively.&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt; For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can &quot;lock&quot; into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.

On the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Melting point===
The [[melting point]]s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to [[boiling points]] for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-number alkanes pack less well and so the &quot;looser&quot; organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Boese R, Weiss HC, Blaser D | title= The melting point alternation in the short-chain n-alkanes: Single-crystal X-ray analyses of propane at 30 K and of n-butane to n-nonane at 90 K | journal= Angew Chemie Int Ed | year=1999 | volume=38 | pages=988–992 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19990401)38:7&lt;988::AID-ANIE988&gt;3.3.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to packing well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.

===Conductivity and Solubility===
Alkanes do not conduct [[electricity]], nor are they substantially [[Relative static permittivity|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be [[hydrophobic]] in that they repel water.

Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property that is called [[lipophilicity]]. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.

The density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms, but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane-water mixture.

===Molecular geometry===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Nylon]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ch4 hybridization.svg|thumb|right|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridization in [[methane]].]]
The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always [[Orbital hybridization|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized]], that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a [[tetrahedron]], the angle of cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(−⅓) ≈ 109.47° between them.

===Bond lengths and bond angles===
An alkane molecule has only C – H and C – C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of a sp³-orbital of carbon with the 1s-orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp³-orbitals on different carbon atoms. The [[bond length]]s amount to 1.09×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C – H bond and 1.54×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C – C bond.
[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of methane.]]

The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp³-orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them. Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

===Conformation===
{{Main|Alkane stereochemistry}}

The structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] for each carbon – carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformational isomerism|conformation]].
[[Image:Newman projection ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]
[[Image:Ethane-rotamers-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]]s of the two rotamers of ethane]]

[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C – C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C – C bond, one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon – carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: [[eclipsed]] conformation and [[staggered conformation]].

The two conformations, also known as [[rotamer]]s, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6 kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).

This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C-C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds.

The case of [[higher alkanes]] is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon-carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.

===Spectroscopic properties===
Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon – carbon and carbon – hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characteristic spectroscopic features.

====Infrared spectroscopy====
The carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&amp;nbsp;[[Wavenumber|cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]], while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1375&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

====NMR spectroscopy====
The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at [[chemical shift|δ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 0.5 – 1.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: δ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 – 30 (primary, methyl, -CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), 15 – 55 (secondary, methylene, -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-), 20 – 60 (tertiary, methyne, C-H) and quaternary. The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[Nuclear Overhauser effect]] and the long [[relaxation time]], and can be missed in weak samples, or sample that have not been run for a sufficiently long time.

====Mass spectrometry====
Alkanes have a high [[ionization energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (M−15) is often absent, and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-groups.

==Chemical properties==
In general, alkanes show a relatively low reactivity, because their C bonds are relatively stable and cannot be easily broken. Unlike most other organic compounds, they possess no [[functional group]]s.

They react only very poorly with ionic or other polar substances. The [[acid dissociation constant]] (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) values of all alkanes are above 60, hence they are practically inert to acids and bases (see: [[carbon acid]]s). This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' (with the meaning here of &quot;lacking affinity&quot;). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

However redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (−4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen (''if'' an amount of the least is enough to meet the reaction [[stoichometry]]) leads to combustion without any smoke; with halogens, [[substitution (chemistry)|substitution]]. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in (See: [[carbon-hydrogen bond activation]]).

[[Free radical]]s, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.

In highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hindrance]], and can substantially increase the reactivity.

===Reactions with oxygen (combustion reaction)===
All alkanes react with [[oxygen]] in a [[combustion]] reaction, although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:
:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + (1.5''n''+0.5)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (''n''+1)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
In the absence of sufficient oxygen, [[carbon monoxide]] or even [[soot]] can be formed, as shown below:

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;(2''n''+2)&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''[[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → (''n''+1)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''[[carbon monoxide|CO]]

For example [[methane]]:
:2CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2CO + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

See the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)#Alkanes|alkane heat of formation table]] for detailed data.
The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, for alkanes increases by about 650&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol per CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of Δ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.

===Reactions with halogens===
{{Main|Free radical halogenation}}
Alkanes react with [[halogen]]s in a so-called ''free radical halogenation'' reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. [[Free-radical]]s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], and can lead to an explosion.

These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps:
* '''Initiation''' the halogen radicals form by [[homolysis]]. Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required.
* '''Chain reaction''' or '''Propagation''' then takes place—the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical. This reacts further.
* '''Chain termination''' where step the radicals recombine.

Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane:&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt; [In the Figure below, the Statistical Distribution should be 25% and 75%]

===Cracking===
{{Main|Cracking (chemistry)}}
Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a [[homolytic cleavage|homolytic]] mechanism with formation of [[free-radical]]s. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst]]s (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite]]s), which promote a [[heterolytic cleavage|heterolytic]] (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of [[ion]]s of opposite charges, usually a carbo[[cation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free-radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C-C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[intramolecular|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride]] transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding [[reactive intermediate]]s (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.

===Isomerization and reformation===
Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a [[platinum]] catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers. In reformation, the alkanes become [[cycloalkane]]s or [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the [[octane number]] of the substance.

===Other reactions===
Alkanes will react with [[steam]] in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]] to give [[hydrogen]]. Alkanes can be [[Chlorosulfonation|chlorosulfonated]] and [[nitration|nitrated]], although both reactions require special conditions. The [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of alkanes to [[carboxylic acid]]s is of some technical importance. In the [[Reed reaction]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorine]] and [[photochemistry|light]] convert hydrocarbons to [[Sulfonic acid|sulfonyl chlorides]].
