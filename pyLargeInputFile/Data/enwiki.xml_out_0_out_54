Accessed August 4, 2007. &quot;Construction already is under way on the southern tip of Manhattan, at Battery Park City, land named for the British fort built there in 1693. The area was expanded by 1.2 million cubic yards of earth and rock excavated for the foundations of the World Trade Center nearby.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood, which is the site of the [[World Financial Center]] along with numerous housing, commercial and retail buildings, is named for adjacent [[Battery Park (New York)|Battery Park]].

Battery Park City is owned and managed by the [[Battery Park City Authority]] (BPCA), a [[public-benefit corporation]] created by New York State under the authority of the [[Empire State Development Corporation|Urban Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=6 Builders Chosen for Housing at Battery Park City |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07EED7153BF93AA2575BC0A967948260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 19, 1981 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess revenue from the area was to be contributed to other housing efforts, typically low-income projects in the [[Bronx]] and [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]]. 

Under the 1989 agreement between the BPCA and the City of New York, $600 million was transferred by the BPCA to the city. Charles J. Urstadt, the first Chairman and CEO of the BPCA, noted in an August 19, 2007 op-ed piece in the ''[[New York Post]]'' that the aggregate figure of funds transferred to the City of New York is above $1.4 billion with the BPCA continuing to contribute $200 million a year. 

Much of this funding has historically been diverted to general city expenses, under section 3.d of the 1989 agreement. However, in July 2006, Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Pataki, and Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr. announced the final approval for the New York City Housing Trust Fund derived from $130 million in Battery Park City revenues. The Fund aims to preserve or create 4,300 affordable units over the next three years. It also provided seed financing for the New York Acquisition Fund, a $230 million initiative that aims to serve as a catalyst for the construction and preservation of more than 30,000 units of affordable housing Citywide over the next 10 years. The Acquisition Fund has since established itself as a model for similar funds in cities and states across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/downloads/pdf/New-Housing-Market-Place-Plan.pdf Mayor Bloomberg’s affordable housing plan], [[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development]], August 2008.

==Geography==
[[Image:Nycmap-batteryparkcity.jpg|thumb|Location of Battery Park City]]
[[File:Battery Park City 007.JPG|thumb|Greenery at South Cove]]
Battery Park City is bounded on the east by [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]], which depending on your viewpoint, insulates or isolates the area from the [[Financial District (Manhattan)|Financial District]] of downtown Manhattan. To the west, north and south, the area is surrounded by the tidal [[estuary]] of the Hudson River.

The development consists of roughly five major sections. Traveling north to south, the first neighborhood, the &quot;North Residential Neighborhood,&quot; consists of high-rise residential buildings, a large hotel, [[Stuyvesant High School]], a movie theater and a modern branch of the New York Public Library. Existing restaurants located in the hotel have been closed following a take over of the property by Goldman Sachs with new development planned for &lt;ref&gt;Joe Weisenthal in Business Insider 08/02/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot; ... a trio of restaurants run by Danny Meyer – the New York City restaurant wunderkind – as well as a new ballroom and conference centre, attached to the hotel which will be upgraded. In addition, the bank [Goldman Sachs] plans 5,000 square feet of retail units.&quot; Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings. [[Goldman Sachs]] has completed building a new headquarters at [[200 West Street]]. The [[Battery Park City Ferry Terminal]] is at the foot of [[Vesey Street (Manhattan)|Vesey Street]] opposite the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]. 

Immediately to the south lies the [[World Financial Center]], a complex of several commercial buildings occupied by tenants including [[American Express]], [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Nomura Holdings]] and [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]]. The World Financial Center's ground floor and portions of the second floor are occupied by a mall; its center point is a steel-and-glass atrium known as the [[Winter Garden Atrium|Winter Garden]]. Outside of the Winter Garden lies a sizeable [[yacht]] harbor on the Hudson known as North Cove.

South of the World Financial Center lies the majority of Battery Park City's residential areas, in three sections: &quot;Gateway Plaza&quot;, a high-rise building complex; the &quot;Rector Place Residential Neighborhood&quot; and the &quot;Battery Place Residential Neighborhood&quot;. These neighborhoods contain most of the area's residential buildings, along with park space and various types of supporting businesses ([[supermarket]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[movie theater]]s.) Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s and completion of the final lots scheduled to be completed by Spring, 2011.

==Demographics==
As of the 2000 census, there were 7,951 people residing in Battery Park City. The population density was 41,032 people per square mile (15,855/km²). The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 75% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 17.93% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.97% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.06% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.58% from [[Race (U.S. Census)|other races]], and 2.42% from two or more races. 5.32% of the population were [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] of any race. 27.7% of the population was foreign born, 51.8% came from Asia, 30.8% from Europe, 8.2% from Latin America and 9.2% from other (mostly Canada).

Today, about 10,000 people live in Battery Park City, most of whom are [[upper middle class]] and [[upper class]] (54.0% of households have incomes over $100,000). When fully built out, the neighborhood is projected to have 14,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/realestate/21livi.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Next Door to a Poignant Memory | first=C.

==History==

Throughout the 19th century and early 20th century the area adjoining today's Battery Park City was known as the Greek quarter; a long-standing reminder of the ethnic past was the former [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]] which was destroyed in the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]].

[[File:Battery Park City panoramic.jpg|thumb|Northernmost part of Battery Park City]]
By the late 1950s, the once prosperous port area of downtown Manhattan was occupied by a number of dilapidated shipping piers, casualties of the rise of [[container shipping]] which drove sea traffic to [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal|Port Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. The initial proposal to reclaim this area through [[Land reclamation|landfill]] was offered in the early 1960s by private firms and supported by the Mayor. This plan became complicated when Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in 1966 the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], the proposal called for a 'comprehensive community' consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry. The landscaping of the parkspace and later the Winter Garden was designed by [[M. Paul Friedberg]]. 

In 1968, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the [[Battery Park City Authority]] (BPCA) to oversee development. The [[Empire State Development Corporation|New York State Urban Development Corporation]] and ten other public agencies were also involved in the development project.&lt;ref name=&quot;enr-1983&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Megajob takes foothold in fill, New York City's $1-billion river development survives snags |publisher=Engineering News-Record |date=1983-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several years, the BPCA made slow progress. In 1969, it unveiled a master plan for the area, and in 1972 issued $200 million in bonds to fund construction efforts. Landfill material from [[Building of the World Trade Center|construction]] of the [[World Trade Center]] was used to add land. Cellular [[cofferdam]]s were constructed to retain the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;iglauer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/content/articles/010924fr_archive02 |title=The Biggest Foundation |author=Iglauer, Edith |date=1972-11-04 |publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976 the landfill was completed; in many cases, the pre-existing piers were simply buried. Construction efforts ground to a halt for nearly two years beginning in 1977, as a result of city-wide financial hardships. In 1979, the title to the landfill was transferred from the city to the Battery Park City Authority, which financially restructured itself and created a new, more viable master plan, designed by [[Alex Cooper]] and [http://www.eekarchitects.com Stanton Eckstut]. The design of BPC to some degree reflects the values of vibrant city neighborhoods championed by [[Jane Jacobs]]. The Urban Land Institute (ULI) awarded the Battery Park City Master Plan its 2010 Heritage Award, for having &quot;facilitated the private development of 9.3 million square feet of commercial space, 7.2 million square feet of residential space, and nearly 36 acres of open space in lower Manhattan, becoming a model for successful large-scale planning efforts and marking a positive shift away from the urban renewal mindset of the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uli.org/News/MediaCenter/PressReleases/2010%20archives/Content/AwardsforExcellenceAmericas2010Winners.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the late 1970s and early 1980s the site hosted Creative Time's landmark Art on the Beach sculpture exhibitions. On September 23, 1979, the landfill was the site of an [[List of anti-nuclear protests in the United States|anti-nuclear rally]] attended by 200,000 people.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Herman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nearly 200,000 Rally to Protest Nuclear Energy |url= |work=[[New York Times]] |page=B1 |date=September 24, 1979 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began on the first residential building in 1980, followed in 1981 with the start of construction on the [[World Financial Center]]. [[Olympia and York]], of [[Toronto]], was named as the developer for the [[World Financial Center]] in 1981, who then hired [[Cesar Pelli]] as the lead architect. By 1985, construction was completed and the World Financial Center saw its first tenants.

Throughout the 1980s, the Battery Park City Authority oversaw a great deal of construction, including the entire [[Rector Place]] neighborhood and the river Esplanade. It was during this period that current City Planning Department Director [[Amanda Burden]] worked on Battery Park City. During the 1980s a total of 13 buildings were constructed. In the early 1990s, Battery Park City became the new home of the [[Stuyvesant High School]]. During the 1990s an additional 6 buildings were added to the neighborhood. By the turn of the 21st century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.

Current residential neighborhoods of Battery Park City are divided into a north and south section, separated by the World Financial Center Complex. The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, is the more densely populated region, containing Gateway Plaza, and Rector Place apartment buildings. The northern section, although still under very large construction, consists entirely of large, 20-45 story buildings which are all various shades of orange brick. 

The [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] had a major impact on Battery Park City. The residents of lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for ten days [http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/21/nyregion/nation-challenged-battery-park-city-displaced-begin-make-their-way-back-home.html?pagewanted=all]. Parts of the community were an official crime-scene and therefore a few residents were unable to return to live or even collect property for a longer period of time. When they were finally allowed to return to Battery Park City, some residents of the Gateway Plaza complex reported their homes had been looted. Upon return the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until January 2002. 

Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East and, the then Parc Place, now Rector Square were punctured by airplane parts and severely contaminated. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center were a source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. While a substantial portion of the area's residents moved away permanently, temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.

Since then, real estate development in the area has continued robustly. Commercial development includes the {{convert|2100000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} [http://www.newyork.construction.com/projects/TopPrj_05-06/TPstrt1-5.pdf Goldman Sachs Group World Headquarters] scheduled for occupancy in 2009. [[Goldman Sachs]] is seeking gold-level certification under the [[United States Green Building Council]]’s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program by incorporating various water and energy conservation features. Several residential projects are underway, including LEED buildings which cater to the environmentally conscious.

==Symptoms and signs==
The most common symptom of BV is an abnormal homogeneous off-white vaginal discharge (especially after sex) with an unpleasant smell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070969.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This malodorous discharge coats the walls of the [[vagina]], and is usually without irritation, pain or [[erythema]]. By contrast, the normal vaginal discharge will vary in consistency and amount throughout the [[menstrual cycle]] and is at its clearest about 2 weeks before the [[menstruation|period]] starts.

== Diagnosis==
To make a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, a swab from inside the vagina should be obtained. These swabs should be tested for:
* A characteristic &quot;fishy&quot; odor on [[wet mount]]. This test, called the ''whiff test'', is performed by adding a small amount of [[potassium hydroxide]] to a [[microscopic slide]] containing the vaginal discharge. A characteristic [[fishy odor]] is considered a positive whiff test and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.
* Loss of [[acidity]]. To control bacterial growth, the vagina is normally slightly acidic with a [[pH]] of 3.8–4.2. A swab of the discharge is put onto [[litmus paper]] to check its acidity. A pH greater than 4.5 is considered alkaline and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.
* The presence of ''[[clue cell]]s'' on wet mount. Similar to the whiff test, the test for clue cells is performed by placing a drop of [[sodium chloride]] solution on a slide containing vaginal discharge. If present, clue cells can be visualized under a microscope. They are so-named because they give a clue to the reason behind the discharge. These are [[epithelial]] cells that are coated with bacteria.

Two positive results in addition to the discharge itself are enough to diagnose BV. If there is no discharge, then all three criteria are needed.&lt;ref name = Amsel&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amsel R, Totten PA, Spiegel CA, Chen KC, Eschenbach D, Holmes KK |title=Nonspecific vaginitis.

The best combination of two tests for BV was the test for clue cells and the whiff test.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1689107&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomason JL, Gelbart SM, Anderson RJ, Walt AK, Osypowski PJ, Broekhuizen FF |title=Statistical evaluation of diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis |journal=Am.

Differential diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis includes the following:{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
*Normal discharge.
*[[Candidiasis]] (thrush, or a yeast infection).
*[[Trichomoniasis]], an infection caused by ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]''.

=== In clinical practice ===
In clinical practice BV is diagnosed using the Amsel criteria:&lt;ref name = Amsel/&gt;

# Thin, white, yellow, homogeneous discharge
# [[Clue cells]] on [[microscopy]]
# [[pH]] of vaginal fluid &gt;4.5
# Release of a fishy odor on adding [[alkali]]—10% [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution.

At least three of the four criteria should be present for a confirmed diagnosis.&lt;ref name=GCH/&gt;

An alternative is to use a Gram-stained vaginal smear, with the Hay/Ison&lt;ref name = HayIson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ison | first1 = CA | last2 = Hay | first2 = PE | year = 2002 | title = Validation of a simplified grading of Gram stained vaginal smears for use in genitourinary medicine clinics | journal = Sex Transm Infect | volume = 78 | pages = 413–5 | doi = 10.1136/sti.78.6.413 | pmid = 12473800 | issue = 6 | pmc = 1758337}}&lt;/ref&gt; criteria or the Nugent&lt;ref name=&quot;Nugent1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nugent RP, Krohn MA, Hillier SL |title=Reliability of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis is improved by a standardized method of gram stain interpretation |journal=J.

The Hay/Ison criteria are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=GCH/&gt;
* Grade 1 (Normal): [[Lactobacillus]] morphotypes predominate.
* Grade 2 (Intermediate): Mixed flora with some Lactobacilli present, but Gardnerella or Mobiluncus morphotypes also present.
* Grade 3 (Bacterial Vaginosis): Predominantly Gardnerella and/or Mobiluncus morphotypes. Few or absent Lactobacilli. (Hay et al., 1994)

What this technique loses in interobserver reliability, it makes up in ease and speed of use.

The standards for research are the Nugent&lt;ref name=&quot;Nugent1991&quot;/&gt; Criteria.  In this scale, a score of 0-10 is generated from combining three other scores. This method is time consuming and requires trained staff, but it has high [[Inter-observer reliability|interobserver reliability]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  The scores are as follows:
* 0–3 is considered negative for BV
* 4–6 is considered intermediate
* 7+ is considered indicative of BV.
At least 10–20 high power (1000× oil immersion) fields are counted and an average determined.

A recent study &lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17078859&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gazi H, Degerli K, Kurt O, ''et al.'' |title=Use of DNA hybridization test for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis in women with symptoms suggestive of infection |journal=APMIS |volume=114 |issue=11 |pages=784–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17078859 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0463.2006.apm_485.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the Gram stain using the Nugent criteria and the DNA hybridization test Affirm VPIII in diagnosing BV.  The Affirm VPIII test detected Gardnerella in 107 (93.0%) of 115 vaginal specimens positive for BV diagnosed by Gram stain.  The Affirm VPIII test has a [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 87.7% and [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 96% and may be used for the rapid diagnosis of BV in symptomatic women.

==Causes==

A healthy vagina normally contains many [[microorganisms]]; some of the common ones are ''Lactobacillus crispatus'' and ''Lactobacillus jensenii''. ''Lactobacilli'', particularly hydrogen peroxide-producing species, appear to help prevent other vaginal microorganisms from multiplying to a level where they cause symptoms. The microorganisms involved in BV are very diverse, but include ''[[Gardnerella vaginalis]]'', ''[[Mobiluncus]]'', ''[[Bacteroides]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma]]''.  A change in normal bacterial flora including the reduction of lactobacillus, which may be due to the use of antibiotics or pH imbalance, allows more resistant bacteria to gain a foothold and multiply.  

There are a variety of causes for bacterial vaginosis. Cases of bacterial vaginosis are more likely to occur in sexually active women between the ages of 15 to 45. [[Condom]]s may provide some protection and there is no evidence that [[spermicide]] increases BV risk.  Although BV can be associated with [[sexual activity]], there is no clear evidence of sexual transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bradshaw CS, Morton AN, Hocking J, ''et al.'' |title=High recurrence rates of bacterial vaginosis over the course of 12 months after oral metronidazole therapy and factors associated with recurrence |journal=J. Infect. Dis. |volume=193 |issue=11 |pages=1478–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16652274 |doi=10.1086/503780 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Better source|date=May 2010}} It is possible for sexually inactive persons to get infected with bacterial vaginosis. Rather, BV is a disordering of the chemical and biological balance of the [[Human flora|normal flora]].  Recent research is exploring the link between sexual partner treatment and eradication of recurrent cases of BV. [[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] women and women with [[sexually transmitted infections]] are especially at risk for getting this infection. Bacterial vaginosis may sometimes affect women after [[menopause]].  A 2005 study by researchers at [[Ghent University]] in Belgium showed that subclinical iron deficiency ([[anemia]]) was a strong predictor of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Verstraelen H, Delanghe J, Roelens K, Blot S, Claeys G, Temmerman M |title=Subclinical iron deficiency is a strong predictor of bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy |journal=BMC Infect.

==Complications==

Although previously considered a mere nuisance infection, untreated bacterial vaginosis may cause serious complications, such as increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections including HIV, and may present other complications for pregnant women.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/STDFact-Bacterial-Vaginosis.htm#Complications |title=STD Facts — Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) |accessdate=2007-12-04 |work=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
===Antibiotics===
[[Metronidazole]] or [[clindamycin]] either orally or vaginally are effective treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oduyebo OO, Anorlu RI, Ogunsola FT 2009 CD006055&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oduyebo OO, Anorlu RI, Ogunsola FT |title=The effects of antimicrobial therapy on bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant women |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3 |pages=CD006055 |year=2009 |pmid=19588379 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006055.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a high rate of recurrence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw2006&quot;/&gt;

The usual medical regimen for treatment is the antibiotic Metronidazole  (500&amp;nbsp;mg twice a day, once every 12 hours) for 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2006/vaginal-discharge.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A one-time 2g dose is no longer recommended by the CDC because of low efficacy. Extended release metronidazole is an alternative recommendation.

In contrast to some other infectious diseases affecting the female genitals, according to some sources, treatment of the sexual partners is not necessarily recommended.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10818662&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Potter J |title=Should sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis receive treatment? |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=49 |issue=448 |pages=913–8 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10818662 |pmc=1313567 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=0960-1643&amp;volume=49&amp;issue=448&amp;spage=913&amp;aulast=Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative medicine===
In 2009 one [[Cochrane review]] did not find [[probiotics]] useful in the treatment of BV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Senok AC, Verstraelen H, Temmerman M, Botta GA |title=Probiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD006289 |year=2009 |pmid=19821358 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006289.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while another concluded they were effective when combined with antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oduyebo OO, Anorlu RI, Ogunsola FT 2009 CD006055&quot;/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that 1 in 3 women will develop the condition at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Family Planning Association|url=http://www.fpa.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Selig's term of service, [[Banned substances in baseball|the use of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs]] became a public issue. The [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]], commissioned by Selig, concluded that the MLB commissioners, club officials, the Players Association, and the players all share &quot;to some extent in the responsibility for the steroid era.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;report_pg_conc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf | title = Mitchell Report | format = PDF | pages = 310–311 | accessdate = 2007-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of the Mitchell Report, Congressman [[Cliff Stearns]] called publicly for Selig to step down as commissioner, citing his &quot;glacial response&quot; to the &quot;growing stain on baseball.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Extension&quot;/&gt; Selig has pledged on numerous occasions to rid baseball of performance enhancing drugs, and has overseen and instituted many rule changes and penalties to that end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/12/15/SPRQTV1S2.DTL |title=Selig unlikely to penalize Giants execs Assigning blame could be difficult |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2007-12-15 |accessdate=2009-10-17 | first=Henry | last=Schulman}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}}

Selig was previously the team owner and team president of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. As a Milwaukee native, he is credited for keeping baseball in Milwaukee. In 1970, he purchased the [[Seattle Pilots]] in bankruptcy court and renamed them the Milwaukee Brewers after a minor league team he had watched in his youth. The Brewers went to the [[1982 World Series]] and won seven organization of the year awards during his tenure. Selig remains a resident of Milwaukee.

On January 17, 2008, Selig's contract was extended by the MLB through 2012, at which point he plans to retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By&amp;nbsp;Barry M. Bloom&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080117&amp;content_id=2347936&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selig made $14.5 million in the 12-month period ending Oct. 31, 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Extension&quot;/&gt;

== Early life ==

Selig was born in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and grew up in a [[Jew]]ish family. His father, Ben Selig, had come to the [[United States]] from [[Romania]] with his family when he was four years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Andrew Zimbalist]]|title=In the Best Interests of Baseball? The Revolutionary Reign of Bud Selig|year=2007|page = 111|isbn=0-470-12824-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selig graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[American history]] and [[political science]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/executives.jsp?bio=selig_bud |title=MLB Bio |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served two years in the [[U.S. Army]] before working with his father who owned a car leasing business in Milwaukee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; Selig continues to be involved in the automotive industry, serving as president of the Selig Executive Lease Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;

Young Bud's interest in baseball came from his mother. Herself an immigrant from [[Ukraine]], Marie Selig attended college, a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early twentieth century, and become a school teacher. When Bud was only three, Marie began taking Bud and his older brother, Jerry, to Old Orchards Field, where the triple-A farm team of the [[Chicago Cubs]] played. As a young man, Selig watched the Milwaukee Brewers, a minor-league affiliate of the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[National League]], unrelated to the current incarnation of the Milwaukee Brewers. Bud soon became a [[Milwaukee Braves|Braves]] fan when the National League franchise moved to his home town of [[Milwaukee]] from [[Boston]] in [[1953 in baseball|1953]]. Selig became the team's largest public stockholder. Selig was heartbroken and devastated when he learned that the Braves were going to leave Milwaukee in favor of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. In [[1965 in baseball|1965]], when the Braves left Milwaukee, he divested his stock in the team.

== Milwaukee Brewers owner ==
{{see also|Atlanta Braves}}

As a minority owner of the [[Atlanta Braves|Milwaukee Braves]], Selig founded the organization '''''Teams, Inc''''', in an attempt to prevent the majority owners (based out of Chicago) from moving the club to a larger television market. This was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations (in the modern era) left a city without a team. Prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams. When his quest to keep the team in Milwaukee finally failed after the [[1965 in baseball|1965]] season, he changed the group's name to '''''Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.''''', after the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|minor league baseball team]] he grew up watching, and devoted himself to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.

Selig arranged for major league games to be played at the now demolished [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The first, a pre-season match between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Minnesota Twins]], drew more than 51,000 spectators. Selig followed this up by hosting nine White Sox regular-season games in [[1968 in baseball|1968]] and eleven in [[1969 in baseball|1969]]. One of the games played in Milwaukee that year was against the expansion [[Seattle Pilots]], the team that would become the Brewers. Those Milwaukee &quot;home&quot; games were phenomenally successful, with the handful of games accounting for about ''one-third'' of total White Sox home attendance.

To satisfy that fanbase, Selig decided to purchase the White Sox (with the intention of moving them to Milwaukee) in 1969. He entered into an agreement to buy the club, but the [[American League]] vetoed the sale, preferring to keep an American League team in Chicago to compete with the crosstown [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]. Selig turned his attention to other franchises.

In [[1970 in baseball|1970]], he purchased the bankrupt Seattle Pilots franchise, moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the ''Brewers''.

During Selig's tenure as club president, the Brewers participated in postseason play in 1981, when the team finished first in the American League East during the second half of the season, and in 1982, when the team made it to the [[1982 World Series|World Series]], under the leadership of future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Robin Yount]] and [[Paul Molitor]]. Under Selig's watch, the Brewers also won seven '''''Organization of the Year''''' awards. Selig was part of the owners' [[Baseball collusion#1985-1987|collusion]] in [[1985 in baseball|1985]]–[[1987 in baseball|1987]], resulting in the owners paying [[United States dollar|$]]280 million in damages to the players.

Upon his assumption of the commissioner's role, Selig transferred his ownership interest in the Brewers to his daughter [[Wendy Selig-Prieb]] in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest, though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations. Although the team has been sold to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] investor [[Mark Attanasio]], questions remain regarding Selig's past involvement. Selig's defenders point to the poor management of the team after Selig-Prieb took control as proof that Selig was not working behind the scenes.

Selig was elected to the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

On August 24, 2010, a statue of Selig, commissioned by Brewers owner Mark Attanasio and designed by artist Brian Maughan, was unveiled outside Miller Park in Milwaukee.

== Acting Commissioner (1992–1998) ==

Selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of Commissioner [[Fay Vincent]], and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal. Selig has never stated that the owners [[Baseball collusion|colluded]], while Vincent has:
{{quote|The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Union]] basically doesn’t trust the ownership because [[Baseball collusion|collusion]] was a [[United States dollar|$]]280 million theft by Selig and [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] of that money from the players. I mean, they rigged the signing of [[free agent]]s. They got caught. They paid $280 million to the players. And I think that’s polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened. I think it’s the reason [[MLBPA]] executive director [[Donald Fehr]] has no trust in Selig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1173&amp;Itemid=81 |title=Interview with Fay Vincent |publisher=Bizofbaseball.com |date=2005-11-09 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Fay Vincent}}
Following an 18-9 no-confidence vote, Vincent resigned. Selig had by this time become chairman of the '''Executive Council of Major League Baseball''', and as such became [[de facto]] acting commissioner.

His first major act was to institute the [[Wild_card_(sports)#Major_League_Baseball|Wild Card]] and divisional playoff play, which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans. Those against the Wild Card see it as diminishing the importance of the [[pennant race]] and the regular season, with the true race often being for second rather than first place, while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a first-place finish in their division, thus maintaining fan interest later in the season.

Selig suspended [[Cincinnati Reds]] owner [[Marge Schott]] for a year in [[1993 in baseball|1993]] for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions. The same year, [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by Selig's predecessor [[Fay Vincent]]. [[Pete Rose]] has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration. Rose, along with his close friend and former teammate [[Mike Schmidt]] (who is a strong supporter of Rose's reinstatement into baseball), met with Selig in [[2002 in baseball|2002]], where Rose privately admitted to Selig (two years before going public with his admission) about [[Dowd Report|betting on baseball]]. Bud Selig was a close friend of the late [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Bart Giamatti]], who was the commissioner when Rose was first banned from the sport in [[1989 in baseball|1989]].

As acting commissioner, Selig represented MLB during the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|1994 players strike]] and cancelled the [[1994 World Series|World Series]], marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since [[1904 World Series|1904]].

== Commissioner (1998–present) ==

After a six-year search for a new commissioner, the owners voted to give Selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the [[1998 in baseball|1998]] season.

During his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in [[2002 in baseball|2002]], and has seen the implementation of [[interleague play]].

Whereas in the past, the National and American Leagues had separate administrative organizations (which, for example, allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the [[designated hitter]]), under Selig, Major League Baseball consolidated the administrative functions of the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]] into the Commissioner's Office in [[2000 in baseball|2000]]. The last official presidents of the NL and AL were [[Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.]] and Dr. [[Gene Budig]] respectively.

=== Reaction after September 11, 2001 ===

On September 11, 2001, Selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terror attacks on New York and Washington]]. The games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims, but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players.

After a dramatic conclusion of the [[2001 World Series]], less than 48 hours later, Selig held a vote on contracting two teams, reportedly the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Montreal Expos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN-ContractionTimeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This action led to Selig (along with former Expos owner [[Jeffrey Loria]]) being sued for racketeering and conspiring with Loria to deliberately defraud the Expos minority owners. If found liable, the league could have been ordered to pay as much as $300 million in punitive damages. Selig was eager to settle the case because the judge had previously ruled that the Expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over. The case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

=== Changes to the MLB All-Star Game ===

The [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 All-Star Game]], played in Selig's hometown of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Milwaukee]], was tied 7-7 after 9 innings, and remained tied after the bottom of the 11th inning. Due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings, both managers had used their entire roster. Concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound, Selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie,&lt;ref name=&quot;usaToday-2007-07-10&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2007-07-10-AllStartiegamefeature_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Tie in '02 All-Star Game mattered | first=Bob | last=Nightengale | date=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the dissatisfaction of the Milwaukee fans. Selig later said that this call was &quot;embarrassing&quot; and that he was &quot;tremendously saddened&quot; by the outcome of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;usaToday-2007-07-10&quot;/&gt; Since 2002, Selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the All-Star Game by awarding the winning league home-field advantage in the World Series. The [[2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]] had the same U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|rating]]; 17 [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|share]]) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/asgtv.shtml |title=All-Star Game Television Ratings on Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American television audience increased in 2006 (9.3 rating; 16 share).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/specials/all_star/2006/07/12/bc.bbo.all.starratings.ap/index.html |title=SI.com&amp;nbsp;— MLB - 2006 All Star Game&amp;nbsp;— Ratings up for All-Star Game, HR Derby&amp;nbsp;— Wednesday July 12, 2006 6:41PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disciplinary actions ===

On July 1, 2005, Selig suspended [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] pitcher [[Kenny Rogers (baseball player)|Kenny Rogers]] for 20 games and fined him [[United States dollar|$]]50,000. Rogers got in trouble when on June 29, 2005, he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman, resulting in one camera falling to the ground. When the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera, Rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way. One of the reporters then resumed filming and Rogers knocked him down again.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN-KennyRogers&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2005 All-Star Game]] in [[Detroit Michigan|Detroit]], where fans loudly booed him. On July 22, 2005, Selig heard Rogers' appeal of his suspension. Selig decided to uphold the 20 games, however, an independent arbitrator ruled that Selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to 13 games, but upheld the fine.

=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===
{{main|2006 Baseball steroids investigation}}

In [[2005 in baseball|2005]], Selig faced [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] on the issue of [[Anabolic steroids|steroids]]. After the Congressional hearings in early 2005, and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue, Selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performance-enhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system. This proposal also included the banning of [[amphetamines]], a first for the major North American sports leagues. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]] and MLB reached an agreement in November on the new policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = |title = MLBPA/MLB joint announcement |url = http://mlbplayers.mlb.com/pa/releases/releases.jsp?content=111505 |publisher = MLBPA |date = 2005-11-15 |accessdate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2006, Selig was forced to deal with the issue of [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]] use.

On March 30, 2006, as a response to the controversy of the use of performance-enhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by Barry Bonds, Selig asked former senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseball's recent past. [[Joe Sheehan]] from [[Baseball Prospectus]] wrote that the commission has been focusing &quot;blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel&quot;, and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sheehan | first = Joe | title = Prospectus Today&amp;nbsp;— Break with the Past | publisher = Baseball Prospectus | date = 2007-05-22 | url = http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6261 | accessdate = 2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much controversy surrounded Selig and his involvement in [[Barry Bonds]]' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig and the possibility that he and [[Hank Aaron]] would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the [[San Diego Padres]], sitting in Padres owner [[John Moores (baseball)|John Moores]]' private suite. Bud Selig did not attend the San Francisco Giants' baseball game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.

On November 15, 2007, attention was brought once again to Barry Bonds as he was [[Indictment|indicted]] by a federal [[grand jury]] for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] in connection to his testimony before the grand jury regarding the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO), a [[San Francisco Bay area]] lab known to be involved in the distribution of [[steroids]] to professional athletes.

On December 13, 2007, former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[George J. Mitchell]] released his [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|report on the use of performance-enhancing substances by MLB players]]. The report names many current and former players who allegedly used performance-enhancing drugs during their career, including [[Roger Clemens]], [[Andy Pettitte]], [[Miguel Tejada]], [[Eric Gagné]], and [[Paul Lo Duca]].

Selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry. [[Chicago Sun Times]] columnist [[Jay Mariotti]] called Selig the &quot;The Steroids Commissioner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/sports/mariotti/742620,mariotti011608.article Selig's only legacy: S-T-E-R-O-I-D-S]{{dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selig has been called to [[United States Congress|Congress]] several times to testify on performance enhancing drug use. Congressman [[Cliff Stearns]] said in December 2007 that Selig should resign because of use of performance enhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Extension&quot;/&gt;

=== Post-season schedule ===
Selig's decision to extend the traditional post-season schedule into November in an attempt to increase Nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain, both inside and outside the baseball community. [[Mike Scioscia]], manager of the American League West Division Champion Los Angeles Angels, dismissed the decision as “Ridiculous. I don’t know. Can I say it any clearer than that? We should have never had a day off last Wednesday. We should never have three days off after the season. You shouldn’t even have two days off after the season.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/sports/baseball/25yankees.html?hpw Another Day Off for Yankees and Angels, and It’s Not Exactly Welcome] [[New York Times]], October 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Term of service ===

On December 1, 2006, Selig announced that he would be retiring as commissioner of baseball upon the expiration of his contract in 2009. Selig earned $14.5 million from MLB over the timespan October 31, 2005 to October 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Press | first = Canadian | title = MLB: Selig made $14.5 million last year | publisher = The Sports Network (TSN) | date = 2007-04-03 | url = http://www.tsn.ca/mlb/news_story/?ID=202619&amp;hubname= | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080122184319/http://www.tsn.ca/mlb/news_story/?ID=202619&amp;hubname= | archivedate = 2008-01-22 | accessdate = 2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on January 17, 2008, Selig's contract was extended by MLB through 2012, at which point he again says he plans to retire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Extension&quot;/&gt;

=== Armando Galarraga controversy ===
{{Main|Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game}}

On June 2, 2010, [[Armando Galarraga]]'s perfect game was ruined in the 9th inning by a wrong call&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/columns/story?id=5245642 Selig must overrule Jim Joyce's call and award Armando Galarraga a perfect game] [[ESPN]], June 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; by umpire [[Jim Joyce]] at first base. Selig announced on June 3, 2010 that the call could not be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5248118 Selig will not reverse blown call] [[ESPN]], June 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable changes to Major League Baseball ==
Bud Selig helped introduce the following changes to Major League Baseball:

* [[World Baseball Classic]] (2006)
* Introduction of [[instant replay]] in the event of a disputed [[home run]] call (2008)

During Selig's terms as Executive Council Chairman (from 1992–1998) and Commissioner, new stadiums have opened in [[Chase Field|Arizona]], [[Turner Field|Atlanta]], [[Great American Ball Park|Cincinnati]], [[Jacobs Field|Cleveland]], [[Coors Field|Colorado]], [[Comerica Park|Detroit]], [[Minute Maid Park|Houston]], [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Milwaukee]], [[Citizens Bank Park|Philadelphia]], [[PNC Park|Pittsburgh]], [[Petco Park|San Diego]], [[AT&amp;T Park|San Francisco]], [[Safeco Field|Seattle]], [[Rangers Ballpark in Arlington|Arlington]], [[Busch Stadium|St. Louis]], [[Nationals Park|Washington, D.C.]], [[Citi Field|Queens]], [[Yankee Stadium|The Bronx]] and [[Target Field|Minneapolis]], with a ballpark in [[Miami Ballpark|Miami]] coming in future years.

== Israel Baseball League ==

Selig and his family served a supportive role on the Advisory Board of the [[Israel Baseball League]] during its inaugural season in 2007. In response to issues with the league's financial management, after the season, the Selig family requested that their names be removed from the list of board members.&lt;ref name=&quot;JerusalemPost-IBL&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Wohlgelernter | first = Elli | title = Field of Failed Dreams | newspaper = The Jerusalem Post | date = 2008-07-24 | url = http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1215331082409&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter | accessdate = 2008-07-28 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==

Selig is married to his second wife, Sue Selig. He has two daughters from his previous marriage, Wendy Selig-Prieb and Sari Selig-Kramer, as well as a stepdaughter, Lisa Steinman. Selig-Prieb used to work for the Brewers, and Steinman currently works for MLB. He has five granddaughters: Emily Markenson, Alyssa Markenson, Marissa Savitch, Andria Savitch, and Natalie Prieb.

Members of the genus '''''Bison''''' are large [[even-toed ungulate]]s within the subfamily [[Bovinae]]. Two [[extant taxon|extant]] and four [[extinction|extinct]] species are recognized. The surviving species are the [[American bison]], also known as the American buffalo (although it is not related to the true [[African buffalo|buffalo]]), ''Bison bison'' (with two subspecies, the [[plains bison]], ''Bison bison bison'', and the [[wood bison]], ''Bison bison athabascae''), found in North America, and the European bison, or [[wisent]] (''Bison bonasus''), found in Europe and the [[Caucasus]]. While these species are usually grouped into their own [[genus]], they are sometimes included in the closely related genus ''[[Bos]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Groves, C. P., 1981. Systematic relationships in the Bovini (Artiodactyla, Bovidae). ''Zeitschrift für Zoologische Systematik und Evolutionsforschung'', '''4''':264-278., quoted in Don E. Wilson &amp; DeeAnn M. Reeder (editors). 2005. ''Mammal Species of the World. A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference'' (3rd ed), Johns Hopkins University Press: &quot;Bison&quot;. ([http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?s=y&amp;id=14200668 online edition])&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[cattle]], [[gaur]], [[kouprey]] and [[yak]]s, with which bison have a limited ability to [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreed]].

== Description ==
[[File:Bison on plaque Bedeilhac grottoe Ariege.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Magdalenian]] bison on plaque, 17,000-9,000 BCE, [[Bédeilhac]] grottoe, [[Ariège]].]]
[[File:Euroameribison.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Skulls of European bison (left) and American bison (right)]]
The American bison and the European wisent are good swimmers and are the largest terrestrial animals in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. Bison are nomadic [[Grazing|grazers]] and travel in [[herd]]s, except for the non-dominant bulls, which travel alone or in small groups during most of the year.  American bison are known for living in the [[Great Plains]]. Both species were hunted close to [[extinction]] during the 19th and 20th centuries but have since rebounded. The American Plains bison is no longer listed as endangered, but the Wood Bison is on the [[endangered|endangered species list]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/SpeciesReport.do?groups=A&amp;listingType=L&amp;mapstatus=1

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although superficially similar, there are a number of physical and behavioural differences between the American and European bison. The American species has 15 ribs, while the European bison has 14. The American bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the European has five.&lt;ref&gt;''The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'' by Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Great Britain), published by C. Knight, 1835&lt;/ref&gt; Adult American bison are not as rangy in build, and have shorter legs.&lt;ref&gt;''Trophy Bowhunting: Plan the Hunt of a Lifetime and Bag One for the Record Books'', by Rick Sapp, Edition: illustrated, published by Stackpole Books, 2006, ISBN 0811733157, 9780811733151&lt;/ref&gt; American bison tend to [[Grazing|graze]] more, and [[Browsing (predation)|browse]] less than their European cousins. Their anatomies reflect this behavioural difference; the American bison's head hangs closer to the earth than the European's. The body of the American bison is typically hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point  through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison which favours butting.&lt;ref&gt;''American Bison: A Natural History'', By Dale F. Lott, Harry W. Greene, ebrary, Inc, Contributor Harry W. Greene, Edition: illustrated, Published by University of California Press, 2003 ISBN 0520240626, 9780520240629&lt;/ref&gt; American bison are more easily tamed than their European cousins, and breed with domestic cattle more readily.&lt;ref&gt;''Zoologist: A Monthly Journal of Natural History'', By Edward Newman, James Edmund Harting, Published by J. Van Voorst, 1859&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic history==
A 2003 study found that mitochondrial DNA indicated that four distinct maternal lineages in tribe ''[[Bovini]]'':
#taurine [[cattle]] and [[zebu]], 
#wisent,
#American bison and [[yak]], and
#[[banteng]], [[gaur]], and [[gayal]]. 
However, Y chromosome analysis associated wisent and American bison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14739241 Maternal and Paternal Lineages in Cross-Breeding Bovine Species. Has Wisent a Hybrid Origin?], Edward L. C. Verkaar, Isaäc J. Nijman, Maurice Beeke, Eline Hanekamp and Johannes A. Lenstra, ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', November 26, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier study using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting showed a close association of wisent and American bison and probably with yak but noted that the interbreeding of ''Bovini'' species made determining relationships problematic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v88/n1/full/6800007a.html Phylogeny of bovine species based on AFLP fingerprinting], J B Buntjer, M Otsen, I J Nijman, M T R Kuiper and J A Lenstra, ''Heredity'' (2002) 88, 46–51, 7 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

During the population bottleneck, American bison were interbred with domestic cattle. Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. Genetic analysis has found a high degree of intermixture in modern commercial bison herds. Some cattle breeds are also partly bison, for instance, [[Beefalo]]. Wisent-American bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in Germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in Russia all the time
. A herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds ([[Zubron]]) are maintained in Poland. First-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. First-generation males are infertile.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Muybridge Buffalo galloping.gif|thumb|right|250px|A group of images by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], set to motion to illustrate the movement of the bison]]

Wallowing is a common behavior of bison. A bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil, either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with mud or dust. Possible explanations suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting, male-male interaction (typically [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] behavior), social behavior for group cohesion, play behavior, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of [[Parasitism|ectoparasite]] load ([[tick]]s and [[Louse|lice]]), and thermoregulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSTOR&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Wallowing Behavior of American Bison (Bos Bison) |publisher = JSTOR| date = April 10, 2008| url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/3083019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the process of wallowing bison may become infected by the fatal disease [[anthrax]], which may occur naturally in the soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthrax kills bison in southern N.W.T.&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title =  Anthrax kills bison in southern N.W.T. |publisher = CBC.CA| date = July 8, 2006| url =   http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2006/07/06/anthrax-nwt-bison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  bison's temperament is often unpredictable. They usually appear peaceful, unconcerned, even lazy, yet they may attack anything, often without warning or apparent reason. They can move at speeds of up to {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}} and cover long distances at a lumbering gallop.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = American Bison| url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/Bison.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their most obvious weapons are the horns borne by both males and females. But their massive heads can be used as battering rams, effectively using the momentum produced by {{convert|2000|lb|sigfig=1}} moving at {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The hind legs can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect. At the time bison ran wild, they were rated second only to the Alaska brown bear as a potential killer, more dangerous than the [[grizzly bear]]. In the words of early naturalists, they were a dangerous, savage animal that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;/&gt; 

The rutting, or mating, season lasts from June through September with peak activity in July and August. At this time, the older bulls rejoin the herd and fights often take place between bulls. The herd exhibits much restlessness during breeding season. The animals are belligerent, unpredictable and most dangerous.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;/&gt;

==Diet==
Bison have a fairly simple [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]. The bison's main [[food]] is [[grass]]. Bison also eat the low lying [[shrub]]bery that is available. In the winter, bison forage in the [[snow]] looking for grass. If there is little grass available, bison have to resort to eating the twigs of shrubs.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Predators==
Due to their large size few predators attack bison. However, [[wolf]] packs can take down a bison. There are even documented cases of a single wolf taking down bison (Schmidt &amp; Mech, 1997). [[Brown bear]]s will also prey on calves, and have been observed driving off wolves to take over their kills.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''baryon''' is a [[composite particle|composite]] [[subatomic particle|particle]] made of three [[quark]]s. Baryons are opposed to [[meson]]s which are made of one quark and one [[antiquark]]. Both baryons and mesons belong to the ''[[hadron]]'' [[list of particles|family]], which are the particles made of quarks. The name &quot;baryon&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for &quot;heavy&quot; (βαρύς, barys), because at the time of their naming, most known particles had lower masses than the baryons'.

Since baryons are composed of quarks, they participate in the [[strong interaction]]. [[Lepton]]s, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such do not participate in the strong interaction. The most well known baryons are the [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s which make up most of the mass of the visible [[matter]] in the [[universe]], whereas [[electron]]s (the other major component of [[atom]]s) are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding [[antiparticle]] (antibaryon) where quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the [[antiproton]], is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.

Until recently, it was believed that some experiments showed the existence of ''[[pentaquark]]s''—&quot;exotic&quot; baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark.&lt;ref&gt;H. Muir (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Carter (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The particle physics community as a whole did not view their existence as likely in 2006,&lt;ref name=PDGPentaquarks2006&gt;W.-M. Yao ''et al.'' (2006): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/reviews/theta_b152.pdf Particle listings – &amp;Theta;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008, considered evidence to be overwhelmingly against the existence of the reported pentaquarks.&lt;ref name=PDGPentaquarks2008&gt;C. Amsler ''et al.'' (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/pentaquarks_b801.pdf Pentaquarks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Baryons are strongly interacting [[fermion]]s—that is, they experience the [[strong nuclear force]] and are described by [[Fermi−Dirac statistics]], which apply to all particles obeying the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. This is in contrast to the [[boson]]s, which do not obey the exclusion principle.

Baryons, along with [[meson]]s, are [[hadron]]s, meaning they are particles composed of [[quark]]s. Quarks have baryon numbers of ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}} and antiquarks have baryon number of ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|1|3|}}. The term &quot;baryon&quot; usually refers to ''triquarks''—baryons made of three quarks (''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1). Other [[Exotic baryon|&quot;exotic&quot; baryons]] have been proposed, such as [[pentaquark]]s—baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark (''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), but their existence is not generally accepted. Theoretically, heptaquarks (5 quarks, 2 antiquarks), nonaquarks (6 quarks, 3 antiquarks), etc. could also exist.

==Baryonic matter==
'''Baryonic [[matter]]''' is matter composed mostly of baryons (by mass), which includes [[atom]]s of any sort (and thus includes nearly all matter that we may encounter or [[experience]] in everyday life, including our bodies). '''Non-baryonic matter''', as implied by the name, is any sort of matter that is not primarily composed of baryons. This might include such ordinary matter as [[neutrino]]s or free [[electron]]s; however, it may also include exotic species of non-baryonic [[dark matter]], such as [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]], [[axion]]s or [[black hole]]s. The distinction between baryonic and non-baryonic matter is important in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], because [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] models set tight constraints on the amount of baryonic matter present in the early [[universe]].

The very existence of baryons is also a significant issue in cosmology because we have assumed that the Big Bang produced a state with equal amounts of baryons and antibaryons. The process by which baryons come to outnumber their antiparticles is called [[baryogenesis]] (in contrast to a process by which [[lepton]]s account for the predominance of matter over antimatter, [[leptogenesis (physics)|leptogenesis]]).

==Baryogenesis==

{{Main|Baryogenesis}}

Experiments are consistent with the number of quarks in the universe being a constant and, more specifically,  the number of baryons being a constant; in technical language, the total [[baryon number]] appears to be ''[[conservation law|conserved]].''  Within the prevailing [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the number of baryons may change in multiples of three due to the action of [[sphaleron]]s, although this is rare and has not been observed experimentally.  Some [[grand unified theory|grand unified theories]] of particle physics also predict that a single [[proton]] can decay, changing the baryon number by one; however, this has not yet been observed experimentally. The excess of baryons over antibaryons in the present universe is thought to be due to non-[[conservation of baryon number]] in the very early universe, though this is not well understood.

==Properties==
===Isospin and charge===

{{Main|Isospin}}

The concept of isospin was first proposed by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1932 to explain the similarities between protons and neutrons under the [[strong interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Heisenberg (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Although they had different electric charges, their masses were so similar that physicists believed they were actually the same particle. The different electric charges were explained as being the result of some unknown excitation similar to spin. This unknown excitation was later dubbed ''isospin'' by [[Eugene Wigner]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wigner (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief lasted until [[Murray Gell-Mann]] proposed the [[quark model]] in 1964 (containing originally only the u, d, and s quarks).&lt;ref&gt;M. Gell-Mann (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the isospin model is now understood to be the result of the similar masses of the u and d quarks. Since the u and d quarks have similar masses, particles made of the same number then also have similar masses. The exact specific u and d quark composition determines the charge, as u quarks carry charge +{{frac|2|3}} while d quarks carry charge −{{frac|1|3}}. For example the four Deltas all have different charges ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}} (uuu), {{SubatomicParticle|Delta+}} (uud), {{SubatomicParticle|Delta0}} (udd), {{SubatomicParticle|Delta-}} (ddd)), but have similar masses (~1,232&amp;nbsp;MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) as they are each made of a total of three u and d quarks. Under the isospin model, they were considered to be a single particle in different charged states.

The mathematics of isospin was modeled after that of spin. Isospin projections varied in increments of 1 just like those of spin, and to each projection was associated a &quot;[[state (physics)|charged state]]&quot;. Since the &quot;Delta particle&quot; had four &quot;charged states&quot;, it was said to be of isospin ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}}. Its &quot;charged states&quot; {{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta0}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Delta-}}, corresponded to the isospin projections ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|3|2}}, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|1|2}}, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|1|2}}, and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|3|2}} respectively. Another example is the &quot;nucleon particle&quot;. As there were two nucleon &quot;charged states&quot;, it was said to be of isospin {{frac|1|2}}. The positive nucleon {{SubatomicParticle|Nucleon+}} (proton) was identified with ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|1|2}} and the neutral nucleon {{SubatomicParticle|Nucleon0}} (neutron) with ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|1|2}}.&lt;ref name=WongA&gt;S.S.M. Wong (1998a)&lt;/ref&gt; It was later noted that the isospin projections were related to the up and down quark content of particles by the relation:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{3}=\frac{1}{2}[(n_\mathrm{u}-n_\mathrm{\bar{u}})-(n_\mathrm{d}-n_\mathrm{\bar{d}})],&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''n'''s are the number of up and down quarks and antiquarks.

In the &quot;isospin picture&quot;, the four Deltas and the two nucleons were thought to be the different states of two particles. However in the quark model, Deltas are different states of nucleons (the N&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; or N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are forbidden by [[Pauli's exclusion principle]]). Isospin, although conveying an inaccurate picture of things, is still used to classify baryons, leading to unnatural and often confusing nomenclature.

===Flavour quantum numbers===
{{Main|Flavour (particle physics)#Flavour quantum numbers}}

The [[strangeness]] [[flavour (particle physics)#Flavour quantum numbers|flavour quantum number]] ''S'' (not to be confused with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers only works well for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d and one other quark and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets (for example ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called ''symmetric'', as they would all behave in exactly the same way with respect to the strong interaction. Since quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be [[broken symmetry|broken]].

It was noted that charge (''Q'') was related to the isospin projection (''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[baryon number]] (''B'') and flavour quantum numbers (''S'', ''C'', ''B''&amp;prime;, ''T'') by the [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]]:&lt;ref name=WongA/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q=I_\mathrm{3}+\frac{1}{2}(B+S+C+B^\prime+T),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S'', ''C'', ''B''&amp;prime;, and ''T'' represent the [[strangeness]], [[charm (quantum number)|charm]], [[bottomness]] and [[topness]] flavour quantum numbers respectively. They are related to the number of strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks and antiquark according to the relations:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S=-(n_\mathrm{s}-n_\mathrm{\bar{s}}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C=+(n_\mathrm{c}-n_\mathrm{\bar{c}}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B^\prime=-(n_\mathrm{b}-n_\mathrm{\bar{b}}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T=+(n_\mathrm{t}-n_\mathrm{\bar{t}}),&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula is equivalent to the expression of charge in terms of quark content:
:&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{2}{3}[(n_\mathrm{u}-n_\mathrm{\bar{u}})+(n_\mathrm{c}-n_\mathrm{\bar{c}})+(n_\mathrm{t}-n_\mathrm{\bar{t}})]-\frac{1}{3}[(n_\mathrm{d}-n_\mathrm{\bar{d}})+(n_\mathrm{s}-n_\mathrm{\bar{s}})+(n_\mathrm{b}-n_\mathrm{\bar{b}})].&lt;/math&gt;

===Spin, orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum===
{{Main|Spin (physics)|Orbital angular momentum|Total angular momentum|Quantum numbers|Clebsch-Gordan coefficients}}
[[Spin (physics)|Spin]] (quantum number ''S'') is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity that represents the &quot;intrinsic&quot; [[angular momentum]] of a particle. It comes in increments of {{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;[[Plank's constant|ħ]] (pronounced &quot;h-bar&quot;). The ħ is often dropped because it is the &quot;fundamental&quot; unit of spin, and it is implied that &quot;spin 1&quot; means &quot;spin 1&amp;nbsp;ħ&quot;. In some systems of [[natural units]], ħ is chosen to be 1, therefore does not appear anywhere.

[[Quark]]s are [[fermion]]ic particles of spin {{frac|1|2}} (''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}}). Because spin projections varies in increments of 1 (that is 1&amp;nbsp;ħ), a single quark has a spin vector of length {{frac|1|2}}, and has two spin projections (''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|1|2}} and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|1|2}}). Two quarks can have their spins aligned, in which case the two spin vectors add to make a vector of length ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and three spin projections (''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1). If two quarks have unaligned spins, the spin vectors add up to make a vector of length ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and has only one spin projection (''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), etc. Since baryons are made of three quarks, their spin vectors can add to make a vector of length ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}} which has four spin projections (''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|3|2}}, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|1|2}}, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|1|2}}, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|3|2}}), or a vector of length ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} with two spin projections (''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|1|2}}, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|1|2}}).&lt;ref name=Shankar&gt;R. Shankar (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another quantity of angular momentum, called the [[orbital angular momentum]] (quantum number ''L''), that comes in increments of 1&amp;nbsp;ħ, which represent the angular moment due to quarks orbiting around each other. The total angular momentum (quantum number ''J'') of a particle is therefore the combination of intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and orbital angular momentum. It can take any value from {{nowrap|''J'' {{=}} {{!}}''L'' − ''S''{{!}}}} to {{nowrap|''J'' {{=}} {{!}}''L'' + ''S''{{!}}}}, in increments of 1.

&lt;/center&gt;

Particle physicists are most interested in baryons with no orbital angular momentum (''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), as they correspond to [[ground state]]s—states of minimal energy. Therefore the two groups of baryons most studied are the ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}}; ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}}; ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, which corresponds to ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, although they are not the only ones. It is also possible to obtain ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; particles from ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} and ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, as well as ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}} and ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. This phenomena of having multiple particles in the same total angular momentum configuration is called ''[[degenerate energy level|degeneracy]]''. How to distinguish between these degenerate baryons is an active area of research in [[baryon spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Garcilazo ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.M. Manley (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parity===
{{Main|Parity (physics)}}

If the universe were reflected in a mirror, most of the laws of physics would be identical—things would behave the same way regardless of what we call &quot;left&quot; and what we call &quot;right&quot;. This concept of mirror reflection is called ''[[parity (physics)|intrinsic parity]]'' or ''parity'' (''P''). [[Gravity]], the [[electromagnetic force]], and the [[strong interaction]] all behave in the same way regardless of whether or not the universe is reflected in a mirror, and thus are said to [[P-symmetry|conserve parity]] (P-symmetry). However, the weak interaction ''does'' distinguish &quot;left&quot; from &quot;right&quot;, a phenomenon called [[parity violation]] (P-violation). 

Based on this, one might think that if the [[wavefunction]] for each particle (more precisely, the [[quantum field]] for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the new set of wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy the laws of physics (apart from the weak interaction). It turns out that this is not quite true: In order for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by −1, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have ''negative'' or ''odd'' parity (''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1, or alternatively ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;–), while the other particles are said to have ''positive'' or ''even'' parity (''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1, or alternatively ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+).

For baryons, the parity is related to the orbital angular momentum by the relation:&lt;ref name=WongB&gt;S.S.M. Wong (1998b)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P=(-1)^L.\ &lt;/math&gt;

As a consequence, baryons with no orbital angular momentum (''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) all have even parity (''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+).

==Nomenclature==
Baryons are classified into groups according to their [[isospin]] (''I'') values and [[quark]] (''q'') content. There are six groups of baryons—[[nucleon]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Nucleon}}), [[Delta baryon|Delta]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta}}), [[Lambda baryon|Lambda]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Lambda}}), [[Sigma baryon|Sigma]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Sigma}}), [[Xi baryon|Xi]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Xi}}), and [[Omega baryon|Omega]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Omega}}). The rules for classification are defined by the [[Particle Data Group]]. These rules consider the [[up quark|up]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Up quark}}), [[down quark|down]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Down quark}}) and [[strange quark|strange]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Strange quark}}) quarks to be ''light'' and the [[charm quark|charm]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Charm quark}}), [[bottom quark]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Bottom quark}}), and [[top quark|top]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Top quark}}) to be ''heavy''. The rules cover all the particles that can be made from three of each of the six quarks, even though baryons made of t quarks are not expected to exist because of the [[top quark|t quark's short lifetime]]. The rules do not cover pentaquarks.&lt;ref name=PDGBaryonsymbols&gt;C. Amsler ''et al.'' (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/namingrpp.pdf Naming scheme for hadrons]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Baryons with three {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} and/or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} quarks are {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Nucleon}}'s (''I'' = {{frac|1|2}}) or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Delta}}'s (''I'' = {{frac|3|2}}).
* Baryons with two {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} and/or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} quarks are {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Lambda}}'s (''I'' = 0) or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Sigma}}'s (''I'' = 1). If the third quark is heavy, its identity is given by a subscript.
* Baryons with one {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} quark are {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Xi}}'s (''I'' = {{frac|1|2}}). One or two subscripts are used if one or both of the remaining quarks are heavy.
* Baryons with no {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} quarks are {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Omega}}'s (''I'' = 0), and subscripts indicate any heavy quark content.
* Baryons that decay strongly have their masses as part of their names. For example, Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; does not decay strongly, but Δ&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;(1232) does.

It is also a widespread (but not universal) practice to follow some additional rules when distinguishing between some states which would otherwise have the same symbol.&lt;ref name=WongA/&gt;
* Baryons in [[total angular momentum]] ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|2}} configuration which have the same symbols as their ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} counterparts are denoted by an asterisk (&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;).
* Two baryons can be made of three different quarks in ''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} configuration. In this case, a prime (&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;) is used to distinguish between them.
:* ''Exception'': When two of the three quarks are one up and one down quark, one baryon is dubbed Λ while the other is dubbed Σ.

Quarks carry charge, so knowing the charge of a particle indirectly gives the quark content. For example, the rules above say that a {{SubatomicParticle|charmed Xi+}} contains a c quark and some combination of two u and/or d quarks. The c quark as a charge of (''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|2|3}}), therefore the other two must be a u quark (''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+{{frac|2|3}}), and a d quark (''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{frac|1|3}}) to have the correct total charge (''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Braille embosser''' is a [[computer printer|printer]], necessarily an [[impact printer]], that renders text as tactile [[Braille]] cells. Using [[Braille translator|Braille translation]] software, a document can be embossed with relative ease, making Braille production much more efficient and cost-effective.

Blind users tend to call other printers &quot;ink printers&quot;, to distinguish them from
their Braille counterparts. This is often the case regardless of the type of printer being discussed.

As with ink printers and presses, embossers range from those intended for consumers to those used by large publishers. Thus, an embosser can cost roughly anywhere from US$2,000 to $80,000, depending on the user's needs.

The fastest industrial Braille embosser is probably the $77,000 Belgian-made &quot;NV Interpoint 55&quot;, first produced in 1991, which uses a separate air compressor to drive the embossing head and can output up to 800 Braille characters per second.  Adoption was slow at first; in 2000 the [[National Federation of the Blind|NFB]] said there were only 3 of these in the USA, one owned by the NFB itself and the other two by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society [http://nfb.org/legacy/bm/bm00/bm0005/brlm0005.htm].  As of 2008 there are more than 60 in use across the world [http://www.givengain.com/unique/blindsa/upload/blindsa1008.doc].

Smaller (and slower) Braille embossers are more common and can be found in some libraries, universities, and specialist education centres, as well as being privately owned by some blind individuals.  Particularly with some lower-priced embossers, it is sometimes necessary to mount the embosser on its own table, as otherwise the vibrations can damage the computer by eventually causing microchips and other components to come loose from the circuit boards.

Braille embossers usually need special Braille paper which is thicker and more expensive than normal paper.  Some high-end embossers are capable of printing on normal paper.  Embossers can be either one-sided or two-sided.  Duplex embossing requires lining up the dots so they do not overlap (called &quot;interpoint&quot; because the points on the other side are placed in between the points on the first side).

Once one copy of a document has been produced, printing further copies is often quicker by means of a device called a &quot;thermoform&quot;, which produces copies on soft plastic.  However the resulting Braille is not as easily readable as Braille that has been freshly embossed, in much the same way that a poor-quality photocopy is not as readable as the original.  Hence large publishers do not generally use thermoforms.

'''''Basic Role-Playing''''' ('''''BRP''''') is a [[role-playing game system]] which originated in the [[fantasy]]-oriented ''[[RuneQuest]]'' [[role-playing game]] rules. A percentile skill-based system, ''BRP'' was used as the basis for most of the games published by [[Chaosium]], including ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'', ''[[Worlds of Wonder]]'', ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[Superworld]]'', ''[[Ringworld (RPG)|Ringworld]]'', ''[[Elfquest]]'', ''[[Hawkmoon]]'', ''Elric!'', and ''[[Nephilim (RPG)|Nephilim]]''. ''[[Pendragon (role-playing game)|Pendragon]]'' (acquired in 1998 by [[Green Knight Publishing]], and 2005 by White Wolf), while related, has sufficiently different mechanics that it can be seen as a separate system. The ''BRP'' standalone booklet was first released in [[1980 in games|1980]]. Two years later it became part of the ''[[Worlds of Wonder]]'' boxed set. The first edition boxed set of ''Call of Cthulhu'' included the booklet as its character creation rules. [[Greg Stafford]] and [[Lynn Willis]] are credited as the authors.

''BRP'' is similar to other generic systems such as ''[[GURPS]]'', ''[[Hero System]]'' or ''[[Savage Worlds]]'' in that it uses a simple resolution method which can be broadly applied. In this case an attempt to roll under a certain number with percentile dice. Each incarnation of the ''BRP'' rules has changed or added to the core ideas and mechanics, so that games are not identical.  For example, in ''Call of Cthulhu'', skills may never be over 100%, while in ''Stormbringer'' skills in excess of 100% are within reach for all characters. 

In 2004, Chaosium published the ''Basic Roleplaying'' monographs (the hyphen was dropped in the later products).  Books with a quick and inexpensive printed format of tape binding and printed cardstock covers, the four monographs (''Players Book'', ''Magic Book'', ''Creatures Book'', and ''Gamemaster Book'') were printed in order to assert Chaosium's copyrights in the run-up to the publishing and distribution of ''Deluxe Basic Roleplaying'', a game system that is essentially ''RuneQuest 3rd Edition'' but with additions to allow play in other genres.

Chaosium released a new version of ''BRP'' on June 24th, 2008 as single comprehensive book. Currently they are selling both a printed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Chaosium| authorlink = Chaosium| publisher = Chaosium| title=Chaosium Catalog |url = http://catalog.chaosium.com/product_info.php?cPath=37&amp;products_id=1256| format = catalog| accessdate =2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pdf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Chaosium| authorlink = Chaosium| publisher = Chaosium| title=Chaosium Catalog |url = http://catalog.chaosium.com/product_info.php?cPath=70&amp;products_id=1257| format = catalog| accessdate =2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; version of the game.

== History ==

The core rules were originally written by [[Steve Perrin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Ehara| first =Tadashi| authorlink = | coauthors =  | title =My Life and Role-Playing| journal =[[Different Worlds]]| volume = | issue =Issue 3| pages =8–9| publisher =[[Chaosium]]| year = 1979| month = June/July}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his game ''RuneQuest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Donohoe| first =jim| authorlink = | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Runequest| journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]| volume = | issue =Issue 11| pages =18–19| publisher =[[Games Workshop]]| year = 1979| month = Feb/March| issn = 0265-8712}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Greg Stafford]]'s idea to simplify the rules (eliminating such things as Strike Ranks and Hit Locations) and issue them in a 16 page booklet called ''Basic Role Playing''. Over the years several others, including [[Sandy Petersen]], [[Lynn Willis]], and [[Steve Henderson (game designer)|Steve Henderson]], contributed to their final form.

The ''BRP'' was notable for being the first role-playing game system to introduce a full skill system to characters regardless of their profession.  This was developed in ''RuneQuest'' but was also later adopted by the more skill-oriented ''Call of Cthulhu''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

''BRP'' was conceived of as a genre-generic engine around which any sort of RPG could be played, much like ''GURPS'' and the d20 system have become today. In order to underscore this, Chaosium produced the ''[[Worlds of Wonder]]'' supplement, which contained the generic rules and several specific applications of those rules to given genres. ''[[Superworld]]'', specifically, began as a portion of the ''Worlds of Wonder'' product.

The fantasy game supplement ''[[Thieves World]]'', based on the popular series of books by [[Robert Asprin|Robert Lynn Asprin]], used both the system for [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'']] as well as the ''RuneQuest'' variation of the ''BRP'' for character statistics, representing the two most popular game systems of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Rules System ==
''BRP'' was developed from a core set of [[Ability score|attributes]] similar to the original ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D'').   Size, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Power, and Appearance (or Charisma) replaced the D&amp;D norms. From that was evolved a structurally simulationist system. Therefore hit points, which increase with experience in ''D&amp;D'' were based on the average of Size and Constitution and were functionally stable for the life of the character. [[Skill (role-playing)|Skill]]s, using a d100, rather than the ''D&amp;D'' d20, were used to simulate the way that people learn skills. [[Experience point]]s were replaced by an experience check, rolling higher than your current skill on a d100. This created a learning curve that leveled out the higher a skill was. 

Armour, which had been merged with defence in ''D&amp;D'', was broken out. The act of parrying was a skill, the ability of the armor to absorb damage was a separate function. The last major element of many ''BRP'' games is that there is no difference between the player character race systems and that of the monster or opponents.  This element is shared with and originated in ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]''.  By varying ability scores, the same system is used for a human hero as a trollish villain. This approach also led quickly, as it did in ''T&amp;T'', to players playing a wide range of non-human characters and game worlds that were deeply pluralist.

== Licensed Games ==
Chaosium was an early adopter of licensing out its ''BRP'' system to other companies, something that was unique at the time they began but rather commonplace now thanks to the d20 licenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhotg7&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory7.phtml |title=Brief History of the Game |accessdate=2007-09-14 |author=Shannon Appelcline |date=2006-11-02 |work= |publisher=RPG.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This places the ''BRP'' in the notable position of being one of the first products to allow other game companies to develop games or game aids for their work. Companies such as Green Knight and Pagan Publishing earliest works were built to support Chaosium's games.

Other, non-Chaosium games have used ''BRP'' for its core rules. ''[[Other Suns]]'', published by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] (FGU), used them under license. In addition, ''[[Corum]]'', a supplement to the ''Stormbringer'' rules, was published in the fall of 2001 by [[Darcsyde Productions]]. 

''BRP'' was used (through a special arrangement with Swedish Fredrik Malmberg) as the base for the highly successful Swedish game ''[[Drakar och Demoner]]'' from [[Target Games]].

''BRP'' was also licensed to Oriflam in France to create a French language second edition of the ''Hawkmoon'' game called ''Hawkmoon, Nouvelle Edition''. This version updated the original ''Hawkmoon'' mechanics to more closely parallel those in the newer ''Elric!'' game as well as adding sophisticated new rule systems specific to the setting (e.g. Mutations and 'Weird Science'). 

''BRP'' was also licensed to Japanese companies. ''BRP'' games in Japanese are ''[[Houkago Kaiki Club]]'' (1997, school life and horror, [[Hobby Japan]]), ''[[Genom Seed]]'' (2004, mutant action, [[Shinkigensha]]) and ''[[Taitei no Ken RPG]]'' (2007, [[SciFi]]-[[jidaigeki]], based on movie of the same title, ''[[Shinkigensha]]'').

== Awards ==
The ''BRP'' itself has been the recipient, via its games, of many awards.  Most notably was the 1981 [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Roleplaying Rules'' for ''Call of Cthulhu''.&lt;ref name=&quot;orgwin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originsgames.com/awards/1981/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (1981) |accessdate=2007-09-14 |author=Origins |date= |work= |publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other editions of ''Call of Cthluhu'' have also won Origins Awards including the Hall of Fame award. The ''BRP'' Character Generation software has also won awards for its design.

In [[cryptography]], a '''block cipher''' is a [[symmetric key algorithm|symmetric key]] [[cipher]] operating on fixed-length groups of [[bit]]s, called [[Block (telecommunications)|block]]s, with an unvarying transformation. A block cipher encryption algorithm might take (for example) a 128-bit block of [[plaintext]] as input, and output a corresponding 128-bit block of ciphertext. The exact transformation is controlled using a second input &amp;mdash; the secret [[key (cryptography)|key]]. Decryption is similar: the decryption algorithm takes, in this example, a 128-bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key, and yields the original 128-bit block of plain text.

A message longer than the [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] (128 bits in the above example) can still be encrypted with a block cipher by breaking the message into blocks and encrypting each block individually. However, in this method all blocks are encrypted with the same key, which degrades security (because each repetition in the plaintext becomes a repetition in the ciphertext). To overcome this issue, [[block cipher modes of operation|modes of operation]] are used to make encryption probabilistic.
Some modes of operation, despite the fact that their underlying implementation is a block cipher, allow the encryption of individual bits. The resulting cipher is called a [[stream cipher]].

An early and highly influential block cipher design was the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES), developed at [[IBM]] and published as a standard in 1977. A successor to DES, the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES), was adopted in 2001.

==Generalities==
A block cipher consists of two paired algorithms, one for encryption, ''E'', and the other for decryption, ''E&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. Both algorithms accept two inputs: an input block of size ''n'' bits and a [[key (cryptography)|key]] of size ''k'' bits, yielding an ''n''-bit output block. For any one fixed key, decryption is the [[inverse function]] of encryption, so that
:&lt;math&gt;E_K(M) = C \; ; \quad E_K^{-1}(C)=M&lt;/math&gt;
for any block ''M'' and key ''K''. ''M'' is termed the plaintext and ''C'' the ciphertext.

For each key ''K'', ''E&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[permutation]] (a [[bijective]] mapping) over the set of input blocks. Each key selects one permutation from the possible set of &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[block size (cryptography)|block size]], ''n'', is typically 64 or 128 bits, although some ciphers have a variable block size. 64 bits was the most common length until the mid-1990s, when new designs began to switch to the longer 128-bit length. One of several [[block cipher modes of operation|modes of operation]] is generally used along with a [[padding (cryptography)|padding]] scheme to allow plaintexts of arbitrary lengths to be encrypted. Each mode has different characteristics in regard to error propagation, ease of random access and vulnerability to certain types of attack. Typical [[key size]]s (''k'') include 40, 56, 64, 80, 128, 192 and 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 bits. {{As of|2011}}, 256 bits is normally taken as the minimum key length needed to prevent [[brute force attack]]s. For creating ciphers with arbitrary block sizes (or on domains that aren't powers of two) see [[Format-preserving encryption]].

Most block ciphers are constructed by repeatedly applying a simpler function. This approach is known as ''iterated block cipher'' (see also [[product cipher]]). Each iteration is termed a ''round'', and the repeated function is termed the ''round function''; anywhere between 4 to 32 rounds are typical.

Usually, the round function ''R'' takes different round keys ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' as second input, which are derived from the original key:
:&lt;math&gt;M_i = R_{K_i}(M_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is the plaintext and &lt;math&gt;M_r&lt;/math&gt; the ciphertext, with ''r'' being the round number.

Frequently, [[key whitening]] is used in addition to this. At the beginning and the end, the data is modified with key material (often with [[Exclusive or|XOR]], but simple arithmetic operations like adding and subtracting are also used):
:&lt;math&gt; M_0 = M \oplus K_0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_i = R_{K_i}(M_{i-1})\; ; \; i = 1 \dots r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = M_r \oplus K_{r+1}&lt;/math&gt;

Many block ciphers can be categorised as [[Feistel network]]s, or, as more general [[substitution-permutation network]]s. [[Arithmetic]] operations, [[Logic gate|logical operations]] (especially [[Exclusive or|XOR]]), [[S-box]]es and various [[permutation]]s are all frequently used as components.

==History==

[[Lucifer (cipher)|Lucifer]] is generally considered to be the first civilian block cipher, developed at [[IBM]] in the 1970s based on work done by [[Horst Feistel]]. A revised version of the algorithm was adopted as a [[United States|US]] government [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] standard, the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES). It was chosen by the US National Bureau of Standards (NBS) after a public invitation for submissions and some internal changes by [[NBS]] (and, potentially, the [[NSA]]). DES was publicly released in 1976 and has been widely used.

DES was designed to, among other things, resist a certain cryptanalytic attack known to the NSA and rediscovered by IBM, though unknown publicly until rediscovered again and published by [[Eli Biham]] and [[Adi Shamir]] in the late 1980s. The technique is called [[differential cryptanalysis]] and remains one of the few general attacks against block ciphers; [[linear cryptanalysis]] is another, but may have been unknown even to the NSA, prior to its publication by [[Mitsuru Matsui]]. DES prompted a large amount of other work and publications in [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]] in the open community and it inspired many new cipher designs.

DES has a block size of 64 bits and a [[key size]] of 56 bits. 64-bit blocks became common in block cipher designs after DES. [[Key (cryptography)|Key]] length depended on several factors, including government regulation. Many observers in the 1970s commented that the 56-bit key length used for DES was too short. As time went on, its inadequacy became apparent, especially after a special purpose machine designed to break DES was demonstrated in 1998 by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. A variant of DES, [[Triple DES]], triple-encrypts blocks with (usually) two different keys (2TDES), resulting in a 112-bit keys and 80-bit security. It was widely adopted as a replacement and is still (2009) considered secure.

DES has been superseded as a [[United States]] Federal Standard by the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES), adopted by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) in 2001 after a 5-year [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|public competition]]. The cipher was developed by two [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]] cryptographers, [[Joan Daemen]] and [[Vincent Rijmen]], and submitted under the name ''Rijndael.'' (See [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] page for pronunciation.) AES has a block size of 128 bits and three possible [[key size]]s, 128, 192 and 256 bits. The US Government permits the use of AES to protect [[classified information]] in systems approved by [[NSA]].

==Cryptanalysis==
In addition to linear and [[differential cryptanalysis]], there is a growing catalog of attacks: [[truncated differential cryptanalysis]], partial differential cryptanalysis, [[integral cryptanalysis]], which encompasses square and integral attacks, [[slide attack]]s, [[boomerang attack]]s, the [[XSL attack]], [[impossible differential cryptanalysis]] and algebraic attacks. For a new block cipher design to have any credibility, it must demonstrate evidence of security against known attacks.

==Tweakable block ciphers==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
M. Liskov, R. Rivest, and D. Wagner have described a generalized version of block ciphers called &quot;tweakable&quot; block ciphers. A tweakable block cipher accepts a second input called the ''tweak'' along with its usual plaintext or ciphertext input. The tweak, along with the key, selects the permutation computed by the cipher. If changing tweaks is sufficiently lightweight (compared with a usually fairly expensive key setup operation), then some interesting new operation modes become possible. The [[disk encryption theory]] article describes some of these modes.

== Block ciphers and other cryptographic primitives ==

Block ciphers can be used to build other cryptographic primitives. For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure care has to be taken to build them the right way.

[[Stream cipher]]s can be built using block ciphers. OFB-mode and CTR mode are [[Block cipher modes of operation|block modes]] that turn a block cipher into a stream cipher.

[[Cryptographic hash function]]s can be built using block ciphers. See [[one-way compression function]] for descriptions of several such methods. The methods resemble the [[block cipher modes of operation]] usually used for encryption.

Just as block ciphers can be used to build [[Cryptographic hash function|hash functions]], hash functions can be used to build block ciphers. Examples of such block ciphers are [[SHACAL]], BEAR and LION.

[[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s (CSPRNGs) can be built using block ciphers.

Secure pseudorandom permutations of arbitrarily sized finite sets can be constructed with block ciphers; see [[Format-Preserving Encryption]].

[[Message authentication code]]s (MACs) are often built from block ciphers. [[CBC-MAC]], [[One-key MAC|OMAC]] and [[PMAC (cryptography)|PMAC]] are such MACs.

[[Authenticated encryption]] is also built from block ciphers. It means to both encrypt and MAC at the same time. That is to both provide [[confidentiality]] and [[authentication]]. [[CCM mode|CCM]], [[EAX mode|EAX]], [[Galois/Counter Mode|GCM]] and [[OCB mode|OCB]] are such authenticated encryption modes.

'''Wireless Broadband''' is a fairly&lt;!--not encyclopedic--&gt; new technology that provides high-speed [[wireless Internet]] access and [[computer networking|data network]] access over a wide area.

==The term broadband==
According to the [[IEEE 802.16|802.16-2004]] standard, broadband means &quot;having instantaneous [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidths]] greater than 1 [[MHz]] and supporting data rates greater than about 1.5 [[Megabit|Mbit]]/s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.16.html Coexistence of Fixed Broadband Wireless Access Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Wireless Broadband networks feature speeds roughly equivalent to wired broadband networks, such as that of [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] or a [[cable modem]].  Wireless Broadband networks can also be Symmetrical, meaning bandwidth traveling in both directions (download/upload), which is most commonly associated with 'Fixed Wireless' networks. A Fixed Wireless network link is a stationary terrestrial wireless connection (similar to satellite, but with far superior speeds), rather than mobile, which allows for greater speeds.

==Abbreviation==

The acronym &quot;WiBro&quot; is entering the vernacular as a contraction of &quot;Wireless Broadband&quot;, in much the same way as &quot;WiFi&quot; refers to 802.11 or similar wireless networks. {{Original Research|date=January 2011}}{{Citation needed|date= January 2011}}

==Technology and speeds==

[[Image:100-0023 IMG.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A typical WISP Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) installed on a residence.]]

Few [[Wireless Internet Service Provider]]s (WISPs) provide download speeds of over 100 Mbit/s; most broadband wireless access services are estimated to have a range of 50&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;miles) from a tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WiMAX: Broadband Wireless Access|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3412391|publisher=wi-fiplanet.com|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies used include [[LMDS]] and [[MMDS]], as well as heavy use of the [[ISM band]]s and one particular access technology is being standardized by [[IEEE 802.16]], also known as [[WiMAX]]. [[WiMAX]] is highly popular in Europe but has not met full acceptance in the United States because cost of deployment does not meet [[return on investment]] figures. In 2005 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] adopted a [[Report and Order]] that revised the FCC’s rules to open the 3650 [[Hertz|MHz]] band for terrestrial wireless broadband operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT AND ORDER – Released: March&amp;nbsp;16, 2005|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-56A1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 14, 2007 the Commission released Public Notice DA 07-4605 in which the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau announced the start date for licensing and registration process for the [[IEEE 802.11y-2008|3650–3700 MHz]] band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PUBLIC NOTICE – Released: November&amp;nbsp;14, 2007|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-07-4605A1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently the FCC adopted the TV White Space Rules (TVWS) and allowed some of the better none line of sight frequency (700&amp;nbsp;MHz) into the FCC Part-15 Rules (http://www.wispa.org/?p=3146).  The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, (http://www.wispa.org) a National association of WISPs, petition the FCC and won.  Because of this we will see new products on the market that will be far superior to the Wi-Fi standard, allowing for better coverage in rural areas.

Initially, WISPs were only found in rural areas not covered by [[cable]] or [[DSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A WISP with Vision|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/columns/article.php/3652986|publisher=wi-fiplanet.com|accessdate=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early WISPs would employ a high-capacity [[T-carrier]], such as a [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] or [[DS3]] connection, and then broadcast the signal from a high elevation, such as at the top of a [[water tower]]. To receive this type of Internet connection, consumers mount a small [[Parabolic antenna|dish]] to the roof of their home or office and point it to the transmitter. [[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of sight]] is usually necessary for WISPs operating in the [[IEEE 802.11|2.4 and 5 GHz]] bands with 900&amp;nbsp;MHz offering better [[NLOS]] (non-line-of-sight) performance.

===Mobile wireless broadband===
Also called [[Mobile Broadband]], wireless broadband technologies include new services from companies such as [[Verizon]], [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]], and [[AT&amp;T Mobility]], which allow a more mobile version of this broadband access. Consumers can purchase a [[PC card]], laptop card, or [[USB]] equipment to connect their PC or laptop to the Internet via [[cell phone tower]]s. This type of connection would be stable in almost any area that could also receive a strong cell phone connection. These connections can cost more for portable convenience as well as having speed limitations in all but urban environments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

On June 2, 2010, after months of discussion,  AT&amp;T became the first wireless Internet provider to announce plans to charge according to usage. As the only [[iPhone]] service in the United States, AT&amp;T experienced the problem of excess Internet use more than other providers. About 3 percent of AT&amp;T [[Smartphone|smart phone]] customers account for 40 percent of the technology's use. 98 percent of the company's customers use less than 2 [[gigabyte]]s (4000 page views, 10,000 emails or 200 minutes of [[Streaming media|streaming video]]), the limit under the $25 monthly plan, and 65 percent use less than 200 [[megabyte]]s, the limit for the $15 plan. For each gigabyte in excess of the limit, customers would be charged $10 a month starting June 7, 2010, though existing customers would not be required to change from the $30 a month unlimited service plan. The new plan would become a requirement for those upgrading to the new iPhone technology later in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/06/03/1509693/att-first-carrier-to-end-unlimited.html |title=AT&amp;T first carrier to end unlimited data plans |last=Bartash |first=Jefffrey|work=[[MarketWatch]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=2010-06=03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing==
A wireless connection can be either licensed or unlicensed. In the US, licensed connections use a private [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] the user has secured rights to from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). In other countries, spectrum is licensed from the country's national radio communications authority (such as the [[ACMA]] in Australia or [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] in Nigeria). Licensing is usually expensive and often reserved for large companies who wish to guarantee private access to spectrum for use in point to point communication. Because of this, most wireless ISP's use [[unlicensed spectrum]] which is publicly shared.

===Demand for spectrum in the US===
{{Main|National Broadband Plan (United States)}}

In the United States, more of the [[Radio spectrum|broadcast spectrum]] was needed for wireless [[broadband Internet access]], and in March 2009, Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]] introduced a bill requiring a study of efficient use of the spectrum.

Later in the year, the [[CTIA - The Wireless Association|CTIA]] said 800&amp;nbsp;MHz needed to be added. David Donovan of [[AMST|The Association for Maximum Service Television]] said the [[S band|2 GHz band]], allocated for [[mobile satellite service]], was not even being used after ten years, and switching to this band would be better than asking broadcasters to give up even more. Because of the [[DTV transition in the United States|digital transition]], television had lost 100 of its 400&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/356595-Broadcasters_Tackle_Spectrum_Sharing_Debate.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Broadcasters Tackle Spectrum-Sharing Debate|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=October 5, 2009|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Association of Broadcasters]] and the AMST commented to the FCC that the government should make maximum use of this newly available spectrum and other spectrum already allocated for wireless before asking for more, while companies that would benefit asked the government to look everywhere possible.&lt;ref name=defend&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/366470-Broadcasters_Defend_Spectrum_From_Reclamation_Proposals.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Broadcasters Defend Spectrum From Reclamation Proposals|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=October 26, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nov2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/367021-Broadcasters_Defend_Their_Spectrum.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Broadcasters Defend Their Spectrum|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many broadcasters objected.&lt;ref name=defend/&gt;

Meredith Attwell Baker, the newest [[Republican Party in the United States|Republican]] FCC commissioner, agreed that properly using the existing spectrum was important, and part of doing this was using the latest technology. The wireless industry needed more spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/366209-Q_A_Baker_Seeks_Spectrum.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Q&amp;A: Baker Seeks Spectrum|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=October 26, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FCC broadband advisor Blair Levin wanted a plan by February 2010.&lt;ref name=nov2/&gt; Another proposal was &quot;geo-filtered [[WiMAX]]&quot;, which would allow [[HDTV]] but only in a particular market, with the remainder of the spectrum sold for $60&amp;nbsp;billion. WiMax would replace the existing services but would make [[MVPD]] services cheaper, while still allowing broadcasters to make more money. The additional spectrum made available could then be sold to pay the industry's debt.&lt;ref name=nov2/&gt;

An FCC workshop on November 23, 2009 produced several ideas. [[Virginia Tech]] professor Charles Bostian said sharing should be done, but not in the [[White spaces (radio)|white spaces]]; [[WiFi]] spectrum should be used instead. Vint Cerf of [[Google]] said cable companies could share some spectrum, which the companies would like to do except they have &quot;must-carry&quot; rules that will not allow this. [[BBN Technologies]] chief engineer Chip Elliott called for government-funded broadband to be shared by researchers. Collaboration was the key to advancing the technology, and the word &quot;collaboratories&quot; referred to broadband as &quot;not only the goal of the research, but the vehicle as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/390234-Academics_Execs_Signal_Need_For_More_Bandwidth_Money_For_Broadband_Research.php?rssid=20103&amp;q=digital+tv

Wi-Fi testing using white spaces took place in [[Virginia]] in Fall 2009 and in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/450679-Wilmington_Tests_WiFi_in_White_Spaces_.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Wilmington Tests WiFi in White Spaces|last=Eggerton|first=John|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=February 24, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 2009 at a hearing before the Communications Subcommittee of the [[House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee]], NAB president [[Gordon H. Smith]] recommended using white space in rural areas with fixed devices rather than mobile devices, and new types of broadband service such as those developed by [[Sezmi]]. CTIA president Steve Largent said that the industry needed spectrum, &quot;wherever it comes from.&quot; He said government spectrum probably was not efficiently used and would &quot;likely&quot; be &quot;repurposed&quot;, while other broadcast and satellite spectrum &quot;may&quot; be used better for wireless. Largent also said without more spectrum, companies might merge to better use what they had. Consultant Dave Hatfield, former FCC engineering and technology chief, said making maximum use of existing spectrum through [[Video compression|compression]] and [[modulation]] would help, but it would not be enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/440398-Broadcast_Wireless_Industries_Keep_Powder_Dry.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv

Mark Wigfield, broadband spokesman for the FCC, pointed out that even in the unlikely event all broadcasters in a market gave up their spectrum, the FCC would have to guarantee that some over-the-air service remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC Has Legal Obligation to Preserve Free TV|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Björn Rune Borg''' ({{IPA-sv|bjœːɳ bɔrj|-|sv-Björn Borg.ogg}}; born 6 June 1956) is a former [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] tennis player from [[Sweden]]. Between 1974 and 1981 he won 11 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles. He won five consecutive [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] singles titles (a record shared with [[Roger Federer]]) and four consecutive French Open singles titles (a record shared with [[Rafael Nadal]]). He is considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9910-1165988,00.html &quot;Navratilova joins Laver and Borg on the shortlist (as voted for by . . .

During his relatively brief pro career, Borg won 41% of the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles tournaments he entered (11 of 27) and 89.81% (141–16) of the Grand Slam singles matches he played, which is an all time record. He also has the highest all surfaces (grass, clay, hard, carpet, court) career match winning percentage of any other male player 82.72 (735/608). All three are [[History of tennis#Open era|open era]] [[ATP World Tour records|male records]] for an entire career. In addition, Borg's six French Open singles titles are an open era male record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/jon_wertheim/news/2002/09/23/mailbag/ &quot;Compare and contrast&quot;], Jon Wertheim, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 23 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2006-05-24-borg-cover_x.htm &quot;Borg still making the shots&quot;], Douglas Robson, ''[[USA Today]]'', 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of four players in the open era to win both Wimbledon and the French Open in the same year and the only player to do so for three consecutive years. He also won three year end championship titles including two [[Masters Cup|Masters Grand Prix]] titles and one [[WCT Finals|WCT Final]] title. In addition he won 14 [[Grand Prix Tennis Championship Series 1970-1989|Championship Series ]] titles (1974-1980) the precursors to the current [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters 1000]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Life and career==
Borg was born in [[Södertälje]], Sweden. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racquet that his father won at a [[table-tennis]] tournament. His father gave him the racquet, beginning his tennis career.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

A player of great athleticism and endurance, he had a distinctive style and appearance—bowlegged, yet very fast. His muscularity allowed him to put heavy topspin on both his forehand and backhand. He used a then unorthodox two-handed backhand, adapted from the slap shot in hockey, a game he favored as a child. By the time he was 13 he was beating the best of Sweden's under-18 players, and Davis Cup captain Lennart Bergelin cautioned against anyone trying to change Borg's rough-looking, jerky strokes. They were effective.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Borg joined the professional circuit at age 14. In 1972, at the age of 15, Borg became one of the youngest players ever to represent his country in the [[Davis Cup]] and won his debut singles rubber in five sets against seasoned professional [[Onny Parun]] of New Zealand. Later that year, he won the Wimbledon junior singles title, recovering from a 5-2 deficit in the final set to overcome Britain's Buster Mottram.

In 1973, Borg reached the Wimbledon main draw quarterfinals in his first attempt. Just before his 18th birthday in 1974, Borg won his first top-level singles title at the [[Rome Masters|Italian Open]], becoming its youngest winner. Two weeks later he became the then-youngest winner of the [[French Open]] defeating [[Manuel Orantes]] in the final 2–6, 6–7, 6–0, 6–1, 6–1. Barely 18 at the time, Borg was the youngest-ever male French Open champion (the record has since been lowered by [[Mats Wilander]] in 1982 and [[Michael Chang]] in 1989).

In early 1975, Borg defeated the great [[Rod Laver]], then 36 years old, in a semifinal of the [[World Championship Tennis]] (WCT) finals in [[Dallas, Texas]] 7–6, 3–6, 5–7, 7–6, 6–2. Borg subsequently lost to [[Arthur Ashe]] in the final.

Borg retained his French Open title in 1975, beating [[Guillermo Vilas]] in the final in straight sets (three sets). Borg then reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals, where he lost to eventual champion Ashe 2–6, 6–4, 8–6, 6–1. Borg did not lose another match at Wimbledon until 1981.

Borg won two singles and one doubles rubber in the 1975 Davis Cup final as Sweden beat [[Czechoslovakia]] 3–2. With these singles wins, Borg had won 19 consecutive Davis Cup singles rubbers since 1973. That was already a record at the time. But Borg never lost another Davis Cup singles rubber, and, by the end of his career, he had stretched that winning streak to 33—a Davis Cup record that still stands.

In early 1976, Borg won the [[World Championship Tennis]] year ending [[WCT Finals]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] with a four-set victory over [[Guillermo Vilas]] in the final.

At the 1976 French Open Borg lost to the Italian [[Adriano Panatta]], who remains the only player to defeat Borg at this tournament. Panatta did it twice: in the fourth round in 1973 (7–6, 2–6, 7–5, 7–6), and in the 1976 quarter-finals (6–3, 6–3, 2–6, 7–6).

Borg won Wimbledon in 1976 without losing a set, defeating the favored [[Ilie Năstase]] in the final. Borg became the youngest male Wimbledon champion of the modern era at 20 years and 1 month (a record subsequently broken by [[Boris Becker]], who won Wimbledon aged 17 in 1985). It would be the last time Borg played Wimbledon as an underdog. Ilie Năstase later exclaimed,&quot;We're playing tennis, he's [Borg] playing something else.&quot;

Borg also reached the final of the 1976 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]], which was then being played on clay courts. Borg lost in four sets to World No. 1 [[Jimmy Connors]].

Borg skipped the French Open in 1977 because he was under contract with [[World Team Tennis|WTT]], but he repeated his Wimbledon triumph, although this time he was pushed much harder. He defeated his good friend [[Vitas Gerulaitis]] in a semifinal 6–4, 3–6, 6–3, 3–6, 8–6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742097.stm &quot;Classic Matches: Borg v Gerulaitis&quot;], [[BBC Sport]], 31 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the final, Borg was pushed to five sets for the third time in the tournament, this time by Connors. The win propelled Borg to the #1 ranking on the computer, albeit for just one week in August.

Through 1977 he had never lost to a player younger than himself.

Borg was at the height of his career from 1978 through 1980, completing the difficult French Open-Wimbledon double all three years.

In 1978, Borg won the French Open with a win over Vilas in the final. Borg did not drop a set during the tournament, a feat only he, Năstase (in 1973), and Rafael Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) have accomplished at the French Open during the open era.

Borg defeated Connors in straight sets at the 1978 Wimbledon. At the US Open, now held on hard courts in Flushing Meadow, New York, he lost the final in straight sets to Connors. That autumn, Borg faced [[John McEnroe]] for the first time in a semifinal of the Stockholm Open and was upset 6–3, 6–4.

Borg lost to McEnroe again in four sets in the final of the 1979 WCT Finals but was now overtaking Connors for the top ranking. Borg established himself firmly in the top spot with his fourth French Open singles title and fourth straight Wimbledon singles title, defeating Connors in a straight-set semifinal at the latter tournament. At the French Open, Borg defeated big-serving [[Victor Pecci]] in a four-set final, and at Wimbledon, Borg took five sets to overcome an even bigger server, [[Roscoe Tanner]]. Borg was upset by Tanner at the US Open, in a four-set quarterfinal played under the lights.

At the season-ending [[Tennis Masters Cup|Masters]] tournament in January 1980, Borg survived a close semifinal against McEnroe 6–7, 6–3, 7–6(1). He then beat Gerulaitis in straight sets, winning his first Masters and first title in New York. In June, he overcame Gerulaitis, again in straight sets, for his fifth French Open title. Again, he did not drop a set.

Borg won his fifth consecutive Wimbledon singles title, the [[1980 Wimbledon Men's Singles final]], by defeating McEnroe in a five-set match, often cited as the best Wimbledon final ever played. Having lost the opening set 6–1 to an all-out McEnroe assault, Borg took the next two 7–5, 6–3 and had two Championship points at 5–4 in the fourth. But McEnroe averted disaster and went on to level the match in Wimbledon's most memorable 34-point tiebreaker, which he won 18–16. In the fourth-set tiebreak, McEnroe saved five match points and Borg six set points before McEnroe won the set. Bjorn served first to begin the 5th set and fell behind 15–40. Borg then won 19 straight points on serve in the deciding set and prevailed after 3 hours, 53 minutes. Borg himself commented years later that this was the first time that he was afraid that he would lose, as well as feeling that it was the beginning of the end of his dominance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Adams | coauthors= | title='I can't explain except to say I wanted to play again. It was madness' | date=7 January 2007 | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/jan/07/tennis.features2 | work=The Observer | accessdate =7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Borg married Romanian tennis pro [[Mariana Simionescu]] in [[Bucharest]] on 24 July 1980.

He defeated McEnroe in the final of the 1980 Stockholm Open, 6–3, 6–4, and faced him one more time that year, in the round-robin portion of the year-end Masters, played in January 1981. With 19,103 fans in attendance, Borg won a deciding third-set tie-break for the second year in a row, 6–4, 6–7, 7–6(2). Borg then defeated [[Ivan Lendl]] for his second Masters title, 6–4, 6–2, 6–2.

Borg won his last Grand Slam title at the French Open in 1981, defeating Lendl in a five-set final. Borg's six French Open singles titles remains a record in the Open era for a male player.

In reaching the Wimbledon final in 1981, Borg stretched his winning streak at the [[All England Club]] to a record 41 matches. In a semifinal, Borg was down to Connors by two sets to love before coming back to win the match 0–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–0, 6–4. However, Borg's streak was brought to an end by McEnroe, who defeated him in four sets, 4–6, 7–6, 7–6, 6–4.

Borg went on to lose to McEnroe at the 1981 US Open, 4–6, 6–2, 6–4, 6–3. After that defeat, Borg walked off court and out of the stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun. There are reports that Borg received threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would turn out to be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. Yet, Borg want to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.&lt;ref name = &quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot;/&gt;

Borg failed to win the US Open in 10 tries, losing four finals, 1976 and 1978 to Jimmy Connors, and 1980 and 1981 to McEnroe. He played on hard courts at the US Open from 1978–1981 and reached the final there on three occasions, in 1978, 1980, and 1981. He led 3–2 in the fifth set of the 1980 final, before losing. That match followed Borg's classic encounter with McEnroe at the 1980 Wimbledon. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, Borg was halfway to a Grand Slam after victories at the French and Wimbledon (the Australian Open being the last Grand Slam tournament of each year at the time) only to falter at Flushing Meadow, lefty Tanner his conqueror in 1979.

He appeared only once at the Australian Open, when he was 17, at which he lost in a early round.

In 1982, Borg played only one tournament, losing to [[Yannick Noah]] in the quarterfinals of [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] in April. Nevertheless, Borg's announcement in January 1983 that he was retiring from the game at the age of 26 was a shock to the tennis world. McEnroe tried unsuccessfully to persuade Borg to continue. (He did, however, play Monte Carlo again in March 1983, reaching the second round, and Stuttgart in July 1984.)

===Retirement===
When he retired Borg had a choice of homes, a penthouse in Monte Carlo, not far from his successful pro shop, and a small island off the Swedish coast. His marriage to the tennis player [[Mariana Simionescu]] ended in divorce, he fathered a child by another woman, and he was briefly married to the Italian singer [[Loredana Bertè]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot;/&gt; There were rumors of a drug overdose and an attempted suicide, yet Borg laughs them off as silly rumors. He states that he only took sleeping pills, yet the Italian press reported it as a suicide attempt,&lt;ref name = &quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot;/&gt; and he narrowly averted personal bankruptcy due to bad business partners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Duncan | last=Campbell | coauthors= | title=Borg trophies sale highlights aces and double faults of tennis stars | date=4 March 2006 | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/mar/04/sport.tennis | work=The Guardian | accessdate =7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= | coauthors= | title= Borg Bankruptcy Sought | date=24 October 1996 | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EEDF1030F937A15753C1A960958260 | work=The New York Times | accessdate =7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borg later bounced back as the owner of the Björn Borg fashion label, whose most noted advertising campaigns asked Swedes (from the pages of a leading national newspaper) to &quot;Fuck for the Future.&quot; His label has since become extremely successful second only to [[Calvin Klein]] in his home country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2007-01-07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjornborg.com/en/ bjornborg.com homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted comeback===
In the early-1990s, Borg attempted a comeback on the men's professional tennis tour. In doing so, he rather eerily grew his hair out as it had been when he retired and returned to using wooden rackets – he had kept his hair cut and used modern graphite rackets in exhibitions he played during the later 1980s. This time around, however, he was completely unsuccessful. In fact, Borg failed to win a single match. He faced [[Jordi Arrese]] in his first match back, again at Monte Carlo, and fell 2–6, 3–6. In his first nine matches, played in 1991 and 92, Borg failed to win a single set. He fared slightly better in 1993, taking a set off his opponent in each of the three matches he played. He came closest to getting a win in what turned out to be his final tour match, falling 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7) to [[Alexander Volkov (tennis)|Alexander Volkov]]. 

Borg later joined the champions tour, returning to shorter hair and modern racquets in the process.

==Memorabilia preserved==
In March 2006, [[Bonhams|Bonhams Auction House]] in London announced that it would auction Borg's Wimbledon trophies and two of his winning rackets on 21 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2006-03-03-borg-trophies-auction_x.htm Borg to auction off Wimbledon trophies]&lt;/ref&gt; Several players then called Borg wondering what he was thinking, but only McEnroe was able to make Borg reconsider. According to [[Dagens Nyheter]] – who had talked to Borg – McEnroe called from New York and asked, &quot;What's up? Have you gone mad?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=672&amp;a=532512&amp;previousRenderType=3 | title=McEnroe fick Borg på andra tankar | language=Swedish |work=DN Sport | date=28 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation apparently persuaded Borg to buy out the trophies from Bonhams at an undisclosed amount.

==Distinctions and honors==
*Borg was ranked by the ATP rankings World No. 1 in six different stretches between 1977 and 1981, totaling 109 weeks.
*During his career, he won a total of 77 (61 listed on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] website) top-level singles and four doubles titles.
*Borg won the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality]] Award in 1979.
*Borg was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1987.
*On 10 December 2006, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] gave Borg a Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented by [[Boris Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/6220542.stm Sports Personality: The winners]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Borg was named one of the 10 Most Superstitious Athletes by [[Men's Fitness]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mensfitness.com/sports_and_recreation/athletes/181 Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Place among the all-time greats==
With 11 titles, Borg ranks fourth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind [[Roger Federer]] (16), [[Pete Sampras]] (14), and [[Roy Emerson]] (12). The French Open-Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials &quot;the most difficult double in tennis&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/bjorn_borg.html &quot;Wimbledon Legends: Bjorn Borg&quot;], Wimbledon official website&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;a feat considered impossible among today's players.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/13/SPGGPL4KST1.DTL &quot;Strokes for Agassi: He belongs among the 10 greatest ever&quot;], Bruce Jenkins, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 13 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Only Rafael Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Roger Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Andre Agassi]] and [[Roger Federer]] are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career.

In his 1979 autobiography, [[Jack Kramer (tennis player)|Jack Kramer]], the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, [[Bud Collins]] chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14489546/ &quot;Top Stars of Tennis&quot;], [[Bud Collins]], [[MSNBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[ESPN.com]] asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories—defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness—with his mental game and footwork singled-out as the best in open era history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/flash/perfect GO.com homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Borg never won the US Open or the Australian Open, losing in the final at the US Open four times. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players [[John McEnroe]] and [[Jimmy Connors]]. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. [[Phil Dent]], a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments – especially the Australian Open – was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french07/columns/story?columnist=desimone_bonnie&amp;id=2882705 Chris Evert owned Roland Garros like no other]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, another contemporary [[Arthur Ashe]] told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', &quot;I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam. But by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like Elvis or Liz Taylor or somebody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1140719/index.htm &quot;Unbjorn&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2009}}
Borg had one of the most distinctive playing styles in the open era. Borg played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes and a double-handed backhand (very rare at the time and unorthodox). He hit the ball hard and high from the back of the court and brought it down with considerable topspin, which made his ground strokes very consistent.&lt;ref name=bbc_legends&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742099.stm |title=Wimbledon Legends:Björn Borg|accessdate=20 January 2009|publisher=BBC   | date=31 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been other players, particularly Rod Laver and [[Arthur Ashe]], who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand. Yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots and pass their opponents at the net easily. Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.

Complementing his consistent ground-strokes was his fitness. Both of these factors allowed Borg to be dominant at the French Open.

One of the factors that made Borg unique was his dominance on the grass courts of Wimbledon, where baseliners since World War II did not usually succeed. Some experts attributed his dominance on this surface to his consistency, an underrated serve, and his adaptation to grass courts. Against the best players, he almost always served-and-volleyed on his first serves (but he naturally played from the baseline after his second serves).

Another trait usually associated with Borg is his grace under pressure. His calm court demeanor earned him the nickname of the &quot;Ice Man&quot; or &quot;Ice-Borg.&quot;&lt;ref name=UKTelegraph&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/10/25/stborg125.xml|title= Bjorn Borg: My life is perfect|accessdate=13 May 2008|author=Mark Hodgkinson|date= 25 October 2007|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borg's physical conditioning was legendary and unrivalled. He could outlast most of his opponents under the most grueling conditions. Contrary to popular belief, however, this wasn't due to his exceptionally low resting heart rate, often reported to be near 35 beats per minute. In his introduction to Borg's autobiography ''My Life and Game'', Eugene Scott relates that this rumor arose from a medical exam the 18-year-old Borg once took for military service, where his pulse was recorded as 38. Scott goes on to reveal Borg's true pulse rate as &quot;about 50 when he wakes up and around 60 in the afternoon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Borg, Björn, and Eugene L. Scott. ''My Life and Game'' (1980), page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Borg is credited with helping to develop the style of play that has come to dominate the game today. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

For each tournament, he has indicated the city, the date of the final, the winner, the runner-up, and the score of the final. A tournament is included in his list if: (1) the draw for the tournament included at least eight players (with a few exceptions, such as the Pepsi Grand Slam tournaments in the second half of the 1970s which included only players that had won a Grand Slam tournament); and (2) the level of the tournaments was at least equal to the present day challenger tournaments. Sutter's book is probably the most exhaustive source of tennis tournament information since World War II, even though some professional tournaments held before the start of the open era are missing. Later, Sutter issued a second edition of his book, with only the players, their wins, and years for the 1946 through 27 April 2003, period.

The '''Booch method''' is a technique used in [[software engineering]]. It is an [[object modeling language]] and methodology that was widely used in [[object-oriented analysis and design]]. It was developed by [[Grady Booch]], while at [[Rational Software]] (now part of [[IBM]]).

The notation aspect of the Booch method has now been superseded by the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE).

Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP).

The '''Battle of the Nile''' (also known as the '''Battle of Aboukir Bay''', in [[French language|French]] as the '''''Bataille d'Aboukir''''' or in [[Egyptian Arabic]] as ''معركة أبي قير البحرية'') was a major naval battle fought between British and French fleets at [[Aboukir Bay]] on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[Egypt]] from 1&amp;ndash;3 August 1798. The battle was the climax of a [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|naval campaign]] that had ranged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months, as a large French convoy sailed from [[Toulon]] to [[Alexandria]], carrying an expeditionary force under General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The French were defeated by the British forces led by
Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]].

Bonaparte had sought to invade Egypt, as the first step in a campaign against [[British India]] whose ultimate aim was to drive Britain out of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson, sent from the British fleet in the [[Tagus]], to establish the purpose of the French expedition and defeat it. For more than two months, Nelson chased the French, on several occasions only missing them by a matter of hours. Bonaparte, aware of Nelson's pursuit, enforced absolute secrecy about his destination and was able to capture [[Malta]] and then land in Egypt without interception by the British force.

With the French army ashore, the fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay, a station {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Alexandria, in a formation that its commander, Vice-Admiral [[François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]], believed established a formidable defensive position. When Nelson's fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys's dispositions, he ordered an immediate attack, and his ships advanced on the French line. As they approached, they split into two divisions, one of which cut across the head of the line and passed between the anchored French and the shore while the other engaged the seaward side of the French fleet. Trapped in a crossfire, the leading French ships were battered into surrender during a fierce three-hour battle, while the centre was able to successfully repel the initial British attack. As British reinforcements arrived, the centre came under renewed assault, and at 22:00 the French flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] exploded. With Brueys dead and his [[:wikt:vanguard|van]] and centre defeated, the rear division of the French fleet attempted to break out of the bay, but ultimately only two [[ships of the line]] and two [[frigate]]s escaped, from a total of 17 ships engaged.

The battle reversed the strategic situation in the Mediterranean, and allowed the [[Royal Navy]] to assume a dominant position which it would retain for the rest of the war. It also encouraged other European countries to turn against France, and was a factor in the outbreak of the [[War of the Second Coalition]]. Bonaparte's army was trapped in Egypt, and Royal Navy dominance off the Syrian coast contributed significantly to its defeat at the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]] in 1799, which preceded Bonaparte's return to Europe. Nelson, who had been wounded in the battle, was proclaimed a hero across Europe and was subsequently made [[Baron Nelson]]. His captains were also highly praised, and would go on to form the nucleus of the legendary [[Nelsonic Band of Brothers]]. The battle has remained prominent in the popular consciousness, with perhaps the best-known representation being [[Felicia Hemans]]'s 1826 poem ''[[Casabianca (poem)|Casabianca]]''.

==Background==
Following [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s victories over the [[Austrian Empire]] in Northern Italy–helping to secure France victory in the [[War of the First Coalition]] in 1797–[[Great Britain]] remained the only major European power still at war with the [[First French Republic|French Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SM224&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 224]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Directory]] investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]], and the expansion of the [[French Navy]] to challenge the [[Royal Navy]] at sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ113&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 113]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term,&lt;ref name=&quot;PP116&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 116]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. However, the French Navy was dominant in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], following the withdrawal of the British fleet after the outbreak of war between Britain and [[Spain]] in 1796.&lt;ref name=&quot;JK36&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 36]]&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Bonaparte to propose an [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|invasion of Egypt]] as an alternative to confronting Britain directly, believing that the British would be too distracted by an imminent [[Irish rebellion of 1798|Irish uprising]] to intervene in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;JHR141&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 141]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonaparte believed that by establishing a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral [[Ottoman Empire]]) the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against [[British India]], possibly in conjunction with the anglophobic [[Tippoo Sultan]] of [[Seringapatam]], that might successfully drive the British out of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA7&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 7]]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, an essential part of her [[British Empire|Empire]] whose trade links generated the wealth Britain required to prosecute the war successfully.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM230&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 230]]&lt;/ref&gt; The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns as far from France as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;NR457&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Rodger|Rodger, p. 457]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled over 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at [[Toulon]]; he also formed the ''[[Commission des Sciences et des Arts]]'', a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish the French colony in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;JC17&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 17]]&lt;/ref&gt; The destination of the expedition was kept top secret; most of the army's officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte himself did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;JC11&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonaparte's armada sailed from Toulon on 19 May 1798, making rapid progress through the [[Ligurian Sea]] and collecting more ships at [[Genoa]] before sailing southwards along the [[Sardinia]]n coast, passing [[Sicily]] on 7 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC353&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 353]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 June the fleet arrived off [[Malta]], then under the ownership of the [[Knights of St. John of Jerusalem]], ruled by [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JC8&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 8]]&lt;/ref&gt; Bonaparte demanded that his fleet be permitted entry to the fortified harbour of [[Valetta]], and when the demand was refused the French general responded by ordering a large scale invasion of the Maltese Islands, overrunning the defenders after 24 hours of skirmishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG21&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 21]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Knights formally surrendered on 12 June and, in exchange for substantial financial compensation, handed the islands and all of their resources over to Bonaparte, including the extensive property of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on Malta.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ151&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 151]]&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week Bonaparte had resupplied his ships, and on 19 June his fleet departed for [[Alexandria]] in the direction of [[Crete]], leaving 4,000 men at Valetta under General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois|Claude-Henri Vaubois]] to ensure French control of the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA13&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 13]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bonaparte was sailing to Malta, the Royal Navy re-entered the Mediterranean for the first time in over a year. Alarmed by reports of French preparations on the Mediterranean coast, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] at the [[Admiralty]] sent a message to Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St. Vincent]], commander of the Mediterranean Fleet based in the [[Tagus River]], to despatch a squadron to investigate.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM233&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 233]]&lt;/ref&gt; This squadron, consisting of three [[ships of the line]] and three [[frigates]], was entrusted to Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Sir Horatio Nelson]]. Nelson was a highly experienced officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in [[Corsica]] in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish [[ships of the line]] at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] in February 1797. However in July 1797 he had lost an arm at the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and had been forced to return to Britain to recuperate.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP109&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 109]]&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at [[Gibraltar]] and sail for the Ligurian Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ148&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 148]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May, as Nelson's squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson's flagship [[HMS Vanguard (1787)|HMS ''Vanguard'']] lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;JK44&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 44]]&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the squadron was scattered; the ships of the line sheltered at [[San Pietro Island]] off Sardinia, while the frigates were blown to the west and failed to return.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA9&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 9]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June, following hasty repairs to his flagship, Nelson was joined off Toulon by a fleet of ten ships of the line and a [[fourth rate]] ship. The fleet was under the command of Captain [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge]], and had been sent by Earl St. Vincent to reinforce Nelson with orders that he was to pursue and intercept the Toulon convoy.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM241&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 241]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although he now had enough ships to challenge the French fleet, Nelson suffered two great disadvantages: he had no intelligence regarding the destination of the French, and no frigates to scout ahead of his force.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC354&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 354]]&lt;/ref&gt; Striking southwards in the hope of collecting information about French movements, Nelson's ships stopped at [[Elba]] and [[Naples]], where the British ambassador [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] reported that the French fleet had passed Sicily in the direction of Malta.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG29&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 29]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite pleas from Nelson and Hamilton, [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand of Naples]] refused to lend his frigates to the British fleet, fearing French reprisals.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB176&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 176]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, Nelson encountered a brig sailing from [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] and was told that the French had sailed eastwards from Malta on 16 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM254&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 254]]&lt;/ref&gt; After conferring with his captains, the admiral decided that the French target must be Egypt and set off in pursuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;JK55&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 55]]&lt;/ref&gt; Incorrectly believing the French to be five days ahead rather than two, Nelson insisted on a direct route to Alexandria without deviation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NR459&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Rodger|Rodger, p. 459]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 22 June, Nelson's fleet passed the French in the darkness, overtaking the slow invasion convoy without realising how close they were to their target.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM258&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 258]]&lt;/ref&gt; Making rapid time on a direct route, Nelson reached Alexandria on 28 June and discovered that the French were not there.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ154&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 154]]&lt;/ref&gt; After a meeting with the suspicious Ottoman commander Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim, Nelson ordered the British fleet northwards, reaching the coast of [[Anatolia]] on 4 July and turning westwards back towards Sicily.&lt;ref name=&quot;JK59&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 59]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson had missed the French by less than a day, the scouts of the French fleet arriving off Alexandria in the evening of 29 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG26&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 26]]&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned by his close encounter with Nelson, Bonaparte ordered an immediate invasion, his troops coming ashore in a poorly managed [[amphibious operation]] in which at least 20 drowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA17&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 17]]&lt;/ref&gt; Marching along the coast, the French army stormed Alexandria and captured the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;JC22&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 22]]&lt;/ref&gt; before Bonaparte led the main force of his army inland.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC356&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 356]]&lt;/ref&gt; He instructed his naval commander, Vice-Admiral [[François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]], to anchor in Alexandria harbour, but naval surveyors reported that the channel into the harbour was too shallow and narrow for the larger ships of the French fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA21&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 21]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an alternative anchorage  was selected at [[Aboukir Bay]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM257&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 257]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson's fleet reached [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] on Sicily on 19 July and took on essential supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ155&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 155]]&lt;/ref&gt; There the admiral wrote letters describing the events of the previous months: &quot;It is an old saying, 'the Devil's children have the Devil's luck.' I cannot find, or at this moment learn, beyond vague conjecture where the French Fleet are gone to. All my ill fortune, hitherto, has proceeded from want of frigates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA19&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 19]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 24 July his fleet was resupplied and, having determined that the French must be somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, Nelson sailed again in the direction of [[Morea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SM265&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 265]]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 July at [[Koroni|Coron]], intelligence was finally obtained describing the French attack on Egypt and Nelson turned south across the Mediterranean. His scouts, [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] and [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']], discovered the French transport fleet at Alexandria on the afternoon of 1 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC355&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 355]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aboukir Bay===
When Alexandria harbour proved inadequate for his fleet, Brueys had gathered his captains and discussed their options. Bonaparte had ordered the fleet to anchor in Aboukir Bay, a shallow and exposed anchorage, but had supplemented the orders with the suggestion that if Aboukir Bay was too dangerous Brueys could sail north to [[Corfu]], leaving only the transports and a handful of lighter warships at Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;JHR142&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 142]]&lt;/ref&gt; Brueys refused, in the belief that his squadron could provide essential support to the French army on shore, and called his captains aboard his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] to discuss their response should Nelson discover the fleet in its anchorage. Despite vocal opposition from Contre-Admiral [[Armand Blanquet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EB199&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 199]]&lt;/ref&gt;  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a [[line of battle]] inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ159&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 159]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria and three days later issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,&lt;ref name=&quot;JHR143&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 143]]&lt;/ref&gt; although the courier carrying the instructions was intercepted and killed by [[Bedouin]] [[Irregular military|partisans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB192&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 192]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers&lt;br/&gt;artist unknown, [[Palace of Versailles]]|alt=A man in an ornate naval uniform with long grey hair stands on a ship's quarterdeck.]]
Aboukir Bay is a coastal indentation {{convert|16|nmi|km}} across, stretching from the village of [[Abu Qir]] in the west to the town of [[Rosetta]] to the east, where one of the mouths of the [[River Nile]] empties into the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM268&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 268-269]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798 the bay was protected at its western end by extensive rocky shoals, which ran {{convert|3|mi|km}} into the bay from a [[promontory]] guarded by Aboukir Castle. The shoals were also protected by a small fort situated on [[Nelson's Island|an island]] among the rocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC357&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 357]]&lt;/ref&gt; The fort was garrisoned by French soldiers and armed with at least four cannon and two heavy [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ160&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 160]]&lt;/ref&gt; Brueys had augmented the fort with his [[bomb vessels]] and [[gunboats]], which were anchored among the rocks to the west of the island in a position to give support to the head of the French line. Further shoals ran unevenly to the south of the island and extended across the bay in a rough semicircle approximately {{convert|1650|yd|m}} from the shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC358&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 358]]&lt;/ref&gt; These shoals were too shallow to permit passage of larger warships, and so Brueys ordered his thirteen ships of the line to form up in a line of battle following the northeastern edge of the shoals to the south of the island, a position that allowed the ships to disembark supplies from their port side while covering the landings with their starboard batteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG31&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 31]]&lt;/ref&gt; Orders were issued for each ship to attach strong cables to the bow and stern of their neighbours, which would effectively turn the line into a long battery forming a theoretically impregnable barrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW66&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 66]]&lt;/ref&gt; A second inner line of four frigates was positioned approximately {{convert|350|yd|m}} west of the main line, roughly halfway between the line and the shoal. The [[:wikt:vanguard|van]] of the French line was led by [[French ship Guerrier (1754)|''Guerrier'']], positioned {{convert|2400|yd|m}} southeast of Aboukir Island and about {{convert|1000|yd|m}} from the edge of the shoals that surrounded the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ160&quot;/&gt; The line then stretched southeast with the centre bowed seawards away from the shoal. The French ships were spaced at intervals of {{convert|160|yd|m}} and the whole line was {{convert|2850|yd|m}} long,&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC359&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 359]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the flagship ''Orient'' at the centre and two large 80-gun ships anchored either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM260&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 260]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rear division of the line was under the command of Contre-Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] in [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ160&quot;/&gt;

In deploying his ships in this way, Brueys hoped that the British would be forced by the shoals to attack his strong centre and rear, allowing his van to use the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack the British once they were engaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP120&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 120]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had made a serious misjudgement: there was enough room between ''Guerrier'' and the shoal for an enemy ship to cut across the head of the French line, allowing the unsupported vanguard to be caught in a crossfire by two divisions of enemy ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA24&quot;/&gt; Brueys' dispositions had a second significant flaw: the 160&amp;nbsp;yard gaps between ships were large enough for a British ship to push through and break the French line.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG13&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 13]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, not all of his captains had followed his orders to attach cables to their neighbour's bow and stern, which would have prevented such a manoeuvre.&lt;ref name=&quot;JK63&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 63]]&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was exacerbated by the orders to only anchor at the bow, which allowed the ships to swing with the wind and widened the gaps. It also created areas within the French line that were not covered by the broadside of any ship. British vessels could anchor in those spaces and engage the French without reply. In addition, the deployment of his fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC372&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 372]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells and collect water.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW66&quot;/&gt; However, constant attacks by Bedouin partisans required each party to be escorted by heavily armed guards; hence, up to a third of the fleet's sailors were away from their ships at any one time.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM261&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 261]]&lt;/ref&gt; Brueys wrote a letter describing the situation to [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Minister of Marine]] [[Étienne Eustache Bruix]], reporting that &quot;Our crews are weak, both in number and quality. Our rigging, in general, out of repair, and I am sure it requires no little courage to undertake the management of a fleet furnished with such tools.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA22&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 22]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nelson's arrival===
[[File:Battle of the Nile, Whitcombe2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''Battle of the Nile, Augt 1st 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816, [[National Maritime Museum]]. The British fleet bears down on the French line.|alt=An engraved print showing a tightly packed line of 13 warships flying the French flag. The ships are firing on eight ships flying the British flag that are steadily approaching them from the right of the picture.]]
Although initially disappointed that the main French fleet was not at Alexandria, Nelson knew from the presence of the transports that they must be nearby. At 14:00 on 1 August, lookouts on [[HMS Zealous (1785)|HMS ''Zealous'']] reported the French anchored in Aboukir Bay, its signal lieutenant just beating the lieutenant on [[HMS Goliath (1781)|HMS ''Goliath'']] with the signal, but inaccurately describing 16 French ships of the line instead of 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP118&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 118]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, French lookouts on ''[[French ship Heureux (1783)|Heureux]]'', the ninth ship in the French line, sighted the British fleet approximately {{convert|9|nmi|km}} off the mouth of Aboukir Bay. The French initially reported just 11 British ships, as ''Swiftsure'' and ''Alexander'' were still returning from their scouting operations at Alexandria, and so were {{convert|3|nmi|km}} to the west of the main fleet, out of sight.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA23&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 23]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Troubridge's ship [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']] was also some distance from the main body, towing a captured merchant ship. At the sight of the French, Troubridge abandoned the vessel and made strenuous efforts to rejoin Nelson.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP118&quot;/&gt; Due to the need for so many sailors to work onshore, Brueys had not deployed any of his lighter warships as scouts, which left him unable to swiftly react to the sudden appearance of the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;NR460&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Rodger|Rodger, p. 460]]&lt;/ref&gt; As his ships readied for action, Brueys ordered his captains to gather for a conference on ''Orient'' and hastily recalled his shore parties, although most had still not returned by the start of the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA23&quot;/&gt; To replace them, large numbers of men were taken out of the frigates and distributed among the ships of the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ161&quot;/&gt; Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs ''Alerte'' and ''Railleur'' to act as decoys in the shallow waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC359&quot;/&gt; By 16:00, ''Alexander'' and ''Swiftsure'' were also in sight, although some distance from the main British fleet, and Brueys gave orders to abandon the plan to remain at anchor and instead for his line to set sails,&lt;ref name=&quot;NM265&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 265]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Blanquet protested the order on the grounds that there were not enough men aboard the French ships to both sail the ships and man the guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW72&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 72]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson then gave orders for his leading ships to slow down in order to allow the British fleet to approach in a more organised formation. Convinced by this that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day, Brueys rescinded his earlier order to sail.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB200&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 200]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Brueys may have been hoping that the delay would allow him to slip past the British during the night and thus follow Bonaparte's orders not to engage the British fleet directly if it could be avoided.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ161&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 161]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson ordered the fleet to slow down at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig &quot;springs&quot; on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their [[broadside]]s to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased maneuverability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under [[raking fire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC360&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 360]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson's plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria,&lt;ref name=SM268/&gt; was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive ''Orient'' would be fighting against three.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ162&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 162]]&lt;/ref&gt; The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division would be unable to easily join the battle and would be cut off from the front portions of the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ165&quot;/&gt; To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their mizenmast and also to hoist an illuminated [[White Ensign]], which was different enough from the [[French tricolour]] that it would not be mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ166&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 166]]&lt;/ref&gt; As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with ''Vanguard''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s officers, announcing as he rose: &quot;Before this time tomorrow I shall have gained a [[peerage]] or [[Westminster Abbey]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PP119&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 119]]&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.

Shortly after the French order to set sails was abandoned, the British fleet began rapidly approaching once more and Brueys, now expecting to come under attack on that night, ordered each of his ships to also place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA23&quot;/&gt; The ''Alerte'' was sent ahead, passing close to the leading British ships and then steering sharply to the west over the shoal in the hope that the ships of the line might follow and become grounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB200&quot;/&gt; None of Nelson's captains fell for the ruse and the British fleet continued undeterred.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ162&quot;/&gt; At 17:30, Nelson hailed one of his two leading ships, HMS ''Zealous'' under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]], which had been racing ''Goliath'' to be the first to fire on the French. The admiral ordered Hood to establish the safest course into the harbour; the British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay except a rough sketch map ''Swiftsure'' had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on ''Zealous'',&lt;ref name=&quot;SM269&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 269]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a 35-year old French map aboard ''Goliath''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA24&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 24]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hood replied that he would take careful [[:wikt:sounding|soundings]] as he advanced to test the depth of the water,&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC361&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 361]]&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB202&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 202]]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Nelson paused to speak with the brig [[HMS Mutine (1797)|HMS ''Mutine'']], whose commander Lieutenant [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]] had seized some [[maritime pilots]] from a small Alexandrine vessel.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP123&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 123]]&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Vanguard'' came to a stop, the following ships slowed. This caused a gap to open up between ''Zealous'' and ''Goliath'' and the rest of the fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA24&quot;/&gt; To counter this effect, Nelson ordered [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']] under Captain [[Ralph Willett Miller|Ralph Miller]] to pass his flagship and join ''Zealous'' and ''Goliath'' in the vanguard.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC361&quot;/&gt; By 18:00, the British fleet was again under full sail, ''Vanguard'' sixth in the line of ten ships as ''Culloden'' trailed behind to the north, and ''Alexander'' and ''Swiftsure'' hastened to catch up to the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ163&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 163]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rapid change from a loose formation to a rigid line of battle both fleets raised their colours; each British ship added additional [[Union Jack]]s in its rigging in case its main flag was shot away.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ164&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 164]]&lt;/ref&gt; At 18:20, as ''Goliath'' and ''Zealous'' rapidly bore down on them, the leading French ships ''Guerrier'' and ''[[French ship Conquérant (1747)|Conquérant]]'' opened fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG33&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 33]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten minutes after the French opened fire ''Goliath'', ignoring fire from the fort to [[starboard]] and from ''Guerrier'' to [[port (nautical)|port]], most of which was too high to trouble the ship, crossed the head of the French line.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ164&quot;/&gt; Captain [[Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Foley]] had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between ''Guerrier'' and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB202&quot;/&gt; As the bow of ''Guerrier'' came within range, ''Goliath'' opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of ''Guerrier'',&lt;ref name=&quot;JK63&quot;/&gt; and Foley's [[Royal Marines]] and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW102&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 102]]&lt;/ref&gt; Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed ''Guerrier'' entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM266&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 266]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Goliath'' eventually stopped close to the bow of ''Conquérant'', opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate [[French frigate Sérieuse (1779)|''Sérieuse'']] and bomb vessel ''Hercule'' which were anchored inshore of the battle line.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC361&quot;/&gt; Foley's attack was followed by Hood in ''Zealous'', who also crossed the French line and successfully anchored next to ''Guerrier'' in the space Foley had intended, engaging the lead ship's bow from close range.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA25&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 25]]&lt;/ref&gt; Within five minutes ''Guerrier''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s foremast had fallen, to cheers from the crews of the approaching British ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC362&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 362]]&lt;/ref&gt; The French captains had been taken by surprise by the speed of the British advance, and were still aboard ''Orient'' in conference with the admiral when the firing started. Hastily launching their boats, they returned to their vessels. Captain [[Jean-François-Timothée Trullet]] of ''Guerrier'' shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on ''Zealous''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA25&quot;/&gt;

The third British ship into action was [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']] under Captain [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Sir James Saumarez]], which rounded the engagement at the head of the battle line and passed between the French main line and the frigates that lay closer inshore.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP124&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 124]]&lt;/ref&gt; As he did so, the frigate ''Sérieuse'' opened fire on ''Orion'', wounding two men. The convention in naval warfare of the time was that ships of the line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage, but in firing first French Captain [[Claude-Jean Martin]] had negated the rule and Saumarez waited until the frigate was at close range before replying.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA26&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 26]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orion'' needed just one broadside to reduce the frigate to a wreck, and Martin's disabled ship drifted away over the shoal.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ165&quot;/&gt; During the delay caused by this detour, two other British ships joined the battle: ''Theseus'', which had been disguised as a [[first-rate]] ship,&lt;ref name=&quot;OW109&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 109]]&lt;/ref&gt; followed Foley's track across ''Guerrier''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s bow. Miller steered his ship through the middle of the melee between the anchored British and French ships until he encountered the third French ship [[HMS Spartiate (1798)|''Spartiate'']]. Anchoring to port, Miller's ship opened fire at close range. [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']] under Captain [[Davidge Gould]] crossed the French line between ''Guerrier'' and ''Conquérant'', anchoring between the ships and raking them both.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC362&quot;/&gt;{{Cref2|Note B}} ''Orion'' then rejoined the action further south than intended, firing on the fifth French ship ''[[French ship Souverain (1792)|Peuple Souverain]]'' and Admiral Blanquet's flagship [[French ship Franklin (1797)|''Franklin'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ165&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 165]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three British ships, ''Vanguard'' in the lead followed by [[HMS Minotaur (1793)|HMS ''Minotaur'']] and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']], remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG33&quot;/&gt; Nelson focused his flagship's fire on ''Spartiate'', while Captain [[Thomas Louis]] in ''Minotaur'' attacked the unengaged ''[[French ship Aquilon (1789)|Aquilon]]'' and Captain [[John Peyton (Royal Navy officer)|John Peyton]] in ''Defence'' joined the attack on ''Peuple Souverain''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC362&quot;/&gt; With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] and [[HMS Majestic (1785)|HMS ''Majestic'']] passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP127&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 127]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than themselves and began to take severe damage: Captain [[Henry D'Esterre Darby|Henry Darby]] on ''Bellerophon'' missed his intended anchor near ''Franklin'' and instead found his ship underneath the main battery of the French flagship,&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA28&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 28]]&lt;/ref&gt; while Captain [[George Blagdon Westcott]] on ''Majestic'' also missed his station and almost collided with ''Heureux'', coming under heavy fire from [[HMS Tonnant (1792)|''Tonnant'']]. Unable to stop in time, Westcott's [[jib|jib boom]] became entangled with ''Tonnant''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Shroud (sailing)|shroud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB204&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 204]]&lt;/ref&gt; The French suffered too: Admiral Brueys on ''Orient'' was severely wounded in the face and hand by flying debris during the opening exchange of fire with ''Bellerophon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ176&quot;/&gt; The final ship of the British line, ''Culloden'' under Troubridge, sailed too close to Aboukir Island in the growing darkness and became stuck fast on the shoal.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA28&quot;/&gt; Despite strenuous efforts from the ''Culloden''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s boats, the brig ''Mutine'' and the 50-gun [[HMS Leander (1780)|HMS ''Leander'']] under Captain [[Sir Thomas Thompson, 1st Baronet|Thomas Thompson]], the ship of the line could not be moved, and the waves drove ''Culloden'' further onto the shoal, inflicting severe damage to the ship's hull.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC363&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 363]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrender of the French van===
At 19:00 the identifying lights in the mizenmasts of the British fleet were lit. By this time, ''Guerrier'' had been completely dismasted and heavily battered. ''Zealous'' by contrast was barely touched: Hood had situated ''Zealous'' outside the arc of most of the French ship's broadside and in any case ''Guerrier'' was not prepared for an engagement on both sides simultaneously, with its port guns blocked by stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ166&quot;/&gt; Although their ship was a wreck, the crew of ''Guerrier'' refused to surrender, continuing to fire the few functional guns whenever possible despite heavy answering fire from ''Zealous''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM267&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 267]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his cannon fire, Hood called up his Marines and ordered them to fire volleys of musket shot at the deck of the French ship, driving the crew out of sight but still failing to secure the surrender from Captain Trullet. It was not until 21:00, when Hood sent a small boat to ''Guerrier'' with a boarding party, that the French ship finally surrendered.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ166&quot;/&gt; ''Conquérant'' was defeated more rapidly, after heavy broadsides from passing British ships and the close attentions of ''Audacious'' and ''Goliath'' brought down all three masts before 19:00. With his ship immobile and badly damaged, the mortally wounded Captain [[Etienne Dalbarade]] [[Striking the colours|struck his colours]] and a boarding party seized control.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC364&quot;/&gt; Unlike ''Zealous'', these British ships suffered relatively severe damage in the engagement; ''Goliath'' lost most of its rigging, suffered damage to all three masts and received over 60 casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ167&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 167]]&lt;/ref&gt; With his opponents defeated, Captain Gould on ''Audacious'' used the spring on his cable to transfer fire to ''Spartiate'', the next French ship in line. To the west of the battle the battered ''Serieusé'' sank over the shoal. Its masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ165&quot;/&gt;

The transfer of ''Audacious''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s broadside to ''Spartiate'' meant that Captain [[Maurice-Julien Emeriau]] now faced three opponents. Within minutes all three of his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around ''Spartiate'' continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ167&quot;/&gt; Although ''Spartiate'' was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line ''Aquilon'', which uniquely of the French van squadron was fighting only one opponent, ''Minotaur''. Captain [[Antoine René Thévenard]] used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered over 100 casualties, including the admiral.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ167&quot;/&gt; At approximately 20:30, Nelson was struck over his blinded right eye by an iron splinter fired in a [[:wikt:langrage|langrage]] shot from ''Spartiate''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW92&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 92]]&lt;/ref&gt; The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ175&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 175]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson collapsed into the arms of Captain [[Edward Berry]] and was carried below. Certain that his wound was fatal, he cried out &quot;I am killed, remember me to my wife&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA29&quot;/&gt; and called for his chaplain [[Stephen George Comyn|Stephen Comyn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB205&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 205]]&lt;/ref&gt; The wound was immediately inspected by ''Vanguard''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s surgeon Michael Jefferson, who informed the admiral that it was a simple flesh wound and stitched the skin together.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA31&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 31]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson subsequently ignored Jefferson's instructions to remain inactive, returning to the quarterdeck shortly before the explosion on ''Orient'' to oversee the closing stages of the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG38&quot;/&gt; Although Thévenard's manoeuvre was successful, it placed his own bow under ''Minotaur''{{'}}s guns and by 21:25 the French ship was dismasted and battered, Captain Thévenard killed and his junior officers forced to surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ168&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 168]]&lt;/ref&gt; With his opponent defeated, Captain [[Thomas Louis]] then took ''Minotaur'' south to join the attack on ''Franklin''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC365&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 365]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth French ship, ''Peuple Souverain'', was attacked from either side by ''Defence'' and ''Orion'' and rapidly lost the fore and main masts.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ168&quot;/&gt; Aboard the ''Orion'', a wooden block was smashed off one of the ship's masts, killing two men before wounding Captain Saumarez in the thigh.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA30&quot;/&gt; On ''Peuple Souverain'', Captain [[Pierre-Paul Raccord]] was badly wounded and ordered his ship's anchor cable cut in an effort to escape the bombardment. ''Peuple Souverain'' drifted south towards the flagship ''Orient'', which mistakenly opened fire on the darkened vessel.&lt;ref name=&quot;IG59&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 59]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orion'' and ''Defence'' were unable to immediately pursue, as ''Defence'' had lost its fore topmast and ''Orion'' was narrowly missed by an improvised [[fireship]] that drifted through the battle. The origin of this vessel, an abandoned and burning ship's boat laden with highly flammable material, is uncertain but it may have been launched from ''Guerrier'' as the battle began.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ168&quot;/&gt; ''Peuple Souverain'' anchored not far from ''Orient'', but took no further part in the fighting. The wrecked ship surrendered during the night. ''Franklin'' remained in combat, but Blanquet had suffered a severe head wound and Captain Gillet had been carried below unconscious with severe wounds. Shortly afterwards, a fire broke out on the quarterdeck after an arms locker exploded, which was eventually extinguished with difficulty by the crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW94&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 94]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south, ''Bellerophon'' was in serious trouble as the huge broadside of ''Orient'' pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizenmast and mainmast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC366&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 366]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered over 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from ''Tonnant'' as the foremast collapsed as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG34&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 34]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orient'' had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC366&quot;/&gt; Admiral Brueys died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below by his men.&lt;ref name=&quot;IG58&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 58]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orient''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s captain [[Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca]] was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious,&lt;ref name=&quot;PP129&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 129]]&lt;/ref&gt; while his ten-year old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW88&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 88]]&lt;/ref&gt; The most-southerly British ship, ''Majestic'', had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun ''Tonnant'',&lt;ref name=&quot;PP128&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 128]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Among the dead was Captain [[George Blangdon Westcott]], who was killed by French musket fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM268&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 268]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged ''Majestic'' to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between ''Tonnant'' and the next in line ''Heureux'', engaging both.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ169&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 169]]&lt;/ref&gt; To support the centre, Captain Thompson of ''Leander'' abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded ''Culloden'' off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting ''Peuple Souverain'' and opening a fierce raking fire on ''Franklin'' and ''Orient''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC364&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 364]]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the battle raged in the bay, the two straggling British ships made strenuous efforts to join the engagement, focusing on the flashes of gunfire in the darkness. Warned away from the Aboukir shoals by the grounded ''Culloden'', Captain [[Benjamin Hallowell]] in ''Swiftsure'' passed the melee at the head of the line and aimed his ship at the French centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC363&quot;/&gt; Shortly after 20:00, a dismasted hulk was spotted drifting in front of ''Swiftsure'' and Hallowell initially ordered his men to fire before rescinding the order, concerned for the identity of the strange vessel. Hailing the battered ship, Hallowell received the reply &quot;Bellerophon, going out of action disabled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ169&quot;/&gt; Relieved that he had not accidentally attacked one of his own ships in the darkness, Hallowell pulled up between ''Orient'' and ''Franklin'' and opened fire on them both.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA29&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 29]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alexander'', the final unengaged British ship that had followed ''Swiftsure'', pulled up close to ''Tonnant'', which had begun to drift away from the embattled French flagship. Captain [[Alexander John Ball|Alexander Ball]] then joined the attack on ''Orient''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ170&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 170]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction of ''Orient''===
[[File:Aboukir.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Orient'' exploding]]
At 21:00, a fire was observed on the lower decks of the ''Orient''.&lt;ref name=&quot;JK64&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 64]]&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying the danger this posed to the French flagship, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their cannon directly into the blaze. Sustained British cannon fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern, and prevented all efforts to extinguish it.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC366&quot;/&gt; Within minutes the flames had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ170&quot;/&gt; The nearest British ships, ''Swiftsure'', ''Alexander'' and ''Orion'', all stopped firing, closed their gunports and began edging away from the blazing ship in anticipation of the detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG34&quot;/&gt; In addition, fire parties were taken away from the guns and soaked the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting blazes.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP129&quot;/&gt; Likewise the French ships ''Tonnant'', ''Heureux'' and ''[[French ship Mercure (1783)|Mercure]]'' all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the blazing ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;JK65&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 65]]&lt;/ref&gt; At 22:00 the fire reached the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and the ''Orient'' was almost completely destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast alone was sufficient to rip open the seams of the nearest ships,&lt;ref name=&quot;NM270&quot;/&gt; and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ171&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 171]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Swiftsure'', ''Alexander'' and ''Franklin'' were all set alight by falling wreckage although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames,&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC366&quot;/&gt; despite a secondary explosion on ''Franklin''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM271&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 271]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two battered ships drift in the foreground while smoke and flame boil from a third. In the background smoke rises from a confused melee of battling ships.]]
It has never been firmly established how the fire on ''Orient'' broke out, but one common account is that jars of oil and paint had been left on the [[poop deck]], rather than properly stowed away after paintwork on the ship's hull had been completed shortly before the battle. Burning [[wadding]] from one of the British ships is believed to have floated onto the poop deck and ignited the paint. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored [[Carcass (projectile)|carcass]] ammunition that was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ176&quot;/&gt; Conversely, Fleet Captain [[Honoré Ganteaume]] later reported the cause as an explosion on the quarterdeck, preceded by a series of minor fires on the main deck among the ship's boats.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA34&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 34]]&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever its origin, the fire spread rapidly though the ship's rigging, unchecked by the fire pumps aboard which had been smashed by British shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA35&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 35]]&lt;/ref&gt; A second blaze then began at the bow, trapping hundreds of sailors in the ship's waist.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM270&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 270]]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent archaeological investigation found debris scattered over {{convert|500|m|yd}} of seabed and evidence that the ship was wracked by two huge explosions one after the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGSinterview&quot;/&gt; Although hundreds of men dived into the sea to escape the flames, fewer than 100 survived the blast: approximately 70 survivors were picked up by British boats, including the wounded staff officer [[Léonard-Bernard Motard]]. Very few others, including Ganteaume, managed to reach the shore on rafts.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ176&quot;/&gt; The remainder of the crew, numbering over a thousand men, were killed,&lt;ref name=&quot;JK66&quot;/&gt; including Captain [[Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca]] and his twelve year old son Giocante.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM269&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 269]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For ten minutes after the explosion there was no firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ171&quot;/&gt; During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of ''Orient''. At 22:10, ''Franklin'' restarted the engagement by firing on ''Swiftsure''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG36&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 36]]&lt;/ref&gt; Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of ''Swiftsure'' and ''Defence''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC367&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 367]]&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of ''Franklin''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s crew had been killed or wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM271&quot;/&gt; By 24:00 only ''Tonnant'' remained engaged, as Commodore [[Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars]] continued his fight with ''Majestic'' and fired on ''Swiftsure'' when the British ship moved within range. By 03:00, after more than three hours of close quarter combat, ''Majestic'' had lost its main and mizzen masts while ''Tonnant'' was a dismasted hulk.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ171&quot;/&gt; Although Captain Du Petit Thouars had lost both legs and an arm he remained in command, insisting on having the tricolour nailed to the mast to prevent it from being struck and giving orders from his position propped up on deck in a bucket of wheat.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC367&quot;/&gt; Under his guidance, the battered ''Tonnant'' gradually drifted southwards away from the action to join the southern division under Villeneuve.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ172&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 172]]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the engagement the French rear had kept up an arbitrary fire on the battling ships ahead.  The only noticeable effect was the smashing of ''[[French ship Commerce de Bordeaux (1785)|Timoléon]]''{{'}}s rudder by misdirected fire from the neighbouring [[French ship Le Généreux|''Généreux'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;IG60&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 60]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morning===
As the sun rose at 04:00 on 2 August, firing broke out once again between the French southern division of ''Guillaume Tell'', ''Tonnant'', ''Généreux'' and ''Timoléon'' and the battered ''Alexander'' and ''Majestic''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC368&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 368]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although briefly outmatched, the British ships were soon joined by ''Goliath'' and ''Theseus''. As Captain Miller manoeuvred his ship into position, ''Theseus'' briefly came under fire from the frigate ''[[French frigate Artémise (1794)|Artémise]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG36&quot;/&gt; Miller turned his ship towards ''Artémise'', but Captain [[Pierre-Jean Standelet]] struck his flag and ordered his men to abandon the frigate. Miller sent a boat under Lieutenant [[William Hoste]] to take possession of the empty vessel, but Standelet had set fire to his ship as he left and ''Artémise'' blew up shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW111&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 111]]&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving French ships of the line, covering their retreat with gunfire, gradually pulled to the east away from the shore at 06:00. ''Zealous'' pursued, and was able to prevent the frigate ''[[French frigate Justice (1794)|Justice]]'' from boarding ''Bellerophon'', which was anchored at the southern point of the bay undergoing hasty repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ172&quot;/&gt;

Two other French ships still flew the tricolour, but neither was in a position to either retreat or fight. When ''Heureux'' and ''Mercure'' had cut their anchor cables to escape the exploding ''Orient'', their crews had panicked and neither captain (both of whom were wounded) had managed to regain control of their ship. As a result, both vessels had drifted onto the shoal.&lt;ref name=&quot;IG61&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 61]]&lt;/ref&gt; Stranded and defenceless, the ships were attacked by ''Alexander'', ''Goliath'', ''Theseus'' and ''Leander'' and both surrendered within minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC368&quot;/&gt; The distractions provided by ''Heureux'', ''Mercure'' and ''Justice'' allowed Villeneuve to bring most of the surviving French ships to the mouth of the bay at 11:00.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ173&quot;/&gt; However the dismasted ''Tonnant'', Commodore Du Petit Thouars now dead from his wounds and thrown overboard at his own request,&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA30&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 30]]&lt;/ref&gt; was unable to make the required speed and was driven ashore by its crew, while ''Timoléon'' was too far south to escape with Villeneuve and in attempting to join the survivors had also grounded on the shoal. The force of the impact dislodged the ship's foremast.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM272&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 272]]&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining French vessels: the ships of the line ''Guillaume Tell'' and ''Généreux'' and the frigates ''Justice'' and ''[[French frigate Diane (1796)|Diane]]'', formed up and stood out to sea, pursued by ''Zealous''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG38&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 38]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strenuous efforts, Captain Hood's isolated ship came under heavy fire and was unable to cut off the trailing ''Justice'' as the French survivors escaped seawards.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ173&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 173]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the remainder of 2 August Nelson's ships made improvised repairs and boarded and consolidated their prizes. ''Culloden'' especially required assistance: having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, Troubridge found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on over {{convert|120|LT|MT|0}} of water an hour. Emergency repairs to the hull and fashioning a replacement rudder from a spare topmast took most of the next two days.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ178&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 178]]&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 3 August, Nelson sent ''Theseus'' and ''Leander'' to force the surrender of the grounded ''Tonnant'' and ''Timoléon''. The ''Tonnant'', its decks crowded with 1,600 survivors from other French vessels, surrendered as the British ships approached while ''Timoléon'' was set on fire by her remaining crew who then escaped to the shore in small boats.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA37&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 37]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Timoléon'' exploded shortly after midday, the eleventh and final French ship of the line destroyed or captured during the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM272&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{quote|&quot;[I] went on deck to view the state of the fleets, and an awful sight it was. The whole Bay was covered with dead bodies, mangled, wounded and scorched, not a bit of clothes on them except their trousers.&quot;|Account by Seaman John Nicol of ''Goliath''|&lt;ref name=&quot;OW103&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 103]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

British casualties in the battle were recorded with some accuracy in the immediate aftermath as 218 killed and approximately 677 wounded, although the number of wounded who subsequently died is not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA37&quot;/&gt; The ships that suffered most were ''Bellerophon'' with 201 casualties and ''Majestic'' with 193, while other than ''Culloden'' the lightest loss was on ''Zealous'', which had one man killed and seven wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC357&quot;/&gt; The casualty list includes Captain Westcott, five lieutenants and ten junior officers among the dead and Admiral Nelson, Captains Saumarez, Ball and Darby and six lieutenants wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC370&quot;/&gt; Other than ''Culloden'', the only British ships seriously damaged in their hulls were ''Bellerophon'', ''Majestic'' and ''Vanguard'', while ''Bellerophon'' and ''Majestic'' were the only ships to lose masts: ''Majestic'' the main and mizzen and ''Bellerophon'' all three.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC369&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 369]]&lt;/ref&gt; French casualties are harder to calculate but were significantly higher. Estimates of French losses range from 2,000 to 5,000, with a suggested a median point of 3,500 which includes over a thousand captured wounded and nearly 2,000 killed, half of which died on ''Orient''.{{Cref2|Note A}} In addition to Admiral Brueys killed and Admiral Blanquet wounded, four captains died and seven others were seriously wounded. The French ships suffered severe damage: two ships of the line and two frigates were destroyed (as well as a bomb vessel scuttled by its crew),&lt;ref name=&quot;OW121&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 121]]&lt;/ref&gt; and three other captured ships were too battered to ever sail again. Of the remaining prizes, only three were ever sufficiently repaired for frontline service.

For weeks after the battle, bodies washed up along the Egyptian coast, decaying slowly in the intense dry heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;JC110&quot;/&gt;

Nelson, who on surveying the bay on the morning of 2 August said &quot;Victory is not a name strong enough for such a scene&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;OW95&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 95]]&lt;/ref&gt; remained at anchor in Aboukir Bay for the next two weeks, preoccupied with recovering from his wound, writing dispatches and assessing the military situation in Egypt using documents captured on board one of the prizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM273&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 273]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson's head wound was recorded as being &quot;three inches long&quot;, with &quot;the cranium exposed for one inch&quot;. He suffered pain from the injury for the rest of his life and was badly scarred, styling his hair to disguise it as much as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW104&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 104]]&lt;/ref&gt; As their commander recovered, his men stripped the wrecks of useful supplies and made repairs to their ships and prizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ183&quot;/&gt; Throughout the week, Aboukir Bay was surrounded by bonfires, lit by Bedouin tribesmen in celebration of the British victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;JC110&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 110]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August, ''Leander'' was despatched to [[Cadiz]] with messages for Earl St. Vincent carried by Captain Edward Berry.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ182&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 182]]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few days all but 200 of the captured prisoners were landed on shore under strict terms of [[parole]], although Bonaparte later ordered them to be formed into an infantry unit and added to his army.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ183&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 183]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August the fleet's boats stormed Aboukir Island, which surrendered without a fight. The landing party removed four of the guns and destroyed the rest along with the fort they were mounted in, renaming the island &quot;Nelson's Island&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ183&quot;/&gt;

On 10 August Nelson sent Lieutenant Thomas Duval from ''Zealous'' with messages to the government in India. Duval travelled across the Middle East overland via [[Aleppo]] and took a ship from [[Basra]] to [[Bombay]], acquainting [[Governor-General of India]] [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Viscount Wellesley]] with the situation in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM273&quot;/&gt; On 12 August the frigates [[HMS Emerald (1796)|HMS ''Emerald'']] under Captain Thomas Moutray Waller, [[HMS Alcmene (1794)|HMS ''Alcmene'']] under Captain [[George Johnstone Hope]] and [[HMS Bonne Citoyenne|HMS ''Bonne Citoyenne'']] under Captain Robert Retalick arrived off Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC373&quot;/&gt; Initially the frigate squadron was mistaken for French warships and chased away by ''Swiftsure'', returning the following day once the error had been realised.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ183&quot;/&gt; The same day as the frigates arrived, ''Mutine'' was sent to Britain with despatches under the command of Lieutenant [[Thomas Bladen Capel]], who had replaced Hardy after the latter's promotion to captain of ''Vanguard''. On 14 August, Nelson sent ''Orion'', ''Majestic'', ''Bellerophon'', ''Minotaur'', ''Defence'', ''Audacious'', ''Theseus'', ''Franklin'', ''Tonnant'', ''Aquilon'', ''Conquérant'', ''Peuple Souverain'' and ''Spartiate'' to sea under the command of Saumarez. Many ships had only [[jury masts]] and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August. On 16 August the grounded prize ''Heureux'' was set on fire and destroyed as no longer fit for service and on 18 August ''Guerrier'' and ''Mercure'' were also burnt.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ183&quot;/&gt; On 19 August, Nelson sailed for Naples with ''Vanguard'', ''Culloden'' and ''Alexander'', leaving Hood in command of ''Zealous'', ''Goliath'', ''Swiftsure'' and the recently joined frigates to watch over French activities at Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ184&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 184]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first message to reach Bonaparte regarding the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his camp on the road between [[Salahieh]] and [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JC110&quot;/&gt; The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General [[Jean Baptiste Kléber]], and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports that when he was handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details.

Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ184&quot;/&gt; Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were &quot;marvellous&quot;, Bonaparte responded that it was just as well, since he would have them shot if they continued &quot;fostering mutinies and preaching revolt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JC111&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 111]]&lt;/ref&gt; To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.&lt;ref name=&quot;JC112&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 112]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their age and battered state meant that neither ''Conquérant'' nor ''Aquilon'' were considered fit for active service in the Royal Navy and both were subsequently hulked, although they had been bought into the service for £20,000 (the equivalent of £{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20000|1798|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} each as HMS ''Conquerant'' and HMS ''Aboukir'' to provide a financial reward to the crews that had captured them.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ185&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 185]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sums were also paid out for ''Guerrier'', ''Mercure'', ''Heureux'' and ''Peuple Souverain'', while the other captured ships were worth considerably more. Built of Adriatic [[oak]], ''Tonnant'' had been  built in 1792 and ''Franklin'' and ''Spartiate'' were less than a year old. ''Tonnant'' and ''Spartiate'', both of which later fought at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], joined the Royal Navy under their old names while ''Franklin'', considered to be &quot;the finest two-decked ship in the world&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ185&quot;/&gt; was renamed HMS ''Canopus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG39&quot;/&gt;

Additional awards were presented to the British fleet: Nelson was awarded £2,000 (£{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2000|1798|r=-1}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) a year for life by the Parliament of Great Britain and £1,000 per annum by the [[Parliament of Ireland]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ187&quot;/&gt; although the latter was inadvertently discontinued after the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] dissolved the Irish Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;OW146&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 146]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both parliaments gave unanimous votes of thanks, each captain who served in the battle was presented with a specially minted gold medal and the first lieutenant of every ship engaged in the battle was promoted to commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC373&quot;/&gt; Although initially excluded and even though they did not directly participate in the engagement, Troubridge and his men were given equal shares in the awards after Nelson personally interceded for the crew of the stranded ''Culloden''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ187&quot;/&gt; The [[Honourable East India Company]] presented Nelson with £10,000 (£{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10000|1798|r=-1}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in recognition of the benefit his action had on their holdings and similar awards were made by the cities of [[London]], [[Liverpool]] and other municipal and corporate bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ187&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 187]]&lt;/ref&gt; From his own captains, Nelson was presented with a sword and a portrait as &quot;proof of their esteem&quot;.

Rumours of a battle first appeared in the French press as early as 7 August, although credible reports did not arrive until 26 August, and even these claimed that Nelson was dead and Bonaparte a British prisoner.&lt;ref name=&quot;IG56&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 56]]&lt;/ref&gt; When the news became certain, the French press insisted that the defeat was the result both of an overwhelmingly large British force and unspecified &quot;traitors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IG61&quot;/&gt; Among the anti-government journals in France, the defeat was blamed on the incompetence of the French Directory and on supposed lingering Royalist sentiments in the Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;IG63&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 63]]&lt;/ref&gt; Villeneuve came under scathing attack on his return to France for his failure to support Brueys during the battle. In his defence, he pleaded that the wind had been against him and that Brueys had not issued orders for him to counterattack the British fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM275&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 275]]&lt;/ref&gt; Writing many years later, Bonaparte commented that if the French Navy had adopted the same tactical principles as the British:

{{quote|&quot;Admiral Villeneuve would not have thought himself blameless at Aboukir, for remaining inactive with five or six ships, that is to say, with half the squadron, for twenty four hours, whilst the enemy was overpowering the other wing.&quot;|Napoleon Bonaparte, ''Mémoires'', Volume 1, 1823. Quoted in translation in Noel Mostert's ''The Line Upon a Wind'', 2007|&lt;ref name=&quot;NM706&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 706]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By contrast, the British press were jubilant; many newspapers sought to portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used to attack the supposedly pro-republican [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians [[Charles James Fox]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IG67&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 67]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been extensive historiographical debate over the comparative strengths of the fleets, although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size, each containing 13 ships of the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;JC108&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Cole|Cole, p. 108]]&lt;/ref&gt; However the loss of ''Culloden'', the relative sizes of ''Orient'' and ''Leander'' and the participation in the action by two of the French frigates and several smaller vessels, as well as the theoretical strength of the French position,&lt;ref name=&quot;OW72&quot;/&gt; leads most historians to the conclusion that the French were marginally more powerful.&lt;ref name=&quot;RLA23&quot;/&gt; This is accentuated by the weight of broadside of several of the French ships: ''Spartiate'', ''Franklin'', ''Orient'', ''Tonnant'' and ''Guillaume Tell'' were each significantly larger than any individual British ship in the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC370&quot;/&gt; However the French ships were hampered by their inadequate deployment, reduced crews and the failure of the rear division under Villeneuve to meaningfully participate, all of which contributed to their defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;WJ179&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 179]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
The Battle of the Nile has been called &quot;arguably, the most decisive  naval engagement of the great age of sail&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;SM272&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 272]]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the most splendid and glorious success which the British Navy gained.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC371&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 371]]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian and novelist [[C. S. Forester]], writing in 1929, compared the Nile to the great naval actions in history and concluded that &quot;it still only stands rivalled by [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsu-Shima]] as an example of the annihilation of one fleet by another of approximately equal material force&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSF120&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Forester|Forester, p. 120]]&lt;/ref&gt; The effect on the strategic situation in the Mediterranean was immediate, reversing the balance of the conflict and giving the British control at sea that they maintained for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM274&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 274]]&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet allowed the Royal Navy to return to the sea in force, as British squadrons set up [[blockade]]s off French and allied ports.&lt;ref name=&quot;PP132&quot;/&gt; In particular, British ships cut Malta off from France, aided by the rebellion among the native Maltese population that forced the French garrison to retreat to Valetta and shut the gates.&lt;ref name=WJ189&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 189]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing [[Siege of Malta (1798&amp;ndash;1800)|Siege of Malta]] lasted for two years before the defenders were finally starved into surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG70&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 70]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799, British ships harassed Bonaparte's army as it marched east and north through [[Palestine]], and played a crucial part in Bonaparte's defeat at the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]], when the barges carrying the siege train were captured and the French storming parties were bombarded by British ships anchored offshore.&lt;ref name=&quot;JHR144&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 144]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was during one of these latter engagements that Captain Miller of ''Theseus'' was killed in an ammunition explosion.&lt;ref name=WJ294&gt;[[#Reference-James|James, p. 294]]&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat at Acre forced Bonaparte to retreat to Egypt and effectively ended his efforts to carve an empire in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG62&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 62]]&lt;/ref&gt; The French general returned to France without his army late in the year, leaving Kléber in command of Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;DC226&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Chandler|Chandler, p. 226]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans, with whom Bonaparte had hoped to conduct an alliance once his control of Egypt was complete, were encouraged by the Battle of the Nile to go to war with France.&lt;ref name=&quot;NR461&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Rodger|Rodger, p. 461]]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a series of campaigns that slowly sapped the strength from the French army trapped in Egypt. Also encouraged by the British victory were the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]], both of whom were mustering armies as part of a [[Second Coalition]], which declared war on France in 1799.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG13&quot;/&gt; With the Mediterranean undefended, a Russian fleet entered the [[Ionian Sea]], while Austrian armies recaptured much of the Italian territory lost to Bonaparte in the previous war.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG14&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 14]]&lt;/ref&gt; Without their best general and his veterans, the French suffered a series of defeats and it was not until Bonaparte returned to become [[First Consul]] that France once again held a position of strength on mainland Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM275&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 275]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 the demoralised remains of the French army in Egypt were defeated by a British Expeditionary Force; the Royal Navy used their dominance in the Mediterranean to invade Egypt without the fear of ambush while anchored off the Egyptian coast.&lt;ref name=RG78&gt;[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 78]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the overwhelming British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian [[Edward Ingram (historian)|Edward Ingram]] has noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue the war in the Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed.&lt;ref name=EL142&gt;[[#Reference-Ingram|Ingram, p. 142]]&lt;/ref&gt; The potential of a successful engagement at sea to change the course of history is underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, [[Louis Alexandre Berthier]], [[Auguste de Marmont]], [[Jean Lannes]], [[Joachim Murat]], [[Louis Desaix]], [[Jean Reynier]], [[Antoine-François Andréossy]], [[Jean-Andoche Junot]], [[Louis-Nicolas Davout]] and [[Guillaume Mathieu, comte Dumas|Dumas]] were all passengers on the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|cramped Mediterranean crossing]].&lt;ref name=SM259&gt;[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 259]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cnote2|Note B|'''Note B:''' The course ''Audacious'' took to reach the battle has been the source of some debate: [[William Laird Clowes]] states that ''Audacious'' passed between ''Guerrier'' and ''Conquerant'' and anchored in the middle.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLC362&quot;/&gt; However, a number of maps of the battle show ''Audacious''{{'}}s course as rounding the head of the line across ''Guerrier''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s bow before turning back to port between the leading French ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;JK42&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 42]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources, including Warner and James,  are vague on the subject and do not state one way or another. The cause of this discrepancy is likely the lack of any significant account or report on the action from Gould. Gould has been criticised for the placement of his ship during the opening stages of the battle, as the ships he attacked were already outnumbered, and the following day he had to be repeatedly ordered to rejoin the battle as it spread southwards despite the lack of damage to his ship. [[Oliver Warner]] describes him as &quot;brave enough no doubt, but without imagination, or any sense of what was happening in the battle as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OW107&quot;&gt;[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 107]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Saint Barnabas''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:Βαρναβᾶς|Βαρναβᾶς]]}}), born '''Joseph''', was an [[Early Christian]] convert, one of the earliest [[Disciple (Christianity)|Christian disciples]] in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris names him as a &quot;prominent leader&quot; of the early church in Jerusalem. [[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Like almost all Christians at the time (see also [[Jewish Christians]]), Barnabas was one of the [[Israelites|Children of Israel]], specifically a [[Levite]]. Named an [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]] in {{bibleverse||Acts|14:14}}, he and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] undertook missionary journeys together and defended [[Gentile]] converts against a faction promoting Gentile circumcision&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt; (see also [[Judaizers]]). They gained many converts in [[Antioch#Late_Antiquity|Antioch]] (''c'' 43-44), traveled together making more converts (''c'' 45-47), and participated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (''c'' 50).&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Barnabas and Paul successfully evangelized among the [[Godfearers|&quot;God-fearing&quot;]] gentiles who attended [[synagogue]]s in various [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] cities of [[Anatolia]] (modern day [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnabas' story appears in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], and Paul mentions him in some of his [[epistle]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;&gt;&quot;Barnabas.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] named him as the author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt; but this and other attributions are conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hebrews, Epistle to the&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement of Alexandria]] ascribed an early Christian epistle to Barnabas ([[Epistle of Barnabas]]), but that is highly improbable.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Epistle of Barnabas.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Martyr]]ed at [[Salamis, Cyprus]], in AD 61,&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt; {{Dubious|date=May 2011}}he is traditionally identified as the founder of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church|Cypriot Church]].  The [[feast day]] of St Barnabas is celebrated on June 11.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt;

Some traditions hold that [[Aristobulus of Britannia]], one of the [[Seventy Disciples]], was the brother of Barnabas.

== Etymologies ==
His [[Greeks|Hellenic]] [[Jewish]] parents called him Joseph (although the [[Byzantine text-type]] calls him {{polytonic|Ιὠσης}}, ''Iōsēs'', 'Joses', a [[Greek language|Greek]] variant of 'Joseph'), but when he sold all his goods and gave the money to the apostles in [[Jerusalem]], they gave him a new name: Barnabas. This name appears to be from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|arc|בר נביא}}, ''{{transl|sem|bar naḇyā}}'', meaning 'the (son of the) prophet'. However, the Greek text of the {{Bibleref2|Acts|4:36}} explains the name as {{polytonic|υἱός παρακλήσεως}}, ''hyios paraklēseōs'', meaning ''&quot;son of consolation&quot; or &quot;son of encouragement&quot;.'' A similar link between ”prophecy” and ”encouragement” is found in St. Paul’s letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 14:3)

== Barnabas in the New Testament ==
[[File:St-barnabé-veronese-rouen.jpg|thumb|right|''Saint Barnabas curing the poor'' by [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]].]]
Barnabas appears mainly in ''Acts'', a Christian history of the early Christian church. He also appears in several of Saint Paul's epistles.

St Barnabas is one of the first teachers of the church at [[Antioch]] (Acts 13:1). Barnabas was a Levite (one of the twelve Israelite tribes, which was assigned the task of serving in the Jewish Temple). He was a native of [[Cyprus]], where he possessed land (Acts 4:36, 37), which he sold, and gave the proceeds to the church in Jerusalem. When [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (9:27). Easton, in his Bible Dictionary, supposes that they had been fellow students in the school of Rabbi [[Gamaliel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas there to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in search of Paul,&quot;an admirable colleague&quot; to assist him &lt;ref&gt; [[F.F. Bruce]],New Testament History,p.233, New York: Doubleday, 1969 &lt;/ref&gt; . St Paul returned with him to Antioch and labored with him for a whole year (Acts 11:25, 26). At the end of this period, the two were sent up to Jerusalem (AD 44) with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer members of the Jerusalem church. 

Shortly after they returned, bringing [[John Mark]] with them, they were appointed as missionaries to [[Asia Minor]], and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of [[Pamphylia]], [[Pisidia]], and [[Lycaonia]] (Acts 13:14). With the conversion of [[Sergius Paulus]], Paul begins to gain prominence over Barnabas from the point where the name ''&quot;Paul,&quot;'' his Roman name, is substituted for ''&quot;Saul&quot;'' (13:9); instead of ''&quot;Barnabas and Saul&quot;'' as heretofore (11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7) we now read ''&quot;Paul and Barnabas&quot;'' (13:43, 46, 50; 14:20; 15:2, 22, 35); only in 14:14 and 15:12, 25 does Barnabas again occupy the first place, in the first passage with recollection of 14:12, in the last two, because Barnabas stood in closer relation to the Jerusalem church than Paul. St. Paul appears as the preaching missionary (13:16; 14:8-9, 19-20), whence the [[Lystra]]ns regarded him as [[Hermes]], St. Barnabas as [[Zeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_14.html Covenantseminary.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that the King James version uses [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] instead of Zeus&lt;/ref&gt; (14:12). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church (Acts 15:2; [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 2:1). According to Gal. 2:9-10, Barnabas was included with Paul in the agreement made between them, on the one hand, and [[James the Just|James]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], on the other, that the two former should in the future preach to the pagans, not forgetting the poor at Jerusalem. This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the agreement of the [[Council of Jerusalem|council]] that [[Gentiles]] were to be admitted into the church.  

It is quite likely, however, that the epistle of Galatians was written prior to the Jerusalem council, and that it refers to a meeting between Paul, Barnabas, and Peter, James, and John that happened earlier.  Much of the scholarship of the 1800's assumes that Galatia was a province to the north of the first missionary journey churches started through Paul and Barnabas' ministry as described in Acts 13-14.  But archeology and recent scholarship accepts the fact that the province of Galatia included many of the first missionary journey churches.  It would have been very strange indeed for Paul to have omitted the fact that the apostles and elders of the Jerusalem church had not laid circumcision as a requirement upon the Gentiles considering the topic of the epistle after it became a controversy in Galatia. It is more likely that Paul the epistle was written some time before the Jerusalem council, and that teachers came from Jerusalem to Antioch teaching the need for it after Paul wrote his epistle to the Galatians, churches from the first missionary journey, addressing this issue.

After they had returned to Antioch from the Jerusalem council and after spending some time there (15:35), Paul asked Barnabas to accompany him on another journey (15:36). Barnabas wished to take [[John Mark]] along, but Paul did not, as he had left them on the former journey (15:37-38). The dispute ended by Paul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Paul took [[Silas]] as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and [[Cilicia]]; while Barnabas took [[John Mark]] to visit Cyprus (15:36-41). Contrary to many people's assumptions, according to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], [[John Mark]] is not [[Mark the Cousin of Barnabas]], and Barnabas did not dispute with Paul because of personal favor to a blood relative, but due to his character as his nickname Barnabas (&quot;Son of Encouragement&quot;) indicates.

Barnabas is not mentioned again by [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. However, in Gal. 2:13 a little more is learned about him, that he followed Peter's example of not eating with Gentiles;{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and from [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 9:6 it may be gathered that he continued to labor as missionary. It is believed that his argument with Paul was resolved.

== Barnabas and Antioch ==
[[Antioch]], the third-most important city of the Roman Empire,&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Antioch''&lt;/ref&gt; then the capital city of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria province]], today [[Antakya]], Turkey, was where Christians were first called thus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Acts|11:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was indeed the site of an early Christian community, traditionally said to be founded by Peter {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. A considerable minority of the Antioch church of Barnabas's time belonged to the merchant class, and they provided support to the poorer Jerusalem church.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;/&gt;

== Council of Jerusalem ==
{{Main|Council of Jerusalem}}
Barnabas participated in the Council of Jerusalem, which dealt with the admission of gentiles into the Christian community, a crucial problem in early Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;/&gt; Paul and Barnabas proposed that gentiles be allowed into the community without being [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]].

== Martyrdom ==
{{Main|Christian martyrs}}
Church tradition describes the martyrdom of many saints, including the legend of the martyrdom of Barnabas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt; It relates that certain Jews coming to Syria and Salamis, where Barnabas was then preaching the gospel, being highly exasperated at his extraordinary success, fell upon him as he was disputing in the synagogue, dragged him out, and, after the most inhumane tortures, stoned him to death. His kinsman, John Mark, who was a spectator of this barbarous action, privately interred his body.&lt;ref name=PFS&gt;&quot;The Life of our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: And the Lives and Sufferings of His Holy Evangelists and Apostles,&quot; p.455, 1857 AD, Miller, Orton &amp; Co., 25 Park Row, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the History of the Cyprus Church,&lt;ref&gt;Church of Cyprus, History of Cyprus Church, The Autocephaly of the Cyprus Church [http://www.churchofcyprus.org.cy/article.php?articleID=92 churchofcyprus.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in 478 Barnabas appeared in a dream to the Archbishop of Constantia ([[Salamis, Cyprus]]) Anthemios and revealed to him the place of his sepulchre beneath a [[carob]]-tree. The following day Anthemios found the tomb and inside it the remains of Barnabas with a manuscript of Matthew's Gospel on his breast. Anthemios presented the Gospel to Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] at [[Constantinople]] and received from him the privileges of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus]], that is, the purple cloak which the [[List of archbishops of Cyprus|Greek Archbishop of Cyprus]] wears at festivals of the church, the imperial sceptre and the red ink with which he affixes his signature.

Anthemios then placed the venerable remains of Barnabas in a church which he founded near the tomb. Excavations near the site of a present day church and monastery, have revealed an early church with two empty tombs, believe to be that of St. Barnabas and Anthemios.&lt;ref&gt;Cyprus Commemorative Stamp issue: 1900th Death Anniversary of Apostle Barnavas, [http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=22 philatelism.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Barnabas is venerated as the [[Patron Saint]] of [[Cyprus]].

== Other sources ==
Although many assume that the biblical [[Mark the Cousin of Barnabas]] ([[Colossians]] 4:10) is the same as [[John Mark]] (Acts 12:12, 25; 13:5, 13; 15: 37) and [[Mark the Evangelist]], the traditionally believed author of the [[Gospel of Mark]], according to [[Hippolytus of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 255-6&lt;/ref&gt; the three &quot;Mark&quot;s are distinct persons. They were all members of the [[Seventy Disciples|Seventy Apostles of Christ]], including Barnabas himself. There are two Barnabas' among Hippolytus' list of Seventy Disciples, one (#13) became the bishop of Milan, the other (#25) the bishop of Heraclea. Most likely one of these two is the biblical Barnabas; the first one is more likely, because the numbering by Hippolytus seems to indicate a level of significance. [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Stromata'', ii, 20) also makes Barnabas one of the [[Seventy Disciples]] that are mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] 10:1ff.

Other sources bring Barnabas to [[Rome]] and [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]]. In the [[Clementine literature|&quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot;]] (i, 7) he is depicted as preaching in Rome even during Christ's lifetime. 

Not older than the 3rd century is the tradition of the later activity and martyrdom of St Barnabas in [[Cyprus]], where his remains are said to have been discovered under the Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. The [[Cypriot Orthodox Church|Cypriot Church]] claimed Saint Barnabas as its founder in order to rid itself of the supremacy of the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], as did the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archbishop of Milan]] afterwards, to become more independent of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02300a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: ''St. Barnabas'']&lt;/ref&gt; In this connection, the question whether St. Barnabas was an apostle became important, and was often discussed during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[C. J. Hefele]], ''Das Sendschreiben des Apostels Barnabas,'' Tübingen, 1840; [[Otto Braunsberger]], &quot;Der Apostel Barnabas,&quot; Mainz, 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; The statements as to the year of St Barnabas's death are discrepant and untrustworthy.

== Alleged writings ==
[[Tertullian]] and other Western writers regard Barnabas as the author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]. This may have been the Roman tradition—which Tertullian usually follows—and in Rome the epistle may have had its first readers. But the tradition has weighty considerations against it{{Clarify|reason=what considerations|date=June 2010}}. 

According to  [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (''Quaest. in Amphil.,'' 123), Barnabas wrote the Acts of the Apostles. (Current consensus ascribes the book to the author of Luke.)

He is also traditionally associated with the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], although modern scholars think it more likely that that epistle was written in Alexandria in the 130s. The 6th century ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' includes a ''Gospel of Barnabas'' amongst works condemned as [[apocrypha]]l; but no certain text or quotation from this work has been identified.  

Another book using that same title, the ''&quot;[[Gospel of Barnabas]]&quot;,'' survives in two post-medieval manuscripts in Italian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[T. Zahn]], ''Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons,'' ii, 292, Leipsig, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, and in accordance with the [[Islamic view of Jesus]], this later ''&quot;Gospel of Barnabas&quot;'' states that Jesus was not the son of God, but a prophet and messenger. The book also says Jesus rose alive into [[Heaven]] without having been crucified. Allegedly, it also mentions by name, the Comforter, as Mohammad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://numerical19.tripod.com/muhammad_in_barnabas.htm Numerical119.tripod.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This is about a Viking-age trading center in Sweden. For other meanings see [[Birka (disambiguation)]].''
During the [[Viking Age]], '''Birka''' {{audio|Sv-Birka.ogg|listen}} (''Birca'' in medieval sources), on the island of Björkö (literally: &quot;Birch Island&quot;) in [[Sweden]], was an important trading center which handled goods from [[Scandinavia]] as well as [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] and the Orient. Björkö is located in [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]], 30 kilometers west of contemporary [[Stockholm]], in the municipality of [[Ekerö]]. The archaeological sites of Birka and [[Hovgården]], on the neighbouring island of [[Adelsö]], make up an archaeological complex which illustrates the elaborate [[trading network]]s of Viking [[Scandinavia]] and their influence on the subsequent history of [[Europe]]. Generally regarded as Sweden's oldest town,&lt;ref&gt;2006 [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], article &quot;Sweden&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Birka (along with Hovgården) has been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1993.

Established in the middle of the 8th century&lt;ref&gt;Helle, K. et al., ''Norsk Byhistorie'', Pax forlag, [[Oslo]] 2006, [[ISBN 13]]: 978-82-530-2882-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus being one of the earliest urban settlements in Scandinavia, Birka was the Baltic link in [[Dnieper trade route|the river and portage route]] through [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] (Aldeigja) and [[Novgorod]] (Holmsgard) to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid]] [[Califate]].&lt;ref&gt;2006 [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]. Article &quot;Birca&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Birka was also important as the site of the first known [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] in Sweden, founded in 831 by [[Ansgar|Saint Ansgar]].

Sources are mainly archeological remains. No texts survive from this area, though the written text ''[[Vita Ansgari]]'' (&quot;The life of Ansgar&quot;) by [[Rimbert]] (c. 865) describes the missionary work of [[Ansgar]] around 830 at Birka, and ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'' (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) by [[Adam of Bremen]] in 1075 describes the [[archbishop]] Unni, who died at Birka in 936.&lt;!--The majority of sources I was able to consult, including Britannica, speak about the first settlement of any size from ca. 800. Perhaps this should be reflected in text of the article.--&gt; St Ansgar's work was the first attempt to convert the inhabitants from [[Norse Mythology|the Norse religion]] to Christianity, and it was unsuccessful.  

Both Rimbert and Adam were German clergymen writing in [[Latin]]. There are no known [[Old Norse language|Norse]] sources mentioning the name of the settlement, or even the settlement itself, and the original Norse name of Birka is unknown. ''Birca'' is the [[Romanization|Latinised]] form given in the sources and ''Birka'' its contemporary, unhistorical Swedish form. The Latin name is probably derived from an [[Old Norse]] word &quot;[[birk (market place)|birk]]&quot; which probably meant a market place. Related to this was the ''Bjärköa law'' ([[bjärköarätt]]) which regulated the life on market places in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Both terms in different forms are very common in Scandinavian place names still today leading to speculation that all references to Birca especially by Adam of Bremen were not about the same location.

Both publications are silent on Birca's size, layout and appearance. Based on Rimbert's account, Birca was significant because it had a port and it was the place for the regional [[Thing (assembly)|ting]]. Adam only mentions the port, but otherwise Birca seems to have been significant to him because it had been the bridgehead of Ansgar's Christian mission and because archbishop Unni had been buried there.

''Vita Ansgari'' and ''Gesta'' are sometimes ambiguous, which has caused some controversy as to whether Birca and the Björkö settlement were the same location. Many other locations have been suggested through the years.&lt;ref&gt;Some of them being [[Linköping]], [[Köpingsvik]] and even [[Saltvik]] in [[Åland]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Björkö is the only location that can show remains of a town of Birca's significance, which is why the vast majority of scholars regard Björkö as the location of Birca.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Dick, ''Sveriges historia -- medeltiden'' (Falköping, 2002), p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Birka was abandoned during the later half of the 10th century. Based on the coin finds, the city seems to have silenced around 960.&lt;ref&gt;Lindqvist, Herman. ''Historien om Sverige. Islossning till kungarike.'' 1996. See page 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly around the same time, the near-by settlement of [[Sigtuna]] supplanted Birka as the main trading centre in the [[Mälaren]] area.&lt;ref name=Concise&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise History of Sweden |last=Kent |first=Neil |date=2008-06-12| accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=[[United Kingdom]] |isbn=0521012279 |pages=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for Birka's decline are disputed. A contributing factor may have been the [[post-glacial rebound]], which lowered the water level of Mälaren changing it from an arm of the sea into a lake and cut Birka off from the nearest (southern) access to the [[Baltic Sea]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} &lt;!-- Is this supposed to have happened ca 1000, or when? --&gt; The Baltic island of [[Gotland]] was also in a better strategic position for [[Dnieper trade route|Russian-Byzantine trade]], and was gaining eminence as a mercantile stronghold.&lt;ref name=Concise/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2006 Encyclopaedia Britannica. Article &quot;Birka&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Neil Kent has speculated that the area may have been the victim of an enemy assault.&lt;ref name=Concise/&gt;

The [[Varangian]] trade stations in [[Russia]] suffered a serious decline at roughly the same date.

==Rimbert's Birka==
In ''[[Vita Ansgari]]'' (&quot;The life of Ansgar&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/anskar.html Vita Ansgarii]. Translation in English.&lt;/ref&gt; monk and later [[Archbishopric of Bremen|archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]] [[Rimbert]] gives the first known description of Birka. The town was the center of Catholic missionary activities in the 9th century Sweden. Rimbert's interests were in the Christian faith, not so much in the Swedish geopolicy, so his descriptions of Birka remain approximate at best.

===Bridgehead of Christian missionaries===
This is how it all started in 829:

:''&quot;Meanwhile it happened that Swedish ambassadors had come to the Emperor [[Louis the Pious]], and, amongst other matters which they had been ordered to bring to the attention of the emperor, they informed him that there were many belonging to their nation who desired to embrace the Christian religion, and that their king so far favoured this suggestion that lie would permit God's priests to reside there, provided that they might be deemed worthy of such a favour and that the emperor would send them suitable preachers.&quot; (Chapter IX)''

:''&quot;[[Ansgar]] then undertook the mission committed to him by the emperor, who desired that he should go to the Swedes and discover whether this people was prepared to accept the faith as their messengers had declared.&quot; (Chapter X)''

Ansgar was already experienced in the missionary work in [[Denmark]], and set forth to Sweden. Rimbert describes the trip very generally:

:''&quot;It may suffice for me to say that while they were in the midst of their journey they fell into the hands of pirates. The merchants with whom they were travelling, defended themselves vigorously and for a time successfully, but eventually they were conquered and overcome by the pirates, who took from them their ships and all that they possessed, whilst they themselves barely escaped on. foot to land. -- With great difficulty they accomplished their long journey on foot, traversing also the intervening seas (maria), where it was possible, by ship, and eventually arrived at the Swedish port called Birka.&quot; (Chapters X and XI)''

Rimbert does not say where Ansgar sailed off or where he landed. Noteworthy is just his note about several &quot;seas&quot; that they had to cross to get to Birka from the place they had landed to. Since Rimbert mentions them to have crossed the seas by ship &quot;where it was possible&quot; they clearly had the alternative of going around them as well meaning that the seas were probably the numerous lakes in southern Sweden. When Ansgar again travelled to Birka from Germany about 852, it went easier:

:''&quot;Ansgar accomplished the journey on which he had set out, and after spending nearly twenty days in a ship, he arrived at Birka --&quot; (Chapter XXVI)''

This might mean that he sailed off from [[Hamburg]] or [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] instead of some port in Baltic Sea, since the later account by Adam of Bremen gives the distance of [[Scania]] and Birka to be only 5 days at sea.

===King in Birka===
Several Swedish kings of the 9th century, [[Björn at Haugi|Björn]], [[Anund Uppsale|Anund]] and [[Olof (I) of Sweden|Olof]], are all mentioned in ''Vita'' to have spent time in Birka. None of them is however said to have had his residence there, as the Swedish king and his retinue routinely moved between the [[Husby]]s, parts of the network of royal estates called [[Uppsala öd]].

King Björn met Ansgar in Birka when he arrived there in 829 (Chapter XI). Later king Olof met him there as well during his last trip in 852 (Chapter XXVI).

===Church in Birka===
Ansgar's missionary work resulted in first churches to be built in Sweden. Talking about [[Herigar]], the prefect of Birka:

:''&quot;A little later he built a church on his own ancestral property and served God with the utmost devotion.&quot; (Chapter XI)''

Herigar's church was not far from the place where tings were held:

:''&quot;On one occasion lie himself was sitting in an assembly of people, a stage having been arranged for a council on an open plain. -- He then summoned his servants and told them to carry him to his church.&quot; (Chapter XIX)''

Another church was also built in Sweden, however location is left open:

:''&quot;This Gautbert, who at his consecration received the honoured name of the apostle Simeon, went to Sweden, and was honourably received by the king and the people ; and he began, amidst general goodwill and approval, to build a church there --&quot; (Chapter XIV)''

The exiled Swedish King [[Anund Uppsale]] confirms that either one of the churches was in Birka itself when he ponders if Birka should be plundered:

:''&quot;&quot;There are there,&quot; he said, &quot; many great and powerful gods, and in former time a church was built there, and there are many Christians there who worship Christ --&quot;&quot; (Chapter XIX)''

===Fortress in Birka?===
Danes attacked Birka, accompanied with the deposed king [[Anund Uppsale|Anund]], which caused great distress in the town.

:''&quot;Being in great difficulty they fled to a neighbouring city (ad civitatem, quæ iuxta erat, confugerunt) and began to promise and offer to their gods -- But inasmuch as the city was not strong and there were few to offer resistance, they sent messengers to the Danes and asked for friendship and alliance. -- Hergeir, the faithful servant of the Lord, was angry with them and said, -- &quot;They will lead away your wives and sons as captives, they will burn our city (urbs) and town (vicus)&lt;ref&gt;The Latin word ''vicus'' which Rimbert uses about Birka can also be translated as &quot;market place&quot; or &quot;village&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and will destroy you with the sword --&quot;&quot; (Chapter XIX)''

As the neighbouring &quot;city&quot; is not mentioned in any other context than during the Danish attack as a place where people took refuge, it probably meant a near-by fortress. Eventually Danes left, sparing Birka from destruction.

===''Ting'' in Birka===
When Ansgar asked if King [[Olof (I) of Sweden|Olof]]&lt;ref&gt;Scandinavian sources omit King Olof from the list of kings that reigned in [[Uppsala]].&lt;/ref&gt; would permit him to establish the Christian religion in the kingdom during his second visit in 852, the king said to him:

:''&quot;On this account I have not the power, nor do I dare, to approve the objects of your mission until I can consult our gods by the casting of lots and until I can enquire the will of the people in regard to this matter. Let your messenger attend with me the next assembly --&quot; (Chapter XXVI)

:''&quot;When the day for the assembly which was held in the town of Birka drew near, in accordance with their national custom the king caused a proclamation to be made to the people by the voice of a herald, in order that they might be informed concerning the object of their mission. -- The king then rose up from amongst the assembly and forthwith directed one of his own messengers to accompany the bishop's messenger, and to tell him that the people were unanimously inclined to accept his proposal and at the same time to tell him that, whilst their action was entirely agreeable to him, he could not give his full consent until, in another assembly, which was to be held in another part of his kingdom, he could announce this resolution to the people who lived in that district.&quot; (Chapter XXVII)''

[[Thing (assembly)|Tings]] were huge open air events, which required plenty of space. The more important ting that king Olof talked about was probably the ''[[Thing of all Swedes|Ting of all Swedes]]'', which was held at the end of February in [[Uppsala]], during the [[Disting]]. The king was obliged to obey the common decisions made at this ting, and the most powerful man at this assembly was not the king, but the [[lawspeaker]] of [[Tiundaland]]. Locally important tings were the Westrogothic ''[[Thing of all Geats|Ting of all Geats]]'' in Skara and the Ostrogothic ''[[Lionga thing|Lionga ting]]'' in the vicinity of today's [[Linköping]].

==Adam of Bremen's Birka==
In ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church),&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm Adam of Bremen, Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum], online text in Latin. Note that ''Scholias'' at the end of the text are later supplements, possibly by Adam himself or copyists. English translation of ''Gesta'' is not available in public domain, and the translation of the selected parts is by Wikipedia editors.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam of Bremen mentions Birka many times, and the book is the main source of information on the city. After its initial release in 1075/6, ''Gesta'' was complemented with supplementary ''Scholias'' until the death of Adam in the 1080s. Birca is described as an existing city in the original version, but then as destroyed in ''Scholia 138''.

One of Adam's main sources had been the German bishop [[Adalvard|Adalvard the Younger]] of [[Sigtuna]] and later of [[Skara]] as hinted in ''Scholia 119''. He was also very familiar with Rimbert's work. Adam himself never visited Birka.

===Birka's location and port===
Adam described Birka as a [[Geat]]ish port town and had gathered many details about it.

:''&quot;Birka is the main Geatish town ([[oppidum]] Gothorum), situated in the middle of Sweden (Suevoniae), not far (non longe) from the [[Temple at Uppsala|temple called Uppsala]] (Ubsola) which the Swedes (Sueones) held in the highest esteem when it comes to the worship of the gods; here forms an inlet of the Baltic or the Barbaric Sea a port facing north which welcomes all the wild peoples all around this sea but which is risky for those who are careless or ignorant of such places ... they have therefore blocked this inlet of the troubled sea with hidden masses of rocks along more than 100 [[Ancient Greek units of measurement|stadions]] (18 km). On this anchorage, being the best sheltered within the maritime region of Sweden (Suevoniae), all the ships belonging to Danes (Danorum) known as Norwegians (Nortmannorum) as well as to [[Slavs]] (Sclavorum), [[Sembrians]] (Semborum) and other [[Scythian]] (Scithiae) peoples use to convene every year for sundry necessary commerce.&quot; (I 62)''

:''&quot;Turning from the northern parts to the mouth of the Baltic Sea we first meet the Norwegians (Nortmanni), then the Danish region of [[Skåne]] (Sconia) stands out, and beyond these live the Geats (Gothi) for a long stretch all the way to Birka.&quot; (IV 14)''

Having described [[Västergötland]] and [[Skara]], Adam writes:

:''&quot;Beyond it [[Östergötland]] (Ostrogothia) extends along the sea, that is called the Baltic Sea, all the way to Birka.&quot; (IV 23)''

Noteworthy in the following statement is the usage of the term &quot;not far&quot; (non longe) which was also used to describe the distance between Birka and the Uppsala temple:

:''&quot;Furthermore we have been told that there are many more islands in that sea, one of which is called the Great [[Estonia|Estland]] (Aestland) -- And this island is told to be quite close to the Woman Land ([[Terra Feminarum|terrae feminarum]]), which&lt;ref&gt;Note that Adam's words &quot;cum illa superior&quot; may also refer to [[Courland]] discussed in Chapter IV 16 just before Estland thus meaning that Birka was not far away from Courland. Compare with Rimbert's story about an attack to Courland, ''Vita Ansgari'' Chapter XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; is not far (non longe) away from Birka of the Swedes.&quot; (IV 17)''

Adam also had travel instructions from Skåne to [[Sigtuna]]:

:''&quot;From Skåne (Sconia) of the Danes one reaches Sigtuna (Sictonam) or Birka after five days at sea, for they are indeed alike.&lt;ref&gt;The word ''iuxta'' can also be translated &quot;close by&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; But by land from Skåne across the Geatish people (Gothorum populos) and cities Skara (Scaranem), Telgas and Birka, one reaches Sigtuna only after a full month.&quot; (IV 28)''

&quot;Telgas&quot; is not mentioned anywhere else, and it remains as speculative as Birka. The most popular identification among many telge names in Sweden is [[Södertälje]].&lt;ref&gt;Assuming Birka and Björkö settlement were the same, Adam's travel instructions were latest from the 10th century when Björkö settlement still existed. Södertälje is mentioned as &quot;Tælgia&quot; etc in medieval sources. ''Gesta'' excluded, it is mentioned for the first time in 1281. However, it is considered possible that Södertälje was already established in the 11th century, but dating the city to be contemporary to the Björkö settlement is unlikely.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scholia 121'' of IV 20 tells also:

:''&quot;For those who sail from Skåne (Sconia) of the Danes to Birka, the journey takes five days, from Birka to Russia (Ruzziam) likewise five days at sea.&quot; (Scholia 121)''

The following definition remains even more mysterious:

:''&quot;In pity of their errors, our archbishop ordained as their diocesan capital Birka, which is in the middle of Sweden (Sueoniae) facing [[Jumne]] (Iumnem), the capital of the Slavs, and equally distant from all the coasts of the surrounding sea.&quot; (IV 20)''

Since it is physically impossible for any Swedish town to face Jumne, the latter being situated along [[Oder|River Oder]], Adam's statement is probably a misunderstanding. No place having a similar name to Birka is known to have situated on the opposite shore of Oder, so it may be possible that something similar to Jumne was located opposite to Birka.

===Bishop in Birka===
[[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]] that oversaw the missionary work in Scandinavia until 1103, had appointed bishops to Sweden at least from 1014 onwards, the first see being in [[Skara]]. Several bishops were appointed for Sweden in 1060s, one also for Birka.

:''&quot;For Sweden, six were consecrated: [[Adalvard|Adalvard the Elder]] (Adalwardum) and Acilinum, also [[Adalvard|Adalvard the Younger]] (Adalwardum) and Tadicum, and furthermore Simeon (Symeonem) and the monk John (Iohannem).&quot; (III 70)''

''Scholia 94'' appends this as follows:

:''&quot;Adalvard the Elder (Adalwardus senior) was to superintend both lands of the Geats (uterque praefectus est Gothiae), Adalvard the Younger Sigtuna (Sictunam) and Uppsala (Ubsalam), Simeon (Symon) the [[Sami people]] (Scritefingos), John (Iohannes) the islands of the Baltic Sea.&quot; (Scholia 94)''

Furthermore, the following was said about John's location after talking about Birka:

:''&quot;For this city he ordained, as the first among our people, the abbot Hiltin, whom he wanted to call John.&quot; (IV 20)''

John seems to have been situated in Birka in order to prepare for the missionary work among the many heathen people that flooded to Birca from around the Baltic coasts. This was a logical continuation to Birka's position as the first missionary town in Sweden. Noteworthy here is that the biggest islands in the Baltic Sea, [[Öland]] and [[Gotland]], were part of the [[diocese of Linköping]] in the Middle Ages, covering also Östergötland and eastern [[Småland]].

===Location of Unni's tomb===
''Scholia 122'' of IV 20 locates the tomb of Hamburg's archbishop [[Unni (archbishop)|Unni]] in Birka:

:''&quot;There is the port of Saint [[Ansgar]] and the tomb of the holy Archbishop Unni, and a familiar haven, it is said, for the holy confessors of our diocese.&quot; (Scholia 122)''

According to ''Gesta'', Unni had died in 936 (I 64).&lt;ref&gt;Unni's head was taken to the Cathedral of Bremen where it still today is. Date 17.9.936 is written in the lead plate attached to the saint's skull. Lindqvist, Herman. ''Historien om Sverige.'', 1992. ISBN 91-1-931502-3. See page 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birka's destruction===
After having consistently described Birka as an existing city, ''Scholia 138'' of IV 29 describes Birka's sudden demise. Talking about [[Adalvard|Adalvard the Younger]], the bishop of Sigtuna and later that of Skara, Adam or a later copyist has written:

:''&quot;During his journey he seized the opportunity to make a detour to Birka, which is now reduced to loneliness so that one can hardly find vestiges of the city; therefore impossible to come upon the tomb of the holy Archbishop Unni.&quot; (Scholia 138)''

The remark does not make it clear if Adalvard found the city destroyed or if that had happened after his visit and the later remark was just to warn the future pilgrims not to go there anymore in vain. As Adalvard was back in Bremen already by 1069 and is mentioned as one of Adam's sources of information, it would have been expected that word about Birka's destruction had reached also Adam before he published his work half a decade later.

==Björkö archaeological site==
[[Image:Birka Svarta jorden 1991.jpg|thumb|300px|Excavation in &quot;Black soil&quot; 1991]]
[[Image:BirkaExcavation2.png|thumb|right|300px|Excavation of Birka]]
The exact location of Birca was also lost during the centuries, leading to speculation from Swedish historians. However, the island of Björkö was first claimed to have been Birka already about 1450 in the so-called &quot;[[Chronicle of Sweden]]&quot; (''Prosaiska krönikan''):

:''&quot;And there were three capitals in Sweden two of which were not long away from Uppsala (vpsala). The one was called Sigtuna (siktuna) and the other Birka (birka). Birka was on an island in Lake Mälaren (mälar) that is called Björkö (birköö). The third was in Westgötaland (westergötlandh) and was called Skara (skara).&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordlund.lu.se/Fornsvenska/Fsv%20Folder/05_Filer/Proskron.rtf Prosaiska krönikan]. Original text. Translation in English is by Wikipedia editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

In search of Birka, National Antiquarian [[Johan Hadorph]] was the first to attempt excavations on Björkö in the late 17th century.

In the late 19th century, [[Hjalmar Stolpe]] , an [[Entomology|entomologist]] by education, arrived on Björkö to study fossilized insects found in [[amber]] on the island. Stolpe found very large amounts of amber on the island, which is unusual since amber is not normally found in lake Mälaren. Stolpe speculated that the island may have been an important trading post, prompting him to conduct a series of archeological excavations between 1871-95. The excavations soon indicated that a major settlement had been located on the island and eventually Stolpe spent two decades excavating the island. After Björkö came to be identified with ancient Birka, it has been assumed that the original name of Birka was simply ''Bierkø'' (sometimes spelt ''Bjärkö''), an earlier form of ''Björkö''.

Ownership of Björkö is today mainly in private hands, and used for farming. The settlement site, however is an [[archaeological]] site, and a [[museum]] has been built nearby for exhibition of finds, models and reconstructions. It is a popular site to visit during the summer times.

The archaeological remains are located in the north part of Björkö and span an area of about 7 [[hectare]]s (17 [[acre]]s). The remains are both burial-sites and buildings, and in the south part of this area, there is also a [[hill fort]] called &quot;Borgen&quot; (&quot;The Fortress&quot;). The construction technique of the buildings is still unknown, but the main material was [[wood]]. An adjacent island holds the remains of [[Hovgården]], an estate which housed the King's retinue during visits.

Approximately 700 people lived at Birka when it was as largest, and about 3,000 graves have been found.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Its administrative center was supposedly located outside of the settlement itself, on the nearby island of [[Adelsö]].

The most recent large excavation was undertaken between 1990-95 in a region of &quot;black earth&quot;, believed to be the site of the main settlement. Björkö is today mainly agricultural, and shipping lines carry tourists to the island, where a museum showcases a view of life during the Viking era.

'''Beta-lactamases''' are [[enzyme]]s ({{EC number|3.5.2.6}}) produced by some bacteria and are responsible for their [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s like [[penicillin]]s, [[cephamycin]]s, and [[carbapenem]]s ([[ertapenem]]). ([[Cephalosporin]]s are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase.) These [[antibiotic]]s have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a [[beta-lactam]]. The lactamase enzyme breaks that ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties.

Beta-lactam antibiotics are typically used to treat a broad spectrum of [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.   Beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms are usually secreted.

The structure of a ''[[Streptomyces]]'' β lactamase is given by {{PDB link|1BSG}}.

==Penicillinase==
Penicillinase is a specific type of β-lactamase, showing specificity for [[penicillin]]s, again by [[hydrolysis|hydrolysing]] the [[beta-lactam]] ring.  Molecular weights of the various penicillinases tend to cluster near 50kiloDalton.

Penicillinase was the first β-lactamase to be identified: it was first isolated by Abraham and Chain in 1940 from Gram-negative  ''E. coli'' even before penicillin entered clinical use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=An enzyme from bacteria able to destroy penicillin | author=Abraham EP, Chain E | journal=Nature | year=1940 | volume=46 | pages=837 | doi=10.1038/146837a0 | issue=3713}}&lt;/ref&gt; but penicillinase production quickly spread to bacteria that previously did not produce it or only produced it rarely.  Penicillinase-resistant beta-lactams such as [[methicillin]] were developed, but there is now widespread [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to even these.

==Classification of Beta Lactamase==
===Functional Classification&lt;ref&gt;*Bush K, Jacoby GA, Medeiros AA.1995. [http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/39/6/1211?ijkey=c8e8586b43c1d0526d3f78dcfadea52ad10fb65d&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha &quot;A functional classification scheme for beta-lactamases and its correlation with molecular structure.&quot;] ''Antimicrob Agents Chemother.''. 1995;39: 1211-33&lt;/ref&gt;===
====Group 1====
;CEPHALOSPORINASE, Molecular Class C ''(not inhibited by clavulanic acid)''
:Group 1 are cephalosporinases not inhibited by [[clavulanic acid]], belonging to the molecular class C

====Group 2====
Group 2 are penicillinases, cephalosporinases, or both inhibited by clavulanic acid, corresponding to the molecular classes A and D reflecting the original TEM and SHV genes. However, because of the increasing number of TEM- and SHV-derived {beta}-lactamases, they were divided into two subclasses, 2a and 2b.

;GROUP 2a: PENICILLINASE, Molecular Class A
:The ''2a subgroup'' contains just penicillinases.

;GROUP 2b: BROAD-SPECTRUM, Molecular Class A
:''2b'' Opposite to 2a , 2b are broad-spectrum {beta}-lactamases, meaning that they are capable of inactivating [[penicillins]] and [[cephalosporins]] at the same rate. Furthermore, new subgroups were segregated from subgroup 2b:

;GROUP 2be: EXTENDED-SPECTRUM, Molecular Class A
:''Subgroup 2be'', with the letter &quot;e&quot; for extended spectrum of activity, represents the ESBLs, which are capable of inactivating third-generation cephalosporins ([[ceftazidime]], [[cefotaxime]], and [[cefpodoxime]]) as well as [[monobactams]] (aztreonam)

;GROUP 2br: INHIBITOR-RESISTANT, Molecular Class A ''(diminished inhibition by clavulanic acid)''
:The ''2br'' enzymes, with the letter &quot;r&quot; denoting reduced binding to [[clavulanic acid]] and [[sulbactam]], are also called inhibitor-resistant TEM-derivative enzymes; nevertheless, they are commonly still susceptible to [[tazobactam]], except where an amino acid replacement exists at position met69.

;GROUP 2c: CARBENICILLINASE, Molecular Class A
:Later''subgroup 2c'' was segregated from group 2 because these enzymes inactivate [[carbenicillin]] more than [[benzylpenicillin]], with some effect on [[cloxacillin]].

;GROUP 2d: CLOXACILANASE, Molecular Class D or A
:''Subgroup 2d'' enzymes inactivate [[cloxacillin]] more than [[benzylpenicillin]], with some activity against [[carbenicillin]]; these enzymes are poorly inhibited by [[clavulanic acid]], and some of them are ESBLs

:the correct term is &quot;OXACILLINASE&quot;. These enzymes are able to inactivate the oxazolylpenicillins like oxacilli, cloxacilli, dicloxacillin. The enzymes belong to the molecular class D not molecular class A.

;GROUP 2e: CEPHALOSPORINASE, Molecular Class A
:''Subgroup 2e'' enzymes are cephalosporinases that can also hydrolyse [[monobactams]], and they are inhibited by [[clavulanic acid]]

;GROUP 2f: CARBAPENAMASE, Molecular Class A
:''Subgroup 2f'' was added because these are [[serine]]-based carbapenemases, in contrast to the zinc-based carbapenemases included in group 3

====Group 3====
;METALLOENZYME, Molecular Class B ''(not inhibited by clavulanic acid)''
:Group 3 are the [[zinc]] based or metallo {beta}-lactamases, corresponding to the molecular class B, which are the only enzymes acting by the metal ion zinc, as discussed above. Metallo B-lactamases are able to hydrolyse penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Thus, carbapenems are inhibited by both group 2f (serine-based mechanism) and group 3 (zinc-based mechanism)

====Group 4====
;PENICILLINASE, No Molecular Class ''(not inhibited by clavulanic acid)''
:Group 4 are penicillinases that are not inhibited by [[clavulanic acid]], and they do not yet have a corresponding molecular class.

===Molecular Classification===

The molecular classification of β-lactamases is based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequences in these enzymes. To date, four classes are recognised (A-D), correlating with the functional classification. Classes A, C, and D act by a [[serine]]-based mechanism, whereas class B or [[metallo-beta-lactamase protein fold|metallo-β-lactamases]] need [[zinc]] for their action&lt;ref&gt;*Ambler RP.1980. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=6109327&amp;dopt=Abstract &quot;The structure of beta-lactamases.&quot;] ''Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci.''. 1980;289: 321-31&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Penicillinase&quot; was discovered in 1940 and re-named Beta-lactamase when the structure of the Beta-lactam ring was finally elucidated.

==Resistance in Gram-negative bacteria==
Among Gram-negative bacteria, the emergence of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins has been a major concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (''[[E. cloacae]]'' , ''[[C. freundii]]'', ''[[S. marcescens]]'', and ''[[P. aeruginosa]]'' ) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally-producing AmpC enzymes (''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'' spp., ''[[Proteus mirabilis|P. mirabilis]]'') due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example [[ceftizoxime]], [[cefotaxime]] , [[ceftriaxone]], and [[ceftazidime]], as well as the oxyimino-monobactam [[aztreonam]]), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins  ([[cephamycins]]); in other words, ([[cefoxitin]] and [[cefotetan]]) have been blocked by inhibitors such as [[clavulanate]], [[sulbactam]], or [[tazobactam]], and did not involve [[carbapenems]]. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins ([[cephamycins]]) such as [[cefoxitin]] or [[cefotetan]] are not affected by commercially-available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.&lt;ref&gt;*Philippon A, Arlet B, Jacoby GA.2002. [http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/46/1/1.pdf &quot;Plasmid-determined AmpC-type β-lactamases&quot;] ''Antimicrob Agents Chemother.''. 2002; 46:
1-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)===
Members of the family [[Enterobacteriaceae]] commonly express plasmid-encoded β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1). which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, a new group of enzymes, the extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected. (first detected in Germany in 1983).&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal | author = Knothe H, Shah P. Kremery V ''et al.'' | year = 1983 | title = Transferable resistance to cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole and cefuroxime in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and [[Serratia marcescens]] | url =http://www.springerlink.com/content/g4r4734xk8148r1u/ | journal = Infection | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 315–7 | doi = 10.1007/BF01641355 | pmid = 6321357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include [[cefotaxime]], [[ceftriaxone]], and [[ceftazidime]], as well as the oxyimino-monobactam [[aztreonam]]. Thus ESBLs confer resistance to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. This extends the spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal | author = Emery C. L., Weymouth L. A. | year = 1997 | title = Detection and clinical significance of extended-spectrum β-lactamases in a tertiary-care medical center | url = http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/35/8/2061?ijkey=d2affb0b60c6a70b4b4f1324e5c76e4c2559e370&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | journal = J. Clin. Microbiol | volume = 35 | issue = 8| pages = 2061–2067 | pmid = 9230382 | pmc = 229903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.

===Types===

====TEM beta-lactamases (class A)====
TEM-1 is the most commonly-encountered beta-lactamase in [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. Up to 90% of ampicillin resistance in [[E. coli]] is due to the production of TEM-1{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.  Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in ''[[H. influenzae]]'' and ''[[N. gonorrhoeae]]'' in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in ''[[E. coli]]'' and ''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', they are also found in other species of Gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the ESBL phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to b-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid. Single amino acid substitutions at positions 104, 164, 238, and 240 produce the ESBL phenotype, but ESBLs with the broadest spectrum usually have more than a single amino acid substitution. Based upon different combinations of changes, currently 140 TEM-type enzymes have been described. TEM-10, TEM-12, and TEM-26 are among the most common in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal | author = Paterson DL, Hujer KM, Hujer AM ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | title = Extended-spectrum b-lactamases in Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream isolates from seven countries: dominance and widespread prevalence of SHV- and CTX-M-type b-lactamases | url = http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/47/11/3554 | volume = 47 | issue = 11| pages = 3554–60 | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.11.3554-3560.2003 | pmid = 14576117 | pmc = 253771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Bradford PA.2001.

====SHV beta-lactamases (class A)====
SHV-1 shares 68 percent of its amino acids with TEM-1 and has a similar overall structure. The SHV-1 beta-lactamase is most commonly found in ''[[K. pneumoniae]]'' and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in this species. ESBLs in this family also have amino acid changes around the active site, most commonly at positions 238 or 238 and 240. More than 60 SHV varieties are known. They are the predominant ESBL type in Europe and the United States and are found worldwide. SHV-5 and SHV-12 are among the most common.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal | author = Paterson DL, Hujer KM, Hujer AM ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | title = Extended-spectrum b-lactamases in Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream isolates from seven countries: dominance and widespread prevalence of SHV- and CTX-M-type b-lactamases | url = http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/47/11/3554 | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother | volume = 47 | issue = 11 | pages = 3554–60 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.11.3554-3560.2003 | pmid = 14576117 | pmc = 253771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CTX-M beta-lactamases (class A) ====
These enzymes were named for their greater activity against [[cefotaxime]] than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (e.g., [[ceftazidime]], [[ceftriaxone]], or [[cefepime]]). Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally found on the chromosome of ''[[Kluyvera]]'' species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they show only approximately 40% identity with these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases. More than 80 CTX-M enzymes are currently known. Despite their name, a few are more active on [[ceftazidime]] than [[cefotaxime]]. They have mainly been found in strains of ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'' serovar ''Typhimurium'' and ''[[E. coli]]'', but have also been described in other species of [[Enterobacteriaceae]] and are the predominant ESBL type in parts of South America. (They are also seen in eastern Europe) CTX-M-14, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-2 are the most widespread.  CTX-M-15 is currently (2006) the most widespread type in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' the UK and is widely prevalent in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Woodford N, Ward E, Kaufmann ME, ''et al.'' | title=Molecular characterisation of ''Escherichia coli'' isolates producing CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) in the United Kingdom | publisher=Health Protection Agency | accessdate=2006-11-19 | url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/cfi/armrl/ARMRL_posters/Woodford%20ECCMID%202004%20poster.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====OXA beta-lactamases (class D)====
OXA beta-lactamases were long recognized as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze [[oxacillin]] and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d . The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to [[ampicillin]] and [[cephalothin]] and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against [[oxacillin]] and [[cloxacillin]] and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by [[clavulanic acid]]. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in ''[[E. coli]]'', ''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', and other [[Enterobacteriaceae]], the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in ''[[P. aeruginosa]]''. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.

====Others====
Other plasmid-mediated ESBLs, such as PER, VEB, GES, and IBC beta-lactamases, have been described but are uncommon and have been found mainly in ''[[P. aeruginosa]]'' and at a limited number of geographic sites. PER-1 in isolates in Turkey, France, and Italy; VEB-1 and VEB-2 in strains from Southeast Asia; and GES-1, GES-2, and IBC-2 in isolates from South Africa, France, and Greece. PER-1 is also common in multiresistant acinetobacter species in Korea and Turkey. Some of these enzymes are found in Enterobacteriaceae as well, whereas other uncommon ESBLs (such as BES-1, IBC-1, SFO-1, and TLA-1) have been found only in Enterobacteriaceae.

====Treatment====
While ESBL-producing organisms were previously associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly found in the community.  CTX-M-15-positive [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] are a cause of community-acquired [[cystitis|urinary infections]] in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Woodford N, Ward E, Kaufmann ME, ''et al.'' | title=Molecular characterisation of ''Escherichia coli'' isolates producing CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum βlactamase (ESBL) in the United Kingdom | url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/cfi/armrl/ARMRL_posters/Woodford%20ECCMID%202004%20poster.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to be resistant to all oral β-lactam antibiotics, as well as [[quinolones]] and [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s.  Treatment options may include [[nitrofurantoin]], [[fosfomycin]], [[mecillinam]] and [[chloramphenicol]].  In desperation, once-daily [[ertapenem]] or [[gentamicin]] injections may also be used.

===Inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases===
Although the inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases are not ESBLs, they are often discussed with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of ''[[E. coli]]'', but also some strains of ''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Klebsiella oxytoca]]'', ''[[Proteus mirabilis|P. mirabilis]]'', and ''[[Citrobacter freundii]]'' .Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by [[clavulanic acid]] and [[sulbactam]], thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—lactamase inhibitor combinations of [[amoxicillin]]-[[clavulanate]] ([[Co-amoxiclav]]), [[ticarcillin]]-[[clavulanate]], and [[ampicillin/sulbactam]], they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by [[tazobactam]] and subsequently the combination of [[piperacillin/tazobactam]], although resistance has been described. To date, these beta-lactamases have primarily been detected in France and a few other locations within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;*Bradford PA.2001. [http://intl-cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/14/4/933 &quot;Extended-spectrum β-lactamases in the 21st century:characterization, epidemiology, and detection of this important resistance threat.&quot;] &quot;Clin Microbiol Rev.''. 2001; 48:933-51&lt;/ref&gt;

===AmpC-type β-lactamases (Class C)===
AmpC type β-lactamases are commonly isolated from extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. AmpC β-lactamases (also termed class C or group 1) are typically encoded on the chromosome of many Gram-negative bacteria including ''[[Citrobacter]]'', ''[[Serratia]]'' and ''[[Enterobacter]]'' species where its expression is usually inducible; it may also occur on ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' but is not usually inducible, although it can be hyperexpressed.  AmpC type β-lactamases may also be carried on plasmids.&lt;ref&gt;*Philippon A, Arlet B, Jacoby GA.2002. [http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/46/1/1.pdf &quot;Plasmid-determined AmpC-type β-lactamases&quot;] ''Antimicrob Agents Chemother.''. 2002; 46:&lt;/ref&gt; AmpC β-lactamases, in contrast to ESBLs, hydrolyse broad and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cephamycins as well as to oxyimino-β-lactams) but are not inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors such as [[clavulanic acid]].

===Carbapenemases===
Carbapenems are famously stable to AmpC β-lactamases and extended-spectrum-β-lactamases. Carbapenemases are a diverse group of b-lactamases that are active not only against the oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins but also against the carbapenems. Aztreonam is stable to the metallo-β-lactamases
but many IMP and VIM producers are resistant, owing to other mechanisms.   Carbapenemases were formerly believed to derive only from classes A, B, and D, but a class C carbapenemase has been described.

====IMP-type carbapenemases (one of the metallo-β-lactamases)====
Plasmid-mediated IMP-type carbapenemases, 17 varieties of which are currently known, became established in Japan in the 1990s in both enteric Gram-negative organisms and in ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' species. IMP enzymes spread slowly to other countries in the Far East, were reported from Europe in 1997, and have been found in Canada and Brazil.

====VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase)====
A second growing family of carbapenemases, the VIM family, was reported from Italy in 1999 and now includes 10 members, which have a wide geographic distribution in Europe, South America, and the Far East and have been found in the United States. VIM-1 was discovered in P. aeruginosa in Italy in 1996; since then, VIM-2 - now the predominant variant - was found repeatedly in Europe and the Far East; VIM-3 and -4 are minor variants of VIM-2 and -1, respectively. VIM enzymes occur mostly in P. aeruginosa, also P. putidaand, very rarely, Enterobacteriaceae.

Amino acid sequence diversity is up to 10% in the VIM family, 15% in the IMP family, and 70% between VIM and IMP. Enzymes of both the families, nevertheless, are similar. Both are integron-associated, sometimes within plasmids. Both hydrolyse all β-lactams except monobactams, and evade all β-lactam inhibitors.

==== OXA (oxacillinase) group of β-lactamases (Class D) ====
The OXA group of β-lactamases occur mainly in Acinetobacter species and are divided into two clusters. OXA carbapenemases hydrolyse carbapenems very slowly ''in vitro'', and the high MICs seen for some Acinetobacter hosts (&gt;64&amp;nbsp;mg/L) may reflect secondary mechanisms. They are sometimes augmented in clinical isolates by additional resistance mechanisms, such as impermeability or efflux.  OXA carbapenemases also tend to have a reduced hydrolytic efficiency towards penicillins and cephalosporins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Santillana  ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Crystal structure of the carbapenemase OXA-24 reveals insights into the mechanism of carbapenem hydrolysis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 104 | issue = 13| pages = 5354–5359 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0607557104 | pmid = 17374723 | pmc = 1838445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====KPC (''K. pneumoniae'' carbapenemase) (Class A)====
A few class A enzymes, most noted the plasmid-mediated KPC enzymes, are effective carbapenemases as well. Ten variants, KPC-2 through KPC-11 are known, and they are distinguished by one or two amino-acid substitutions (KPC-1 was re-sequenced in 2008 and found to be 100% homologous to published sequences of KPC-2). KPC-1 was found in North Carolina, KPC-2 in Baltimore and KPC-3 in New York. They have only 45% homology with SME and NMC/IMI enzymes and, unlike them, can be encoded by self-transmissible plasmids.

The class A ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' carbapenemase ([[Beta-lactamase#KPC_.28K._pneumoniae_carbapenemase.29_.28Class_A.29|KPC]]) is currently the most common carbapenemase, which was first detected in [[North Carolina]], USA, in 1996 and has since spread worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nordmann P, Cuzon G, Naas T |title=The real threat of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=228–36 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19324295 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70054-4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later publication indicated that Enterobacteriaceae that produce KPC were becoming common in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pathol Biol (Paris) |date=2010 Feb |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=39–45 |trans_title=KPC carbapenemases: what is at stake in clinical microbiology? |title=KPC carbapenemases: what is at stake in clinical microbiology? |language=French |author=Cuzon G, Naas T, Nordmann P |pmid=19854586 |doi=10.1016/j.patbio.2009.07.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CMY (Class C)====
The first class C carbapenemase was described in 2006 and was isolated from a virulent strain of ''Enterobacter aerogenes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kim JY, Jung HI, An YJ, ''et al.'' | title=Structural basis for the extended substrate spectrum of CMY-10, a plasmid-encoded class C beta-lactamase | journal=Mol Microbiol | year=2006 | volume=60 | pages=907&amp;ndash;16 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05146.x | pmid=16677302 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is carried on a plasmid, pYMG-1, and is therefore transmissible to other bacterial strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lee JH, Jung HI, Jung JH, ''et al.'' | title=Dissemination of transferable AmpC-type β-lactamase (CMY-10) in a Korean hospital | journal=Microbiol Drug Resist | year=2004 | volume=10 | pages=224&amp;ndash;30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SME, IMI, NMC and CcrA====
In general, these are of little clinical significance.

CcrA (CfiA). Its gene occurs in c. 1-3% of B. fragilis isolates, but fewer produce the enzyme since expression demands appropriate migration of an insertion sequence. CcrA was known before imipenem was introduced, and producers have shown little subsequent increase.

====NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase)====
{{Main|New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase}}
Originally described from [[New Delhi]] in 2009, this gene is now widespread in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' from [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. As of mid-2010, NDM-1 carrying bacteria have been introduced to other countries (including the [[USA]] and [[UK]]), presumably by [[Medical tourism in India|medical tourists]] undergoing [[surgery]] in India.

==Treatment of ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemases==
===General Overview===

In general, an isolate is suspected to be an ESBL producer when it shows ''in vitro'' susceptibility to the second-generation [[cephalosporin]]s ([[cefoxitin]], [[cefotetan]]) but resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins and to [[aztreonam]]. Moreover, one should suspect these strains when treatment with these agents for Gram-negative infections fails despite reported ''in vitro'' susceptibility. Once an ESBL-producing strain is detected, the laboratory should report it as &quot;resistant&quot; to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, even if it is tested (in vitro) as susceptible.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Associated resistance to [[aminoglycosides]] and [[trimethoprim]]-[[sulfamethoxazole]], as well as high frequency of co-existence of [[fluoroquinolone]] resistance, creates problems. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as [[clavulanate]], [[sulbactam]], and [[tazobactam]] ''in vitro'' inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy. [[Cephamycins]] ([[cefoxitin]] and [[cefotetan]]) are not hydrolyzed by majority of ESBLs, but are hydrolyzed by associated AmpC-type β-lactamase.  Also, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may not be effective against organisms that produce AmpC-type β-lactamase.  Sometimes these strains decrease the expression of outer membrane proteins, rendering them resistant to cephamycins. ''In vivo'' studies have yielded mixed results against ESBL-producing ''[[K. pneumoniae]]''. ([[Cefepime]], a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has demonstrated ''in vitro'' stability in the presence of many ESBL/AmpC strains.) Currently, [[carbapenems]] are, in general, regarded as the preferred agent for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent ''in vitro'' activity against strains of [[Enterobacteriaceae]] expressing ESBLs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=== According to genes ===
====ESBLs====

Strains producing only ESBLs are susceptible to [[cephamycins]] and [[carbapenems]] ''in vitro'' and show little if any [[inoculum effect]] with these agents.

For organisms producing '''TEM''' and '''SHV''' type ESBLs, apparent ''in vitro'' sensitivity to [[cefepime]] and to [[piperacillin/tazobactam]] is common, but both drugs show an inoculum effect, with diminished susceptibility as the size of the inoculum is increased from 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;organisms.

Strains with some '''CTX-M'''–type and '''OXA'''-type ESBLs are resistant to [[cefepime]] on testing, despite the use of a standard inoculum.

====Inhibitor-Resistant β-Lactamases====

Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by [[clavulanic acid]] and [[sulbactam]], thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—lactamase inhibitor combinations of [[amoxicillin]]-[[clavulanate]] ([[Co-amoxiclav]]), [[ticarcillin]]-[[clavulanate]], and [[ampicillin/sulbactam]], they remain susceptible to inhibition by [[tazobactam]] and subsequently the combination of [[piperacillin/tazobactam]].

====AmpC====

AmpC-producing strains are typically resistant to [[oxyimino-beta lactams]] and to [[cephamycins]] and are susceptible to [[carbapenems]]; however, diminished porin expression can make such a strain carbapenem-resistant as well.

====Carbapenemases====

Strains with '''IMP-, VIM-, and OXA'''-type carbapenemases usually remain susceptible to [[aztreonam]]. Resistance to non–b-lactam antibiotics is common in strains making any of these enzymes, such that alternative options for non–b-lactam therapy need to be determined by direct susceptibility testing. Resistance to [[fluoroquinolones]] and [[aminoglycosides]] is especially high.

===According to Species===
====''Escherichia coli'' or ''Klebsiella''====

For infections caused by ESBL-producing ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' or ''[[Klebsiella]]'' species, treatment with [[imipenem]] or [[meropenem]] has been associated with the best outcomes in terms of survival and bacteriologic clearance. [[Cefepime]] and [[piperacillin/tazobactam]] have been less successful. [[Ceftriaxone]], [[cefotaxime]], and [[ceftazidime]] have failed even more often, despite the organism's susceptibility to the antibiotic ''in vitro''. Several reports have documented failure of [[cephamycin]] therapy as a result of resistance due to porin loss. Some patients have responded to [[aminoglycoside]] or [[quinolone]] therapy, but in a recent comparison of [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[imipenem]] for bacteremia involving an ESBL-producing ''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', [[imipenem]] produced the better outcome.

====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''====

There have been few clinical studies to define the optimal therapy for infections caused by ESBL producing ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' strains.

'''Burhanuddin Rabbani''' ({{lang-fa|برهان الدين رباني}} - ''Burhânuddîn Rabbânî'') (b. 1940), is a former President of [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=BbcNews2001-11-14&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Burhanuddin Rabbani is the leader of [[Jamiat-e Islami]] Afghanistan (Islamic Society of Afghanistan). He also served as the political head of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan]] (UIFSA), an alliance of various political groups who fought against [[Taliban]] rule in Afghanistan. He served as President from 1992-1996 until he was forced to leave Kabul because of the Taliban takeover of the city. His government was recognized by many countries, as well as the [[United Nations]]. He is currently the head of Afghanistan National Front (known in the media as [[United National Front (Afghanistan)|United National Front]]), the largest political opposition to [[Hamid Karzai]]'s government.

==Early years==
Rabbani, son of Muhammed Yousuf, was born in 1940 in [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], northern Afghanistan. He is an ethnic [[Tājik people|Tajik]]. After finishing school in his native province, he went to Darul-uloom-e-Sharia (Abu-Hanifa), a religious school in Kabul. When he graduated from Abu-Hanifa, he went to [[Kabul University]] to study Islamic Law and Theology. During his four years at Kabul University he became well known for his works on [[Islam]]. Soon after his graduation in 1963, he was hired as a professor at [[Kabul University]]. In order to enhance himself, Rabbani went to [[Egypt]] in 1966, and he entered the [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo where he developed close ties to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burke&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Al-Qaeda: The True Story Of Radical Islam  |author=Burke, Jason |publisher=I. B. Tauris |year=2004 |pages= 66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two years, he received his [[masters degree]] in [[Islamic Philosophy]]. Rabbani was one of the first Afghans to translate the works of [[Sayyid Qutb]] into [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burke&quot;/&gt;

==Jamiat-e Islami==
Rabbani returned to Afghanistan in 1968, where the High Council of [[Jamiat-e Islami]] gave him the duty of organizing the University students. Due to his knowledge, reputation, and active support for the cause of Islam, in 1972, a 15-member council selected him as head of Jamiat-e Islami of Afghanistan; the founder of Jamiat-e Islami of Afghanistan, Ghulam M. Niyazi was also present.  Jamiat-e Islami was primarily composed of [[Tājik people|Tajiks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan: Analysis and Chronology |author=Rogers, Tom |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1992 |pages= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1974, the police came to Kabul University to arrest Rabbani for his pro-Islamic stance, but with the help of his students the police were unable to capture him, and he managed to escape to the countryside.

When the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviets supported the 1979 coup]], Rabbani helped lead Jamiat-e Islami in resistance to the PDPA regime. Rabbani's forces were the first [[mujahideen]] elements to enter Kabul in 1992 when the PDPA government fell from power.

The four-engine 747 uses a [[double-deck aircraft|double deck]] configuration for part of its length. It is available in passenger, freighter and other versions. Boeing designed the 747's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first class lounge or (as is the general rule today) extra seating, and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door. Boeing did so because the company expected [[Supersonic transport|supersonic airliners]] (whose development was announced in the early 1960s) to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete, while believing that the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would be robust into the future.&lt;ref&gt;Orlebar 2002, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The 747 in particular was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Matthew L.

==Development==
===Background===
In 1963, the [[United States Air Force]] started a series of study projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft. Although the [[C-141 Starlifter]] was being introduced, they felt that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially the capability to carry outsized [[cargo]] that would not fit in any existing aircraft. These studies led to initial requirements for the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS) in March 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of {{convert|180000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} and a speed of Mach 0.75 ({{convert|500|mph|km/h|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=/}}), and an unrefueled range of {{convert|5000|nmi|km|sigfig=3}} with a payload of {{convert|115000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}. The payload bay had to be {{convert|17|ft|m|sigfig=3}} wide by {{convert|13.5|ft|m|sigfig=3}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=3}} long with access through doors at the front and rear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton_C-5&quot;&gt;Norton 2003, pp. 5–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Featuring only four engines, the design also required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. On 18 May 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[Martin Marietta]]; while engine proposals were submitted by [[GE Aviation|General Electric]], [[Curtiss-Wright]], and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]]. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney for the engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton_C-5&quot;/&gt;

All three of the airframe proposals shared a number of features. As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was. All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit to above the cargo area; Douglas had a small &quot;pod&quot; just forward and above the wing, Lockheed used a long &quot;spine&quot; running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it, while Boeing blended the two, with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html &quot;Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Partners in Freedom.&quot;] ''NASA'', 2000, see images in &quot;Langley Contributions to the C-5&quot;. Retrieved: December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 Lockheed's aircraft design and General Electric's engine design were selected for the new [[C-5 Galaxy]] transport, which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton_C-5&quot;/&gt; The nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airliner proposal===
The 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_p13&gt;Norris and Wagner 1997, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The era of commercial jet transportation, led by the enormous popularity of the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]], had revolutionized long-distance travel.&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_p13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/companyoffices/gallery/images/commercial/707-03.html &quot;Boeing Multimedia Image Gallery 707&quot;]. ''The Boeing Company''. Retrieved: December 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was pressed by [[Juan Trippe]], president of [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am), one of its most important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a large new aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/chasingthesun/innovators/jtrippe.html &quot;Innovators: Juan Trippe.&quot;] ''PBS''. Retrieved: December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, [[Joe Sutter]] was transferred from Boeing's [[Boeing 737|737]] development team to manage the studies for a new airliner, already assigned the model number 747.&lt;ref name=&quot;sutter_p.80&quot;&gt;Sutter 2006, pp. 80–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Sutter initiated a design study with Pan Am and other airlines, in order to better understand their requirements. At the time, it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by [[supersonic transport]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/852087.stm &quot;Air travel, a supersonic future?.&quot;] ''BBC News'', July 17, 2001. Retrieved: December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined. In the freighter role, the clear need was to support the [[Containerization|containerized shipping]] methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time. Standard containers are {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} square at the front (slightly higher due to attachment points) and available in {{convert|20|and|40|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} lengths. This meant that it would be possible to support a 2-wide 2-high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier CX-HLS project.

In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 747-100 aircraft for US$525 million. During the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing's 50th Anniversary, Juan Trippe predicted that the 747 would be &quot;... a great weapon for peace, competing with [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile|intercontinental missiles]] for mankind's destiny&quot;, according to [[Malcolm T. Stamper]], one of the senior management for the 747 program at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disc_Chan_747&quot;&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6853359534780959649 &quot;Great Planes-Boeing 747.&quot;] ''Discovery Channel''.

===Design effort===
Ultimately, the high-winged CX-HLS Boeing design was not used for the 747, although technologies developed for their bid had an influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Partners/C_5.html &quot;Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Partners in Freedom.&quot;] ''NASA'', 2000. Retrieved: December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The original design included a full-length double-deck fuselage with rows of eight-across seating and two aisles on the lower deck and seven-across seating and two aisles on the upper deck.&lt;ref name=&quot;irving282&quot;&gt;Irving 1994, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; However, concern over evacuation routes and limited cargo-carrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucfc747&quot;/&gt; The cockpit was, therefore, placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freight-loading door could be included in the nose cone; this design feature produced the 747's distinctive &quot;bulge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutter p.93&quot;/&gt; In early models it was not clear what to do with the small space in the pod behind the cockpit, and this was initially specified as a &quot;lounge&quot; area with no permanent seating.

General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geae.com/engines/commercial/cf6/history.html &quot;GE Aviation: CF6.&quot;] ''GE Aviation''.

The project was designed with a new methodology called [[fault tree analysis]], which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucfc747&quot;/&gt; To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]] systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutter p.1218&quot;&gt;Sutter 2006, pp. 121, 128–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some of the most advanced [[high-lift device]]s used in the industry were included in the new design, in order to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included leading edge flaps running almost the entire length of the wing, as well as complex three-part slotted [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] along the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Guy and Wagner 1997, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21% and lift by 90% when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2000, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969. The delivery date left 28 months to design the aircraft, which was two-thirds the normal time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutter p.96&quot;&gt;Sutter 2006, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule was so fast paced that the people who worked on it were given the nickname &quot;The Incredibles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Guy and Wagner 1997, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have &quot;bet the company&quot; when it started the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucfc747&quot;/&gt;

As Boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airliner, they chose to build a new plant. The company considered locations in about 50 cities,&lt;ref&gt;Pascall, Glenn R.

Developing the 747 had been a major challenge, and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking. Boeing president [[William M. Allen]] asked [[Malcolm T. Stamper]], then head of the company's turbine division, to oversee construction of the [[Boeing Everett Factory|Everett factory]] and to start production of the 747.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Tom.

===Development and testing===
Before the first 747 was fully assembled, testing began on many components and systems. One important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock-up via the aircraft's emergency chutes. The first full-scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], and several volunteers were injured. Subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries. Most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft's upper deck; instead of using a conventional slide, volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel.&lt;ref name=&quot;irving383&quot;&gt;Irving 1994, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft. Boeing built an unusual training device known as &quot;Waddell's Wagon&quot; (named for a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) that consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck. While the first 747s were still being built, the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position.&lt;ref name=&quot;hist747&quot;&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/history/boeing/747.html &quot;History - &quot;747 Commercial Transport.&quot;] ''The Boeing Company''.

During later stages of the flight test program, [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|flutter]] testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions. This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components.

The huge cost of developing the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate. During the final months before delivery of the first aircraft, the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project.

The 747 line was further developed with the launching of the 747-300 in 1980. The {{nowrap|-300}} resulted from Boeing studies to increase the [[seating capacity]] of the 747. Solutions such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected.

The 747-100 was the original variant launched in 1966. The 747-200 soon followed, with an order in 1968. The 747-300 was launched in 1980 and was followed in 1985 by the 747-400. Ultimately, the 747-8 was announced in 2005. Several versions of each variant have been produced. Many of the early variants were in production simultaneously.

===747-100===

The first 747-100s were built with six upper-deck windows (three per side) to accommodate upstairs lounge areas. Later, as airlines began to use the upper-deck for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space, Boeing offered a 10-window upper deck as an option. Some -100s were retrofitted with the new configuration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aircraftspotting.net/aircraft/boeing_747.html &quot;Boeing 747.&quot;] ''Aircraft Spotting''.

====747SR====
Responding to requests from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a &quot;short range&quot; variant of the 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and more than 550 in later models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_747_classics&quot;/&gt; The 747SR had an &quot;economic design life objective&quot; of 52,000 flights during 20 years of airline operation, compared to 20,000 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and undercarriage to accommodate the added stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoffs and landings.&lt;ref&gt;Kane [http://books.google.com/books?id=nCFYdB2H05UC&amp;pg=PA534&amp;lpg=PA534&amp;dq=747sr&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sviCNP0_wb&amp;sig=kPnsW0VGN7ONVVYAP5i6RvzoUZg 2004, p. 534.]&lt;/ref&gt; Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20% reduction in fuel capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Itabashi et al. 1995, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial order for the -100SR, four aircraft for Japan Air Lines (JAL, later Japan Airlines), was announced on October 30, 1972; rollout occurred on August 3, 1973, and the first flight took place on August 31, 1973. The type was certified by the FAA on September 26, 1973, with the first delivery on the same day. The -100SR entered service with JAL, the type's sole customer, on October 7, 1973, and typically operated Japanese domestic flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;B747_milest&quot;&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/pf/pf_milestones.html &quot;747 Milestones.&quot;] ''The Boeing Company''.

Following the -100SR, Boeing produced the -100BSR, a 747SR variant with increased takeoff weight capability. Debuting in 1978, the -100BSR also incorporated structural modifications for a high cycle-to-flying hour ratio; a related standard -100B model debuted in 1979. The -100BSR first flew on November 3, 1978, with first delivery to [[All Nippon Airways]] (ANA) on December 21, 1978.

===747-200===
The series 100 powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-3A engines offered enough payload and range for US domestic operations, but it was marginal for long international route sectors. This demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to improved series 200. The 747-200 has more powerful engines, increased MTOW, and greater range than the -100. In its first three years of production, the series 200 featured [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D|Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7]] engines (initially the only engine available).

===Undeveloped variants===
Boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage.

====747 trijet====
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with [[trijet|three-engines]] to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range and passenger capacity. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an [[S-duct]] intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747 that resulted in the 747SP.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the [[Boeing 777]], a long-range twinjet airliner smaller than the 747-400 entered service in the market where the 747-300 had been targeted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.747sp.com/Explained.asp &quot;The Story of the Baby 747.&quot;] ''Boeing 747SP website''.

The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980&amp;nbsp;nmi (9,200&amp;nbsp;mi, 14,800&amp;nbsp;km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_747-400XQLR&quot;&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2002/q1/nr_020225h.html &quot;Boeing Offers New 747-400X Quiet Longer Range Jetliner.&quot;] ''The Boeing Company'', February 26, 2002.

==Accidents and incidents==
{{Main|Boeing 747 hull losses}}

As of September 2010, the 747 has been involved in 124 [[Aviation accidents and incidents|accidents or incidents]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Type=104 &quot;Boeing 747 incidents.&quot;] ''Aviation-Safety.net'', September 3, 2010.

Retrieved: September 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 2,852 fatalities. The 747 has been in 31 [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackings]], which caused 25 fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/type/type-stat.php?type=104 &quot;Boeing 747 Accident Statistics.&quot;] ''Aviation-Safety.net'', Retrieved: December 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few crashes have been attributed to design flaws of the 747. The [[Tenerife disaster]] resulted from pilot error, air traffic control (ATC) error and communications failure, while the [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]] and [[China Airlines Flight 611]] crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. [[United Airlines Flight 811]], which suffered an [[uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]] mid-flight on 24 February 1989, led the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] was shot down by the Soviets in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) for civilian use. [[TWA Flight 800]], a 747-100 that exploded in midair on July 17, 1996, led the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to propose a rule requiring installation of an [[inerting system]] in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008, after years of research into solutions. It is expected that the new safety system will cost $100,000 to $450,000 per aircraft and weigh approximately {{convert|200|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Airlines Ordered to Cut Fuel-Tank Explosion Risk.&quot; ''Wall Street Journal'', July 17, 2008, p. B5. Note: Cargo aircraft and smaller regional jets and commuter aircraft are not subject to this rule.&lt;/ref&gt;

As increasing numbers of &quot;classic&quot; 747-100 and 747-200 series aircraft have been retired, some have found their way into museums or other uses. The ''City of Everett'', the first 747 and prototype is at the [[Museum of Flight]], [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[United States|USA]] where it is sometimes leased to Boeing for test purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofflight.org/Collection/Aircraft.asp?RecordKey=2779CA3D-8016-4339-A7E2-5AAC663A3E3D &quot;Aircraft and Space Craft, Boeing 747-121.&quot;] ''Museum of Flight''.

Upon its retirement from service, the 747 number two in the production line was dis-assembled and shipped to [[Namyangju]], [[Gyeonggi-do]], [[South Korea]] where it was re-assembled and converted into a restaurant. Originally flown commercially by [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] as N747PA &quot;''Clipper Juan T. Trippe''&quot;, and repaired for service following a tailstrike, it stayed with the airline until its bankruptcy. The 747 restaurant closed by 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2009/04/abandoned-boeing-747-restaurant.html &quot;Dark Roasted Blend: Abandoned Boeing 747 Restaurant (and Other Plane Conversions).&quot;] ''darkroastedblend.com'', April 21, 2009.

The '''Battle of Agincourt'''{{Ref label|a|a|none}} was a major English victory against a numerically superior French army in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The battle occurred on Friday 25 October 1415 ([[Saint Crispin's Day]], November 3. [[New style|NS]]), near modern day [[Azincourt]], in northern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Monstrelet|first=Enguerrand |authorlink=Enguerrand de Monstrelet|coauthors=[[Thomas Johnes|Johnes, Thomas]] (trans)|title=The Chronicles of Enguerrand de Monstrelet|publisher=Henry Bohn|location=London|year=1810|edition=1853|page=340|chapter=The French and English meet in battle on the plains of Azincourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|b|b|none}} [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s victory had a crippling effect on France and started a new period in the war, during which Henry married the French king's daughter and his son was made heir to the throne of France. However, his battlefield successes were not capitalised on by his heir, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].

[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] led his troops into battle and participated in hand-to-hand fighting. The French king of the time, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], did not command the French army himself as he suffered from severe, repeating illnesses and moderate mental incapacitation. Instead, the French were commanded by [[constable of France|Constable]] [[Charles d'Albret]] and various prominent French noblemen of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac party]].

The battle is notable for the use of the [[English longbow]], which Henry used in very large numbers, with [[English People|English]] and [[Welsh People|Welsh]] archers forming most of his army. The battle is also the centrepiece of the play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', by [[William Shakespeare]].

==Campaign==
{{Main|Hundred Years War}}
[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on [[Aquitaine]] and other French lands (the terms of the [[Treaty of Bretigny]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He initially called a great council in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the following negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of [[John II of France|John II]] (who had been captured at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of Normandy, Touraine, Anjou, Brittany and Flanders, as well as Aquitaine. Henry would marry Princess Catherine, the young daughter of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. The French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Princess Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415 negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1414, the English [[Parliament of England|parliament]] was persuaded to grant Henry a &quot;double subsidy&quot;, a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French. On 19 April 1415, Henry again asked the great council to sanction war with France, and this time they agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) pp. 107, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415 and besieged the port of [[Harfleur]] with an army of about 12,000. The [[siege of Harfleur|siege]] took longer than expected. The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease. Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in  the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through [[Normandy]] to the port of [[Calais]], the English [[stronghold]] in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert (1971) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He also intended the manoeuvre as a deliberate provocation to battle aimed at [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|the dauphin]], who had failed to respond to Henry's personal challenge to combat at Harfleur.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

The French had raised an army during the siege which assembled around [[Rouen]]. This was not strictly a [[feudal]] army, but an army paid through a system similar to the English. The French hoped to raise 9,000 troops, but the army was not ready in time to relieve Harfleur. After Henry V marched to the north the French moved to blockade them along the River Somme. They were successful for a time, forcing Henry to move south, away from Calais, to find a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]. The English finally crossed the Somme south of Péronne, at Béthencourt and Voyennes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wylie |first=James Hamilton |authorlink= |coauthors=Waugh, William Templeton |title=The Reign of Henry the Fifth |year=1914 |publisher=The University Press |location=Cambridge |oclc=313049420 |page= 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seward |first=Desmond |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Hundred Years War: The English in France 1337–1453 |year=1999 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=9780140283617 |page= 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resumed marching north. Without the river protection, the French were hesitant to force a battle. They shadowed Henry's army while calling a ''semonce des nobles'', calling on local nobles to join the army. By 24 October both armies faced each other for battle, but the French declined, hoping for the arrival of more troops. The two armies spent the night of 24 October on open ground. The next day the French initiated negotiations as a delaying tactic, but Henry ordered his army to advance and to start a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid, or if he had to fight it, he wanted to fight it defensively; that was how [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] and the other famous longbow victories had been won. The English had very little food, had marched 260 miles in two-and-a-half weeks, were suffering from sickness such as [[dysentery]], and faced much larger numbers of well equipped French men at arms. The French army blocked Henry's way to the safety of Calais however, and delaying battle would only further weaken his tired army and allow more French troops to arrive. &lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2009, pp.436-437 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
===Preparation for battle===
The battle was fought in the narrow strip of open land formed between the woods of [[Tramecourt]] and [[Azincourt|Agincourt]] (close to the modern village of Azincourt). The French army was positioned at the northern exit so as to bar the way to [[Calais]].

[[Image:Map Agincort.svg|thumb|right|400px|The battle of Agincourt]]

====English deployment====
Early on the 25th, Henry deployed his army (approximately 1,500 [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 7,000 longbowmen) across a 750-yard part of the [[defile (geography)|defile]]. The army was organised into three &quot;battles&quot; or divisions, the vanguard led by the [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Duke of York]], the main battle led by Henry himself and the rearguard, led by [[Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys|Lord Camoys]]. In addition, [[Thomas Erpingham|Sir Thomas Erpingham]], one of Henry's most experienced household knights, had a role in marshalling the archers.&lt;ref&gt;Barker 2005, p.271,290&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the English adopted their usual battle line of longbowmen on either flank, men-at-arms and knights in the centre. They may also have deployed some archers in the centre of the line. The English men-at-arms in plate and mail were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English and Welsh archers on the flanks drove pointed wooden [[Archer's stake|stakes]] into the ground at an angle to force [[cavalry]] to veer off. This use of stakes may have been inspired by the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] of 1396, where forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] used the tactic against French cavalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;HughesCurry1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew Bennett (historian)|editor=Curry, Anne; Hughes, Michael L|title=Arms, armies, and fortifications in the Hundred Years War|year=1994|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=0851153658|chapter=The Development of Battle Tactics in the Hundred Years War|pages=7; 15–16|quote=The battle of Nicopolis was crucial … The importance of this battle relates to the role of the stakes. This is the first reference, as far as I am aware, to such a defence … [At Agincourt] it seems likely that Henry had heard of the success of this device at Nicopolis two decades earlier … How did Henry learn the trick? Doubtless it circulated orally, but it was also ‘published’ (in the medieval sense of the word) in [a] book ... in 1411, just four years before Agincourt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English made their confessions before the battle, as was customary.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, 2006, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Henry, worried about the enemy launching surprise raids, and wanting his troops to remain focused, ordered all his men to spend the night before the battle in silence, with having an ear cut off the punishment for disobeying. He told his men that he would rather die in the coming battle than be captured and ransomed. &lt;ref&gt;Barker, 2005, pp.267-268&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the morning of the battle, Henry made a speech, emphasising the justness of his cause, and reminding his army of previous great defeats the kings of England had inflicted on the French. The Burgundian sources have him concluding the speech by telling his men that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so that he could never draw a longbow again. (Whether this was true is open to question; death was the normal fate of any soldier who couldn't be ransomed.) &lt;ref&gt;Barker, 2005, pp. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

====French deployment====
By contrast, the French were confident that they would prevail and were eager to fight. The French believed they would triumph over the English not only because their force was larger, fresher, and better equipped, but also because the large number of noble men-at-arms would have considered themselves superior to the large number of archers in the English army, who the French (based on their experience in living memory of using and facing archers) considered relatively insignificant. The chronicler Edmond de Dyntner stated that there were &quot;ten French nobles against one English&quot;, ignoring the archers completely.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer(2009) p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;

The French were arrayed in three lines or &quot;battles&quot;. The first line was led by Constable D'Albret, [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jean Le Maingre|Boucicault]], and the [[Charles, Duke of Orléans|Dukes of Orléans]] and [[John I, Duke of Bourbon|Bourbon]], with attached cavalry wings under the [[Louis, Count of Vendôme|Count of Vendôme]] and Sir Clignet de Brebant. The second line was commanded by the [[Edward III of Bar|Dukes of Bar]] and [[John I, Duke of Alençon|Alençon]] and the [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Count of Nevers]]. The third line was under the Counts of Dammartin and Fauconberg.&lt;ref&gt;Barker 2005, pp. 276–8&lt;/ref&gt; The Burgundian chronicler, [[Jehan de Waurin]], writes that there were 8,000 men-at-arms, 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the vanguard, with two wings of 600 and 800 mounted men-at-arms, and the main battle having &quot;as many knights, esquires and archers as in the vanguard&quot;, with the rearguard containing &quot;all of the rest of the men-at-arms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/SOURCES/agincourt.htm ''Battle of Agincourt 1415'', de Waurin]&lt;/ref&gt; The Herald of Berry uses somewhat different figures of 4,800 men-at-arms in the first line, 3,000 men in the second line, with two &quot;wings&quot; containing 600 mounted men-at-arms each, and a total of &quot;10,000 men-at-arms&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Curry (2000), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; but does not mention a third line.

Approximately 8,000 of the heavily armoured French men-at-arms fought on foot, and needed to close the distance to the English army to engage them in hand-to-hand fighting. If they could close the distance, however, they outnumbered the English men-at-arms by more than 5-to-1, and the English longbowmen would not be able to shoot into a mêlée without risking hitting their own troops. Many of the French men-at-arms had fathers and grandfathers who had been humiliated in previous battles such as [[Battle of Crecy|Crécy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]], and the French nobility were determined to get revenge. Several French accounts emphasise that the French leaders were so eager to defeat the English (and win the ransoms of the English men-at-arms) that they insisted on being in the first line. For example: &quot;All the lords wanted to be in the vanguard, against the opinion of the constable and the experienced knights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Clifford J.|title=The Hundred Years War|editor=Villalon, L. J. Andrew;  Kagay, Donald J
|publisher=Brill|location=Boston, MA|year=2008|volume=2|pages=107|chapter=The Battle of Agincourt|isbn=9789004168213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There appear to have been thousands of troops in the rearguard, containing servants and commoners whom the French were either unable or unwilling to deploy. De Waurin gives the total French army size as 50,000. He says: &quot;They had plenty of archers and crossbowmen but nobody wanted to let them fire [sic]. The reason for this was that the site was so narrow that there was only enough room for the men-at-arms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Curry (2000), p.159&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the rearguard played little part in the battle, with English and French accounts agreeing that many of the French army fled after seeing so many French nobles killed and captured in the fighting.

===Terrain===
The field of battle was arguably the most significant factor in deciding the outcome. The recently ploughed land hemmed in by dense woodland favoured the English, both because of its narrowness, and because of the thick mud through which the French knights had to walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wason |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Battlefield Detectives |year=2004 |publisher=Carlton Books |location=London |isbn=0233050833 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Holmes (military historian)  |coauthors= |title=War Walks |year=1996 |publisher=BBC Worldwide Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-563-38360-7 |page= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by ''[[Battlefield Detectives]]'' has looked at the crowd dynamics of the battlefield.&lt;ref name=BFD&gt;{{cite web | title=Battlefield Detectives - Agincourt |work=Crowd Dynamics Ltd Battlefield Detectives - Agincourt | url=http://www.crowddynamics.com/Battlefield%20Detectives/Agincourt.htm | accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050405065203/http://www.crowddynamics.com/Battlefield+Detectives/Agincourt.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1,000–1,500 English men-at-arms are described as shoulder to shoulder and four deep, which implies a tight line about 250–300 men long (perhaps split in two by a central group of archers). The remainder of the field would have been filled with the longbowmen behind their palings. The French first line contained men-at-arms who had no way to outflank the English line. The French, divided into the three ''battles'', one behind the other at their initial starting position, could not bring all their forces to bear: the initial engagement was between the English army and the first battle line of the French. When the second French battle line started their advance, the soldiers were pushed closer together and their effectiveness was reduced. Casualties in the front line from longbow arrows would also have increased the congestion, as the following men would have to walk around the fallen. The ''Battlefield Detectives'' episode states that when the density reached four men per square metre, soldiers would not even be able to take full steps forward, lowering the speed of the advance by 70%.&lt;ref name=BFD/&gt; Accounts of the battle describe the French engaging the English men-at-arms before being rushed from the sides by the longbowmen as the [[mêlée]] developed. The English account in the ''Gesta Henrici'' says: &quot;For when some of them, killed when battle was first joined, fall at the front, so great was the undisciplined violence and pressure of the mass of men behind them that the living fell on top of the dead, and others falling on top of the living were killed as well&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, 2000, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Although the French initially pushed the English back, they became so closely packed that they are described as having trouble using their weapons properly. The French monk of St. Denis says: &quot;Their vanguard, composed of about 5,000 men, found itself at first so tightly packed that those who were in the third rank could scarcely use their swords&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Quoted in Curry, 2000, p. 107&quot;&gt;Quoted in Curry, 2000, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Burgundian sources have a similar passage. In practice there was not enough room for all these men to fight, and they were unable to respond effectively when the English longbowmen joined the hand-to-hand fighting. By the time the second French line arrived, for a total of about eight thousand men (depending on the source), the crush would have been even worse. The press of men arriving from behind actually hindered those fighting at the front.

As the battle was fought on a recently ploughed field, and there had recently been heavy rain leaving it very muddy, it proved very tiring to walk through in full plate armour. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as &quot;marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy&quot;. The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the mêlée. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), p.300&lt;/ref&gt; Their limited mobility made them easy targets for the volleys from the English archers. The mud also increased the ability of the much more lightly armoured English archers to join in hand-to-hand fighting against the French men-at-arms.

===Fighting===
====Opening moves====

On the morning of 25 October the French were still waiting for additional troops to arrive. The [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (about 2,000 men),&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2009, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Louis II of Naples|Duke of Anjou]] (about 600 men),&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2009, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] (6,000 men, according to Montstrelet),&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2009, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; were all marching to join the army. This left the French with a question of whether or not to advance towards the English.

For three hours after sunrise there was no fighting. Military textbooks of the time stated &quot;Everywhere and on all occasions that foot soldiers march against their enemy face to face, those who march lose and those who remain standing still and holding firm win&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; On top of this, the French were expecting thousands of men to join them if they waited. They were blocking Henry's retreat, and were perfectly happy to wait for as long as it took. There had even been a suggestion that the English would run away rather than give battle when they saw that they would be fighting so many French princes.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's men, on the other hand, were already very weary from hunger, illness and marching. Even though he knew as well as the French did that his army would perform better on the defensive, Henry was eventually forced to take a calculated risk, and move his army further forward to start the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2009) pp.436-437&lt;/ref&gt; This entailed pulling out the long stakes pointed outwards toward the enemy which protected the longbowmen, and abandoning his chosen position. (The use of stakes was an innovation for the English: during the [[Battle of Crécy]], for example, the archers were instead protected by pits and other obstacles.)&lt;ref name=&quot;HughesCurry1994&quot; /&gt; If the French cavalry had charged before the stakes had been hammered back in, the result would probably have been disastrous for the English, as it was at the [[Battle of Patay]]. However, the French seem to have been caught off guard by the English advance. The tightness of the terrain also seems to have restricted the planned deployment of their forces.

A battle plan had originally been drawn up which had archers and crossbowmen in front of the men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to &quot;fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the event, the archers and crossbowmen were deployed ''behind'' and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle). The cavalry force, which could have devastated the English line if it had attacked while they moved their position, seems to have charged only ''after'' the initial volley of arrows from the English. It is unclear whether this is because the French were hoping the English would launch a frontal assault (and were surprised when the English instead started shooting from their new defensive position), or whether the French mounted knights simply did not react fast enough to the English advance. French chroniclers agree that when the mounted charge did come, it did not contain as many men as it should have; Gilles le Bouvier states that some had wandered off to warm themselves and others were walking or feeding their horses.&lt;ref&gt;Barker,  (2005) p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, within extreme bowshot from the French line (approximately 300 yards), the longbowmen dug in their stakes and then opened the engagement with a barrage of arrows.

====The French cavalry attack====
The French cavalry, despite being somewhat disorganised and not at full numbers, charged the longbowmen, but it was a disaster, with the French knights unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the palings that protected the archers. [[John Keegan]] argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle was at this point: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation shots used as the charge started.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan (1976), pp.92-6&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the mounted charge and then retreat was further to churn up the mud the French had to cross to reach the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk of [[Saint Denis Basilica|St. Denis]] who reports how the panicking horses also galloped back through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), p.293&lt;/ref&gt; The Burgundian sources similarly say that the mounted men-at-arms retreated back into the advancing French vanguard.

====The main French assault====
The constable himself led the attack of the dismounted French men-at-arms. French accounts describe their vanguard alone as containing about 5,000 men-at-arms, which would have outnumbered the English men-at-arms by more than 3 to 1, but before they could engage in hand-to-hand fighting they had to cross the muddy field under a bombardment of arrows.

The plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 300 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as &quot;a terrifying hail of arrow shot&quot;. However they had to lower their visors and bend their heads to avoid being shot in the face (the eye and airholes in their helmets were among the weakest points in the armour), which restricted both their breathing and their vision, and then they had to walk a few hundred yards through thick mud, wearing armour weighing 50–60 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) pp. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|left|250px|King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415, by Sir [[John Gilbert (painter)|John Gilbert]]]]

The French men-at-arms reached the English line and actually pushed it back, with the longbowmen continuing to shoot until they ran out of arrows and then dropping their bows and joining the mêlée, implying that the French were able to walk through a hail of tens of thousands of arrows while taking comparatively few casualties. (Mortimer suggests &quot;about a thousand arrows every second&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2009, p.440&lt;/ref&gt;. Henry brought in the region of 130,000 sheaves (i.e. about three million arrows) with him from England at the start of the campaign.)&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2009, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; However the physical pounding from thousands of non-penetrating arrows, combined with the slog in heavy armour through the mud, the heat and lack of oxygen in plate armour with the visor down, and the crush of their numbers meant they could &quot;scarcely lift their weapons&quot; when they finally engaged the English line.&lt;ref&gt;Curry (2000) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;
When the English archers, using [[hatchet]]s, [[sword]]s and other weapons, attacked the now disordered and fatigued French, the French could not cope with their unarmoured assailants (who were much less hindered by the mud). The exhausted French men-at-arms are described as having been knocked to the ground and then unable to get back up. As the [[Melee|mêlée]] developed, the French second line also joined the attack, but they too were swallowed up, with the narrow terrain meaning the extra numbers could not be used effectively, and French men-at-arms were taken prisoner or killed in their thousands. The fighting lasted about three hours, but eventually the leaders of the second line were killed or captured, as those of the first line had been. The English ''Gesta Henrici'' describes three great heaps of the slain around the three main English standards.&lt;ref&gt;Curry (2000) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
According to contemporary English accounts, Henry was directly involved in the hand-to-hand fighting. Upon hearing that his youngest brother [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] had been wounded in the groin, Henry took his household guard and stood over his brother, in the front rank of the fighting, until Humphrey could be dragged to safety; the king received an axe blow to the head which knocked off a piece of the crown that formed part of his helmet.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2009) p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

====The attack on the English baggage train====
The only French success was an attack on the lightly protected English baggage train, with Ysembart d'Azincourt (leading a small number of men-at-arms and varlets plus about 600 peasants) seizing some of Henry's personal treasures, including a crown.&lt;ref&gt;Curry (2005), pp. 207–9&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this was part of a deliberate French plan or an act of local brigandage is unclear from the sources.  Certainly, d'Azincourt was a local knight but he may have been chosen to lead the attack because of his local knowledge and the lack of availability of a more senior soldier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 2005, p.308&quot;&gt;Barker (2005), p.308&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts the attack happened towards the end of the battle, and led the English to think they were being attacked from the rear. Barker, following the ''Gesta Henrici'', believed to have been written by an English chaplain who was actually in the baggage train, concludes that the attack happened at the ''start'' of the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 2005, p.308&quot;/&gt;

====Henry orders the killing of the prisoners====
Regardless of when the baggage assault happened, there was a point after the initial English victory where Henry became alarmed that the French were regrouping for another attack. The ''Gesta Henrici'' puts this after the English had overcome the onslaught of the French men-at-arms, and the weary English troops were eyeing the French rearguard (&quot;in incomparable number and still fresh&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Curry (2000) p.37&lt;/ref&gt;). Le Fevre and Waurin similarly say that it was signs of the French rearguard regrouping and &quot;marching forward in battle order&quot; which made the English think they were still in danger.&lt;ref&gt;Curry (2000) p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, Henry ordered the slaughter of what was perhaps several thousand French prisoners, with only the most illustrious being spared. His fear was that they would rearm themselves with the weapons strewn upon the field, and the exhausted English would be overwhelmed. Though ruthless, it was arguably justifiable given the situation of the battle; perhaps surprisingly, even the French chroniclers do not criticise him for this.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) pp. 302–305.&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of the battle, as the French rearguard, having seen so many of the French nobility captured and killed, fled the battlefield.

===Aftermath===
Due to a lack of reliable sources it is impossible to give a precise figure for the French and English casualties. However, it is clear that though the English were outnumbered, their losses were far lower than those of the French. The French sources all give 4,000–10,000 French dead, with up to 1,600 English dead. The lowest ratio in these French sources has the French losing six times more men than the English. The English sources vary between about 1,500 and 11,000 for the French dead, with English dead put at no more than 100.&lt;ref&gt;All figures on number of dead from table in Curry, 2000, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker identifies from the available records &quot;at least&quot; 112 Englishmen who died in the fighting (including [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York]], a grandson of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 2005, p.320&lt;/ref&gt; but this excludes the wounded. One widely used estimate puts the English casualties at 450, not an insignificant number in an army of about 8,500, but far less than the thousands the French lost, nearly all of whom were killed or captured. Using the lowest French estimate of their own dead of 4,000 would imply a ratio of nearly 9 to 1 in favour of the English, or over 10 to 1 if the prisoners are included.

The French suffered heavily. Three dukes, at least eight counts, a viscount and an archbishop died, along with numerous other nobles. Of the great royal office holders, France lost her Constable, Admiral, Master of the Crossbowmen and ''prévôt'' of the marshals.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), pp.''x'',321,323&lt;/ref&gt; The ''baillis'' of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle &quot;cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in Artois, Ponthieu, Normandy, Picardy.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), pp. 322–3&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the number of prisoners vary between 700 and 2,200, amongst them the [[Charles, duc d'Orléans|Duke of Orléans]] (the famous poet Charles d'Orléans) and [[Jean Le Maingre]] (known as Boucicault) [[Marshal of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005) pp. 337, 367, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all these prisoners would have been nobles, as the less valuable prisoners were slaughtered.

Although the victory had been militarily decisive, its impact was complex.  It did not lead to further English conquests immediately as Henry's priority was to return to England, which he did on 16 November, to be received in triumph in London on the 23rd.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2009) pp. 475, 479&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry returned a conquering hero, in the eyes of his subjects and European powers outside of France, blessed by God.  It established the legitimacy of the Lancastrian monarchy and the future campaigns of Henry to pursue his &quot;rights and privileges&quot; in France.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2009), pp.547–8&lt;/ref&gt; Other benefits to the English were longer term.  Very quickly after the battle, the fragile truce between the Armagnac and Burgundian factions broke down. The brunt of the battle had fallen on the Armagnacs and it was they who suffered the majority of senior casualties and carried the blame for the defeat.  The Burgundians seized on the opportunity and within 10 days of the battle had mustered their armies and marched on Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), p.354&lt;/ref&gt;  This lack of unity in France would allow Henry eighteen months to prepare militarily and politically for a renewed campaign.  When that campaign took place, it was made easier by the damage done to the political and military structures of Normandy by the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), p.381&lt;/ref&gt;

It took several years' more campaigning, but Henry was eventually able to fulfil all his objectives. He was recognised by the French in the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) as the regent and heir to the French throne. This was cemented by his marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]], the daughter of King Charles VI.

==Numbers at Agincourt==
[[Anne Curry]] in her 2005 book ''Agincourt: A New History'', argues (based on research into the surviving administrative records) that the French army was about 12,000 strong, and the English army about 9,000, giving odds of 4–3. By contrast, [[Juliet Barker]] in her ''Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle'' (also published in 2005) argues the English and Welsh were outnumbered &quot;at least four to one and possibly as much as six to one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 2005 p.x&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests figures of about 6,000 for the English and 36,000 for the French, based on the ''Gesta Henrici''{{'}}s figures of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms for the English, and [[Jehan de Waurin]]'s statement &quot;that the French were six times more numerous than the English&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 2005 p.274 &lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' uses the figures of about 6,000 for the English and 20,000 to 30,000 for the French. The 1911 ''Britannica'' used somewhat different figures of 6,000 archers, 1,000 men-at-arms and &quot;a few thousands of other foot&quot; for the English, with the French outnumbering them by &quot;at least four times&quot;.

Having both one of the lowest estimates for the size of the French army and also one of the highest estimates for the size of the English army, Curry is currently in a minority in suggesting that the odds were as equal as 4–3. While not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, some historians have however given support to her assertion that the French army was much smaller than traditionally thought, and the English somewhat bigger. Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, has said that he thinks the French probably had 12,000–15,000 troops.&lt;ref name=Glanz&gt;{{cite news |title=Historians Reassess Battle of Agincourt |first=James |last=Glanz |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 24, 2009 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/world/europe/25agincourt.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Mortimer, in his 2009 book ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', notes how Curry &quot;minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)&quot;, but agrees that previous estimates have exaggerated the odds, and suggests that &quot;the most extreme imbalance which is credible is fifteen thousand French troops against 8,100 English: a ratio of about two-to-one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=1415: Henry V's Year of Glory |last= Mortimer |first= Ian|year= 2009 |publisher=Bodley Head |location= London|isbn=9780224079921 |page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Clifford J. Rogers, professor of history at the United States Military Academy at West Point, has recently argued that archival records are too incomplete to substantially change his view that the English were outnumbered about 4–1.&lt;ref name=Glanz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Clifford J. ''The Battle of Agincourt :Appendix II'' in The Hundred Years War (Part II): Different Vistas, ed. L. J. Andrew Villalon and Donald J. Kagay (Leiden: Brill, 2008): pp.114-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Juliet Barker also disagrees with Curry's arguments in the acknowledgments section of her 2005 book on Agincourt, saying: &quot;Surviving administrative records on both sides, but especially the French, are simply too incomplete to support [Curry's] assertion that nine thousand English were pitted against an army only twelve thousand strong. And if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Barker, 2005, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Those supporting a greater imbalance have generally put more store by contemporary (and especially eyewitness) accounts. The ''Gesta Henrici'' gives plausible figures for the English of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms, but Mortimer notes it is &quot;wildly inaccurate&quot; in stating the English were outnumbered 30–1, and there have also been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. The proportions also seem incorrect, as from surviving records we know that Henry set out with about four times as many archers as men-at-arms, not five and a half times as many. Those who have supported the Gesta figures for the English army have generally thought that although the English army may have left Harfleur with eight or nine thousand men, it is plausible that after weeks of campaigning and disease in hostile territory they would have lost two or three thousand fighting men; however Mortimer states: &quot;Despite the trials of the march, Henry had lost very few men to illness or death; and we have independent testimony that no more than 160 had been captured on the way.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mortimer notes, the Burgundian numbers for the size of the French vanguard of 8,000 men-at-arms in the vanguard with 1,400 (or 2,400) men-at-arms in the wings correspond roughly with the figures of ten thousand men-at-arms recorded by the duke of Berry's herald. The Burgundians also recorded 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the &quot;vanguard&quot;, which would suggest &quot;fourteen or fifteen thousand fighting men&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, 2009, p.565&lt;/ref&gt; (It should be noted that the Burgundians actually give the total size of the French army as an implausible 50,000,&lt;ref&gt; Curry, 2000, p.12 &lt;/ref&gt; and the numbers they use do not correspond closely to the odds they describe. Using very similar numbers, [[Jean Le Fevre]] states that the English were outnumbered 3–1, whereas Waurin states that the English were outnumbered 6–1.&lt;ref&gt; Curry, 2000, p.157 &lt;/ref&gt;)

One particular cause of confusion may have been the number of servants on both sides. Mortimer suggests that because there was a much higher proportion of men-at-arms on the French side, the number of non-combatants was much higher. Each man-at-arms could be expected to have a page, who would have ridden one of his spare horses. If the French army had an extra 10,000 men mounted men (as opposed to only 1,500 extra for the English), then &quot;the English probably did see an army about three times the size of their own fighting force&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', pp.421–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is open to debate whether these should all be counted as non-combatants; Rogers (for example) accepts that the French probably had about 10,000 men-at-arms, but explicitly includes one &quot;gros valet&quot; (an armed, armoured and mounted military servant) per French man-at-arms in his calculation of the odds.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (2008), pp 60-2&lt;/ref&gt; There may therefore be less difference between some of these different historians' positions on the numerical odds than there initially appears, given that the various accounts generally agree that the battle was almost entirely fought between the French men-at-arms and the English army, with French crossbowmen, archers, and other infantry playing little or no part.

==Popular representations==
[[Image:Agincourtcarol.jpg|thumb|The 15th century [[Agincourt Carol]]]]
Soon after the English victory at Agincourt, a number of popular folk songs were created about the battle, the most famous being the ''[[Agincourt Carol]]'', produced in the first half of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Curry (2000), pp.280-283.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ballads followed, including ''[[King Henry Fifth's Conquest of France]]'', raising the popular prominence of particular events mentioned only in passing by the original chroniclers, such as the gift of tennis balls before the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, p.323.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most famous cultural depiction of the battle today, however, is through [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599. The play focuses on the pressures of kingship, the tensions between how a king should appear - chivalric, honest and just - and how a king must sometimes act - Machiavellian and ruthless.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions are illustrated by in the play by Shakespeare's depiction of Henry's decision to kill some of the French prisoners, whilst attempting to justify it and distance himself from the event - this moment of the battle is portrayed both as a break with the traditions of chivalry, and as key example of the paradox of kingship.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, pp.21-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's depiction of the battle also plays on the theme of modernity - Shakespeare contrasts the modern, English king and his army with the medieval, chivalric, older model of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's play presented Henry as leading a truly British force into battle, playing on the importance of the link between the monarch and the common soldiers in the fight.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The original play does not, however, feature any scenes of the actual battle itself, leading critic Rose Zimbardo to characterise it as &quot;full of warfare, yet empty of conflict.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hatchuel, p.193&quot;&gt;Hatchuel, p.193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play introduced the famous &quot;[[Henry V (play)#Synopsis|Saint Crispin's day]]&quot; speech; Shakespeare has Henry give a moving narration to his soldiers just before the battle, urging his &quot;band of brothers&quot; to stand together in the forthcoming fight.&lt;ref&gt;Margolies, p.149.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Shakespeare's most heroic speeches, critic David Margolies, describes how it &quot;oozes honour, military glory, love of country and self-sacrifice&quot;, and it forms one of the first instances of English literature linking solidarity and comradeship to success in battle.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Margolies, p.149; Adam, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a result, the battle was used as a metaphor at the beginning of the [[First World War]], when the [[British Expeditionary Force]]'s attempts to stop the German advances were widely likened to it.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's version of the battle of Agincourt has been turned into three films - by [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944]], by [[Kenneth Branagh]] in [[Henry V (1989 film)|1989]], and by Peter Babakitis in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hatchuel, p.193&quot;/&gt; Made just prior to the invasion of Normandy, Olivier's gives the battle what Sarah Hatchuel has termed an &quot;exhilarating and heroic&quot; tone, with an artificial, cinematic look to the battle scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, pp.194-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Branagh's version gives a longer, more [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] portrayal of the battle itself, drawing on both historical sources and images from the Vietnam and Falkland Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, p.195.&lt;/ref&gt; Babakitis uses digital effects to exaggerate realist features during his battle scenes, producing a more [[Experimental film|avant-garde]] interpretation of the fighting at Agincourt.&lt;ref&gt;Hatchuel, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The battle remains an important symbol in popular culture. For example, a mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the slaughter of the prisoners was held in Washington, D.C. in March 2010, drawing from both the historical record and Shakespeare's play. Participating as judges were Justices [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsberg]]. The trial ranged widely over the whether there was just cause for war and not simply the prisoner issue.  Although an audience vote was &quot;too close to call&quot;, Henry was unanimously found guilty by the court on the basis of “evolving standards of civil society”.&lt;ref name=&quot;mock-trial-cspan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/221111 | title=Judgment at Agincourt | date=2010-03-16 | publisher=[[CSPAN]] }} link to video&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mock-trial-cd&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2010/03/18/high-court-rules-for-french-at-agincourt/ | title=High Court Rules for French at Agincourt | publisher=DC Theater Scene | first=Tim | last=Treanor | date=2010-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mock-trial-lawj&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446381186 | title=High Court Justices, Legal Luminaries Debate Shakespeare's 'Henry V' | last=Jones | first=Andy | publisher=[[National Law Journal]] | date=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Footnotes ===
*'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}}Pronunciation: The story of the battle has been retold many times in English, from the fifteenth-century [[Agincourt Carol|Agincourt song]] onwards, and an English pronunciation of {{IPA-en|ˈædʒɨn.kɔrt|&lt;!--not a velar N--&gt;}} has become established. [[Merriam-Webster]] has a small audio file [http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?ggazin02.wav=Agincourt here]. The modern tendency, however, is to use pronunciations closer to the original French {{IPA-fr|aʒɛ̃kuʁ}}, such as {{IPA|/ˈædʒɨnkɔr/}} or {{IPA|/ˈæʒɨnkʊər/}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olausson |first=Lena |coauthors=Sangster, Catherine |others= |title=Oxford BBC Guide to Pronunciation: The Essential Handbook of the Spoken Word|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|year=2006|page=7|quote='''aj'''-in-kor/ˈadʒɪnˌkɔː(r)/ the established anglicization|isbn=978-0-19-280710-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Daniel|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|editors=Roach, Peter ''et al''|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England|year=2003|edition=16|page=12|isbn=9780521017121}}&lt;/ref&gt; as exampled in this interview with [[Juliet Barker]] on ''Meet the Author'', [http://www.meettheauthor.co.uk/bookbites/915.html here].

{{Bronze Age|210}}

The '''Bronze Age''' is a transitional [[Periodization|period]] between the [[Stone Age]] and [[Iron Age]], characterized by the creation of [[bronze]] from raw materials, the widespread use of bronze tools and weapons, and the continued development of [[pictogram]]ic or [[ideogram]]ic symbols and [[proto-writing]]. In [[archeology]], the ''Bronze Age'' is the 2nd principal period of the [[three-age system]] created by [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]]&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Thomsen and [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae]] first applied the system to artifacts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ellis, Archaeological method and theory: an encyclopedia.

S.l.: s.n..&lt;/ref&gt; This could either be based on the local smelting of [[copper]] and [[tin]] from [[ore]]s, or trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;The naturally occurring ores typically had [[arsenic]] as a common impurity.&lt;/ref&gt; Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in [[western Asia]] before the [[third millennium BCE]]. Many, though not all, Bronze Age cultures flourished in [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, M. C. (1925). Prehistory: A study of early cultures in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Cambridge [Eng.: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures developed extensive written records during their Bronze Ages.

A difference between some of the Bronze Age cultures was the [[history of writing|development of the first writings]]. In Egypt ([[hieroglyphs]]), the Near East ([[Cuneiform]]), but also in the Mediterranean, with the Mycenaean culture ([[Linear B]]), had viable systems of written communication. The archaeological findings are evidence of the first written sources.

The end of any particular age is to some extent a convenience for classification purposes, and is also considered to have varied geographically. Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the [[Neolithic|Neolithic age]] (New Stone Age), but in some parts of the world, a [[Copper Age]] followed the Neolithic Age and preceded the Bronze Age. Although the [[Iron Age]] generally followed the Bronze age, in some areas such as in many parts of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Neolithic|Neolithic age]] was directly followed by the Iron Age, and there was no Bronze Age, as the technology seems to have jumped from stone to iron there.

==History==
{{Human history}}

The term &quot;Bronze Age&quot; is ultimately derived from the &quot;[[Ages of Man]]&quot;, the stages of human existence on the Earth according to [[Greek mythology]]. Of these, the [[Golden Age]] and [[Silver Age]] are categorized by modern historians as mythical, but the Bronze Age as well as the [[Iron Age]] are conceived as having a nucleus of historical validity. The overall period is characterized by the full adoption of bronze in many regions, though the place and time of the introduction and development of bronze technology is not universally synchronous.&lt;ref&gt;Bronze was independently discovered in the [[Maykop culture]] of the [[North Caucasus]] as early as the mid-[[4th millennium BCE]], which would make them the makers of the oldest known bronze. However, the Maykop culture only had [[arsenical bronze]], a naturally occurring alloy. Other regions would utilize bronze and the associated technology at different periods.&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made tin bronze technology requires set production techniques. Tin must be mined (mainly as the tin ore [[cassiterite]]) and smelted separately, then added to molten copper to make the bronze alloy. The Bronze Age was a time of heavy use of metals and of developing trade networks (See ''[[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]'').

{{Main|Ancient Near East}}

The Bronze Age in the [[Ancient Near East]] began with the rise of [[Sumer]] in the 4th millennium BC. The Ancient Near East is considered the [[cradle of civilization]] and practised intensive year-round agriculture, developed a writing system, invented the potter's wheel, created a centralized government, law codes and empires, and introduced social stratification, slavery and organized warfare. Societies in the region laid the foundations for astronomy and mathematics.

====Mesopotamia====
:''Main article: [[History of Mesopotamia|Ancient Mesopotamia]]''
In [[Mesopotamia]], the [[History of Mesopotamia#Bronze Age|Mesopotamia Bronze Age]] begins in about 2900 BCE and ends with the [[Kassites|Kassite]] period. The usual tripartite division into an Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age is not used. Instead, a division primarily based on art-historical and historical characteristics is more common. The [[cities of the Ancient Near East]] housed several tens of thousands of people. [[Ur]] in the Middle Bronze Age and [[Babylon]] in the Late Bronze Age similarly had large populations.

The earliest mention of [[Babylonia]] can be found in a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], dating back to the 23rd century BC. The [[Amorite|Amorite dynasty]] established the city-state of Babylon in the 19th century BC; over 100 years later it briefly took over the others and formed the first [[Babylonian empire]], during what is also called the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian Period]]. Babylonia adopted the written Semitic Akkadian language for official use. The Sumerian language was by that time was no longer a spoken language, but it was still in religious use. The [[Akkadian]] and [[Sumerian]] traditions played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under outside rule, throughout the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age.

[[Elam]] was an ancient civilization located to the east of Mesopotamia. In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau, centered in Anshan, and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands. Its culture played a crucial role in the Gutian Empire, especially during the Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded it.

The [[Oxus civilization]]&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, O. M., Franks, A. W., &amp; Read, C. H. (1905). [http://books.google.com/books?id=p14VAAAAYAAJ The treasure of the Oxus]: With other objects from ancient Persia and India. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Bronze Age Central Asian culture dated to ca. 2300–1700 BC and centered on the upper Amu Darya (Oxus). In the Early Bronze Age the culture of the Kopet Dag oases and Altyn-Depe developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to level IV at Namazga-Depe. Altyn-Depe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown. The height of this urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age c. 2300 BC, corresponding to level V at Namazga-Depe.&lt;ref&gt;V.M.

Dani and Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson (eds.), History of civilizations of Central Asia, volume 1: The dawn of civilization: earliest times to 700 BC (1&lt;/ref&gt; It is this Bronze Age culture which has been given the [[BMAC]] name.

The [[Kulli culture]],&lt;ref&gt;Possehl, G. L. (1986). Kulli: An exploration of ancient civilization in Asia. Durham, N.C: Carolina Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, S. (1961). Prehistoric India to 1000 B.C. Baltimore: Penguin Book.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilization, was located in southern Balochistan (Gedrosia) ca. 2500 - 2000 BCE. Agriculture was the economical base of this people. At several places dams were found, providing evidence for a highly developed water management system.

[[Konar Sandal]] is associated with the hypothesized &quot;[[Jiroft culture]]&quot;, a 3rd millennium BC culture postulated on the basis of a collection of artifacts confiscated in 2001.

====Anatolia====
{{Main|Bronze Age Anatolia}}
The [[Hittite Empire]] was established in Hattusa in northern Anatolia from the 18th century BC. In the 14th century BC, the Hittite Kingdom was at its height, encompassing central Anatolia, south-western Syria as far as Ugarit, and upper Mesopotamia. After 1180 BC, amid general turmoil in the Levant associated with the sudden arrival of the Sea Peoples, the kingdom disintegrated into several independent &quot;Neo-Hittite&quot; city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BC. 

[[Arzawa]] in Western Anatolia during the second half of the second millennium BC likely extended along southern Anatolia in a belt reaching from near the Turkish Lakes Region all the way to the Aegean coast. Arzawa was the western neighbor, sometimes a rival and sometimes a vassal of the [[Hittite Kingdom|Middle and New Hittite Kingdoms]]. 

The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the Hittites under an earlier Tudhaliya I around 1400 BC. Arzawa has been associated with the much more obscure [[Assuwa]] generally located to its north - it probably bordered it, and may even be an alternative term for it (at least during some periods).

[[Ebla]] experienced an apogee lasting from ca. 1850 to 1600 BC. The first known ruler of Ebla in this period was Megum, an Ensi (governor) for [[Ur III]] during the reign of [[Amar-Sin]] of Ur. [[Ibbit-Lim]] was the first attested king. Ebla is mentioned in texts from [[Alalakh]] from ca. 1750 BC. The city was destroyed again in the turbulent period of 1650–1600 BC, by a Hittite king ([[Mursili I]] or [[Hattusili I]]). This is attested to only by the fragmentary Hurro-Hittite [[Song of Release]]. 

[[Amorites|Amorite kingdoms]], ca. 2000–1600 BC, arose in [[Mari]], [[Yamkhad]], [[Qatna]], [[Assyria]],&lt;ref&gt;under [[Shamshi-Adad I]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], and also Babylon. This era ended in northern Mesopotamia with the expulsion of the Amorite dominated Babylonians from Assyria by [[Adasi (Assyria)|King Adasi]] circa 1720 BC, and in the south with the Hittite sack of Babylon (c. 1595 BC) which brought new ethnic groups — particularly [[Kassites]] — to the forefront in southern Mesopotamia. From the 15th century BC onward, the term [[Amurru]] is usually applied to the region extending north of Canaan as far as [[Kadesh]] on the [[Orontes]].

The [[Mitanni]] was a loosely organized state in northern Syria and south-east Anatolia from ca. 1500 BC–1300 BC. Founded by an Indo-Aryan ruling class governing a predominately Hurrian population, Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of Kassite Babylon created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia. At the beginning of its history, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the Thutmosids. However, with the ascent of the Hittite empire, Mitanni and Egypt made an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, it had outposts centered around its capital, Washukanni, whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the headwaters of the Khabur River. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks, and was reduced to the status of a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire.

The earliest [[Ugarit]] contact with Egypt (and the first exact dating of Ugaritic civilization) comes from a carnelian bead identified with the Middle Kingdom pharaoh Senusret I, 1971 BC–1926 BC. A stela and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been found. However, it is unclear at what time these monuments got to Ugarit. Amarna letters from Ugarit ca. 1350 BC records one letter each from Ammittamru I, Niqmaddu II, and his queen. From the 16th to the 13th century BC Ugarit remained in constant touch with Egypt and Cyprus (named Alashiya).

The [[Aramaeans]] are a Northwest Semitic semi-nomadic and pastoralist people who originated in what is now modern Syria (Biblical Aram) during the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Large groups migrated to Mesopotamia where they intermingled with the native Akkadian (Assyrian and Babylonian) population. The Aramaeans never had a unified empire; they were divided into independent kingdoms all across the Near East. After the Bronze Age collapse, their political influence was confined to a number of Syro-Hittite states, which were entirely absorbed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire by the 8th century BC.

====Ancient Egypt====
{{main|Ancient Egypt }}
===== Early Bronze dynasties=====
In [[Ancient Egypt]], the Bronze Age begins in the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|Protodynastic period]], c. 3150 BCE. The archaic ''early Bronze Age of Egypt'', known as the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;KSnPG&quot;&gt;Karin Sowada and Peter Grave. Egypt in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Old Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lukas de Blois and R. J. van der Spek. An Introduction to the Ancient World. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; immediately follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt, c. 3100 BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from [[Abydos]] to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in the Early Bronze Age was the largest city of the time. 

The [[Old Kingdom]] of the regional Bronze Age&lt;ref name=&quot;KSnPG&quot; /&gt; is the name given to the period in the 3rd millennium BCE when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization in complexity and achievement – the first of three so-called &quot;Kingdom&quot; periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the [[Geography of Egypt#Nile_Valley and Delta|lower Nile Valley]] (the others being [[Middle Kingdom]] and the [[New Kingdom]]).

The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. (2000). A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: An investigation conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre. Copenhagen: Det Kongelike Danske Videnskabernes Selskab. Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; often described as a &quot;dark period&quot; in ancient Egyptian history, spanned about 100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC. Very little monumental evidence survives from this period, especially from the early part of it. The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases: [[Heracleopolis]] in Lower Egypt and [[Thebes]] in Upper Egypt. These two kingdoms would eventually come into conflict, with the Theban kings conquering the north, resulting in reunification of Egypt under a single ruler during the second part of the 11th Dynasty.

=====Middle Bronze dynasties=====
The [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] lasted from 2055 to 1650 BC. During this period, the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Osiris funerary cult]] rose to dominate Egyptian popular religion. The period comprises two phases: the 11th Dynasty, which ruled from Thebes and the 12th&lt;ref&gt;Othmar Keel and Christoph Uehlinger. ''Gods, goddesses, and images of God in ancient Israel'', 1998. Page 17 (cf. &quot;The first phase (Middle Bronze Age IIA) runs roughly parallel to the Egyptian Twelfth Dynasty&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; and 13th Dynasties which were centered around [[el-Lisht]]. The unified kingdom was previously considered to comprise the 11th and 12th Dynasties, but historians now at least partially consider the 13th Dynasty to belong to the Middle Kingdom.

During the [[Second Intermediate Period]]&lt;ref&gt;Bruce G. Trigger. ''Ancient Egypt: a social history''. 1983. Page 137. (cf. ... &quot;for the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period it is the Middle Bronze Age&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt;, Ancient Egypt fell into disarray for a second time, between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known for the [[Hyksos]], whose reign comprised the 15th and 16th dynasties. The Hyksos first appeared in Egypt during the 11th Dynasty, began their climb to power in the 13th Dynasty, and emerged from the Second Intermediate Period in control of [[Avaris]] and the [[Nile Delta|Delta]]. By the 15th Dynasty, they ruled lower Egypt, and they were expelled at the end of the 17th Dynasty.

=====Late Bronze dynasties=====
The [[New Kingdom]] of Egypt, also referred to as the Egyptian Empire, lasted from the 16th to the 11th century BC. The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period and was succeeded by the [[Third Intermediate Period]]. It was Egypt's most prosperous time and marked the peak of Egypt's power. The later New Kingdom, ie the 19th and 20th Dynasties (1292-1069 BC), is also known as the [[Ramesside period]], after the eleven pharaohs that took the name of Ramesses.

====Pontic-Caspian steppe====
The [[Yamna culture]] is a late copper age/early Bronze Age culture of the Southern Bug/Dniester/Ural region (the Pontic steppe), dating to the 36th–23rd centuries BC. The name also appears in English as Pit Grave Culture or Ochre Grave Culture. The [[Catacomb culture]], ca. 2800-2200 BC, refers to an early Bronze Age culture occupying essentially what is present-day Ukraine. It's seemed more of as an areal term to cover several smaller related archaeological cultures. The [[Srubna culture]] was a Late Bronze Age (18th-12th centuries BC) culture. It is a successor to the Yamna culture, the Pit Grave culture and the Poltavka culture.

&lt;/ref&gt; It is conjectured that changes in climate in this region around 2000 BCE and the ensuing ecological, economic and political changes triggered a rapid and massive migration westward into northeast Europe, eastward into China and southward into [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]] across a frontier of some 4,000 miles.&lt;ref name=BBCKeys/&gt; This migration took place in just five to six generations and led to peoples from Finland in the west to Thailand in the east employing the same metal working technology and, in some areas, horse breeding and riding.&lt;ref name=BBCKeys/&gt; It is further conjectured that the same migrations spread the [[Uralic language|Uralic]] group of languages across Europe and Asia: some 39 languages of this group are still extant, including [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Lappish language|Lappish]].&lt;ref name=BBCKeys/&gt;

Historians disagree about the dates of a &quot;Bronze Age&quot; in China.  The difficulty lies in the term &quot;Bronze Age&quot;, as it has been applied to signify a period in history when bronze tools replaced stone tools, and, later, were themselves replaced by iron ones.  The medium of the new &quot;Age&quot; made that of the old obsolete. In China, however, any attempt to establish a definite set of dates for a Bronze Age is complicated by two factors:
# arrival of iron smelting technology, and
# persistence of bronze objects.
The earliest bronze artifacts have been found in the [[Majiayao culture]] site (between 3100 and 2700 BCE) and, from then on, the society gradually grew into the Bronze Age.

Bronze metallurgy in China originated in what is referred to as the [[Erlitou]] ({{zh|w=Erh-li-t'ou}}) period, which some historians argue places it within the range of dates controlled by the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, K. C.: &quot;Studies of Shang Archaeology&quot;, pp. 6–7, 1.  Yale University Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others believe the Erlitou sites  belong to the preceding [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]] ({{zh|w=Hsia}}) dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, K. C.: &quot;Studies of Shang Archaeology&quot;, p. 1.  Yale University Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. [[National Gallery of Art]] defines the Chinese Bronze Age as the &quot;period between about 2000 BCE and 771 BCE,&quot; a period that begins with Erlitou culture and ends abruptly with the disintegration of [[Western Zhou Dynasty|Western Zhou]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_pt2.shtm |title=Teaching Chinese Archaeology, Part Two&amp;nbsp;— NGA |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this provides a concise frame of reference, it overlooks the continued importance of bronze in Chinese metallurgy and culture. Since this is significantly later than the discovery of bronze in Mesopotamia, bronze technology could have been imported rather than discovered independently in China. Although there is reason to believe that bronzework developed inside China separately from outside influence.&lt;ref&gt;Li-Liu; The Chinese Neolithic, Cambridge University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/shzh/hd_shzh.htm ''Shang and Zhou Dynasties: The Bronze Age of China'' Heilbrunn Timeline] Retrieved May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shang Dynasty]]&lt;ref&gt; Also known as the [[Yin Dynasty]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorp, R. L. (2005). China in the early bronze age: Shang civilization. Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Yellow River Valley]] rose to power after the [[Xia Dynasty]]. While some direct information about the Shang Dynasty comes from Shang-era inscriptions on bronze artifacts, most comes from oracle bones — turtle shells, cattle scapulae, or other bones, which bear glyphs that form the first significant corpus of recorded Chinese characters. 

Iron is found from the [[Zhou Dynasty]], but its use is minimal. Chinese literature dating to the 6th century BC attests a knowledge of iron smelting, yet bronze continues to occupy the seat of significance in the archaeological and historical record for some time after this.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, N.: &quot;Bronze Casting and Bronze Alloys in Ancient China&quot;, p. 14.  The Australian National University and Monumenta Serica, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian W. C. White argues that iron did not supplant bronze &quot;at any period before the end of the Zhou dynasty (256 BCE)&quot; and that bronze vessels make up the majority of metal vessels all the way through the Later Han period, or through [[CE]] 221.&lt;ref&gt;White, W. C.: &quot;Bronze Culture of Ancient China&quot;, p. 208.  University of Toronto Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese bronze artifacts generally are either utilitarian, like spear points or adze heads, or ritualistic, like the numerous large sacrificial tripods known as [[ding]]s in Chinese.  However, even some of the most utilitarian objects bear the markings of more sacred items.  The Chinese inscribed all kinds of bronze items with three main motif types:  demons, symbolic animals, and abstract symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Erdberg, E.: &quot;Ancient Chinese Bronzes&quot;, p. 20.  Siebenbad-Verlag, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some large bronzes also bear inscriptions that have helped historians and archaeologists piece together the history of China, especially during the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BCE).

The bronzes of the Western Zhou Dynasty document large portions of history not found in the extant texts that were often composed by persons of varying rank and possibly even social class. Further, the medium of cast bronze lends the record they preserve a permanence not  enjoyed by manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, E. L.:  &quot;Sources of Western Zhou History&quot;, pp. xv–xvi.  University of California Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  These inscriptions can commonly be subdivided into four parts:  a reference to the date and place, the naming of the event commemorated, the list of gifts given to the artisan in exchange for the bronze, and a dedication.&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, E. L. &quot;Sources of Western Zhou History&quot;, pp. 76–83.  University of California Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative points of reference these vessels provide have enabled historians to place most of the vessels within a certain time frame of the Western Zhou period, allowing them to trace the evolution of the vessels and the events they record.&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, E. L. &quot;Sources of Western Zhou History&quot;, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korean====
{{Main|Gojoseon|Mumun Pottery Period}}

The [[Gojoseon]] period on the peninsula is usually said to be 1000 BC, but estimates range from the 15th to 8th centuries BC. Although the Korean Bronze Age culture derives from the [[Liaoning bronze dagger culture|Liaoning]] and Manchuria, it exhibits unique typology and styles, especially in ritual objects.&lt;ref&gt;http://daegu.museum.go.kr/museum/english/body_02/body02_1_03.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mumun pottery period]] is named after the Korean name for undecorated or plain cooking and storage vessels that form a large part of the pottery assemblage over the entire length of the period, but especially 850-550 BCE. The Mumun period is known for the origins of intensive agriculture and complex societies in both the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago. 

The Middle Mumun pottery period culture of the southern [[Korean Peninsula]] gradually adopted bronze production (c. 700–600? BCE) after a period when Liaoning-style bronze daggers and other bronze artifacts were exchanged as far as the interior part of the Southern Peninsula (c. 900–700 BCE). The bronze daggers lent prestige and authority to the personages who wielded and were buried with them in high-status megalithic burials at south-coastal centres such as the [[Igeum-dong site]].&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gai.or.kr/ ▒▒▒▒ 경남고고학연구소 ▒▒▒▒ Bot generated title &lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Bronze was an important element in ceremonies and as for mortuary offerings until 100.

{{Main|Indus Valley civilization}}

The Bronze Age on the [[Indian subcontinent]] began around 3300 BCE with the beginning of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley civilization]]. Inhabitants of the Indus Valley, the [[Harappa]]ns, developed new techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, bronze, lead and tin. The Indian Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age [[Vedic Period]]. The Harappan culture, which dates from 1700 BCE to 1300 BCE, overlapped the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age; thus it is difficult to date this transition accurately.

{{Main|Aegean Civilization}}
The Aegean Bronze Age begins around 3000 BCE, when civilizations first established a far-ranging [[trade]] network.  This network imported [[tin]] and charcoal to [[Cyprus]], where [[copper]] was mined and alloyed with the tin to produce bronze. Bronze objects were then exported far and wide, and supported the trade. [[Isotope|Isotopic]] analysis of tin in some [[Mediterranean]] bronze artifacts point to the fact that they may have originated from [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Waldman, Catherine Mason. ''Encyclopedia of European peoples: Volume 1''. 2006. Page 524.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of [[navigation]] was well developed at this time, and reached a peak of skill not exceeded (except perhaps by [[Polynesia#Polynesian navigation|Polynesian]] sailors) until [[CE]] 1730 when the invention of the [[chronometer]] enabled the precise determination of [[longitude]].

The [[Minoan civilization]] based in [[Knossos]] appears to have coordinated and defended its Bronze Age trade. [[Illyrians]] are also believed to have roots in the early Bronze Age. Ancient empires valued [[luxury good]]s in contrast to [[staple foods]], leading to famine.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster, H. O. (1990). Expectations of life: A study in the demography, statistics, and history of world mortality. New York: Springer-Verlag. Page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have arisen because money was concentrated in the hands of a few people, rather than due to a lack of modern accounting methods.

=====Aegean Collapse=====
{{Main|Bronze Age collapse}}
Bronze Age collapse theories have described aspects of the end of the Age in this region. At the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean region, the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] administration of the regional trade empire followed the decline of Minoan primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Drews, R. (1993). The end of the Bronze Age: Changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Pres&lt;/ref&gt; Several Minoan [[Client States|client states]] lost much of their population to famine and/or pestilence. This would indicate that the trade network may have failed, preventing the trade that would previously have relieved such famines and prevented illness caused by malnutrition. It is also known that in this era the [[breadbasket]] of the Minoan empire, the area north of the [[Black Sea]], also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some cultivation.

The Aegean Collapse has been attributed to the exhaustion of the [[Cyprus]] forests caused the end of the bronze trade.&lt;ref&gt;Cities on the Sea., Swiny, S., Hohlfelder, R. L., &amp; Swiny, H. W. (1998). Res maritimae: Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean from prehistory to late antiquity : proceedings of the Second International Symposium &quot;Cities on the Sea&quot;, Nicosia, Cyprus, October 18–22, 1994. Atlanta, Ga: Scholars Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creevey, B. (1994). The forest resources of Bronze Age Cyprus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bernard Knapp, Steve O. Held and Sturt W. Manning. The prehistory of Cyprus: Problems and prospects.&lt;/ref&gt; These forests are known to have existed into later times, and experiments have shown that [[charcoal]] production on the scale necessary for the bronze production of the late Bronze Age would have exhausted them in less than fifty years.

Aegean Collapse has also been attributed to the fact that as [[iron]] [[tool]]s became more common, the main justification for the tin trade ended, and that trade network ceased to function as it did formerly.&lt;ref&gt;Lockard, Craig A. (2009). Societies, Networks, and Transitions: To 600. Wadsworth Pub Co. Page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies of the Minoan empire then suffered drought, famine, war, or some combination of those three, and had no access to the distant resources of an empire by which they could easily recover.

The [[Thera eruption]] occurred around the Aegean Collapse, 110&amp;nbsp;km (70&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Crete. Speculation include a [[tsunami]] from Thera (more commonly known today as Santorini) destroyed Cretan cities. A tsunami may have destroyed the Cretan [[navy]] in its home harbour, which then lost crucial naval battles; so that in the [[Minoan chronology|LMIB/LMII]] event (c. 1450 BCE) the cities of [[Crete]] burned and the [[Mycenaean civilization]] took over [[Knossos]]. If the eruption occurred in the late 17th century BCE (as most chronologists now think) then its immediate effects belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition, and not to the end of the Late Bronze Age; but it could have triggered the instability that led to the collapse first of Knossos and then of Bronze Age society overall. One such theory looks to the role of Cretan expertise in administering the empire, post-Thera. If this expertise was concentrated in Crete, then the Mycenaeans may have made political and commercial mistakes in administering the Cretan empire.

Archaeological findings, including some on the island of Thera, suggest that the centre of Minoan Civilization at the time of the eruption was actually on Thera rather than on Crete. According to this theory, the catastrophic loss of the political, administrative and economic centre by the eruption as well as the damage wrought by the tsunami to the coastal towns and villages of Crete precipitated the decline of the Minoans. A weakened political entity with a reduced economic and military capability and fabled riches would have then been more vulnerable to human predators. Indeed, the Santorini Eruption is usually dated to c. 1630 BCE, while the Mycenaean Greeks first enter the historical record a few decades later, c. 1600 BCE. Thus, the later Mycenaean assaults on Crete (c.1450 BCE) and Troy (c.1250 BCE) are revealed as mere continuations of the steady encroachments of the Greeks upon the weakened Minoan world.

{{Main|Bronze Age Europe}}
The Bronze Age in Europe spans the entire [[2nd millennium BC]] ([[Unetice culture]], [[Urnfield culture]], [[Tumulus culture]], [[Terramare culture]], [[Lusatian culture]]) in [[Nordic Bronze Age|Northern Europe]] lasting until ca. 600 BC.

In [[Central Europe]], the early Bronze Age [[Unetice culture]] (1800–1600 BCE) includes numerous smaller groups like the [[Straubingen culture|Straubing]], [[Adlerberg culture|Adlerberg]] and [[Hatvan|Hatvan cultures]]. Some very rich burials, such as the one located at [[Leubingen]] with grave gifts crafted from gold, point to an increase of social stratification already present in the Unetice culture. All in all, cemeteries of this period are rare and of small size. The Unetice culture is followed by the middle Bronze Age (1600–1200 BCE) [[Tumulus culture]], which is characterised by inhumation burials in [[tumuli]] (barrows). In the eastern [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Körös]] tributaries, the early Bronze Age first saw the introduction of the [[Mako culture]], followed by the [[Ottomany culture|Ottomany]] and [[Gyulavarsand culture]]s.

The late Bronze Age [[Urnfield]] culture, (1300–700 BCE) is characterized by cremation burials. It includes the [[Lusatian culture]] in eastern [[Germany]] and [[Poland]] (1300–500 BCE) that continues into the [[Iron Age]]. The Central European Bronze Age is followed by the Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] (700–450 BCE).

[[list of archaeological sites|Important sites]] include:
* [[Biskupin]] ([[Poland]])
* [[Nebra]] ([[Germany]])
* [[Vráble]] ([[Slovakia]])
* Zug-Sumpf, [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], [[Switzerland]]

The Bronze Age in Central Europe has been described in the chronological schema of German prehistorian Paul Reinecke. He described Bronze A1 (Bz A1) period (2300–2000 BCE : triangular daggers, flat axes, stone wrist-guards, flint arrowheads) and Bronze A2 (Bz A2) period (1950–1700 BCE : daggers with metal hilt, flanged axes, halberds, pins with perforated spherical heads, solid bracelets) and phases Hallstatt A and B (Ha A and B).

====South Europe====
The [[Apennine culture]] (also called Italian Bronze Age) is a technology complex of central and southern Italy spanning the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age proper. The [[Camuni]] were an ancient people of uncertain origin (according to [[Pliny the Elder]], they were [[Euganei]]; according to [[Strabo]], they were [[Rhaetians]]) who lived in [[Val Camonica]] - in what is now northern [[Lombardy]] - during the [[Iron Age]], although human groups of hunters, shepherds and farmers are known to have lived in the area since the [[Neolithic]].

Located in [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], the [[Nuragic civilization]] lasted from the early Bronze Age (18th century BC) to the 2nd century AD, when the islands were already Romanized. They take their name from the characteristic nuragic towers, which evolved from the pre-existing megalithic culture, which built [[dolmen]]s and [[menhir]]s. The nuraghe towers are unanimously considered the best preserved and largest megalithic remains in Europe. Their effective use is still debated: some scholars considered them as monumental tombs, others as [[Giants' grave|Houses of the Giants]], other as fortresses, ovens for metal fusion, prisons or, finally, temples for a solar cult.

The [[Terramare]] was a [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] civilization which lived in the area of what is now [[Pianura Padana]] (northern Italy) before the arrival of the [[Celts]], as well as in other parts of Europe. They lived in villages constituted of wooden [[stilt houses]]: they had a square shape, built on the  mainland but generally near a stream, with roads that crossed each other at [[right angles]]. The whole complex denoted the nature of a fortified settlement. The Terramare were widespread in the Pianura Padana (specially along the [[Panaro]] river, between [[Modena]] and [[Bologna]]) and in the rest of Europe. The civilization developed in the Middle and Recent Bronze Age, between the 17th and the 13th centuries BC.

The [[Castellieri culture]] developed in [[Istria]] during the Mid-Bronze Age. It lasted for more than a millennium, from the 15th century BC until the Roman conquest in the 3rd century BC. It takes its name from the fortified boroughs (''Castellieri'', [[Friulian language|Friulian]] ''cjastelir'') which characterized the culture.

The [[Canegrate culture]] developed from the mid-Bronze Age (13th century BC) till the Iron Age in the [[Pianura Padana]], in what is are now western [[Lombardy]], eastern [[Piedmont]] and [[Canton Ticino|Ticino]]. It takes its name from the township of [[Canegrate]] where, in the 20th century, some fifty tombs with ceramics and metal objects were found.rior population who had descended to [[Pianura Padana]] from the Swiss Alps passes and the Ticino.

The [[Golasecca culture]] developed starting from the late Bronze Age in the [[Po plain]]. It takes its name from Golasecca, a locality next to the [[Ticino]] where, in the early 19th century, abbot Giovanni Battista Giani excavated its first findings (some fifty tombs with ceramics and metal objects). Remains of the Golasecca culture span an area of c. 20,000 square kilometers south to the Alps, between the Po, [[Sesia]] and [[Serio]] rivers, dating from the 9th to the 4th century BC.

The [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] is a cultural complex of the period of approximately 1300–700 BC that includes different cultures in Portugal, Andalusia, Galicia and the British Isles. It is marked by economic and cultural exchange. Commercial contacts extend to Denmark and the Mediterranean. The Atlantic Bronze Age was defined by a number of distinct regional centres of metal production, unified by a regular maritime exchange of some of their products.

=====Great Britain=====
{{Main|Bronze Age Britain}}
In [[Great Britain]], the Bronze Age is considered to have been the period from around 2100 to 750 BCE. [[Human migration|Migration]] brought new people to the islands from the continent. Recent tooth enamel isotope research on bodies found in early Bronze Age graves around [[Stonehenge]] indicate that at least some of the migrants came from the area of modern [[Switzerland]]. The [[Beaker culture]] displayed different behaviours from the earlier [[Neolithic]] people, and cultural change was significant. Integration is thought to have been peaceful, as many of the early [[henge]] sites were seemingly adopted by the newcomers. The rich [[Wessex culture]] developed in southern Britain at this time. Additionally, the climate was deteriorating; where once the weather was warm and dry it became much wetter as the Bronze Age continued, forcing the population away from easily defended sites in the hills and into the fertile [[valley]]s. Large livestock farms developed in the lowlands and appear to have contributed to economic growth and inspired increasing forest clearances. The [[Deverel-Rimbury culture]] began to emerge in the second half of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1400–1100 BCE) to exploit these conditions. [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] were major sources of [[tin]] for much of western Europe and [[copper]] was extracted from sites such as the [[Great Orme]] mine in northern [[Wales]]. Social groups appear to have been tribal but with growing complexity and hierarchies becoming apparent.

The burial of dead (which until this period had usually been communal) became more individual. For example, whereas in the Neolithic a large [[chambered cairn]] or [[long barrow]] was used to house the dead, the Early Bronze Age saw people buried in individual [[tumulus|barrows]] (also commonly known and marked on modern British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps as tumuli), or sometimes in [[cist]]s covered with [[cairn]]s.

The greatest quantities of bronze objects found in [[England]] were discovered in [[East Cambridgeshire]], where the most important finds were recovered in [[Isleham]] (more than [[Isleham Hoard|6500 pieces]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hall and Coles, p. 81–88.&lt;/ref&gt;
Alloying of copper with zinc or tin to make [[brass]] or [[bronze]] was practised soon after the discovery of copper itself. One copper mine at [[Great Orme]] in North Wales, extended to a depth of 70 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=O’Brien, W.|title=Bronze Age Copper Mining in Britain and Ireland|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|year=1997|isbn=0747803218}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Alderley Edge]] in [[Cheshire]], carbon dates have established mining at around 2280 to 1890 BCE (at 95% probability).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timberlake, S. and Prag A.J.N.W.|year=2005|title=The Archaeology of Alderley Edge:Survey, excavation and experiment in an ancient mining landscape|location=Oxford|publisher= John and Erica Hedges Ltd.|page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest identified metalworking site (Sigwells, Somerset) is much later, dated by Globular Urn style pottery to approximately the 12th century BCE. The identifiable sherds from over 500 mould fragments included a perfect fit of the hilt of a sword in the Wilburton style held in Somerset County Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabor 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tabor |first=Richard |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cadbury Castle: A hillfort and landscapes |year=2008 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud |pages=61–69|isbn=9780752447155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ireland=====
{{See also|Atlantic Bronze Age}}
The [[Bronze Age in Ireland]] commenced around 2000 BCE, when copper was alloyed with tin and used to manufacture [[Ballybeg]] type flat axes and associated metalwork. The preceding period is known as the [[Copper Age]] and is characterised by the production of [[flat axes]], [[daggers]], [[halberds]] and [[stitching awl|awls]] in copper. The period is divided into three phases: [[Early Bronze Age]] (2000–1500 BCE), [[Middle Bronze Age]] (1500–1200 BCE), and [[Late Bronze Age]] (1200&amp;nbsp;– c. 500 BCE). Ireland is also known for a relatively large number of Early Bronze Age [[burials]].

One of the characteristic types of artifact of the Early Bronze Age in Ireland is the flat axe. There are five main types of flat axes: [[Lough Ravel]] (c. 2200 BCE), Ballybeg (c. 2000 BCE), [[Killaha]] (c. 2000 BCE), [[Ballyvalley]] (c. 2000–1600 BCE), [[Derryniggin]] (c. 1600 BCE), and a number of metal ingots in the shape of axes.&lt;ref&gt;Waddell; Eogan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nordic Bronze Age|Northern Bronze Age]] was a period and a Bronze Age culture in Scandinavian pre-history, c. 1700-500 BC, with sites that reached as far east as Estonia. Succeeding the Late Neolithic culture, its ethnic and linguistic affinities are unknown in the absence of written sources. It is followed by the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]].

Even though Northern European Bronze Age cultures were fairly late and came in existance via trade, sites present rich and well-preserved objects made of wool, wood and imported Central European bronze and gold. Many rock carvings depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as stone ships suggest that shipping played an important role. Thousands of rock carvings depict ships, most probably representing sewn plank built canoes for warfare, fishing and trade. These may have a history as far back as the neolithic period and continue in to the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as shown by the [[Hjortspring boat]]. There are many mounds and rock carving sites from the period. Numerous artifacts of bronze and gold are found. No written language existed in the Nordic countries during the Bronze Age. The rock carvings have been dated through comparison with depicted artifacts.

===Americas===
{{See also|Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America}}
The [[Moche]] civilization of [[South America]] independently discovered and developed bronze smelting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/bolmuseo/1996/jldi41/jldi01a.htm El bronce y el horizonte medio&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze technology was developed further by the Incas and used widely both for utilitarian objects and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antonio Gutierrez |url=http://incas.homestead.com/inca_metallurgy_copper.html |title=Inca Metallurgy |publisher=Incas.homestead.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later appearance of limited bronze smelting in West [[Mexico]] (see [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]]) suggests either contact of that region with [[Andean]] cultures or separate discovery of the technology.

==Outside the Bronze Age==
===Japan===
{{Main|Jōmon period}}
The [[Jōmon period]] lasted until 500 BC and, after the end of the period, the Japanese experienced the introduction of bronze and iron simultaneously. Chinese technologies were adopted in the Korean peninsula and spread to the Japanese. Iron was mainly used for agricultural and other tools; whereas, ritual and ceremonial artifacts were mainly made of bronze.

===Africa===
{{See also|Prehistoric North Africa}}
Although North Africa was influenced to certain extent by European Bronze Age cultures (for examples, traces of the [[Bell beaker]] tradition are found in [[Morocco]]), Africa did not develop its own metallurgy until the Phoenician colonization (ca. 1100 BCE) of North Africa and remained attached to the [[Neolithic]] way of life. The civilization of the Ancient Egypt, whose influence did not cover the rest of Africa, was rather an exception from this rule as regarding the whole range of ancient cultures of Africa.

'''BBC News''' (also called ''BBC News Channel'') is the [[BBC|BBC's]] 24-hour rolling news television network in the United Kingdom. The channel launched as ''BBC News 24'' on 9 November 1997 at 17:30 as part of the BBC's foray into digital domestic television channels, becoming the first competitor to [[Sky News]], which had been running since 1989.&lt;ref name = &quot;kcvcng&quot;&gt;[http://www.tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml About BBC News 24] TV Home&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, with several relaunches, an increase in funding and resources from the BBC and improvements in digital television technology, the channel has been able to diversify content, with two minute looped bulletins available to view via [[BBC Red Button]], [[BBC News Online]] and the BBC's mobile website, alongside individual weather and sport bulletins.

In May 2007 the channel became available for UK viewers to view through the BBC News website through a live [[Streaming media|stream]]. In April 2008 the channel was renamed &quot;BBC News&quot; as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output, complete with a new studio and presentation. Its sister services, BBC World was also renamed as &quot;[[BBC World News]]&quot; while the national news bulletins became ''BBC News at One'', ''BBC News at Six'' and ''BBC News at Ten''.

As a major part of the BBC News department, the channel is based at and broadcast from the News Centre within [[BBC Television Centre]] in West London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/aboutbbcnews/spl/hi/history/noflash/html/1990s.stm About BBC News] 1997: News on the move&lt;/ref&gt; The channel was named [[Royal Television Society|RTS]] ''News Channel of the Year'' in 2006 and again in 2009.

==History==
BBC News 24 was originally available only to analogue cable television subscribers. To this day it and [[BBC Parliament]] remain the only BBC &quot;digital&quot; channels which are made available to analogue cable subscribers. This coverage was improved in 1998 with the advent of [[digital television]] in the United Kingdom allowing [[satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial television]] viewers to also view the service. Initially it was difficult to obtain a digital satellite or terrestrial receiver without a subscription to Sky or [[ONdigital]] respectively, but now the channel forms an important part of the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] package of channels.

The BBC had run the international news channel [[BBC World News|BBC World]] for two and a half years prior to the launch of BBC News 24 on 9 November 1997. [[Sky News]] had had a free hand with domestic news for over eight years (since 5 February 1989) and being owned by [[News International]] their papers were used to criticise the BBC for extending its news output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chauy.com/2006/07/the-sky-news-blog-%E2%80%93-a-new-angle-in-the-news/ The Sky News Blog-A New Angle In The News?] Tips 'N' Tutorials&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sky News]] objected to the breaking of its monopoly, complaining about the costs associated with running a channel that only a minority could view from the [[Television licence|licence fee]]. Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the [[European Commission]] ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the [[Television licence|licence fee]] should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reckon.co.uk/open/BBC_News_24 BBC News 24 (State aid)] Reckon Regulation &amp; Competition Economics LLP&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel's journalistic output has been overseen by Controller of the channel, [[Kevin Bakhurst]], since 16 December 2005. This was a return to having a dedicated Controller for the channel in the same way as the rest of the BBC's domestic television channels. At launch, Tim Orchard was Controller of News 24 from 1997 until 2000. Editorial decisions were then overseen by Rachel Atwell in her capacity as Deputy Head of television news. Her deputy Mark Popescu became responsible for editorial content in 2004, a role he continued in until the appointment of Bakhurst as Controller in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4417472.stm BBC to revamp TV news operation] – BBC News Online, 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A further announcement by Head of television news [[Peter Horrocks]] came at the same time as Bakhurst's appointment in which he outlined his plan to provide more funding and resources for the channel and shift the corporation's emphasis regarding news away from the traditional BBC One bulletins and across to the rolling news channel. The introduction of simulcasts of the main bulletins on the channel was to allow the news bulletins to pool resources rather than work against each other at key times in the face of competition particularly from Sky News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1131460853&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=5&amp; BBC announces changes to Television News] TV Newsroom, 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Board of Governors of the BBC|BBC Governors]]' [http://www.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/ annual report] for 2005/2006 reported that average audience figures for fifteen minute periods had reached 8.6% in multichannel homes, up from 7.8% in 2004/2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review-report-research/bbcannualreport.pdf BBC Governor's Annual Report 2005/2006] Page 47&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 report claimed that the channel outperformed Sky News in both weekly and monthly reach in multichannel homes for the January 2004 period, and for the first time in two years moved ahead of Sky News in being perceived as the channel best for news.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds15400.html BBC News 24 edging ahead of Sky News] Neil Wilkes; Digital Spy, 19 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 2006, the channel was named ''News Channel of the Year'' at the Royal Television Society Television Journalism Awards for the first time in its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds29532.html BBC winners at TV journalism awards] Dave West; Digital Spy, 23 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The judges remarked that this was the year that the channel had &quot;really come into its own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_4740000/newsid_4742600/4742620.stm News 24 wins news channel of the year] Newswatch – BBC News Online, 23 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 rebranding===
On 21 April 2008 BBC News 24 was renamed ''BBC News'' on the channel itself – but is referred to as the ''BBC News Channel '' on other BBC services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article3735982.ece BBC News 24 to be renamed] Times Online&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of the creative futures plan, launched in 2006, to bring all BBC News output under the single brand name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jun/12/digitalmedia.marketingandpr Creative Futures Plan] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC News Channel moved from the Studio N8 set (now home to BBC World News) to what was the home of the national news in Studio N6, allowing the Channel to share its set with the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' and the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' – with other bulletins moving to studio TC7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvradiobits.co.uk/idents/news24c.htm 2008 Changes]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
===News===
&lt;!-- Please do not replace this section with a schedule, it violates section 1.7.7. of Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not and may also violate copyright --&gt;
Each hour consists of headlines on each quarter hour, extended at the top of the hour to form the main part of the daily schedule though these are interspaced with other programmes, generally at weekends. This will be often be displaced by rolling news coverage including reports and live interviews. Weather summaries are provided every half hour by forecasters from the [[BBC Weather Centre]] while business and sport updates are also presented generally from within the main studio.

====Breaking news====
The BBC maintains guidelines for procedures to be taken for breaking news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/impartiality_business/f2_news_submission.txt | title=Editoral processes – How BBC News works | publisher=[[BBC Trust]] | date=22 January 2007| accessdate=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With domestic news, the correspondent first records a &quot;generic minute&quot; summary (for use by all stations and channels) and then priority is to report on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], then on the BBC News Channel and any other programmes that are on air. For foreign news, first a &quot;generic minute&quot; is recorded, then reports are to [[BBC World Service|World Service]] radio, then the reporter talks to any other programmes that are on air.

A key claim made by Lord Lambert in his report had been that the channel was slower to react to breaking news compared with its main rival Sky News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml Getting creative breakthrough...-About BBC News] TV Home&lt;/ref&gt; To counteract this, a new feature introduced with the 2003 relaunch was a 'breaking news sting': a globe shown briefly onscreen to direct a viewer's attention to the breaking news.

The graphics relaunch in January 2007 has since seen the globe sting replaced by a red strapline to highlight the breaking story immediately.

To complement this, a permanent live news ticker had earlier been introduced in 2006: this had only previously been in use sporadically. News statements are shown as continuously-scrolling upper-case text located at the bottom of the screen; some past ambiguities noted have included spelling the plural of MPs as &quot;MPS&quot;, together with other occasional spelling and grammatical errors. The design of this ticker was slightly altered with the 2007 graphics redesign and from June turned red to indicate breaking news, as ''[[Newswatch (BBC)|Newswatch]]'' reported viewers' confusion.

====Overnight and special simulcasts====
The BBC began [[simulcast]]ing the channel overnight on [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] channel BBC One with the launch of the channel, ending the tradition of a closedown but at the same time effectively making the service available to many more viewers. In the early 2000s, BBC Two also started simulcasting the channel, although the weekend morning show ''Weekend 24'' had been simulcast on the channel in the early days. During major breaking news events, the BBC News Channel has been broadcast on BBC One; examples of special broadcasts include the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]], [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] and [[Operation Red Dawn|the capture of Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds23123.html News 24 claims July victory] Neil Wilkes; Digital Spy, 1 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1124647138&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=5&amp; News 24 top for rolling news] TV Newsroom, 21 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of major events has also been simulcast on BBC World News.

====Simulcast BBC One programmes====
Since the launch of [[BBC Breakfast|''Breakfast'']] in 2000, the programme has been simulcast on both BBC One and BBC News, replacing the individual breakfast news programmes that had been run by both channels. Since May 2006, the simulcast begins with the programme at 06:00 until 08:30 when programming on BBC News begins. ''Breakfast'' on BBC One then generally continues until 09:15.

The ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' began simulcasting on the channel on 30 January 2006 as part of the ''Ten O'Clock Newshour'', followed by extended sport and business news updates. The bulletin was joined in being simulcast on 10 April 2006 when the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' (with [[British Sign Language]] in-vision signing) and ''[[BBC News at Six]]'' bulletins were added to the schedule following a similar format to the ''News at Ten'' in terms of content on the channel once each simulcast ends.

During the Summer, the hour long programme ''News 24 Sunday'' is broadcast both on BBC One and the BBC News Channel at 09:00, to replace ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', which is off air. It is presented by a newspresenter, and comes from the main News channel studio. The programme is made up mostly of interviews focusing on current affairs, and includes a full paper review, a weather summary, and a news update at 09:00, 09:30 and 10:00.

====Exclusive programmes====
[[Image:BBC News 24 set.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the previous BBC News set]]
Other programming produced solely by the BBC News channel includes the ''[[BBC News at Five O'Clock]]'' with Huw Edwards (including ''Film 24'' with [[Mark Kermode]] at 17:45 on Fridays), Entertainment programme ''E24'' (at 18:30 and 21:30, with [[Tasmin Lucia Khan]]), ''Sportsday'' (at 18:45, except on Friday and Saturdays when it is from 18:30, plus 22:30 every weekday) and ''[[Newswatch (BBC)|Newswatch]]'' (Friday 20:45, Saturday 07:45).

Programmes including ''[[Click (TV series)|Click]]'', ''[[Dateline London]]'', ''[[HARDtalk]]'', ''Our World'', ''E24'', ''The Record Europe'', ''Reporters'', ''Straight Talk'' and ''Your Money'' appear regularly in the weekend schedules. Many of these programmes also appear throughout the week on BBC News's sister channel [[BBC World News]].

Previous BBC News programming includes ''Head 2 Head'', ''[[Your News]]'', ''[[STORYFix]]'' and ''BBC News 24 Tonight'' a regular weekday evening programme providing a round up of the days news which ran from 2005 to 2008.

====BBC World News shared programming====
Between 01:00 and 06:00 UK Time (UKT) the channel simulcasts with its sister channel, BBC World News, for the first 25 minutes of each hour with world news shown all through the simulcasts.  Non-World programmes air generally on the half hour, notably ''[[World News with Diane Sawyer|ABC World News Tonight]]'' at 01:30.  Since 21 April 2008, the overnight bulletins, while produced by the BBC News Channel has usually been broadcast from the studios of BBC World News.

On 1 October 2007, BBC World News started broadcasting ''[[BBC World News America]]'' and ''[[World News Today]]'' at 00:00 and 03:00 UKT respectively. World News Today is simulcast on the BBC News channel while ''BBC World News America'', airs a delayed version at 00:30 UKT.

BBC World News and World Business Report air at 5.00 on both channels and in lieu of commercials seen on the international broadcasts, the presenters give a brief update on UK news for domestic audiences.

===Sport coverage===
In 1990, new broadcaster [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] launched its new satellite television service. During the news programmes on [[Galaxy (British television)|Galaxy]] and [[Now (television)|Now]] and during the sports news programme on [[The Sports Channel]] clips from other broadcaster's sports output would be used to illustrate the sports headlines. The BBC took BSB to court to sue them for copyright violation for showing highlights of the BBC's live broadcasts of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] football matches. The [[High Court of Justice]] decided that the ''rebroadcasts were for the purposes of reporting the news'' and were legal, even if the ''highlights were also entertaining'', the BBC lost the case but set a legal precedent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nic.suzor.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/2006-Suzor-Transformative-Use.pdf Transformative Use of Copyright Material] page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

This has allowed all UK television broadcasters to legally package highlights from their own and other broadcasters' output into news programmes without payment or permission, as only a caption indicating the originating broadcaster is required. [[Fair dealing]] allows [[copyright]]ed material to be used for news gathering purposes, as well as criticism and review or research.

This has allowed the BBC to benefit from the action it took against BSB, to provide a cut-price sport news service since the channel launched. As the precedent only applies to television, [[Sky News]] is not streamed online as the ''criticism and review'' provision used does not apply outside broadcast television. Since the beginning of May 2007, the BBC News Channel has been streamed online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/05_may/08/news24.shtml|title=Press Release: BBC News 24 streamed live on BBC News website permanently|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=25 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports bulletins are usually at 45 minutes past the hour, with headlines at 15 minutes past the hour. There are also two extended sports bulletins per day, entitled 'Sportsday' broadcast at 18:45 (18:30 Friday and Saturday) and 22:30 (weekdays only). Each bulletin is read by a single sports presenter, with the exception of Saturday Sportsday, which is double headed.
Bulletins during [[BBC Breakfast]] are presented by [[Chris Hollins]] or [[Mike Bushell]], with the latter also appearing on other sports bulletins on the channel. The other presenters for bulletins on the channel are: [[Robin Bailey]], [[Amanda Davies]], [[Sean Fletcher]], [[David Garrido]], [[Lizzie Greenwood-Hughes]], Amelia Harris, [[Celina Hinchcliffe]], [[Rachael Hodges]], [[Sonja McLaughlan]], [[Alison Mitchell]], [[Adnan Nawaz]], [[Gavin Ramjaun]], George Riley and Olympic gold medalist turned journalist [[Matthew Pinsent]]. These presenters also often produce reports on major sports stories, as well as appearing on the BBC One weekend bulletins.

===Business===
An hourly business update is included during the weekday schedule from the BBC Business Unit, usually presented by [[Simon Jack]] during [[BBC Breakfast]] and through the morning until the [[BBC News at One]] and [[Maryam Moshiri]] during the rest of the day. Other presenters include [[Babita Sharma]], Joe Lynam, Dominic Laurie, [[Rachel Horne]], [[Sara Coburn]], [[Owen Thomas]] and Sally Eden. News Channel updates are usually broadcast at 40 minutes past the hour from 08:40 until 22:40. The final bulletin is an extended roundup of the day's business news.

[[Rico Hizon]] regularly presents the main business stories from Singapore during the BBC's overnight coverage, which is simulcast on BBC World News.

Until May 2009, the morning business updates on BBC Breakfast and on the BBC News Channel were broadcast from one of the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s studios in central London. Since Tuesday, 26 May 2009, those bulletins have been broadcast from TC7 and N6 in [[London Television Centre]], the main studios of BBC Breakfast and the BBC News Channel respectively.

==News presenters==
{{Detail|List of BBC newsreaders and reporters}}
Since December 2007, the main regular presenters on the channel have been [[Simon McCoy]], [[Carrie Gracie]], [[Matthew Amroliwala]], [[Jane Hill]], [[Jon Sopel]], [[Emily Maitlis]], [[Louise Minchin]], [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]], [[Ben Brown (journalist)|Ben Brown]], [[Joanna Gosling]] and [[Chris Eakin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbcnewschannel.wetpaint.com/page/BBC+News+Channel+-+Main+Presenters Main BBC News Channel Presenters]&lt;/ref&gt; The main weekend presenters include [[Tim Willcox]], [[Maxine Mawhinney]], [[Nicholas Owen (journalist)|Nicholas Owen]], [[Martine Croxall]], [[Clive Myrie]] and [[Annita McVeigh]]. Most of these presenters also regularly stand in during the week.

[[Adnan Nawaz]], [[Babita Sharma]] and [[Alistair Yates]] are the main overnight presenters on the channel, which simulcasts with [[BBC World News]] and either [[BBC One]] or [[BBC Two]] at these times. [[Deborah Mackenzie]] and [[Rebecca Pike]] occasionally appear in these slots. [[Naga Munchetty]], [[Komla Dumor]] and [[Martine Dennis]] present the BBC World News five o'clock hour, which is also broadcast on the News Channel and BBC One.

The main relief presenters are [[Gavin Esler]], [[Sophie Long]], [[Rachel Schofield]], [[Tim Willcox]] and [[Julian Worricker]], while [[Fiona Armstrong]], [[Ellie Crisell]], [[Ben Geoghagen]], [[Roger Johnson (TV presenter)|Roger Johnson]], [[Kasia Madera]], [[Chris Rogers]], [[Julia Somerville]] and [[Sue Thearle]] also fill in for regular presenters. Along with Armstrong and Somerville, political correspondent [[Carole Walker]] and [[BBC World News]] presenter [[Zeinab Badawi]] occasionally present as part of the BBC's push to &quot;ensure it [has] the best range of faces&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8427992.stm ''Julia Somerville to present on BBC News channel''] BBC News, 23 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They most frequently appear during holidays. Badawi also appears on the World News programme ''Reporters'' on the channel, while Esler presents [[Dateline London]].

The simulcasting of the main national news bulletins has led to the presenters of those bulletins appearing on the channel, with these presenters currently including [[Huw Edwards]], [[Fiona Bruce]], [[George Alagiah]], [[Sophie Raworth]] and [[Kate Silverton]]. The main ''[[BBC Breakfast|Breakfast]]'' presenters have also appeared on the channel since it was first launched as a simulcast programme in 2000, with the current presenters being [[Bill Turnbull]], [[Sian Williams]] (Mondays to Thursdays), [[Charlie Stayt]] and [[Susanna Reid]] (Fridays and weekends). [[Mishal Husain]] also appears on Sunday evening broadcasts and during the week.

[[Stephen Sackur]] appears in the late evenings on the BBC's [[Hardtalk]], while [[Diane Sawyer]] appears on a delayed showing of [[ABC World News]] Monday to Thursday. Badawi, Gracie and [[Sarah Montague]] fill-in for Sackur on Hardtalk, while [[George Stephanopoulos]] and [[David Muir]] &quot;substitute&quot; for Sawyer. In addition, [[Spencer Kelly]] presents the BBC's [[Click (TV programme)|Click]]; 

During a major news event one or more of the main news presenters may be sent to present live for the channel from the scene of the story, where they will conduct interviews with the people involved, question correspondents, introduce related reports and also give general information on the story, much as a reporter sent to cover a story would. The presenters often have expertise in the story they are sent to cover, for example, former Paris correspondent [[Jon Sopel]] presented coverage of the 2007 French presidential elections.

==Presentation==
===Graphics===
The channel was criticised at launch for its style of presentation, with accusations of it being less authoritative than the BBC One news bulletins, with presenters appearing onscreen without jackets. [[Jenny Abramsky]] had originally planned to have a television version of the informal news radio channel [[BBC Radio Five Live]], or a TV version of [[Radio 4 News FM]] both of which she had run. The bright design of the set was also blamed for this – one insider reportedly described it as a &quot;car crash in a shower&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;kcvcng&quot;/&gt; – and was subject to the network relaunch on 25 October 1999. The channel swapped studios with sister channel BBC World, moving to studio N8 within the newsroom, where it remained until 2008. New music and title sequences accompanied this set change, following the look of newly relaunched BBC One bulletins.

Graphics and titles were developed by the [[Lambie-Nairn]] design agency and were gradually rolled out across the whole of BBC News, including a similar design for regional news starting with [[Newsroom South East]] and the three ''BBC Nations'' – [[BBC Scotland|Scotland]], [[BBC Wales|Wales]] and [[BBC Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. The similarity of main BBC News output was intended to increase the credibility of the channel as well as aiding cross channel promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutN24&quot;&gt;[http://www.tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml About BBC News] TV Home&lt;/ref&gt;

A graphics relaunch in January 2007 saw the channel updated, with redesigned headline straplines, a redesigned '[[Digital on-screen graphic]]' and repositioned clock. The clock was originally placed to the left hand side of the channel name though following complaints that this could only be viewed in widescreen, it was moved to the right in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/01/fine_tuning.html|title=BBC News – The Editors – Fine tuning|date=22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulletins on BBC World News and BBC One also introduced similar graphics and title sequences on the same day.

In 2008 the graphics were again relaunched, using the style introduced in 2007 and a new colour scheme.

===The Lambert report===
[[File:BBC News 24 2003.jpg|thumb|right|BBC News 24's ''Ribbon Globe'' logo used from 2003-2007.]]
The Lambert Report into the channel's performance in 2002 called upon News 24 to develop a better brand of its own, to allow viewers to differentiate between itself and similar channels such as [[Sky News]]. As a direct result of this, a brand new style across all presentation for the channel launched on Monday 8 December 2003 at 09:00. [[Philip Hayton]] and [[Anna Jones]] were the first two presenters on the set, the relaunch of which had been put back a week due to previous power disruptions at Television Centre where the channel is based. The new designs also featured a dynamic set of titles for the channel; the globe would begin spinning from where the main story was taking place, while the headline scrolled around in a ribbon; this was occasionally replaced by the BBC News logo, then the completed logo would look like a red globe surrounded by a red stylized clamshell and BBC News ribbons, along with the BBC News logo in the bottom of the logo.

Bulletins on BBC One adopted the style later in February 2004 despite moving into a new set in January 2003 but retaining the previous ivory [[Lambie-Nairn]] titles. News 24 updated the title colours slightly to match those of BBC One bulletins in time for the 50th anniversary of BBC television news on 5 July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvradiobits.co.uk/idents/news24b.htm BBC News 24 2003–08] TV &amp; Radio Bits&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countdown sequence===
[[Image:BBC News 2008 countdown.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The countdown since 2008 has shown the elements of journalism and production involved in bringing news stories to air.]]
{{Listen|filename=Bbc news theme 2007.ogg
|title=BBC News theme|description=The BBC News title music by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]}}

An important part of the channel's presentation since launch has been the top of the hour countdown sequence, since there is no presentation system with continuity announcers so the countdown provides a link to the beginning of the next hour. A similar musical device is used on [[BBC Radio Five Live]], and mirrors the [[BBC pips|pips]] on [[BBC Radio 4]].

Previous styles have included a series of fictional flags set to music between 1997 and 1999 before the major relaunch, incorporating the new contemporary music composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]], and graphics developed by [[Lambie-Nairn]]. Various images, originally ivory numbers fully animated against a deep red background, were designed to fit the pace of the channel, and the music soon gained notoriety, and was often satirised and parodied in popular culture, perhaps most famously by comic [[Bill Bailey]] who likened the theme music to an &quot;apocalyptic [[rave]]&quot;. Images of life around the UK were added in replacement later with the same music, together with footage of the newsroom and exterior of Television Centre. The 2003 relaunch saw a small change to this style with less of a metropolitan feel to the footage.

A brand new version was introduced on 28 March 2005, designed and created by [[Red Bee Media]] and directed by Mark Chaudoir was launched. The full version runs for 60 seconds, though only around 30 seconds are shown on air. The music was revised completely but the biggest change came in the footage used – it now reflects the methods and nature of newsgathering, while a strong emphasis is placed on the BBC logo itself. Satellite dishes are shown transmitting and receiving red &quot;data streams&quot;. In production of the countdown sequence, Clive Norman filmed images around the United Kingdom, Richard Jopson in the United States, while BBC News cameramen filmed images from [[Iraq]], Beijing ([[Great Wall of China]]), [[Bund of Shanghai]], Africa, as well as areas affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Asian Tsunami]] and others.

The sequence has since seen several remixes to the music and a change in visuals to focus more on the well-known journalists, with less footage of camera crews and production teams. Changes have also seen the channel logo included during the sequences and at the end, as well as the fonts used for the time. The conclusion of the countdown was altered in 2008 to feature the new presentation style, rather than a data stream moving in towards the camera.

A full three minute version of the countdown music was made available on the [[BBC News Online|BBC News website]] and David Lowe's own after a remix on 16 May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/4992088.stm News 24 'releases' countdown music] – BBC News Online, 18 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An international version of the countdown was launched on BBC World News on 5 September 2005 featuring more international content and similar music. Various changes have been made to the music and visuals since then, with presentation following the style of BBC News.

The visuals in the sequence were updated on 10 May 2010.

'''William &quot;Bill&quot; Edgar Oddie''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 7 July 1941, [[Rochdale]], England) is an English author, actor, comedian, artist, [[naturalist]] and musician, who became famous as one of ''[[The Goodies]]''.

A [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] since childhood, Oddie has now established a reputation for himself as an [[ornithologist]], conservationist and television presenter on [[wildlife]] issues. Some of his books are illustrated with his own paintings and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A32619233 BBC - Bill Oddie OBE - Comedian and Naturalist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oddie's wildlife programmes for the [[BBC]] include: ''[[Springwatch]]''/''Autumnwatch'', ''[[Bill Oddie's How to Watch Wildlife|How to Watch Wildlife]]'', ''[[Wild In Your Garden]]'', ''[[Birding with Bill Oddie]]'', ''[[Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie]]'' and ''[[Bill Oddie Goes Wild]]''.

==Career==
===Comedy===
After attending Lapal Primary School, Halesowen Grammar School (now [[Earls High School|The Earls High School]], [[Halesowen]]) then [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], Oddie studied [[English Literature]] at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] at the University of Cambridge, where he appeared in several [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] productions.

One of these, a [[revue]] called ''A Clump of Plinths'', was so successful at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] that it was renamed ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and transferred to the West End in London, then [[New Zealand]] and Broadway in September 1964. Meanwhile, still at Cambridge, Oddie wrote scripts for TV's ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first television appearance was in [[Bernard Braden]]'s ''On The Braden Beat'' in 1964. Subsequently, he was a key member of the performers in the  [[BBC]] radio series ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' (ISIRTA; 1965), where many of his musical compositions were featured. Some were released on the album ''Distinctly Oddie'' (Polydor, 1967). He was possibly one of the first performers to [[parody]] a rock song, arranging the traditional [[Yorkshire]] folk song &quot;[[On Ilkla Moor Baht'at]]&quot; in the style of [[Joe Cocker]]'s hit rendition of [[the Beatles]]' &quot;[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]&quot; (released on [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]] in 1970 and featured in Peel's special box of most-treasured singles), and singing &quot;[[Andy Pandy]]&quot; in the style of a brassy soul number such as [[Wilson Pickett]] or [[Geno Washington]] might perform. In many shows he would do short impressions of [[Hughie Green]].

In one song on ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', Oddie performed &quot;[[What a Wonderful World]]&quot; with a voice fully reminiscent of [[Louis Armstrong]].  During the course of the song, the rest of the cast attributed the gravelly quality of his voice to a sore throat. In the background, during the rest of the song, it is possible to hear the cast dispense cough medicine, then call for a doctor, the arrival of the doctor and his decision that Oddie should go into hospital, the trip to hospital in an ambulance, and the operation extracting his tonsils. After this, the sound of his voice changed to a sound closer to that of [[Harry Secombe]]. He thanked the cast for curing him. On television Oddie was co-writer and performer in the comedy series ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]]. Later, he was co-writer and performer in the comedy series ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] and [[Graeme Garden]], for which Oddie became a cast member for the second series.

Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden then co-wrote and appeared in their television comedy series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''. The Goodies also released records, including &quot;Father Christmas Do Not Touch Me&quot;/&quot;The In-Betweenies&quot;, &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;, and &quot;Black Pudding Bertha&quot;, which were hit singles in 1974-75. They reformed, briefly, in 2005, for a successful 13-date tour of Australia.

Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden voiced characters on the 1983 animated children's programme ''[[Bananaman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.80scartoons.co.uk/bananaman2.php &quot;Bananaman&quot; – 80s Cartoons]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/b/banaman.htm &quot;Bananaman – International Hero]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnnorrisbrown.com/classic-nick/bananaman/index.htm &quot;Bananaman&quot; – Classic Nick Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Amnesty International show, ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden sang their hit song &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;. They also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with the song. Together with [[Graeme Garden|Garden]] (who is a qualified doctor), Oddie co-wrote many episodes of the television comedy series ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'', including most of the first season and all of the second season. He has occasionally appeared on the BBC Radio 4 panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', on which Garden and Brooke-Taylor are regular panellists. In 1982 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a 6-part science fiction sitcom called ''[[Astronauts (television)|Astronauts]]'' for [[Central Independent Television|Central]] and [[ITV]]. The show was set in an international [[space station]] in the near future. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Natural history===

Oddie's first published work was an article about the birdlife of Birmingham's [[Bartley Reservoir]] in the [[West Midland Bird Club]]'s 1962 Annual Report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oddie-1963&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oddie|first=W.E.|date=1963-07|title=Birds in the Bartley Reservoir Area, 1931-1962 (Part I)|journal=The West Midland Bird Report, 1962|publisher=[[West Midland Bird Club]]|location=Birmingham|volume=29|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/archive/bartley-62.htm|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since written a number of books about birds and birdwatching, as well as articles for many specialist publications including [[British Birds (Magazine)|''British Birds'']], ''Birdwatching Magazine'' and ''[[Birdwatch]]''.

One of Oddie's first forays in the world of television natural history was on 30 July 1986, as the subject of a ''Nature Watch Special: Bill Oddie - Bird Watcher'', in which he was interviewed by [[Julian Pettifer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Choice&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://web6.infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/359/357/47201865w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS486772990&amp;dyn=21!nxt_4_0_CS486772990?sw_aep=bclib|title=Choice (Today's Television Programmes)|last=Lawson|first=Mark|date=30 July 1985|work=The Times |location=UK |pages=29|accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oddie has since hosted a number of successful nature programmes for the BBC, many produced by [[Stephen Moss]], including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1166900/credits.html|title=Bill Oddie: Film &amp; TV Credits|publisher=www.screenonline.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its first evening of broadcast in 2004, ''Britain Goes Wild'' set a record for its timeslot of 8&amp;nbsp;pm on [[BBC Two]] of 3.4&amp;nbsp;million viewers, one million more than the [[Channel 4]] programme showing at that time. ''Britain Goes Wild'', renamed ''Springwatch'' the following year, became a wildlife broadcasting phenomenon, attracting up to 5&amp;nbsp;million viewers. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

He became president of the [[West Midland Bird Club]] in 1999,&lt;ref name=&quot;WMBC-chrono&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/chrono#C1990s|title=West Midland Bird Club: Chronology|publisher=West Midland Bird Club|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been Vice-President since 1991,&lt;ref name=&quot;WMBC-chrono&quot; /&gt; and is a former member of the council of the [[RSPB]]. Oddie is also a vice-president of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and a vice-president of the [[BTCV|British Trust for Conservation Volunteers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.btcv.org.uk/display/whoweare#ppvp BTCV - Who we are]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Oddie set up a [[marathon|half-marathon]] to raise money for various wildlife charities in his birth-town of Rochdale. Celebrities who have participated in the event include [[Ray Mears]], [[Catherine Jenkins]] and [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]].

In 2011, Oddie featured as an investigator in ''Snares Uncovered: killers in the countryside''.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.onekind.org/take_action/campaigns/snare_free/snares_uncovered/ &lt;/ref&gt; The film carried out an expose of snaring in Scotland and was commissioned by animal protection charity [[OneKind]]. During the investigation, Oddie discovered over 70 snare traps and several stink pits.

===Music===
In the 1960s and early 1970s, Oddie released a number of singles and at least one album. One of the former, issued in 1970 on [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]] label (Catalogue No: 4786), was ''[[On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=222302|title=eil.com|publisher=eil.com|accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed in the style of [[Joe Cocker]]'s ''[[With a Little Help from my Friends]]''. The B-side, ''Harry Krishna'', featured the [[Hare Krishna]] chant, substituting the names of contemporary famous people called Harry, including [[Harry Secombe]], [[Harry Worth]], [[Harry Lauder]], and [[Harry Corbett]], as well as [[pun]]s such as &quot;Harry [Hurry] along now&quot;, &quot;Harrystotle [Aristotle]&quot; and ending with &quot;Harry-ly [I really] must go now&quot;. Both tracks appear on the compilation CD ''Life Too, Has Surface Noise: The Complete Dandelion Records Singles Collection 1969–1972'' (2007).

He played the drums and [[saxophone]] and appeared as Cousin Kevin in a production of [[The Who]]'s rock opera ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' at the [[Rainbow Theatre]], [[Finsbury Park, London]] on 9 December 1972. He has also contributed vocals to a [[Rick Wakeman]] album, ''Criminal Record''.

Oddie took part in the [[English National Opera]] production of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]] ''[[The Mikado]]'', in which he appeared in the role of the &quot;Lord High Executioner&quot;, taking over the role from [[Eric Idle]]. During the early 1990s, Oddie was a DJ for London-based [[jazz]] radio station [[102.2 Jazz FM]], but was dismissed after criticising the management on air after they told him he was playing too much jazz on his show.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 2007 Oddie appeared on the BBC series ''[[Play It Again]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/playitagain/programmes/series1/billoddie|title=Play It Again: Bill Oddie grapples with the electric guitar|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode he attempts to realise his dream of becoming a [[rock guitarist]]. Initially teacher [[Bridget Mermikides]] tries to teach him using traditional methods but he rebels: instead he turns to old friends [[Albert Lee]], [[Dave Davies]] (of [[The Kinks]]) and [[Mark Knopfler]] for advice and strikes out on his own. He succeeds in the target of playing lead guitar for his daughter Rosie's band at her 21st birthday party, and even manages to impress his erstwhile teacher.

In November 2010, he agreed, along with fellow members of [[The Goodies]], to re-release their 1970s hit The Funky Gibbon to raise funds for the [[International Primate Protection League]]'s Save the Gibbon appeal.

===Other television and audio appearances===
Oddie appeared as the hapless window cleaner in the [[Eric Sykes]]' comedy story ''[[The Plank (1967 film)|The Plank]]'' in 1967. He also presented the live children's Saturday morning entertainment show ''[[Saturday Banana]]'' ([[ITV]]/[[Southern Television]]) during the late 1970s. In the late 1980s he was a presenter of the BBC TV show ''[[Fax (TV show)|Fax]]'' (a show about 'facts').

In the 1990s he became better known as a presenter of birdwatching, and later wildlife-related, programmes such as ''[[Springwatch]]''.  Although he remains almost unknown to US audiences, in 1992 he was a guest star in the US comedy television series ''[[Married with Children]]'' for a 3-part episode set in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/m/marriedwithchild_1299002005.shtml &quot;Married...With Children.&quot;] – BBC Guide to Comedy (Retrieved on: 30 July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997-98 he appeared on the [[Channel 4]] archaeological programme ''[[Time Team]]'', as the team excavated a Roman villa site in [[Turkdean]], Gloucestershire.

He was the compère of a daytime BBC [[gameshow]], ''[[History Hunt]]'' (in 2003); and has appeared in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' audio drama ''[[Doctor Who and the Pirates]]''.  In 2004, he appeared in the BBC show ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', in which he looked into his ancestry – he was visibly moved by its revelations. In 2005, he took part in ''[[Rolf on Art]]'' – the big event at Trafalgar Square.

In 2006 Oddie appeared in the BBC show ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article2636212.ece &quot;Jupitus comments on Oddie's appearance on 'Never Mind The Buzzcocks'&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and also appeared on the topical quiz show ''[[8 out of 10 Cats]]''.  Bill also is the voice behind many ''[[B&amp;Q]]'' adverts throughout 2006/2007.  On 25 May 2007, Oddie made a [[cameo appearance]] on [[Ronni Ancona]]'s new comedy [[sketch show]], ''[[Ronni Ancona &amp; Co]]''.

He hosted the [[genealogy]]-based series ''[[My Famous Family]]'', broadcast on [[UKTV History]] in 2007. In 2008, Oddie was a guest on [[Jamie Oliver]]'s television special ''Jamie's Fowl Dinners'', talking about free-range chickens. He also recorded a voice for Lionhead Studios' ''Fable II''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Oddie is married to Laura Beaumont&lt;ref&gt;Camden marriage register 1983 Jul–Sep vol.14 p1900&lt;/ref&gt; (Beaumont-Gilles),&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Camden birth register 1985 Nov vol. 14 p1828&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he has worked on a variety of projects for children, including film scripts, drama and comedy series, puppet shows and books. They have a daughter, Rosie (born 30 October 1985),&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1048416/My-Oddie-life-The-troubled-times-Wildlife-Bill.html |title=My very Oddie life: the troubled times of Wildlife Bill |work=The Daily Mail |location=UK |date=29 August 2008 | location=London}} (mentions Rosie's birth &quot;the night before Halloween&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; and live in [[Hampstead]], London.

Oddie also has two daughters from his first marriage (1967 to Jean Hart):&lt;ref&gt;Hampstead marriage register 1967 Oct–-Dec vol. 5b p1372&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnie, and the actress [[Kate Hardie]], plus three grandchildren, Lyle, Ella and Gracie.

===Depression===
Oddie has suffered from [[Mood disorder|depression]] for most of his life, being diagnosed with clinical depression in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1885499,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | accessdate=26 April 2010 | title=I couldn't move.

His agent David Foster said: &quot;Bill gets these bouts every two or three years where he gets down for about two weeks and recovers.

He said that he was dealing with depression and [[bipolar disorder]], describing the period as &quot;probably the worst 12 months of my life&quot;. Oddie stated that he was planning to meet with BBC executives to discuss his return to television work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8448164.stm |title=Bill Oddie speaks about his depression battle |publisher=BBC News |date=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1241338/Bill-Oddie-reveals-feared-depression-kill-worst-12-months-life.html |title=Bill Oddie feared depression would kill him after 'the worst 12 months of my life' |work=The Daily Mail |location=UK |first=Georgina |last=Littlejohn |date=8 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His illness meant that he did not appear in the 2009 and 2010 seasons of ''Springwatch'', although he made a guest appearance in the penultimate episode of the latter.

==Honours==
In 2001, Oddie became the third person to decline to appear on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]''. He changed his mind a few hours later and agreed to appear on the show. On 16 October 2003, Oddie was made an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his service to Wildlife Conservation in a ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]]. He played down the event, choosing to wear a camouflage shirt and crumpled jacket to receive his medal. In June 2004, Oddie and [[Johnny Morris]] were jointly profiled in the first of a three part [[BBC Two]] series, ''[[The Way We Went Wild]]'', about television wildlife presenters. In May 2005, he received the [[British Naturalists' Association]]'s [[Peter Scott]] Memorial Award, from BNA president [[David Bellamy]], &quot;in recognition of his great contribution to our understanding of natural history and conservation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=144823] Bill Oddie to receive Peter Scott Memorial Award&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2009, he was proposed for inclusion in the [[Birmingham Walk of Stars]], with the public invited to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkofstars.net/?cat=1|title=Vote for Stars|date=30 June 2009|accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the fictional world of comedy character [[Alan Partridge]], Oddie is an unseen presence in Alan's life.

He has also been referenced, often humorously, by the hosts of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV Series)|Top Gear]]''. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] even used a mask with Bill Oddie's face to escape speed cameras while racing the [[Nissan GT-R]] against the Bullet train in Japan in the 4th episode of Top Gear's 11th series. James May also raced in Finland against a Bill Oddie lookalike, who won the race.

In the BBC comedy ''How Not To Live Your Life'', main character Don Danbury is frequently referred to as Bill Oddie by a group of teenagers, because he is &quot;old and watches birds all day&quot;.

In the second episode of the SKY series ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'', where he goes to see the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[India]], [[Karl Pilkington]] meets a yogi at a religious festival that reminds him of Bill Oddie.

[[Image:Bway.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A view of Broadway in 1909]]

'''Broadway''' is a wide avenue in [[New York City]], which runs the full length of [[Manhattan]] and continues into northern [[Westchester County]].&lt;ref&gt;There are four other streets named &quot;Broadway&quot; in New York City's remaining three boroughs: one each in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Staten Island]], and two in [[Queens]] (one running from [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] to [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], and the other in [[Hamilton Beach, Queens|Hamilton Beach]]).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest north–south main thoroughfare in the city, dating to the first [[New Amsterdam]] settlement. The name ''Broadway'' is the [[English language|English]] literal translation of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name, ''Breede weg''. A stretch of Broadway is famous as the heart of the [[Broadway theater|American theater industry]].

== History ==
[[Image:Broadway-1885-APL.jpeg|thumb|left|In 1885 the Broadway commercial district was overrun with telephone, telegraph, and electrical lines. This view was north from Cortlandt and [[Maiden Lane (Manhattan)|Maiden Lane]].]]
Broadway was originally the Wickquasgeck Trail, carved into the brush destination of Manhattan by its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Streets Where History Lives |first=Russell |last=Shorto|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E5DD1F3BF93AA35751C0A9629C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 9, 2004 |accessdate=2008-04-04 |quote=And what about a marker for the Wickquasgeck Trail, the Indian path that ran the length of the island, which the Dutch made into their main highway and the English renamed Broadway?
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trail originally snaked through swamps and rocks along the length of Manhattan Island. Upon the arrival of the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]], the trail soon became the main road through the island from ''Nieuw Amsterdam'' at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur [[David de Vries]] gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 (&quot;the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily&quot;). The Dutch named the road &quot;''Heerestraat''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Epic of New York City |author=Ellis, Edward Robb |publisher=Old Town Books |year=1966 |pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-eighteenth century, part of Broadway in what is now lower Manhattan was known as ''Great George Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City Notes of 1774 Up for Redemption |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2061EF93A5A107A93C4A9178BD95F418385F9 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 6, 1935 |page=N1 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, Broadway ended at the town commons north of Wall Street, where [[Eastern Post Road]] continued through the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] and Bloomingdale Road the west side of the island. In the late 19th century the widened and paved part of Bloomingdale Road north of Columbus Circle was called &quot;The Boulevard&quot; but on February 14, 1899 the name &quot;Broadway&quot; was extended to the whole old road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ny1.com/6-bronx-news-content/features/4215/february-14th-in-nyc-history February 14th in NYC History: 1899], referred to as &quot;the 'Western' Boulevard&quot;; called &quot;the 'Grand' Boulevard&quot; in ''The New York Times'', February 1869, quoted in Michael V. Susi, ''The Upper West Side'' &quot;Introduction&quot;, 2009:7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Route ==
{{See also|U.S. Route 9 in New York}}
[[File:Proposed arcarde railway broadway NY 1868.jpg|thumb|Plan of 1868 for an &quot;arcade railway&quot;.]]

Broadway runs the length of Manhattan Island, from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] at the south, to [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] at the northern tip of the island. South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street.  Starting in 2009, vehicular traffic is banned at [[Times Square]] between 47th and 42nd Streets, and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians.  From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].  [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway through its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].

Because Broadway is a true north–south route that parallels the [[Hudson River]] and precedes the grid that the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] imposed on the island, Broadway diagonally crosses Manhattan, its intersections with avenues marked by &quot;[[town square|squares]]&quot; (some merely triangular slivers of open space) that have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].
[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|left|thumb|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]
The section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the &quot;[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]&quot; during such events. West of Broadway as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area and the Hudson shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[TriBeCa]] and [[Battery Park City]].

Broadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place (Manhattan)|Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]]. A bend in front of [[Grace Church, New York|Grace Church]] allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.

At [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner. Union Square is the only location wherein Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan.

At [[Madison Square]], location of the [[Flatiron Building]], Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]].

At [[Herald Square]], Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (the Avenue of the Americas). [[Macy's]] Department Store is located on the western corner of Herald Square; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.
[[Image:Broadway 38th Street at dus.jpg|thumb|upright|Broadway and 38th Street]]
One famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theater|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the Theater District or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline &quot;Found on the Great White Way&quot; in the February 3, 1902 edition of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic [[sobriquet]] was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area.

After becoming New York's de facto [[Red-light district|Red Light District]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.  Until June 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'', from which the Square gets its name, was published at offices at 239 West 43rd Street; the paper stopped printing papers there on June 15, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Copy! |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/weekinreview/10dunlap.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 10, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-10 |quote=The sound is muffled by wall-to-wall carpet tiles and fabric-lined cubicles. But it’s still there, embedded in the concrete and steel sinews of the old factory at 229 West 43rd Street, where The New York Times was written and edited yesterday for the last time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the southwest corner of [[Central Park]], Broadway crosses [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] at [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]]; on the site of the former [[New York Coliseum]] convention center is the new shopping center at the foot of the [[Time Warner Center]], headquarters of [[Time Warner]].

North of [[Columbus Circle]], Broadway retains planted [[median (road)|center islands]] as a vestige of the central mall of &quot;The Boulevard&quot; that became the spine of the [[Upper West Side]].

At the intersection of [[Columbus Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] and West 65th Street, Broadway passes by the [[Juilliard School]] and [[Lincoln Center]], both well-known performing arts landmarks, as well as a [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (the Mormon or LDS Church), known as the [[Manhattan New York Temple]].

At the intersection with 72nd street, the triangle of tiny [[Verdi Square]] is surrounded by several notable apartment buildings, including [[The Ansonia]], and the Florentine palazzo occupied by [[Apple Bank for Savings]].

At its intersection with 78th Street, Broadway shifts direction, to continue directly uptown aligned approximately with the Commissioners' grid. Past the bend are [[The Apthorp]] and the [[First Baptist Church in the City of New York]] (1891), built for a Baptist congregation in New York since 1762. The road heads north passing such important apartment houses as  [[The Belnord]], the [[Astor Court Building]], and the [[Art nouveau]] [[The Cornwall|Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;Horsley, Carter B. [http://www.thecityreview.com/uws/bway/cornwall.html &quot;The Cornwall&quot;] ''City Review''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AIA4}} p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

At 99th Street Broadway passes between the controversial skyscrapers of [[The Ariel]] East and West.

At 107th Street Broadway intersects with [[West End Avenue‎]] to form [[Straus Park]] with its Titanic Memorial by [[Augustus Lukeman]].

[[Image:Broadway in Inwood.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Broadway at Dyckman Street in Inwood]]
Further north, Broadway follows the old Bloomingdale Road as the main spine of the [[Upper West Side]], passing the campus of [[Columbia University]] at [[116th Street]] in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]], in part on the tract that housed the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum|Bloomingdale (Lunatic) Asylum]] from 1808 until it moved to [[Westchester County]] in 1894. Still in Morningside Heights, Broadway passes the handsome, park-like campus of [[Barnard College]]. Next, the beautiful Gothic quadrangle of [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] and the brick buildings of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] with their beautifully landscaped interior courtyards face one another across Broadway. On the next block is the [[Manhattan School of Music]]. Broadway then runs past the proposed uptown campus of Columbia University, and the main campus of [[City College of New York|CUNY—City College]]; the beautiful Gothic buildings of the original City College campus are out of sight, a block to the east. Also to the east are the handsome brownstones of Hamilton Heights.

Broadway achieves a verdant, park-like effect, particularly in the spring, when it runs between the uptown [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] and the former Trinity Chapel, now the [[Church of the Intercession, New York]] near 155th Street. The springtime plantings in the median, maintained by [[Trinity Church, New York|Trinity Church]], are spectacular.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]] lies on Broadway near 166th, 167th, and 168th Streets in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. At this point, Broadway becomes part of [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]]. The intersection with [[Saint Nicholas Avenue (Manhattan)|Saint Nicholas Avenue]] at 167th Street forms [[Mitchell Square Park]].

Broadway crosses the [[Harlem River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] to [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] and then enters [[The Bronx]], where it is the eastern border of [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and the western border of [[Van Cortlandt Park]]. After leaving New York City, it is the main north–south street of western [[Yonkers, New York]], before becoming [[Albany Post Road]] at the northern border of [[Tarrytown, New York]].

== Public transit ==
From south to north, Broadway at one point or another runs over or under the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]], the [[BMT Broadway Line]], the [[IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line]], and the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]]:

* The IRT Lexington Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]] to [[Fulton Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] ({{NYCS Lexington south}} trains).
* The BMT Broadway Line runs under it from [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]] to [[Times Square – 42nd Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Times Square – 42nd Street]] ({{NYCS Broadway}} trains).
* The IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line runs under and over Broadway from [[Times Square – 42nd Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square]] to [[168th Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|168th Street]] ({{NYCS Broadway-Seventh}} trains), and from 218th Street to its terminal in [[the Bronx]] at [[Van Cortlandt Park – 242nd Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|Van Cortlandt Park – 242nd Street]] ({{NYCS Broadway-Seventh north local}} train).
* The northern portion of the IND Eighth Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Dyckman Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Dyckman Street]] to [[Inwood – 207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Inwood – 207th Street]] ({{NYCS Eighth far north}} train).

Early [[street railway]]s on Broadway included the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's Broadway and University Place Line (1864?) between [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] ([[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]) and [[Times Square]] ([[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]), the Ninth Avenue Railroad's [[Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues Line]] (1884) between 65th Street and 71st Street, the Forty-second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway's [[Broadway Branch Line]] (1885?) between Times Square and [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]], and the Kingsbridge Railway's Kingsbridge Line&lt;!--when?--&gt; north of 169th Street. The Broadway Surface Railroad's [[Broadway Line (Lower Manhattan surface)|Broadway Line]], a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] line, opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became the core of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]], with two cable branches: the [[Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line]] and [[Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line]].

These streetcar lines were replaced with [[bus route]]s in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along it were the [[New York City Omnibus Company]]'s (NYCO) [[6 (NYCO)|6]] (Broadway below Times Square), [[7 (NYCO)|7]] (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and [[11 (NYCO)|11]] (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the [[Surface Transportation Corporation]]'s [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]] (Kingsbridge) and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]] (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company]]'s (FACCo) [[4 (FACCo)|4]] and [[5 (FACCo)|5]] used Broadway from [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]] north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and [[6 (FACCo)|6]] used Broadway between [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] and [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]]. With the implementation of one-way traffic, the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].

As of 2007, Broadway is now served by the [[M1 (New York City bus)|M1]] (used [[Lafayette Street (Manhattan)|Lafayette Street]] until that became one-way), [[M4 (New York City bus)|M4]] (ex-FACCo 4), [[M5 (New York City bus)|M5]] (ex-FACCo 5), [[M7 (New York City bus)|M7]] (ex-NYCO 7), [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]], and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]]. Other routes that use part of Broadway include the [[M10 (New York City bus)|M10]], [[M20 (New York City bus)|M20]], [[M60 (New York City bus)|M60]], [[Bx7 (New York City bus)|Bx7]], and [[Bx20 (New York City bus)|Bx20]].

'''''Canyon of Heroes''''' is occasionally used to refer to the section of lower Broadway in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] that is the location of the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s.

The traditional route of the parade is northward from [[Bowling Green (Manhattan)|Bowling Green]] to [[City Hall Park, Manhattan|City Hall Park]]. Most of the route is lined with tall office buildings along both sides, affording a view of the parade for thousands of office workers who create the snowstorm-like jettison of shredded paper products that characterize the parade.

While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the [[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] parade on August 14 and August 15, 1945 – marking the end of [[World War II]] – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the [[New York City Department of Sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Q &amp; A: Today’s Giants Ticker-Tape Parade  |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/q-a-todays-giants-ticker-tape-parade/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Super Bowl-Winning Giants Get Canyon of Heroes Honor |first=Fernanda |last=Santos |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/nyregion/11bloomberg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-04 |quote=The plaque is one of the more than 200 granite strips in a route known as the Canyon of Heroes, marking those who have been honored by the city with ticker-tape parades.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent parade in the Canyon of Heroes was on November 6, 2009 for the [[New York Yankees]] in honor of their 27th [[2009 World Series|World Series]] Championship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yankeeparaderoute.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Great White Way ==

[[Image:broadway sign1.jpg|right|thumb|Broadway]]

'''''Great [[White Way]]''''' is a nickname for a section of Broadway in the [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] section of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]], specifically the portion that encompasses the [[Broadway theatre|Theatre District]], between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]] and [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Streets]], and encompassing [[Times Square]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1880, a stretch of Broadway between [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] and [[Madison Square]] was illuminated in 1880 by [[Charles F. Brush|Brush]] [[arc lamp]]s, making it among the first electrically-lighted streets in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.1063&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, the portion from [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] to [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] was so brightly illuiminated by electrical advertising signs, that people began calling it &quot;The Great White Way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.1066&lt;/ref&gt;  When the theatre district moved uptown, the name was transferred to the [[Times Square]] area.

The phrase ''Great White Way'' has been attributed to Shep Friedman, columnist for the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]'' in 1901, who lifted the term from the title of a book about the Arctic by [[Albert Paine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bloom&quot;&gt;Bloom, Ken. [http://books.google.com/books?id=GBiEO8q59f0C&amp;pg=PA499&amp;dq=%22great+white+way%22+Shep+Friedman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TDzQTNneAsKclgf-mOi9Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22great%20white%20way%22%20Shep%20Friedman&amp;f=false Broadway: its history, people, and places : an encyclopedia], p.499 (2003) (ISBN 978-0415937047)&lt;/ref&gt;  The headline &quot;Found on the Great White Way&quot; appeared in the February 3, 1902, edition of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York Evening Telegram]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloom&quot;/&gt;

A portrait of Broadway in the early part of the 20th century and &quot;The Great White Way&quot; late at night appeared in &quot;Artist In Manhattan&quot;(1940)&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Myers, Artist in Manhattan, New York: American Artists Group, Inc. 1940. &lt;/ref&gt; written by the painter-writer [[Jerome Myers]]. 
&quot;Early morn on Broadway, the same light that tips the mountain tops of the Colorado canyons gradually discloses the quiet anatomy, the bare skeletons of the huge iron signs that trellis the sky, now denuded of the attractions of the volcanic night. Almost lifeless, the tired entertainers of the night clubs and their friends straggle to their rooms, taximen compare notes and earnings, the vast street scene has had its curtain call, the play is over.

Dear old Broadway, for many years have I dwelt on your borders. I have known the quiet note of your dawn. Even earlier I would take my coffee at Martin's, at 54th Street–now, alas, vanished–where I would see creatures of the night life before they disappeared with the
dawn.

One night a celebrated female impersonator came to the restaurant in all his regalia, directly from a club across the street. Several taximen began to poke fun at him. Unable any longer to bear
their taunts, he got up and knocked all the taximen out cold. Then he went back to the club, only to lament under his bitter tears, &quot;See how they've ruined my dress!&quot;

Gone are the old-time Broadway oyster bars and chop houses that were the survivors of a tradition of their sporting patrons, the bon vivants of Manhattan. Gone are the days when the Hoffman House flourished on Madison Square, with its famous nudes by Bouguereau; when barrooms were palaces, on nearly every corner throughout the city; when [[Steve Brodie]], jumping from [[Brooklyn Bridge]], splashed the entire country with publicity; when Bowery concert halls dispensed schooners of beer for a nickel, with a stage show thrown in; when Theis's Music Hall still resounded on 14th Street with its great mechanical organ, the wonder of its day, a place of beauty, with fine paintings and free company and the frankest of female life. Across the street was [[Tammany Hall]], and next to it [[Tony Pastor]]'s, where stars of the stage were born. Tony himself, in dress clothes and top hat, sang his ballads, a gallant trouper introducing [[Lillian Russell]] and others to fame through his audience.&quot;

== Modern traffic flow ==
Broadway was once a [[two-way street]] for its entire length. The present status, in which it runs [[one-way]] southbound south of [[Columbus Circle]] ([[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]]), came about in several stages. On June 6, 1954, [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] became southbound and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and [[Times Square]] (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=7th and 8th Aves.

Since May 2009, the portions of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square have been closed entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, as part of a traffic and pedestrianization experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those lounging in temporary seating placed by the City.  The City decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010.  Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Traffic Experiment Gets Permanent Run |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/nyregion/12broadway.html |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bilinear transform''' (also known as '''[[Arnold Tustin|Tustin]]'s method''') is used in [[digital signal processing]] and discrete-time [[control theory]] to transform continuous-time system representations to discrete-time and vice versa.  

The bilinear transform is a special case of a [[conformal map]]ping (namely, the [[Möbius transformation]]), often used to convert a [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt; H_a(s) \ &lt;/math&gt; of a [[linear]], [[time-invariant]] ([[LTI system theory|LTI]]) filter in the [[continuous function|continuous]]-time domain (often called an [[analog filter]]) to a transfer function &lt;math&gt; H_d(z) \ &lt;/math&gt; of a linear, shift-invariant filter in the [[discrete signal|discrete]]-time domain (often called a [[digital filter]] although there are analog filters constructed with [[switched capacitor]]s that are discrete-time filters).   It maps positions on the &lt;math&gt; j \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; axis, &lt;math&gt; Re[s]=0 \ &lt;/math&gt;, in the [[s-plane]] to the [[unit circle]], &lt;math&gt; |z| = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, in the [[complex plane|z-plane]].  Other bilinear transforms can be used to warp the [[frequency response]] of any discrete-time linear system (for example to approximate the non-linear frequency resolution of the human auditory system) and are implementable in the discrete domain by replacing a system's unit delays &lt;math&gt; \left( z^{-1} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt; with first order [[all-pass filter]]s.

The transform preserves [[BIBO stability|stability]] and maps every point of the [[frequency response]] of the continuous-time filter, &lt;math&gt; H_a(j \omega_a) \ &lt;/math&gt; to a corresponding point in the frequency response of the discrete-time filter, &lt;math&gt; H_d(e^{j \omega_d T}) \ &lt;/math&gt; although to a somewhat different frequency, as shown in the [[#Frequency warping|Frequency warping]] section below.  This means that for every feature that one sees in the frequency response of the analog filter, there is a corresponding feature, with identical gain and phase shift, in the frequency response of the digital filter but, perhaps, at a somewhat different frequency.  This is barely noticeable at low frequencies but is quite evident at frequencies close to the [[Nyquist frequency]].

== Discrete-time approximation ==
The bilinear transform is a first-order approximation of the natural logarithm function that is an exact mapping of the z-plane to the s-plane.  When the [[Laplace transform]] is performed on a discrete-time signal (with each element of the discrete-time sequence attached to a correspondingly delayed [[Dirac delta function|unit impulse]]), the result is precisely the [[Z transform]] of the discrete-time sequence with the substitution of 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
z &amp;= e^{sT}   \\
  &amp;= \frac{e^{sT/2}}{e^{-sT/2}} \\
  &amp;\approx \frac{1 + s T / 2}{1 - s T / 2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; T \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[sample time]] (the reciprocal of the [[sampling frequency]]) of the discrete-time filter.  The above bilinear approximation can be solved for &lt;math&gt; s \ &lt;/math&gt; or a similar approximation for &lt;math&gt; s = (1/T) \ln(z) \  \ &lt;/math&gt; can be performed.

The inverse of this mapping (and its first-order bilinear approximation) is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s &amp;= \frac{1}{T} \ln(z)  \\
  &amp;= \frac{2}{T} \left[\frac{z-1}{z+1} + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^3  + \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^5  + \frac{1}{7} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^7 + \cdots \right] \\
  &amp;\approx  \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\
  &amp;=  \frac{2}{T} \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The bilinear transform essentially uses this first order approximation and substitutes into the continuous-time transfer function, &lt;math&gt; H_a(s) \ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s \leftarrow \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is

:&lt;math&gt;H_d(z) = H_a(s) \bigg|_{s = \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}}= H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right). \ &lt;/math&gt;

== Stability and minimum-phase property preserved ==
A continuous-time causal filter is [[BIBO stability|stable]] if the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its transfer function fall in the left half of the [[complex number|complex]] [[s-plane]].  A discrete-time causal filter is stable if the poles of its transfer function fall inside the [[unit circle]] in the  [[complex plane|complex z-plane]]. The bilinear transform maps the left half of the complex s-plane to the interior of the unit circle in the z-plane.  Thus filters designed in the continuous-time domain that are stable are converted to filters in the discrete-time domain that preserve that stability.

Likewise, a continuous-time filter is [[minimum-phase]] if the [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeros]] of its transfer function fall in the left half of the complex s-plane.  A discrete-time filter is minimum-phase if the zeros of its transfer function fall inside the unit circle in the complex z-plane.  Then the same mapping property assures that continuous-time filters that are minimum-phase are converted to discrete-time filters that preserve that property of being minimum-phase.

== Example ==
As an example take a simple [[low-pass]] [[RC filter]].  This continuous-time filter has a transfer function

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_a(s) &amp;= \frac{1/sC}{R+1/sC} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{1 + RC s}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If we wish to implement this filter as a digital filter, we can apply the bilinear transform by substituting for &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the formula above; after some reworking, we get the following filter representation:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_d(z) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; =H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1}\right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{1 + RC \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1}\right)} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1 + z}{(1 - 2 RC / T) + (1 + 2RC / T) z}. \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1 + z^{-1}}{(1 + 2RC / T) + (1 - 2RC / T) z^{-1}}. \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

The coefficients of the denominator are the 'feed-backward' coefficients and the coefficients of the numerator are the 'feed-forward' coefficients used to implement a real-time [[digital filter]].

== Frequency warping ==
To determine the frequency response of a continuous-time filter, the [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt; H_a(s) \ &lt;/math&gt; is evaluated at &lt;math&gt;s = j \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; which is on the &lt;math&gt; j \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; axis.  Likewise, to determine the frequency response of a discrete-time filter, the transfer function &lt;math&gt; H_d(z) \ &lt;/math&gt; is evaluated at &lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:+30%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;z = e^{ j \omega T} \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt; which is on the unit circle, &lt;math&gt; |z| = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;. When the actual frequency of &lt;math&gt; \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; is input to the discrete-time filter designed by use of the bilinear transform, it is desired to know at what frequency, &lt;math&gt; \omega_a \ &lt;/math&gt;, for the continuous-time filter that this &lt;math&gt; \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; is mapped to.

:&lt;math&gt;H_d(z) = H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1}\right) \ &lt;/math&gt;

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_d(e^{ j \omega}) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{e^{ j \omega} - 1}{e^{ j \omega} + 1}\right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{e^{j \omega/2} \left(e^{j \omega/2} - e^{-j \omega/2}\right)}{e^{j \omega/2} \left(e^{j \omega/2} + e^{-j \omega/2 }\right)}\right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{\left(e^{j \omega/2} - e^{-j \omega/2}\right)}{\left(e^{j \omega/2} + e^{-j \omega/2 }\right)}\right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left(j \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{ \left(e^{j \omega/2} - e^{-j \omega/2}\right) /(2j)}{\left(e^{j \omega/2} + e^{-j \omega/2 }\right) / 2}\right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left(j \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{ \sin(\omega/2) }{ \cos(\omega/2) }\right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left(j \frac{2}{T} \cdot \tan \left( \omega/2 \right) \right) \ &lt;/math&gt; 
|}

This shows that every point on the unit circle in the discrete-time filter z-plane, &lt;font style=&quot;vertical-align:+30%;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;z = e^{ j \omega} \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is mapped to a point on the &lt;math&gt;j \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; axis on the continuous-time filter s-plane, &lt;math&gt;s = j \omega_a \ &lt;/math&gt;. That is, the discrete-time to continuous-time frequency mapping of the bilinear transform is

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_a = \frac{2}{T} \tan \left( \omega \frac{T}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

and the inverse mapping is

:&lt;math&gt; \omega = 2 \arctan \left( \omega_a \frac{T}{2} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The discrete-time filter behaves at frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega \ &lt;/math&gt; the same way that the continuous-time filter behaves at frequency &lt;math&gt; (2/T) \tan(\omega T/2) \ &lt;/math&gt;.  Specifically, the gain and phase shift that the discrete-time filter has at frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega \ &lt;/math&gt; is the same gain and phase shift that the continuous-time filter has at frequency &lt;math&gt; (2/T) \tan(\omega T/2) \ &lt;/math&gt;.  This means that every feature, every &quot;bump&quot; that is visible in the frequency response of the continuous-time filter is also visible in the discrete-time filter, but at a different frequency.  For low frequencies (that is, when &lt;math&gt;\omega \ll 2/T&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\omega_a \ll 2/T&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\omega \approx \omega_a \ &lt;/math&gt;.

One can see that the entire continuous frequency range

: &lt;math&gt; -\infty &lt; \omega_a &lt; +\infty \ &lt;/math&gt;

is mapped onto the fundamental frequency interval

: &lt;math&gt; -\frac{\pi}{T} &lt; \omega &lt; +\frac{\pi}{T}. \ &lt;/math&gt;

The continuous-time filter frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega_a = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the discrete-time filter frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; and the continuous-time filter frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega_a = \pm \infty \ &lt;/math&gt; correspond to the discrete-time filter frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega = \pm \pi / T. \ &lt;/math&gt;

One can also see that there is a nonlinear relationship between &lt;math&gt; \omega_a \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega. \ &lt;/math&gt;  This effect of the bilinear transform is called '''''frequency warping'''''. The continuous-time filter can be designed to compensate for this frequency warping by setting &lt;math&gt; \omega_a = \frac{2}{T} \tan \left( \omega \frac{T}{2} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt; for every frequency specification that the designer has control over (such as corner frequency or center frequency).  This is called '''''pre-warping''''' the filter design.

The main advantage of the warping phenomenon is the absence of aliasing distortion of the frequency response characteristic, such as observed with [[Impulse invariance]].  It is necessary, however, to compensate for the frequency warping by pre-warping the given frequency specifications of the continuous-time system.  These pre-warped specifications may then be used in the bilinear transform to obtain the desired discrete-time system.

'''Brian Anthony Boitano''' (born October 22, 1963) is an [[United States|American]] [[Figure skating|figure skater]] from [[Sunnyvale, California]]. He is the [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Olympic champion]], the 1986 and 1988 [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Champion]], and the 1985-1988 [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. National Champion]]. He turned professional following the 1988 season. He returned to competition in 1993 and competed at the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], where he placed sixth.

==Personal life==
Brian Boitano was born in [[Mountain View, California]] and now lives in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/18/DDID197KN3.DTL|title=Skater Brian Boitano is cooking up a storm|first=Janny|last=Hu|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boitano is a graduate of Ryan Falco High School in Sunnyvale, California.&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;[http://www.scu.k12.ca.us/news_and_events/hall_of_fame.htm Who’s Who in Santa Clara Unified?], accessed September 6, 2006. {{Wayback | url=http://www.scu.k12.ca.us/news_and_events/hall_of_fame.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | date=20060928172615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figure skating career==
===Early career===
Brian Boitano first made his mark on the international scene when he won the bronze medal at the 1978 [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships]], beating future rival [[Brian Orser]] for that medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith  |first=Beverley  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A Year in Figure Skating  |year=1997 |publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart  |location= |isbn=0771027559  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Boitano became the first American to land a [[Axel jump|triple axel]]. In 1987, he introduced his signature jump, the 'Tano triple [[lutz jump|lutz]]' in which the skater raises his left arm above his head. He attempted a quadruple jump throughout the 1986-87 season and at the 1988 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], but did not cleanly land the jump; he double-footed the landing on two occasions.

Boitano was known primarily as a jumper early in his career and he, along with several other skaters, helped push the technical envelope of men's skating. It was not until his failure to defend his World title in 1987 that he focused specifically on improving his artistry.

Boitano placed second at the 1984 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], earning himself a trip to the [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. He placed 5th at the Olympics, setting the stage for the next four years.

===World Champion===
Following the 1984 Olympics, several skaters emerged as likely medal hopes following the retirement of [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]].

Boitano won the 1985 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], the first of his four titles. At the first World Championships of the post-Hamilton era in 1985, [[Alexander Fadeev (figure skater)|Alexander Fadeev]] won, with [[Brian Orser]] finishing 2nd and Boitano 3rd. At the 1986 World Championships, Boitano took the title, while Fadeev had a disastrous free skate despite having been in an excellent position to win; Orser finished 2nd once again.

During the 1986-87 season, Boitano had introduced two new elements to his programs: the 'Tano triple [[lutz jump|lutz]] and a quadruple [[toe loop jump|toe loop]], although he never succeeded in landing a clean quadruple jump in competition. The 1987 World Championships were held in [[Cincinnati]], giving defending World champion Boitano a home-field advantage. The outcome of the event would set the tone for the 1988 Olympics. At Worlds, Boitano fell on his quadruple toe loop attempt and placed second.

After losing the world title to Orser at home, Boitano and his coach [[Linda Leaver]] decided that some changes needed to be made if Boitano was to become the Olympic champion.&lt;ref name=&quot;passiontoskate&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bezic  |first=Sandra  |authorlink=Sandra Bezic |coauthors=[[David Hayes|Hayes, David]] |title=The Passion to Skate: An Intimate View of Figure Skating  |year=1998 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub  |location= |isbn=0836264525  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boitano had always been good at the technical requirements (&quot;The first mark&quot;), but he was weak on the artistic (&quot;the second mark&quot;). He was a self-described &quot;jumping robot&quot;. In order to help his growth as an artist, he hired choreographer [[Sandra Bezic]] to choreograph his programs for the 1987-1988 Olympic season.&lt;ref name=&quot;passiontoskate&quot; /&gt;

Bezic choreographed two programs that featured clean lines and accentuated the skating abilities of the 5' 11&quot; Boitano.&lt;ref name=&quot;passiontoskate&quot; /&gt;  The short program was based on [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ballet ''Les Patineurs'' in which Boitano plays a cocky young man showing off his tricks, using movements dating back to the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;passiontoskate&quot; /&gt; In one famous moment, Boitano wipes ice shavings, also called snow, off his skate blade and tosses it over his shoulder after landing a triple axel combination. The free skating program was based on the film score, ''Napoleon'', detailing various phases of a soldier's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;passiontoskate&quot; /&gt;

Boitano debuted his new programs at 1987 [[Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]], held in the [[Saddledome]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada, the same venue in which he would compete against Brian Orser for the Olympic title three months later. Boitano's new programs were received with standing ovations by the audience. Although Orser won the competition, Boitano skated clean, landing seven triple jumps, including a footwork section into a jump. Boitano, Leaver, and Bezic were so confident about the strength of Boitano's new programs that they omitted the quadruple toe loop, which if landed, could have put him a shoulder above Orser in technical merit.

The short program at the 1988 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]] proved to be a highlight. Boitano received marks of 6.0 from eight of the nine judges for presentation, the second mark. His free skate was flawed.&lt;ref name=&quot;passiontoskate&quot; /&gt; Due to delays, he did not skate until after midnight. Still, Boitano won the competition, and went into the Olympics as the national champion (U.S.), as did Orser (Canadian).

===1988 Olympics: Battle of the Brians===
{{Main|Battle of the Brians}}
Going into the Olympics, Boitano and [[Brian Orser]] each had won a World title and each had excellent, balanced repertoire, with Boitano being known as the slightly better technician and Orser as the better artist. Adding to the rivalry, Boitano and Orser were both performing military-themed programs. Boitano's was to the music of Napoleon.

The [[Battle of the Brians]] at the [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics]] was the highlight of Boitano's amateur career. Boitano and Orser were effectively tied going into the [[free skating]] portion of the event and whoever won that portion would win the event. [[Alexander Vladimirovich Fadeyev|Alexander Fadeev]] had won the [[compulsory figures]] section of the competition with Boitano second and Orser third. In the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]], Orser placed first and Boitano second. The [[free skating]] was, at the time, worth 50% of the score, and so Boitano's lead would not be enough to hold him in first place if he lost the free skate.

Boitano skated a clean, technically excellent long program, with eight triple jumps, two Axels, and a triple-triple combination. Orser made one small mistake on a jump and omitted his planned second triple axel. Boitano won the Battle in a 5-4 split. Boitano won the gold medal, wearing skates with American flag appliqués that are now part of the collections of the [[National Museum of American History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

Following the Olympics, both Orser and Boitano went to the World Championships, which Boitano won. Boitano turned professional soon after.

===Professional and return to amateur===
Following the Olympics, Boitano went on to dominate competitions in the professional ranks, winning 10 straight professional competitions, including 5 consecutive World Professional Championship titles and 4 consecutive wins at the Challenge of Champions. Boitano also appeared in ''Carmen on Ice'', for which he won an [[Emmy]]. However, Boitano wanted to return to amateur competition and make another run at the Olympics.

Boitano's lobby proved successful and in June 1993, the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) introduced a clause, commonly known as the &quot;Boitano rule&quot;, which allowed professionals to reinstate as &quot;amateur&quot; or &quot;eligible&quot; skaters. This had been the result of Boitano's active involvement during the early 1990s, which saw professionals being allowed in the Olympic Games in the sports of tennis and basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Boitano competed at the 1994 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], led after the short program, but lost to [[Scott Davis (figure skater)|Scott Davis]] in the long program in a 6-3 split decision. Boitano was named to the Olympic team. Going into the Olympics as a medal favorite in a strong field, Boitano missed his triple axel combination during the short program for the first time in his career. This mistake proved extremely costly, and knocked Boitano out of medal contention. He skated a good long program and finished 6th.

Boitano returned to the professional ranks afterwards. He was inducted into the [[World Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] and the [[United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] in 1996.

==Celebrity and popular culture career==
===What Would Brian Boitano Do?===
{{Main|What Would Brian Boitano Do?}}
A [[caricature]] of Boitano as a [[superhero]] appears as a semi-recurring character in the [[cartoon]] series ''[[South Park]]''. The movie ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' (1999), features a musical number titled &quot;[[What Would Brian Boitano Do?]]&quot;. Boitano also appears in a 1995 Christmas cartoon that was a prototype of South Park, entitled [[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]. The name of the song is a parody of the popular slogan [[What Would Jesus Do?]].

===Food Network show===
On August 23, 2009, [[Food Network]] debuted a new series entitled &quot;[[What Would Brian Boitano Make?]]&quot;, which borrows both its name and opening musical theme from the [[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]] song. The show features Boitano preparing meals for his friends. The series has been picked up for a ten-episode second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What Would Brian Boitano Make Picked Up for Another Season |url=http://www.eatmedaily.com/2009/11/what-would-brian-boitano-make-picked-up-for-another-season/ |work=EatMeDaily.com |date=November 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and film appearances===
* Boitano won an [[Emmy Award]] for his portrayal of Don Jose in ''[[Carmen on Ice]]''.
* An animated likeness of Boitano appears in the 1995 South Park short animated film, ''The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs Santa''.
* He was featured in the [[Super Bowl XXVI]] halftime show &quot;Winter Magic&quot; along with [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Dorothy Hamill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478281/ Super Bowl XXVI (1992) (TV)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Boitano had a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the 2007 film ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' as a world skating federation judge.
* He had a cameo in the 2005 Disney film, ''[[Ice Princess]]'', appearing as himself in a [[sports commentator|commentator]] role alongside fellow figure skater [[Michelle Kwan]], who also portrayed herself as a commentator during the Sectionals competition.
* He appeared on [[Giada at Home]] for one episode.
* He appeared on Fox Business Network's &quot;Stossel&quot;, episode &quot;Spontaneous Order&quot; 2/10/11

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Political scandals in the United Kingdom''' are commonly referred to by the press and commentators as &quot;''''sleaze'''&quot;.

==Sleaze==
A number of [[political scandal]]s in the 1980s and 1990s created the impression of what was described in the British press as &quot;sleaze&quot;: a perception that the then [[British Conservative Party|Conservative]] government was associated with [[political corruption]] and [[hypocrisy]]. This was revived in the late 1990s due to accounts of so-called &quot;sleaze&quot; by the Labour government.

===Conservative Party cash controversies===
In particular, the successful entrapment of [[Graham Riddick]] and [[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Tredinnick]] in the [[Cash-for-questions affair|&quot;cash for questions&quot; scandal]], the contemporaneous misconduct as a minister by [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] (who lost a consequent libel action against ''[[The Guardian]]''), and the convictions of former Cabinet member [[Jonathan Aitken]] and former party deputy chairman [[Jeffrey Archer]] for [[perjury]] in two separate cases leading to custodial sentences damaged the Conservatives' public reputation. Persistent rumours about the activities of the party treasurer [[Michael Ashcroft]] furthered this impression. At the same time, a series of revelations about the private lives of various Conservative politicians made the headlines.

===Back to Basics===
[[John Major]]'s [[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]] campaign backfired because of media focus on its moral aspects, where they exposed &quot;sleaze&quot; within the Conservative Party and, most damagingly, within the Cabinet itself. A number of ministers were then revealed to have committed sexual indiscretions, and Major was forced by media pressure to dismiss them. In September 2002 it was revealed that, prior to his promotion to the cabinet, Major had himself had a long-standing extramarital affair with a fellow MP, [[Edwina Currie]].

===Sleaze in the Labour Party===
Since their coming to power in 1997, controversies affecting the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] such as [[David Blunkett]]'s affair with [[The Spectator|Spectator]] editor [[Kimberly Fortier]] and financial scandals involving senior ministers and officials shifted the focus to sleaze within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. There was some perception that sleaze may be endemic in [[Politics of United Kingdom|British Politics]] as a whole.

Hayes had met [[Young Conservatives|Young Conservative]] Paul Stone at the 1991 Conservative conference and that same evening, &quot;committed a lewd act which was in breach of the law at the time&quot;. Stone had been 18 at the time, whilst the legal age for homosexual sex in 1991 was 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/back-to-basics-of-vaudeville-1282058.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Peter | last=Popham | title=Back to basics of vaudeville | date=7 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously supported [[Section 28]] and other anti-gay legislation.

* In 2002, [[Edwina Currie]] revealed that she had had an affair, beginning in 1984, with [[John Major]] before he became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].

* The [[Burrell affair]] - allegations about the behavior of the [[British Royal Family]] and their servants with possible constitutional implications. (2002)

The government was cleared of wrongdoing, while the BBC was strongly criticised by the subsequent inquiry, leading to the resignation of the BBC's chairman and director-general.
*In 2005, [[David McLetchie]], leader of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party|Conservative and Unionist Party]] is forced to resign after claiming the highest taxi expenses of any MSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McLetchie resigns as Tory leader |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4393622.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=31 October 2005 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included personal journeys, journeys related solely with his second job as a solicitor, and Conservative Party business, for example travel to Conservative conferences.

By resigning Laws became the shortest serving Minister in modern British political history with less than 18 days service as a Cabinet Minister.

==History==
[[Image:Bombardier (PSF).jpg|thumb|]]

[[Joseph-Armand Bombardier]] was a mechanic who dreamed of building a vehicle that could &quot;float on snow.&quot; In 1937, he designed and produced his first [[snowmobile]] in his small repair shop in [[Valcourt (city), Quebec|Valcourt, Quebec]].

Bombardier's technological breakthrough in the design of bush vehicles came in the mid-1930s when he developed a drive system that revolutionized travel in snow and swampy conditions. In 1937, Bombardier sold 12 snowmobiles—named the B7 and, in 1942, created l'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée company.

The first snowmobiles were large, multi-passenger vehicles designed to help people get around during the long winter months. Snowmobiles were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. His invention filled a very particular need in the region and soon business was booming. In 1941, Armand opened a large new factory in Valcourt. Then a major setback hit the growing business: the [[World War II|Second World War]] was well underway and the Canadian government issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. To keep his business going, Armand switched gears and developed vehicles for the military. After the war, Bombardier experienced another setback in his snowmobile business. In 1948, the Quebec government passed a law requiring all highways and local roads to be cleared of snow; the Bombardier company's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized specifically  for use on municipal sidewalks (replacing horse-drawn devices), then by making all-terrain vehicles for the mining, oil and forestry industries.

Of note, the machines had removable front skis that could be replaced with front wheels for use on paved or hard surfaces, thus providing greater utility to his large snowmobiles. Production of these machines evolved over time.  During 1951, the wooden bodies were replaced with sheet steel and these vehicles were powered by [[Chrysler]] flathead six-cylinder engines and 3-speed manual transmissions. In the 1960s, V-8 engines began to appear and during the 1969/70 production years, the standard round &quot;porthole&quot;-style windows were replaced with larger rectangular windows which allowed more interior light and made them feel less claustrophobic.  Following these changes came the switchover to more reliable [[Chrysler]] Industrial 318 engines with the automatic Loadflite transmissions. Production of these machines continued into the mid-1970s.

Bombardier dreamed of developing a fast, lightweight snowmobile that could carry one or two people. In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles, but by the end of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come onto the market. Bombardier resumed his efforts to build a &quot;miniature&quot; snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959.[[Image:BR100+sidea.jpg|thumb|right|Bombardier BR100+ Groomer, mid engine, hard cab model]]

The [[snowmobile|Ski-doo]] was originally called the &quot;Ski-Dog&quot; because Bombardier meant it to be a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By an accident, a painter misinterpreted the name and painted &quot;Ski-Doo&quot; on the first prototype. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The public soon discovered that speedy vehicles that could zoom over snow were a lot of fun. Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centred in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225 Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and move resources away from his all-terrain vehicles. He vividly remembered his earlier business setbacks that forced him to diversify. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products but still dominate the entire snowmobile industry.  The snowmobiles produced were of exceptional quality and performance, earning a better reputation than the rival [[Polaris Industries|Polaris]] and [[Arctic Cat]] brand of motosleds. In 1975 Bombardier completed the purchase of the [[Moto-Ski]] company.

On February 18, 1964, J. Armand Bombardier died of cancer at age 56. He left behind a thriving business, but also one that had been focused on one person. Armand dominated his company, overseeing all areas of operation. He controlled the small research department, making all the drawings himself. By the time of his death sales of the company had reached [[Canadian dollar|C$]]20 [[million]], which is the equivalent of C$160 million in 2004 dollars. The younger generation took over, led by Armand's sons and sons-in-law. The young team reorganized and decentralized the company, adopting modern business tactics. The company adopted the latest technological innovation—the computer—to handle inventory, accounts and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an incentive program was developed for sales staff.

In 1967, L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée was renamed '''Bombardier Limited''' and on January 23, 1969, the company went public, listing on the [[Montreal Exchange|Montreal]] and [[Toronto Stock Exchange|Toronto]] [[stock exchange]]s.

In 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectnorthstar.ca/northstarprimer/ch03s01.html Project North Star Restoration Primer – Sec. 3.1 Canadair]&lt;/ref&gt; Bombardier acquired [[Canadair]] after the Canadian government-owned aircraft manufacturing company had recorded the largest corporate loss in Canadian business history. Shortly thereafter, [[de Havilland Canada]] from Boeing, [[Short Brothers]] and [[Learjet]] operations were added. The aerospace arm now accounts for over half of the company's revenue.  Bombardier's most popular aircraft currently include its [[Dash 8]], [[Bombardier CRJ200|CRJ100/200/440]], and [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ700/900/1000]] lines of [[regional airliner]]s. It also manufactures the [[CL-415]] amphibious water-bomber, the [[Global Express]] and the [[Bombardier Challenger 600|Challenger]] business jet. [[Learjet]] continues to operate as a subsidiary of Bombardier and manufactures jets under the Learjet name.
Bombardier also manufactured the Olympic Torch for the [[2010 Winter Olympics Torch Relay]]

In 1970, Bombardier acquired the Viennese company Lohner-[[Rotax]], a manufacturer of snowmobile engines and tramways, and became involved with [[Rail transport|rail business]]. This section started to gain importance in the mid-1990s in the renaissance of [[tram]]ways or &quot;[[light rail|light-rail transit]]&quot;. Bombardier acquired the assets and designs of [[American Locomotive Company]]/[[Montreal Locomotive Works]], which continued in the [[locomotive]] business until 1985. In the Canadian market, they also acquired [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]]’s [[Thunder Bay]] facilities and [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation|UTDC]] (formerly of [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]).

In 2001, Bombardier  acquired [[Adtranz]] (DaimlerChrysler Rail Systems), a manufacturer of trains which were widely used throughout Germany and Great Britain. Bombardier was one of the companies which took over [[British Rail]]'s R&amp;D facilities after [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]] (the remainder largely being absorbed into [[AEA Technology]] and [[Alstom]]).

With the acquisition of [[ADtranz]] from DaimlerChrysler, Bombardier Transportation emerged as one of the largest manufacturers of railway rolling stock in the world.

===Financial services===
'''Bombardier Capital''' (BC) was the Bombardier division in charge of financial services.&lt;ref name=IB&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.informationbuilders.com/applications/bomb_bar.html | title= Information Builders.com: Bombardier Capital Drives ERP Efficiency | publisher = Information Builders | accessdate = 2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1973, when it was based in [[Colchester, Vermont]],&lt;ref name=TU&gt;{{cite news | title = Jacksonville's Bombardier Capital cuts hundreds of jobs | date = September 27, 2001 | accessdate = 2009-02-22 | work = Florida Times-Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; it offered financial services such as lending, leasing, and asset-management throughout the Americas. In 2001, BC restricted its loan activity to existing customers.&lt;ref name=IB/&gt; The company, which began transitioning some services to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] in 1997,&lt;ref name=TU/&gt; ceased taking on new consumer loans in 2001, focusing instead on loans to retailers and gradually downsizing.&lt;ref name=TU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Bennett | first = Jane | title = Bombardier reduces space | date = October 4, 2002 | work= Jacksonville Business Journal | accessdate = 2009-02-22 | url = http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2002/10/07/story5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, Bombardier's credit evaluation was downgraded by [[Moody's]] from &quot;moderate credit risk&quot; (Baa3) to &quot;questionable credit quality&quot; (Ba2), a below [[investment grade]] rating which impacted Bombardier Capital, although the company's transportation division was unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Jelter | first = Jim | title = Moody's downgrades Bombardier | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid={00F70BA2-2211-4C92-8C0E-0DEEF0241D26} | work = Wall Street Journal | date = November 11, 2004 | accessdate = 2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Bombardier sold the Inventory Finance Division of BC to [[GE Commercial Finance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newratings.com/en/main/company_headline.m?&amp;id=785835 | title = Bombardier &quot;hold&quot; | date = 2005-04-20 | accessdate = 2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/industrials/ge-capital-solutions-signs-exclusive-agreement-brp/ | date = May 28, 2008 | title = GE Capital Solutions Signs Exclusive Agreement with BRP | publisher = Fox Business | accessdate = 2009-02-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divestitures==
===Military===
Bombardier was, until recently, a major Canadian [[defence contractor]]. With the latest restructuring, the company sold off nearly all of its military-related work in Canada. Military Aviation Services was sold to [[SPAR Aerospace]] and land-based defence products made by [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation]] ceased operations as Bombardier moved away from non-aviation defence products.

===Recreational products===
[[Image:Bombardier old.svg|thumb||right|150px|Old Bombardier [[sprocket]] logo]]
{{Main|Bombardier Recreational Products}}
On 27 August 2003 – Bombardier, Inc. announced the sale of its BRP (Recreational Products) unit to the Bombardier family for $875 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbbi.com/company/bomb/bomb.htm Bombardier Recreational Products News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
As part of the deal, BRP retained rights to the sprocket logo, which they subsequently modified.  Its [[snowcat]]s and [[snowmobile]]s dated back to the origins of the company; current brands are Ski-Doo and [[Lynx (snowmobile)|Lynx]]. Bombardier Recreational Products has also become well known for its [[Sea-Doo]] [[personal watercraft]] division which also features jet-powered sport boats.  Bombardier also makes ATVs ([[all terrain vehicle]]s).  In 2006, the Bombardier ATV was rebranded as Can-Am. Can-Am is the old name of the line of dirt bikes it produced in the 1980s which used high-tech engines featuring RAVE (Rotax Automatic Variable Exhaust) valving to create peak power at a wider range of RPMs.  The bikes were shelved but technology tweaks re-emerged in the Company's Ski-Doo snowmobiles (beginning with the 1989 model year Ski-Doo Mach 1).  Many of today's snowmobiles produced by the Company feature proprietary engineering by BRPs Rotax brand engine production plant located in Austria.  BRP's Can-Am product is among the high tech recreational vehicles which specifically include the [[Can-Am Spyder]], a three-wheel roadster with a rear-drive wheel and featuring a vehicle stability system (VSS), anti-lock braking system (ABS) and other safety and electronic vehicle control enhancements as certified by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA).

===Public transport bus===
In the early 1980s in [[Ireland]], [[Córas Iompair Éireann]] (now [[Dublin Bus]]) commissioned a range of single and double decker buses to be designed and produced. The prototypes were devised in Germany and production was carried out in Shannon, Co. Clare, Ireland. A total of 418 single and double deck buses entered service from this facility from 1981 until their withdrawal from service in 2000. Some still are used for training and exist in as Museum exhibition pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Shane.

Retrieved: 17 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bombardier Museum ==
[[Image:1951B12a.jpg|thumb|right|1951 Bombardier B12 Snow Bus Snowmobile]]
The Bombardier Museum is a large modern museum in [[Valcourt (city), Quebec|Valcourt, Quebec]] dedicated to the life of [[Joseph-Armand Bombardier]] and the [[snowmobile]] as well as the industry he helped create.  Formally opened in 1971, with substantial renovations in 1990, the museum is professionally curated and features a wide array of Ski-Doos and other industrial designs as well as a selection of related books, booklets and other items of interest to enthusiasts.

Also of note at the museum is the original Bombardier garage &quot;factory&quot; that was the genesis of the organization bearing the name.  The garage was carefully removed from its original location in [[Valcourt]]{{dn}} and moved to its present site at the museum, which is located blocks away from the huge, present-day [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] factory.

[[Image:Key break.jpg|right|100px|thumb|Break/Pause key on PC keyboard]]
The origins of the '''break key''' on a [[computer keyboard]] go back to telegraph practices. A standard [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] key has a built-in [[knife switch]] that can be used to [[short circuit|short]] the key's contacts.  When the key was not in use, that switch was kept closed, so that a signal was continually sent.  If that steady-state signal was interrupted, it indicated one of two things: either the operator was about to start transmitting, or something else had happened to break the connection — such as a physical break in the telegraph line.

As the [[Teleprinter|teletype]] came into use, a key was created that would temporarily interrupt the communications line, allowing this practice to continue. When this occurred, the receiving teletype mechanism would activate but not print characters (it was typing the non-printing ''DEL'' character repeatedly). The noise got the operator's attention.

[[Time-sharing]] computers connected to [[modem]]s could recognize the break because the ''DEL'' characters received had &quot;bad [[parity bit|parity]].&quot; &lt;!-- The link to parity doesn't explain what 'bad parity' is and so this needs more explanation, either here or on the parity page. Can anyone help? --&gt;This was used to generate an [[interrupt]], allow login, or stop a running program.

On personal computers, the Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection. On a [[BBC Micro]] computer, the Break key generates an interrupt which would normally cause a [[Soft reset|warm restart]] of the computer. A cold restart is triggered by typing Ctrl+break. If a DFS ROM is installed, Shift+break will cause the computer to search for and load a file called !boot on the floppy disk in drive 0.

On the [[Sinclair ZX80]] and [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]] computers, the Break is accessed by pressing Space. On the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] it is accessed by Shift and Space. The Spectrum+ and later computers have a dedicated Break key. It does not trigger an interrupt but will halt any running BASIC program, or terminate the loading or saving of data to cassette tape. An interrupted BASIC program can usually be resumed with the CONTINUE command. The [[Sinclair QL]] computer, without a break key, maps the function to Ctrl+Space. On many modern [[Personal computer|PCs]], ''Pause'' interrupts screen output by [[BIOS]] until another key is pressed. This is effective during [[booting|boot]] in [[text mode]] and in a [[DOS]] box in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] safe mode with 50 lines. On early keyboards without a Pause key (before the introduction of 101-key keyboards) the Pause function was assigned to Ctrl+NumLock, and the Break function to Ctrl+ScrLock; these key-combinations still work with most programs, even on modern PCs with modern keyboards. Pressing the dedicated Pause key on 101-key keyboards sends the same [[scancode]]s as pressing Ctrl, then NumLock, then releasing them in the reverse order would do; additionally, an e1&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; prefix is sent which enables 101-key aware software to discern the two situations, while older software usually just ignores the prefix. The Pause key is different from all other keys in that it sends no scancodes at all on release; therefore it is not possible for any software to determine whether this key is being held down. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled ''Pause/Break''. In most Windows environments, the key combination [[Windows key]]+Pause brings up the system properties. Compact and notebook keyboards often have the Pause/Break key mapped to a function command: for example Ctrl+Fn+F11.

== Usage for breaking the program's execution ==
While both Ctrl+Break and Ctrl+C combination are commonly implemented as a way of breaking the execution of a console application, they are also used for similar effect in [[integrated development environment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff540312.aspx |title=CTRL+C (Break) |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff541727.aspx |title=Debug Break |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these two are often considered interchangeable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Ctrl-Break |title=Ctrl-Break definition of Ctrl-Break in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; compilers and execution environments usually assign different signals to these.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/subproc-ctrl-c&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in some kernels (e.g. miscellaneous DOS variants) Ctrl+C is detected only at the time OS tries reading from a keyboard buffer and only if it's the only key sequence in the buffer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/os_dos.html |title=Vim documentation: vim online |publisher=Vim.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ousob.com/ng/dos5/ng27979.php |title=ClipX&amp;nbsp;— DOS 5.0 Ref. - int 23h ctrl-c handler |publisher=Ousob.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Ctrl+Break is often translated instantly (e.g. by [[BIOS call|INT 1Bh]] under DOS). Because of this, Ctrl+Break is usually a more effective choice under these OSes; sensitivity for these two combinations can be enhanced by the BREAK=ON [[CONFIG.SYS]] statement.

A '''bogie''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|oʊ|ɡ|i}} {{USdict|bō′·gē}}) is a [[wheel]]ed wagon or trolley. In [[Machine|mechanics]] terms, a bogie is a [[chassis]] or framework carrying wheels, attached to a vehicle.  It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a caterpillar tracked vehicle.

[[Image:Drehgestell SBB EC Waggon.jpg|thumb|Bogie of a [[SBB-CFF-FFS|SBB]] [[Eurocity]] passenger car, as seen from underneath]]

A '''bogie''' in the UK, or a '''wheel truck''', or simply '''truck''' in North America, is a structure underneath a [[train]] to which [[axle]]s (and, hence, [[wheel]]s) are attached through [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s. In [[Indian English]], bogie may also refer to an entire [[railway carriage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/bogie&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British railway to build coaches with bogies, instead of rigidly-mounted axles, was the [[Midland Railway]] in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkinson |first=David |authorlink=David Jenkinson |title=British Railway Carriages of the 20th Century - Volume 1: The end of an era, 1901-22 |year=1988 |publisher=Guild Publishing |location=London |id=CN 8130 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogies serve a number of purposes:&lt;ref name=&quot;how&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Isao Okamoto | year = 1998 | month = December | title = How Bogies Work | journal = Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review  | volume =  | issue = 18 | pages = 52–61 | url = http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr18/pdf/f52_technology.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support of the rail vehicle body.
* Stability on both straight and curved track.
* Ensuring ride comfort by absorbing vibration and minimizing centrifugal forces when the train runs on curves at high speed.
* Minimizing generation of track irregularities and rail abrasion.

Usually two bogies are fitted to each [[railroad car|carriage]], wagon or [[locomotive]], one at each end. An alternate configuration often is used in [[articulated vehicle]]s, which places the bogies (often [[jacobs bogie]]s) under the connection between the carriages or wagons.

Most bogies have two axles as it is the simplest design,&lt;ref name=&quot;how&quot; /&gt; but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using [[span bolster]]s to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars.

Usually the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a double decker [[bilevel rail car|train]] to increase interior space while staying within [[Loading gauge|height restrictions]], or in easy-access, stepless-entry low-floor trains.

Key components of a bogie include:&lt;ref name=&quot;how&quot; /&gt;
* The bogie frame itself. This can be of inside frame type where the main frame and bearings are between the wheels, or (more commonly) of outside frame type where the main frame and bearings are outside the wheels.
* [[suspension (vehicle)|Suspension]] to absorb shocks between the bogie frame and the rail vehicle body. Common types are [[coil spring]]s, or rubber airbags.
* At least one [[Wheelset (railroad)|wheelset]], composed of an [[axle]] with a [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s and [[wheel]] at each end.
* Axle box suspension to absorb shocks between the axle bearings and the bogie frame. The axle box suspension usually consists of a spring between the bogie frame and axle bearings to permit up and down movement, and sliders to prevent lateral movement. A more modern design uses solid rubber springs.
* [[Brake (railway)|Brake equipment]]. Two main types are used: [[brake shoe]]s that are pressed against the tread of the wheel, and [[disc brake]]s and pads.
* In powered vehicles, some form of [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], usually an electrically powered [[traction motor]]s or a hydraulically powered [[torque converter]].

The connections of the bogie with the rail vehicle allows a certain degree of rotational movement around a vertical axis pivot (bolster), with side bearers preventing excessive movement. More modern bolsterless bogie designs omit these features, instead taking advantage of the sideways movement of the suspension to permit rotational movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;how&quot; /&gt;

=== Examples ===
==== BR1 bogie ====

The [[British Railways Mark 1]] coach brought into production in 1950 utilised the BR1 bogie, which was rated to run at {{convert|90|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The wheels were cast as a one-piece item in a pair with their axle. The simple design involved the bogie resting on four [[leaf spring]]s (one spring per wheel) which in turn were connected to the axles. The leaf springs were designed to absorb any movement or resonance and to have a damping effect to benefit [[ride quality]].

Each spring was connected to the outermost edge of the axle by a roller bearing contained in oil-filled axle box. The oil had to be topped up at regular maintenance times to avoid the bearing running hot and seizing.

There was also a heavy-duty version designated BR2.

==== Commonwealth bogie ====
[[File:Commonwealth bogie.jpg|thumb|Commonwealth bogie as used on BR Mark 1 and CIE Park Royals.]]

The Commonwealth bogie, manufactured by [[SKF]] or [[Timken Company|Timken]], was introduced in the late 1950s for all BR Mark 1 vehicles. It was a heavy, cast-steel design weighing about {{convert|6.5|LT|lk=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parkin |first=Keith |title=British Railways Mark 1 Coaches |year=1991 |publisher=Pendragon |location=Penryn |isbn=0 906899 49 4 |page=35 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; with sealed roller bearings on the axle ends, avoiding the need to maintain [[axle box]] oil levels.

The leaf springs were replaced by coil springs (one per wheel) running vertically rather than horizontally. The advanced design gave a better ride quality than the BR1, being rated for {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0abbr=on}}.

The side frame of the bogie was usually of bar construction, with simple horn guides attached, allowing the axleboxes vertical movements between them.  The axleboxes had a cast steel equaliser beam or bar resting on them.  The bar had two steel coil springs placed on it and the bogie frame rested on the springs.  The effect was to allow the bar to act as a compensating lever between the two axles and to use both springs to soften shocks from either axle.  The bogie had a conventional bolster suspension with swing links carrying a spring plank.

==== B4 bogie ====
[[File:Bogie BT4.JPG|thumb|B4 bogie as used on BR Mark 2 and Irish Cravens]]

The B4 bogie was introduced in 1963.  It was a fabricated steel design as versus cast iron and was lighter than the Commonwealth, weighing in at {{convert|5|LT|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parkin|1991|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had a speed rating of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0abbr=on}}.

Axle/spring connection was again with fitted roller bearings.  However, now two coil springs rather than one were fitted per wheel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsr.org.uk/bogies.htm  Unofficial West Somerset Railway website - Bogies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a very small amount of Mark 1 stock was fitted with the B4 bogie from new, it being used on the Mark 1 only to replace worn out BR1 bogies.  The [[British Rail Mark 2]] coach however carried the B4 bogies from new. A heavier duty version, the B5, was standard on Southern Region Mk1 based EMUs from the 1960s onwards. Some Mark 1 catering cars had mixed bogies—a B5 under the kitchen end, and a B4 under the seating end. Some of the B4 fitted Mark 2s, as well as many B4 fitted Mark 1 [[Brake Gangwayed|BG]]s were allowed to run at {{convert|110|mph}} with extra maintenance, particularly of the wheel profile, and more frequent exams.

==== BT10 Bogie ====
[[File:Bogie BT10.JPG|thumb|BT10 High speed bogie as used on MK3]]

The BT10 bogie was introduced on the [[British Rail Mark 3]] coach in the 1970s. Each wheel is separately connected to the bogie by a swing-arm axle.

There is dual suspension:
*primary suspension via a coil spring and damper mounted on each axle.
*secondary suspension via two air springs mounted on the pivot plank.  This is connected to the bogie by pendulum links.  A constant coach height is maintained by air valves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uctc.net/papers/114.pdf ''Roger Barnett'' - British Rail’s InterCity 125 and 225]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotive]]s are carried on bogies (trucks - US). Trucks used in the USA include [[AAR type A switcher truck]], [[Blomberg B]], [[HT-C truck]] and Flexicoil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hosam.com/emd/emd6a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tramway ==
=== Modern ===
[[File:Septa PCC car truck.jpg|thumb|Side view of a [[SEPTA]] [[PCC streetcar|PCC]] car bogie]]

Tram bogies are much simpler in design because of their axle load, and the tighter curves found on tramways mean that tram bogies almost never have more than two axles. Furthermore, some tramways have steeper gradients and vertical as well as horizontal curves, which means that tram bogies often need to pivot on the horizontal axis as well.

Some [[articulated tram]]s have bogies located under articulations, a setup referred to as a [[Jacobs bogie]]. Often [[low-floor tram]]s are fitted with non-pivoting bogies and many [[tramway enthusiast]]s see this as a retrograde step, as it leads to more wear of both track and wheels and also significantly reduces the speed at which a tram can round a curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway2007.fd.cvut.cz/proceedings/Capek+Kolar.pdf |title=ČVUT.cz - Čapek, Kolář |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only 100% low floor tram with pivoting bogies - [[Škoda 15 T|Škoda ForCity]] - uses the [[Jacobs bogie]].

=== Historic ===
In the past, many different types of bogie (&quot;truck&quot;) have been used under tramcars, e.g. &quot;[[J. G. Brill and Company|Brill]]&quot;, &quot;Peckham&quot; and &quot;maximum traction&quot;.  A maximum traction truck has one driving axle with large wheels and one non-driving axle with smaller wheels.  The bogie pivot is located off-centre so that more than half the weight rests on the driving axle.

== Tracked vehicles ==

Some [[tank]]s and other [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles have bogies as external suspension components (see [[suspension (vehicle)#Armoured fighting vehicle suspension|armoured fighting vehicle suspension]]). This type of bogie usually has two or more road wheels and some type of sprung suspension to smooth the ride across rough terrain. Bogie suspensions keep much of their components on the outside of the vehicle, saving internal space. Although vulnerable to [[antitank]] fire, they can often be repaired or replaced in the field.

== Hybrid systems ==
[[File:Bogie-metro-Meteor-p1010692.jpg|thumb|Model of the pneumatic bogie system of a [[MP 89]] carriage used on the [[Paris Métro Line 14|''Meteor'' metro]].]]

The retractable stadium roof on Toronto's [[Roger's Centre]] utilized modified 'off the shelf' train bogies on a circular rail. The system was chosen for its proven reliability. 

[[Rubber-tyred metro]] trains utilise a specialised version of railway bogies. As well as the standard running wheels (rubber instead of steel) there are additional horizontal guide wheels in front of and behind the running wheels.

== Variable gauge axles ==

To overcome [[break of gauge|breaks of gauge]] some bogies are being fitted with [[variable gauge]] axles (VGA) so that they can operated on two different gauges.  These include the [[SUW 2000]] system from [[ZNTK Nowy Sącz|ZNTK]].

'''British Steel''' was a major British [[steel]] producer. It originated as a [[nationalization|nationalised]] industry, the '''British Steel Corporation''' (BSC), formed in 1967.  This was converted to a public limited company, British Steel PLC, and privatised in 1988. It was once a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]] but following mergers, the business is now owned by [[Corus Group|Corus]], a [[Tata Steel]] company.

==Nationalisation==
BSC was formed from the assets of former private companies which had been nationalised, largely under the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of [[Harold Wilson]] (1964–1970).  Wilson's was the second attempt at nationalisation, [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain]] having been largely privatised by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments of the 1950s.  Only one steel company, [[Richard Thomas and Baldwins]], remained in public ownership throughout.

BSC was established under the Iron and Steel Act 1967, which vested in the Corporation the shares of the fourteen major steel companies:
*[[David Colville &amp; Sons|Colvilles]] Ltd
*[[Consett Iron Company]] Ltd
*[[Dorman Long]] &amp; Company Ltd
*[[English Steel Corporation]] Ltd
*[[GKN]] Steel Company Ltd
*[[John Summers &amp; Sons]] Ltd
*The [[Lancashire Steel Corporation]] Ltd
*The [[Park Gate Iron &amp; Steel Company]] Ltd
*[[Richard Thomas and Baldwins]] Ltd
*[[Round Oak Steel Works]] Ltd
*[[South Durham Steel &amp; Iron Company]] Ltd
*The [[Steel Company of Wales]] Ltd
*[[Stewarts &amp; Lloyds]], Ltd
*The [[United Steel Companies]] Ltd

These companies commanded some 200 wholly or partly owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and overseas in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Africa, South Asia, and South America.

Dorman Long, South Durham and Stewarts and Lloyds had merged as British Steel and Tube Ltd before vesting took place.

BSC later arranged an exchange deal with [[Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]] Ltd (GKN), the parent company of GKN Steel, under which BSC acquired [[Dowlais Ironworks]] at [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and GKN took over BSC's [[Brymbo Steelworks]] near [[Wrexham]].

==Change in the British steel industry==
The Act brought together 90 percent of the UK's steelmaking to form BSC, a single business with 268,500 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uksteel.org.uk/keydates.htm UK Steel:Key dates]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Blair (1997) British Steel had serious problems, including complacency with existing obsolescent plants (plants operating under capacity and thus at low efficiency); outdated technology; price controls that reduced marketing flexibility; soaring coal and oil costs; lack of capital investment funds; and increasing competition on the world market. By the 1970s the government adopted a policy of keeping employment artificially high in the declining industry. This especially impacted BSC since it was a major employer in a number of depressed regions.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair M. Blair, &quot;The British iron and steel industry since 1945,&quot; Journal of European Economic History Winter 1997, Vol. 26 Issue 3, pp 571-81 &lt;/ref&gt;

One of the arguments aired in favour of nationalisation was that it would enable steel production to be rationalised.  This involved concentrating investment on major integrated plants, placed near the coast for ease of access by sea, and closing older, smaller plants, especially those that had been located inland for proximity to coal supplies.

From the mid-1970s the (now loss-making) British Steel pursued a strategy of concentrating steelmaking in five areas: South Wales, [[South Yorkshire]], [[Scunthorpe]], [[Teesside]] and [[Scotland]]. This policy continued following the Conservative victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 General Election]].  Other traditional steelmaking areas faced cutbacks.  Under the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]], a review by Lord Beswick had led to the reprieve of the so-called 'Beswick plants', for social reasons, but subsequent governments were obliged under EU rules to withdraw subsidies.  Major changes resulted across Europe including, in the UK:

* At [[Consett]] the closure of the British Steel works in 1980 marked the end of steel production in the [[River Derwent, North East England|Derwent Valley]] and the decline of the area.

* At [[Corby]] the early 1980s saw the loss of 11,000 jobs leading to an initial unemployment rate of over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap33.htm Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions, HMSO]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In Wales, works at East Moors (Cardiff), [[Ebbw Vale]] and [[Shotton]] were closed.

* In Scotland, Western Europe's largest hot [[strip steel]] mill [[Ravenscraig steelworks]], near [[Motherwell, Scotland|Motherwell]], [[North Lanarkshire]], was closed by British Steel in 1992, leading to huge unemployment in the area. It also led to the closure of several local support and satellite businesses, such as the nearby British Steel [[Clydesdale Works]] in [[Mossend]], [[Clyde Alloy]] in [[Netherton, North Lanarkshire|Netherton]] and equipment maker [[Anderson Strathclyde]]. Demolition of the site's landmark blue gasometer in 1996, and the subsequent cleanup operation, has created the largest [[brownfield]] site in [[Europe]]. This huge area between Motherwell and [[Wishaw]] is in line to be transformed into the new town of [[Ravenscraig]], a project partly funded by [[Corus]].

==Privatisation==
British Steel was [[privatization|privatised]] in 1988 under the  Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. It merged with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] steel producer ''Koninklijke Hoogovens'' to form ''[[Corus Group]]'' on 6 October 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corusgroup.com Corus Group Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  Corus itself was taken over in March 2007 by the Indian steel operator [[Tata Steel]].

==Chairmen==
*[[Julian Edward Alfred Mond, 3rd Baron Melchett|Lord Melchett]] (1967–1973)
*[[Monty Finniston]] (1973–1976)
*[[Charles Hyde Villiers|Charles Villiers]] (1976–1980)
*[[Ian MacGregor]] (1980–1983)

Ian MacGregor later became famous for his role as Chairman of the [[National Coal Board]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)]]. During the strike the &quot;[[Battle of Orgreave]]&quot; took place at British Steel's coking plant. Ratan Tata is the head of the Tata steel company which was originated in India in 1903 in Jamshedpur city of Bihar state.

==Sponsorship==
In 1971, British Steel sponsored Sir [[Chay Blyth]] in his record-making non-stop [[circumnavigation]] against the winds and currents, known as 'The Impossible Voyage'. In 1992 they sponsored the [[Global Challenge|British Steel Challenge]], the first of a series of 'wrong way' races for amateur crews.

British Steel had agreed a sponsorship deal with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough Football Club]] during the [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95 season]], with a view to British Steel sponsored Middlesbrough shirts making their appearance [[1995-96 in English football|the following season]]. But the sponsorship deal was terminated before it commenced after it was revealed that [[United Kingdom|British]] steel only made up a tiny fraction of steel used in construction of the stadium - the bulk of the steel had been imported from [[Germany]].

==History==
BT is the world’s oldest [[Telephone company|telecommunications company]]. The company's origins date back to the establishment of the first telecommunications companies in the United Kingdom. Among them was the first commercial [[Telegraphy|telegraph service]], the [[Electric Telegraph Company]], established in 1846. As these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed, the remaining companies were transferred to [[Government-owned corporation|state control]] under the [[General Post Office|Post Office]]. These companies were merged and [[Rebranding|rebranded]] as British Telecommunications.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

===1878{{ndash}}1969: General Post Office===
From 1878, the telephone service in the United Kingdom was provided by private sector companies such as the [[National Telephone Company]], and later by the [[General Post Office]]. In 1896, the National Telephone Company was taken over by the General Post Office. In 1912, it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services, after the Post Office took over the private sector telephone service in the UK, except for a few local authority services. Those services all folded within a few years, the sole exception being [[Kingston upon Hull]], where the telephone department became present day [[KCOM Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt; Telegraph and Telephone services became the exclusive responsibility of the Post Office Engineering department.

Converting the Post Office into a nationalised industry, as opposed to a governmental department, was first discussed in 1932 by Lord Wolmer. His ideas were recorded in the book ''Post Office Reform''. In 1932, the Bridgeman Committee was formed, &quot;to enquire and report as to whether any changes to the constitution, status or system of organisation of the Post Office would be in the public interest&quot;. The Committee's report was rejected. In 1961, the subject received further attention, the proposals were ignored. The Post Office remained a department of central government, with the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] sitting in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

In March 1965, [[Tony Benn]], the acting [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], wrote to the Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the Post Office into a [[State ownership|nationalised industry]]. A party was established to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal, and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the Government to re-establish a Steering Group on the Organisation of the Post Office. After some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions; [[General Post Office|Post]], Telecommunications, [[National Savings and Investments|Saving]]s, [[Girobank|Giro]] and National Data Processing Services, it was decided that there should be two: ''Post'' and ''Telecommunications''. These events finally resulted in the introduction of the Post Office Act, 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

On 1 October 1969, under the Post Office Act, 1969, the Post Office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a [[Public company|public corporation]]. The Act gave the Post Office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems. Effectively, the General Post Office retained its telecommunications monopoly.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

===1977{{ndash}}1982: British Telecom===
In 1977, the Carter Committee Report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations. The findings contained in the report led to the renaming of [[Post Office Telecommunications]] as British Telecom in 1980, although it remained part of the Post Office.

The British Telecommunications Act, 1981 transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the Post Office, creating two separate corporations, [[Post Office Ltd.|Post Office]]. At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into the UK telecommunications industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British Telecom, to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems. Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the British Standards Institution (BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and had the effect of requiring British Telecom to connect approved apparatus to its systems.

The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up to  and the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable &amp; Wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary, Mercury Communications.

===1982{{ndash}}1984: Privatisation of British Telecom===
On 19 July 1982, the Government formally announced its intention to privatise British Telecom with the sale of up to 51 per cent of the company's shares to private investors. This intention was confirmed by the passing of the Telecommunications Act, 1984, which received Royal Assent on 12 April that year. The transfer to British Telecommunications plc of the business of British Telecom, the statutory corporation, took place on 6 August 1984 and, in November 1984, more than 50 per cent of British Telecom shares were sold to the public.

The new legislation had to enable British Telecom to become more responsive to competition in the UK and to expand its operations globally. Commercial freedom granted to British Telecom allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and, if it so decided, to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus.

The company's transfer into the private sector continued in December 1991 when the Government sold around half its remaining holding of 47.6 per cent of shares, reducing its stake to 21.8 per cent. Substantially all the government's remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in July 1993, raising £5&amp;nbsp;billion for the Treasury and introducing 750,000 new shareholders to the company.

The 1984 Act also abolished British Telecom’s exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition. This meant that British Telecom finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems, which it had technically retained under the 1981 Act despite the Secretary of State's licensing powers. It now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator.  The principal licence granted to British Telecom laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities, including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus.

===1983{{ndash}}1991: Open telecommunications===
The next major development for British Telecom, and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications, occurred in 1991. On 5 March, the Government's [[White Paper]], Competition and Choice: Telecommunications Policy for the 1990s, was issued. In effect, it ended the duopoly which had been shared by British Telecom and Mercury Communications in the UK since November 1983 and the build up to privatisation. The new, more open and fairer policy, enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies. Independent 'retail' companies were permitted to bulk-buy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users.
The White Paper was endorsed by British Telecom, the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer.

===1991 – 2001: Rebranding===
On 2 April 1991, the company unveiled a new trading name, BT, a new corporate identity and a new organisational structure. This structure focused on specific market sectors, reflecting the needs of different customers – the individual, the small business or the multinational corporation. The reorganisation was named Project Sovereign to reflect the company’s commitment to meetings customers’ needs – ‘the customer is King’. Together with a succession of strategic alliances with telecommunications companies worldwide, these changes gave BT the means to expand into overseas markets.

===Ventures===
==== 1994{{ndash}}1997: Concert Communications Services ====
In June 1994, BT and MCI Communication Corporation, the second largest carrier of long distance telecommunications services in the US, launched Concert Communications Services, a $1&amp;nbsp;billion joint venture company. This alliance gave BT and MCI a global network for providing end-to-end connectivity for advanced business services. Concert was the first company to provide a single source, broad portfolio of global communications services for multinational customers. On 3 November 1996, BT and MCI announced they had entered into a merger agreement to create a global telecommunications company called Concert plc, to be incorporated in the UK, with headquarters in both London and Washington DC. As part of the alliance BT acquired a 20 per cent holding in MCI. Nevertheless, following US carrier WorldCom's rival bid for MCI on 1 October 1997, BT ultimately decided in November, to sell its stake in MCI to WorldCom for $7&amp;nbsp;billion. The deal with WorldCom resulted in a profit of more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion on BT's original investment in MCI, with an additional $465&amp;nbsp;million severance fee for the break up of the proposed merger.

====1998{{ndash}}2005: Concert====
In July 1998, BT announced another global venture with the formation of a 50:50 business with AT&amp;T.  The new company, Concert, was launched in November 1999 to serve the needs of multinational companies and the international calling needs of individuals and businesses. In October 2001, following a downturn in the global telecommunications market, it was announced that BT and AT&amp;T were to unwind Concert, returning its businesses, customer accounts and networks to the two parent companies (this was completed in April 2002).

In December 2000, following modifications to BT’s licence in April 2000, BT offered local loop unbundling (LLU) to other telecommunications operators, enabling them to use BT’s copper local loops (the connection between the customer’s premises and the exchange) to connect directly with their customers.  By the end of August 2005, 105,055 lines had been unbundled.

====1985{{ndash}}2005: O2====
{{Main|O2 (United Kingdom)}}
In 1985, Cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Limited, a 60:40 venture between British Telecommunications and [[G4S|Securicor]] respectively.

In 1999, BT purchased Securicor's shares in Cellnet for £3.15&amp;nbsp;billion, Securicor originally invested £4&amp;nbsp;million in Cellnet in 1983, the company was later rebranded as BT Cellnet, and it became a part of BT Wireless, a group of subsidiary companies owned by BT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In October 2001, at a general meeting held in [[Birmingham]], 4.297&amp;nbsp;billion [[British Telecommunications]] shares voted in favour of the demerger, and 0.67&amp;nbsp;million voted against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In February 2004, the company was subject to rumours of take-over bids from [[KPN]], the Dutch telecommunications group though these never came to fruition. In 2005 rumours of KPN (and several other international network operators) bidding for the various branches of O2 persisted, though following the company's posting of better than expected results so soon after demerging some speculation shifted to O2 itself making bids for other businesses.

In March 2005, the company underwent a corporate reorganization, that saw mmO2 plc being de-listed from the [[London Stock Exchange]] and acquired (via a share swap) by a new company, O2 plc, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange in its place. The summer of 2005 saw the company under threat of crippling [[strike action]] by [[Communication Workers' Union (UK)|Communication Workers Union]] members following disputes over pay and remuneration, though unrelated to earlier job losses as part of the reorganization. This was resolved without strikes taking place after several months of negotiations between the company and the [[trade union]].

===2001{{ndash}}2003: dot.com crash and reorganisation===
Following the global stock market based [[dot com crash]], the group undertook a major board restructuring and asset sale to address its debt pile. In May 2001, BT announced a three for ten rights issue to raise £5.9&amp;nbsp;billion – still the UK's largest ever rights issue – and the sale of [[Yell Group]], the international directories and associated e-commerce business for £2.14&amp;nbsp;billion. Both activities were completed in June 2001. The group also sold its property portfolio to JV property company [[Telereal Trillium|Telereal]].

===2003{{ndash}}2004: Brand refresh===
In April 2003, BT unveiled its current corporate identity and brand values.  Reflecting the aspirations of a technologically innovative future, the connected world is designed to embody BT’s five corporate values: trustworthy, helpful, inspiring, straightforward, heart.

The Communications Act, 2003 which came into force on 25 July 2003 introduced a new industry regulator, the Office of Communications ([[Ofcom]]), to replace the Office of Telecommunications ([[Oftel]]). It also introduced a new regulatory framework. The licensing regime was replaced by a general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement and, in some instances, specific conditions.  Under a specific condition BT retained its universal service obligation (USO) for the UK, excluding the Hull area. The USO included connecting consumers to the fixed telephone network, schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of call box services.

In the summer of 2004, BT launched Consult 21, an industry consultation for BT’s 21st century network (21CN) programme. 21CN is a next generation network transformation, due for completion by end 2010. Using internet protocol technology, 21CN will replace the existing networks and communications from any device such as mobile phone, PC, PDA or home phone, to any other device.

====2005: Openreach====
{{main|BT Openreach}}
Following the Telecommunications Strategic Review (TSR), in September 2005 BT signed legally binding Undertakings with Ofcom to help create a new regulatory framework for BT and the UK telecoms industry generally. 

[[Openreach]] provides provision and repair in the &quot;last mile&quot; of copper wire. Formed from 25,000 engineers previously employed by BT's Retail and Wholesale divisions. It is designed to ensure that other communications providers (CPs) have exactly the same operational conditions as parts of the BT group. Opened for business on 11 January 2006, it reports directly into the BT chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/8208794-1.html BT's Openreach could have to list separately]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005: Global expansion===
In 2005, BT made a number of important acquisitions. 

In February 2005, BT acquired [[El Segundo, California]]-based telecoms giant Infonet (now re-branded BT Infonet), giving BT access to new geographies.

It also acquired the second largest telecoms operator in the Italian business market, Albacom. 

In April 2005, it bought Radianz from Reuters (now rebranded as BT Radianz), which expanded BT's coverage, provided BT with more buying power in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DUJ/is_/ai_n9772149 |title=BT goes home |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006 BT confirmed that it would be investing 75% of its total capital spending, put at £10&amp;nbsp;billion over five years, in its new [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) based [[BT 21CN|21st century network]] (21CN). Annual savings of £1&amp;nbsp;billion per annum are expected when the transition to the new network is complete in 2010, with over 50% of its customers transferred by 2008. That month the first customers on to 21CN was successfully tested at [[Adastral Park]] in Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-155608023.html |title=BT transfers first customer lines to 21CN network |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=1 December 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
British Telecommunications plc (BT) is a wholly owned subsidiary of BT Group plc and encompasses virtually all businesses and assets of the BT Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
    | url = http://www.btplc.com/report/report08/overview/index.htm
    | title = 2008 Annual Report Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT Group plc is listed on stock exchanges in London and New York.

BT runs the [[telephone exchange]]s, trunk network and [[local loop]] connections for the vast majority of British fixed-line telephones. Currently BT is responsible for approximately 28&amp;nbsp;million telephone lines in the UK. Apart from [[Kingston Communications]], which serves Kingston upon Hull, BT is the only UK telecoms operator to have a ''[[Universal service|Universal Service Obligation]]'' (USO) which means it must provide a fixed telephone line to any address in the UK. It is also obliged to provide public call boxes.

BT's businesses are operated under special government regulation by the British telecoms regulator [[Ofcom]] (formerly [[Oftel]]). BT has been found to have Significant Market Power in some markets following Market Reviews by Ofcom. In these markets, BT is required to comply with additional obligations such as meeting reasonable requests to supply services and not to discriminate.

As well as continuing to provide service in those traditional areas in which BT has an obligation to provide services or is closely regulated, BT has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less regulation. These are principally, [[broadband]] internet service and [[bespoke]] solutions in telecommunications and information technology.

BT Group is organised into the following business divisions:
*[[BT Retail]]: Retail telecoms services to consumers
*[[BT Wholesale]]: Wholesale telecoms core trunk network
*[[Openreach]]: fenced-off wholesale division, tasked with ensuring that all rival operators have equality of access to BT's own local network
*[[BT Global Services]]: Business services and solutions (formerly '''BT Ignite''' and '''BT Syntegra''')
*'''BT Exact / One IT''': used to handle consultancy and internal IT. Now been replaced by BT Innovate and Design.
*'''Group operations''': handles security, [[BT Research|research and development]], and other functions for BT Group Plc such as legal services

From 1 July 2007 two additional divisions were put in place:-
*'''BT Operate''' took responsibility from BT Wholesale for the roll-out and maintenance of the group's new IP based fixed-line network, known as [[BT 21CN|21st Century Network]] (21C).
*'''BT Innovate and Design''' pulled together IT designers from BT Retail, BT Wholesale, BT Global Services and OneIT to design services on the 21C network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

After a pay rise of over 40%, BT's chief financial officer, Hanif Lalani, became one of the very few UK financial directors whose annual remuneration exceeds £1&amp;nbsp;million.  He became CEO of BT Global Services in October 2008 and was replaced as BT Group CFO by Tony Chanmugam on 1 December 2008.

In recent years, the strategy of BT plc has been to reduce its dependence on traditional voice revenues and instead obtain an increasing portion of its turnover from so-called ''New Wave'' revenues.  At the heart of this strategy is BT Global Services, which has won many significant contracts in the commercial and public sectors, in part through its portrayal as a &quot;momentum story&quot;.

In the early 1990s the market was opened up and a number of new national Public Telecommunications Operators (PTOs) were given licences. This ended the duopoly that had existed in the 1980s when only BT and Mercury were licensed to provide fixed line telecom networks in the UK.

===Pension fund===
BT has the largest [[defined benefit pension plan]] of any UK public company; as of 31 December 2009 the scheme had a deficit of £9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Environment==
In 2004, the BT Group signed the world's largest renewable energy deal with [[npower (UK)|npower]] and British Gas, and now all of their exchanges, satellite networks and offices are powered by renewable energy.  BT is a member of the Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change.  They signed a letter urging the government to do more to tackle this problem.  Janet Blake, head of global corporate social responsibility (CSR) at BT, says that she would like to see incentives that find ways of rewarding those companies that focus on climate change by making investments in green business models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itweek.co.uk/business-green/analysis/2199869/interview-csr-delivers-2bn-bt Interview: CSR delivers £2.2bn for BT – 30 Oct 2006 – IT Week&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
=== World Wide Web hyperlink patent ===
In 2001 BT discovered it owned a patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) which it believed gave it patent rights on the use of [[hyperlink]] technology on the [[World Wide Web]]. The corresponding UK patent had already expired, but the US patent was valid until 2006. Opponents of BT's claim held that the patent had never been valid, due to prior art by both [[Douglas Engelbart]] and [[Ted Nelson]]'s [[Project Xanadu]]. Nevertheless on 11 February 2002, BT began a court case relating to its claims in a U.S. federal court against the [[Internet service provider]] [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy Communications Corporation]]. The U.S. court ruled on 22 August 2002 that the BT patent was not applicable to Web technology, and granted Prodigy's request for summary judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nswscl.org.au/journal/51/Glen_Sauer.html |title=BT’s “Hyperlinking” Patent Litigation Fails |publisher=Nswscl.org.au |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of prior art was thus not addressed.

In early 2008 it was announced that BT had entered into a contract (along with [[Virgin Media]] and [[TalkTalk (telecommunications company)|Talk Talk]]) with the [[spyware]] company [[Phorm]] (responsible under their 121Media guise for the Apropos [[rootkit]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/apropos.shtml F-Secure Spyware Information Pages: Apropos]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/peopleonpage.shtml |title=F-Secure Spyware Information Pages: PeopleOnPage |publisher=F-secure.com |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to intercept and analyse their users' click-stream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of Phorm's OIX advertising service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/25/phorm_isp_advertising/page2.html |title=ISP data deal with former 'spyware' boss triggers privacy fears |work=The Register |location= |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/29/phorm_documents/ |title=How Phorm plans to tap your internet connection |work=The Register |location= |date=29 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, known as &quot;[[behavioural targeting]]&quot; and condemned by critics as &quot;[[data pimping]]&quot;, came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested-parties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under UK law (RIPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23449601-details/Web+users+angry+at+ISPs%27+spyware+tie-up/article.do |title=Web users angry at ISPs' spyware tie-up |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/04/phorm_ripa/ |title=Data pimping: surveillance expert raises illegal wiretap worries |work=The Register |location= |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/17/phorm_fipr_illegal/ |title=Net think thank: Phorm is illegal |work=The Register |location= |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fipr.org/080423phormlegal.pdf |title=The Phorm “Webwise” System – a Legal Analysis |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a more fundamental level, many have argued that the ISPs and Phorm have no right to sell a commodity (a user's data, and the copyright content of web sites) to which they have no claim of ownership. In response to questions about Phorm and the interception of data by the Webwise system [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]], credited as the creator of the World Wide Web, indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying that his data and web history:

{{quotation|It's mine – you can't have it. If you want to use it for something, then you have to negotiate with me. I have to agree, I have to understand what I'm getting in return. I myself feel that it is very important that my ISP supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house. It supplies connectivity with no strings attached.

'''Balmoral Castle''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|æ|l|ˈ|m|ɒr|əl}})  is a large [[estate house]] situated in [[Royal Deeside]], part of [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]]. Balmoral has been one of the [[List of British royal residences|residences]] of the [[British Royal Family]] since 1852, when it was purchased by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and her [[Prince Consort|consort]], [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. It remains the private property of the monarch, and is not part of the state-owned [[Crown Estate]].

Soon after the estate was purchased the existing house was found to be too small. It was demolished, and the current Balmoral Castle was completed during 1856. The architect was William Smith of Aberdeen, although his designs were amended by Prince Albert. The castle is an example of [[Scots Baronial]] architecture, and is now protected as a category A [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=51460 |title=Balmoral Castle: Listed Building Report |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balmoral [[Estate (land)|Estate]] has been added to by successive members of the Royal Family, and now covers an area of about {{convert|20000|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/ |title=Welcome to Balmoral |publisher=Balmoral Estates}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a working estate, including [[Red Grouse|grouse moors]], forestry and farmland, as well as managed herds of deer, [[Highland cattle]] and ponies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/estate.htm |title=Balmoral Estate |publisher=Balmoral Estates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] of Scotland (1316–1390) had a [[hunting|hunting lodge]] in the area. A house at Balmoral was built by Sir William Drummond during 1390.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whichcastle.com/aberdeenshire/balmoralcastle.htm |title=Balmoral Castle, Aberdeenshire |publisher=www.whichcastle.com |date= |accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate is recorded in 1451 as &quot;Bouchmorale&quot;, and was later tenanted by Alexander Gordon, second son of the [[Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly|1st Earl of Huntly]]. A [[tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]] was built on the estate by the Gordons.&lt;ref name=garden&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/heritage/gardens/gardenssearchmoreinfo.htm?s=balmoral&amp;r=&amp;bool=0&amp;PageID=2252&amp;more_info=Site |title=Balmoral Castle: Site History |work=An Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1662 the estate passed to Charles Farquharson of [[Inverey]], brother of [[Inverey#John_Farquharson.2C_3rd_of_Inverey|John Farquharson]], the &quot;Black Colonel&quot;. The Farquharsons were [[jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathisers, and James Farquharson of Balmoral was involved in both the 1715 and 1745 [[Jacobite risings|rebellions]], and was wounded at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)|Battle of Falkirk]] during 1746. His estates were [[forfeit]], and passed to the Farquharsons of [[Braemar|Auchendryne]].&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Seton Gordon|Gordon, Seton]] |title=Seton Gordon's Cairngorms : an anthology |publisher=Whittles |year=2009 |chapter=The Country of Balmoral |pages=141–142 |isbn=9781904445883}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1798, [[James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife]], acquired Balmoral, and leased the castle. Sir Robert Gordon, a younger son of the [[George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aberdeen|3rd Earl of Aberdeen]], acquired the lease during 1830 and made major alterations to the castle, with baronial-style extensions designed by John Smith of Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;

===Royal acquisition===

[[Image:balmoral by queen.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Balmoral Castle, painted by Queen Victoria in 1854 during its construction]]

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert first visited Scotland during 1842, five years after her accession and two years after their marriage. They stayed at [[Edinburgh]], and at [[Taymouth Castle]] in [[Perthshire]], the home of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane|Marquess of Breadalbane]].&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; They returned in 1844 to stay at [[Blair Castle]], and in 1847 when they rented Ardverikie by [[Loch Laggan]].&lt;ref&gt;Millar, pp.23,31&lt;/ref&gt; The latter trip was extremely rainy, which led [[James Clark (physician)|Sir James Clark]], the Queen's physician, to recommend [[Deeside]] for its more healthy climate.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir Robert Gordon died during 1847, and the lease on Balmoral reverted to Lord Aberdeen. In February 1848 it was decided that Prince Albert would acquire the remaining part of the lease on Balmoral, together with its furniture and staff, and the couple arrived for their first visit on 8 September 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, pp.40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria found the house &quot;small but pretty&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded in her diary that: &quot;All seemed to breathe freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils&quot;.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; 

The house was quickly found to be too small, and John and William Smith were commissioned in 1848 to design new offices, cottages and other ancillary buildings.&lt;ref name=millar55/&gt; Improvements to the woodlands, gardens and estate buildings were also being made, assisted by the landscape gardener James Beattie and the painter [[james Giles (painter)|James Giles]].&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; After seeing a [[corrugated iron]] cottage at the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], Prince Albert ordered a pre-fabricated iron building for Balmoral from E. T. Bellhouse &amp; Co., to serve as a temporary ballroom and dining room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/bellhouse/chapter4.pdf |title=E.T. Bellhouse and Co. Engineers and Iron Founders |work=David Bellhouse and Sons, Manchester |author=Bellhouse, David |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in use by 1 October 1851, and served as a ballroom until completion of the new ballroom in 1856.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millar, p.59&quot;&gt;Millar, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Major additions to the old house were considered in 1849,&lt;ref name=millar55&gt;Millar, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; but by then negotiations were underway to purchase the estate from the trustees of the deceased Earl Fife. The sale was completed during November 1851, the price being £32,000, and Prince Albert formally took possession the following autumn.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;&lt;ref name=millar56&gt;Millar, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbouring estate of [[Birkhall]] was bought at the same time, and the lease on [[Abergeldie Castle|Abergeldie]] secured.

===Construction of the new house===
The programme of improvement culminated during early 1852 with the decision to commission a new, larger house, from William Smith.&lt;ref name=millar56/&gt; The son of John Smith, designer of the earlier castle, William Smith was City Architect of [[Aberdeen]] from 1852. On learning of the commission, [[William Burn]] sought an interview with the Prince, apparently to complain that Smith had plagiarised his work during the past. However, Burn was unsuccessful in depriving Smith of the appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201859 |title=William Smith II |work=Dictionary of Scottish Architects 1840–1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Smith's designs were amended by Prince Albert, who took a close interest in details such as turrets and windows.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began during summer 1853, on a site some {{convert|100|m}} north-west of the original building, which was considered to have a better outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, pp.56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone on 28 September 1853, during the annual autumn visit.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; By the autumn of 1855, the royal apartments were ready, though the tower was still under construction and the servants had to be lodged in the old house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millar, p.59&quot;/&gt; The new house was completed during 1856, and the old castle was subsequently demolished.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; 

Balmoral Castle is built from [[granite]] quarried at Invergelder on the estate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Scotland's Gardens |author=Little, G. A. |publisher=Spur Books |year=1981 |isbn=0715720910}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprises two main blocks, each arranged around a courtyard. The south-western block contains the main rooms, while the north-eastern contains the service wings. At the south-east is a {{convert|24.5|m|ft|adj=on}} tall clock tower topped with turrets,&lt;ref name=glendinning/&gt; one of which has a balustrade similar to a feature at [[Castle Fraser]].&lt;ref name=fenwick&gt;{{cite book |author=Fenwick, Hubert |title=Scotland's Historic Buildings |isbn=0709144970 |publisher=Robert Hale |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of the new house is considered to be somewhat dated for its time, being similar in style to the demolished castle of the 1830s, in contrast to the richer forms of [[Scots Baronial]] being developed by William Burn and others during the 1850s.&lt;ref name=glendinning&gt;{{cite book |author=Glendinning, Miles |author2=MacKechnie, Aonghus |author3=MacInnes, Ranald |title=A History of Scottish Architecture |page=270 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=0748608494 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an exercise in Scots Baronial, it is sometimes described as being too ordered, pedantic, and even [[Architecture of Germany|Germanic]], as a result of Prince Albert's influence on the design.&lt;ref name=fenwick/&gt; However, the purchase of a Scottish estate by Victoria and Albert, and their adoption of Scottish architectural style, was very influential for the ongoing revival of [[Highland culture]]. The royals decorated Balmoral with tartans and attended [[highland games]] at Braemar; Queen Victoria expressed an affinity for Scotland, even professing herself to be a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Devine, T.M. |title=The Scottish Nation 1700–2000 |publisher=Penguin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0141027692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the work of [[Sir Walter Scott]], this was a major factor in promoting the adoption of Highland culture by [[Lowland Scotland]]ers. Historian Michael Lynch comments that &quot;the Scottishness of Balmoral helped to give the monarchy a truly British dimension for the first time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynch, Michael |work=Scotland: A New History |publisher=Pimlico |year=1992 |isbn=978-0712698931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria and Albert at Balmoral===
Even before the completion of the new house, the pattern of the royal couple's life in the Highlands was soon established. Albert spent many days shooting deer and game, while Victoria took long walks of up to four hours daily. In 1849 the diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] described their life at Balmoral as like that of gentry rather than royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria began a policy of commissioning artists to record Balmoral, its surroundings and its staff. Over the years, numerous painters were employed at Balmoral, including [[Edwin Landseer|Edwin]] and [[Charles Landseer]], [[Carl Haag]], [[William Wyld]], William Henry Fisk, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The couple took great interest in their staff, and set up a lending library. During the 1850s, new plantations were established around the house, and exotic conifers were planted in the grounds. Prince Albert had an active role in these improvements, overseeing the design of [[parterre]]s, the diversion the main road north of the river via a new bridge, and plans for farm buildings.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; These included a [[model farm|model dairy]] which he developed during 1861, the year of his death. It was completed by Victoria, who subsequently built several monuments to her husband on the estate. These included an obelisk, and a large statue of Albert by [[William Theed]], inaugurated in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:BalmoralCastle1900.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Balmoral, c.1890–1900]]
After Albert's death, Victoria spent increasing periods at Balmoral, staying up to four months a year during early summer and autumn. Few further changes were made to the grounds, with the exception of the monuments and cottages built during the remainder of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; It was during this period that Victoria began to depend on her servant [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]], a local [[ghillie]] from Crathes who became one of her closest companions during her long mourning.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Balmoral Castle was the birthplace of [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Victoria Eugenie of Spain]], a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In September 1896, Victoria welcomed [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra]] to Balmoral. Four years later Victoria made her last visit, three months before her death on 22 January 1901.

===After Victoria===
After Victoria's death, the royal family continued to use Balmoral during annual autumn visits. [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] had substantial improvements done during the 1910s and 1920s, including formal gardens to the south of the castle.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt; 

Balmoral is a private property and, unlike the monarch's [[official residence]]s, is not part of the state-owned [[Crown Estate]]. Ownership of Balmoral, along with [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk, was inherited by [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] on his accession during 1936. However, when he [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] later the same year, he retained ownership. A financial settlement was devised, under which Balmoral and Sandringham passed to his brother, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/SandringhamHouse/History.aspx |title=Sandringham House: History |work=The official website of The British Monarchy |publisher=The Royal Household}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] has also added herbaceous borders and a water garden. During the 1980s new staff buildings were built close to the castle.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;

==The estate==
[[File:The Balmoral Castle, Scotland.jpg|thumb|North-west corner of Balmoral Castle]]

Balmoral Estate is within the [[Cairngorms National Park]], and is partly within the Deeside and Lochnagar [[National Scenic Area]].&lt;ref name=cons&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/conservation.htm |title=Conservation |publisher=Balmoral Estates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|20000|ha}} estate contains a wide variety of landscapes, from the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee Valley]] to open mountains. There are seven [[Munro]]s (hills in Scotland over {{convert|3000|ft}}) in the estate, the highest being [[Lochnagar]] at {{convert|1155|m}}. The mountain was the setting for a children's story, ''[[The Old Man of Lochnagar]]'', told originally by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] to his younger brothers, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]], and published during 1980 with royalties accruing to [[The Prince's Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?category=292&amp;object=1101076&amp;row=94&amp;detail=about |title=The Old Man of Lochnagar, 1980 |publisher=The Royal Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The areas of Lochnagar and Ballochbuie were designated during 1998 by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] as [[Special Protection Areas]] (SPA) under the European Union (EU) [[Birds Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/SPA/UK9002281.pdf |title=Lochnagar SPA: Standard Data Form |publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/SPA/UK9002781.pdf |title=Ballolchbuie SPA: Standard Data Form |publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballochbuie is also protected as a [[Special Area of Conservation]] by the EU [[Habitats Directive]], as &quot;one of the largest remaining continuous areas of native [[Caledonian Forest]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0030030 |title=Ballolchbuie SAC: Site Details |publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are four [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] on the estate.&lt;ref name=cons/&gt;

During 1931, the castle gardens were first opened to the public, and are now open daily between April and the end of July, after which the Queen arrives for her annual stay.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; The ballroom is the only room in the castle which can be viewed by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/admissions.htm |title=2011 Admission Charges |publisher=Balmoral Estate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Family employs about 50 full-time and 50–100 part-time staff to maintain the working estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/employment.htm |title=Employment |publisher=Balmoral Estates}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Single malt whisky|malt whisky]] distillery located on the Balmoral Estate produces the [[Royal Lochnagar Single Malt]] whisky.

During 2005, it was suggested that Balmoral would realize at least £14&amp;nbsp;million if it were sold on the private market.&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-357891/Castle-siege-tourists-keeps-Queen-bay.html |title=Castle siege by tourists keeps Queen at bay |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other properties on the estate include [[Birkhall]], formerly home to [[Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother]], and used now by Prince Charles and the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]] for their summer holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/residences/birkhall/ |title=Birkhall |work=The Prince of Wales official website |publisher=Household of HRH The Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craigowan Lodge]] is used regularly by the Queen's friends and family, and has also been used by the Queen while Balmoral Castle is being prepared.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; Six smaller properties on the estate are let as [[holiday cottage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/availability.htm |title=Current Availability |publisher=Balmoral Estates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Queen was in residence at Balmoral at the time of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] during 1997.  Her initial decision not to return to London or to mourn more publicly was much criticised at the time by the London media.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  Her private discussions with Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] were dramatised in [[Stephen Frears]]' film ''[[The Queen (film)|The Queen]]'' (2006). The 1997 film ''[[Mrs. Brown]]'' was also based on events at Balmoral, although in both films substitute locations were used: [[Blairquhan Castle]] in ''The Queen''; and [[Duns Castle]] in ''Mrs Brown''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436697/locations |title=Filming locations for ''The Queen'' |work=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119280/locations |title=Filming locations for ''Mrs Brown'' |work=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banknotes==
Since 1987 an illustration of the castle has featured on the reverse side of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|£100 notes]] issued by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scotbanks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_royal_bank_of_scotland.php|title=Current Banknotes : Royal Bank of Scotland|publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers|accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breton''' (''Brezhoneg'') is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] spoken in [[Brittany]] ({{lang-br|Breizh}}; {{lang-fr|Bretagne}}), [[France]]. Breton is a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic language]], descended from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[British language (Celtic)|British language]] brought from [[Great Britain]] to [[Armorica]] by migrating [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. Like the other Brythonic languages, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]], it is classified as an [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic language]]. Breton is most closely related to Cornish, as both are thought to have evolved from a [[Southwestern Brythonic protolanguage]]. The other [[regional language]] of Brittany, [[Gallo language|Gallo]], is a [[Langue d'oïl]] derived from [[Latin]].

==History and status==
[[Image:Britonia6hcentury.png|thumb|The [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] community around the 6th century. The sea was a communication medium rather than a barrier]]
[[Image:Celtic Nations1.svg|thumb|[[Celtic nations]], with [[Brittany]] coloured in black at the bottom]]

Breton is spoken in Lower Brittany, roughly to the west of a line linking [[Plouha]] and [[La Roche-Bernard]] (east of [[Vannes]]). It comes from a Celtic language community (''see image'') between [[Great Britain]] and [[Armorica]] (present-day Brittany), and even [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. It was the language of the upper classes until the 12th century. However, afterwards it was only the language of the people of West Brittany (''Breizh Izel''), while the nobility, followed by the [[bourgeoisie]], adopted [[French language|French]]. As a written language, the [[Duchy of Brittany]] used [[Latin]], switching to French in the 15th century. There exists a limited tradition of [[Breton literature]]. Some [[Old Breton]] vocabulary remains in the present day as [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and scientific terms in Modern Breton.

The French Monarchy did not concern itself with the [[Minority language|minority]] [[languages of France]]. The [[French revolution|revolutionary period]] saw the introduction of policies favouring French over the regional languages, pejoratively referred to as ''[[patois]]''. It was assumed by the revolutionaries that [[reactionary]] and [[monarchy|monarchist]] forces preferred [[regional language]]s in an attempt to keep the peasant masses under-informed. In 1794, [[Barère]] submitted to the ''[[Comité de salut public]]'' his &quot;report on the idioms&quot;, in which he said that &quot;federalism and superstition speak breton&quot;. Under the [[French Third Republic|Third]], [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth]] and [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth republics]], humiliating practices aimed at stamping out the Breton language and culture prevailed in state schools until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/endangered.htm#Image%20No.%202:%20Breton%20is%20a%20hindrance%20to%20good%20citizenship ICBL information about Breton] at breizh.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, despite the political centralization of France and the important influence of the media, Breton is still spoken as an everyday language by about 200,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;ouiaubreton&quot; /&gt; This is, however, down from 1.3 million in 1930. At the beginning of the 20th century, half of the population of Lower Brittany knew only Breton, the other half being bilingual. By 1950, there were only 100,000 [[monolingual]] Bretons, and a rapid decline since with only small handfuls of elderly monolingual speakers as of 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethno&quot;&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bre Ethnologue report].&lt;/ref&gt; A statistical survey in 1997 found around 300,000 speakers in ''Breizh izel'', of which about 190,000 were aged 60 or over. Few of those of the 15-19 year-old age-group spoke Breton, which is now considered to be an [[endangered language]].&lt;ref&gt;Fañch Broudic, ''Qui parle breton aujourd'hui? Qui le parlera demain?'' Brest: Brud Nevez, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, thanks to Professor [[Roparz Hemon]], the first issue of the review ''[[Gwalarn]]'' appeared. During its 19-year run, ''Gwalarn'' tried to raise the language to the level of other great “international” languages by creating original works covering all genres and by proposing Breton translations of internationally-recognized foreign works.

In 1946, ''Al Liamm'' replaced ''Gwalarn''. Other periodicals appeared and began to give Breton a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

In 1977, [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]]. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. ''See the [[#Education|education section]] for more information.''

The [[Asterix]] comic series has been translated into Breton. This is notable because, according to the comic, the [[Gaul]]ish village where Asterix lives is in the [[Armorica|Armoric peninsula]], which is now Brittany. Some other comics have also been translated into Breton, including [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]], [[Spirou et Fantasio|Spirou]], [[Titeuf]], [[Hägar the Horrible]], [[Peanuts]] and [[Yakari]].

Some movies (''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'', ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', ''[[Marion du Faouet]]'', ''[[Sezneg]]'') and TV series (''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'') are also broadcast in Breton.

Some poets, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, for example [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], [[Roparz Hemon]], [[Anjela Duval]], [[Pêr-Jakez Helias]] and [[Youenn Gwernig]], are now known internationally.

Today, Breton is the only living [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] that is not recognized as an official or regional language. The French State refuses to change the second article of the [[French Fifth Republic|Constitution]] (added in 1994), which states that “the language of the Republic is French”.

The first Breton dictionary, the ''Catholicon'', was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today the existence of bilingual dictionaries directly from Breton into languages such as English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh demonstrates the determination of a new generation to gain international recognition for Breton. There also exists a monolingual dictionary, ''[[Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here]]'', defining Breton words in Breton. The first edition of 1995 contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words.

==Geographic distribution and dialects==
[[File:Percentage of breton speakers in the breton countries in 2004.png‎|thumb|340px|Regional statistics of Breton speakers, in 2004.]]
[[Image:Breton dialectes.svg|thumb|left|250px|Dialects of Breton]]
Breton is spoken mainly in Western Brittany, but also in a more dispersed way in Eastern Brittany (where [[Gallo language|Gallo]] is spoken alongside Breton and French), and in areas around the world that have Breton immigrants.

The dialects of Breton as identified by [[Ethnologue]] are Leoneg, Tregerieg, Gwenedeg, and Kerneveg (in French, respectively: ''[[Léonard Breton dialect|léonard]]'', ''[[Trégorrois Breton dialect|trégorrois]]'', ''[[Vannetais Breton dialect|vannetais]]'', and ''[[Cornouaillais Breton dialect|cornouaillais]]''). A fifth [[Bazt-sur-Mer Breton|dialect]] was spoken up to the beginning of the 20th century in the [[Guérande]] region. There are no clear borders between those dialect areas because the language varies slightly from one village to the next. Compared to the other dialects, the Gwenedeg dialect is somewhat more distinct due to several pronunciation specificities.

==Official status==
[[Image:Ofis ar Brezhoneg vehicle.jpg|thumb|''[[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]]'', the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the use of Breton]]

===State===
Breton is not an [[official language]] of [[France]], despite pleas from autonomists and others for official recognition and for the language to be guaranteed a place in schools, the media, and other aspects of public life.

====Constitution====
In July 2008, the French [[Constitution]] was amended adding article 75-1, stating ''les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France'' (the [[regional languages]] belong to the heritage of [[France]]). This is an important step in the recognition of Breton and other minority languages of France; however, it doesn't explicitly give more actual recognition, rights or funds to these languages.

[[Image:Bilingual sign Vannes Gwened.jpg|thumb|Bilingual sign in [[Vannes]] (''Gwened'')]]

===Region===
Nevertheless, the regional and departmental authorities do use Breton to a very limited extent, for example in signage. Some bilingual signage may also be seen, such as [[street name]] signs in Breton towns, and one station of the [[Rennes Metro|Rennes metro system]] has signs in both French and Breton.
Under French law (the [[Toubon Law]]), it is illegal for commercial signage to be in Breton alone; it must be bilingual or else in French alone. Since commercial signage usually has limited physical space, signage is normally in French alone.

''[[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]]'', the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the use of Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofis-bzh.org |title=Ofis ar Brezhoneg |publisher=Ofis-bzh.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created the ''[[Ya d'ar brezhoneg]]'' campaign, signed by enterprises, organisations and communes to promote the use of Breton, for example by installing bilingual signage or translating their website.

==Education==
[[Image:Breton school sign in Rennes.jpg|thumb|Sign in French and Breton in Rennes, outside a school with bilingual classes]]

An attempt by the French government to incorporate the independent Breton-language immersion schools (called ''[[Diwan (school)|Diwan]]'') into the state education system was blocked by the French [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] on the grounds that, as the 1992 amendment to the Constitution of the 5th Republic states that French is the language of the Republic, no other language may be used as a language of instruction in state schools. The [[Toubon Law]] states that French is the language of public education, which means that Breton-language schools do not receive funding from the national government, though the Brittany Region may fund them.

The [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded in 1977 to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]]. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. They gained more and more fame owing to their high level of results in school exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.diwanbreizh.org/sections.php4?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=6 Diwan FAQ, #6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another teaching method is a bilingual approach by ''[http://div-yezh.org/ Div Yezh]'' (&quot;Two Languages&quot;) in the State schools, created in 1979, and ''[http://www.dihun.com/ Dihun]'' (&quot;Awakening&quot;) in the Catholic schools, created in 1990.

===Statistics===
In 2010, 13,493&lt;ref name=&quot;ofis-stats&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ofis-bzh.org/fr/langue_bretonne/chiffres_cles/index.php Données clés sur breton, Ofis ar Brezhoneg].&lt;/ref&gt; students (about 1.48% of all students in Brittany) attended Diwan, Div Yezh and Dihun schools, a number rapidly growing yearly. The president of the Regional Council, Jean-Yves Le Drian wanted the number to be 20,000 in 2010, though this is unlikely to be realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/fetch.php?id=11436 Interview with Jean-Yves Le Drian, the president of the Region Council].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 4,500 to 5,000 adults followed a Breton language course (evening course, correspondence, ...) in 2007. The family transmission of Breton in 1999 is estimated to be only 3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ofis-stats&quot; /&gt;

===Other forms of education===
Next to bilingual education (including Breton-medium education), there are &quot;initiations&quot; of Breton in the primary education, primarily in the department of Finistère. These initiations are 1 to 3 hours per week and consist of songs, games, ...

There are also schools in secondary education (''[[collège]]s'' and ''[[lycée]]s'') offering courses of Breton (given as either foreign language or option, instead of e.g. German, Spanish, ...), and there are about 5,000 pupils in the universities in Brittany who take this option.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://studi.canalblog.com/archives/2010/06/20/18372084.html ''L'option de breton'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Vowels in Breton may be short or long (see [[Vowel length]]). All unstressed vowels are short; stressed vowels can be short or long. All vowels can be [[Nasalization|nasalized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hemon|first1=Roparz|authorlink1=Roparz Hemon|last2=Everson|first2=Michael|authorlink2=Michael Everson|title=Breton Grammar|edition=2|year=2007|publisher=Evertype/Al Liamm|isbn=9781904808114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{main|Breton grammar}}
&lt;!-- Description of the grammar of the language. --&gt;

===Verbal aspect===
As in [[English language|English]], and the other Celtic languages a variety of verbal constructions are available to express [[grammatical aspect]], for example showing a distinction between [[Progressive tense|progressive]] and habitual actions:

{| style=&quot;padding-left: 1.25em&quot;
|-
|Breton
|English
|Irish
|Welsh
|-
| Me '''zo o komz''' gant ma amezeg
| &quot;I '''am talking''' with my neighbour&quot;
| &quot;'''Táim ag labhairt''' le mo chomharsain&quot;
| &quot;'''Dw i'n siarad''' â fy nghymydog
|-
| Me '''a gomz''' gant ma amezeg [bep mintin]
| &quot;I '''talk''' with my neighbour [every morning]&quot;
| &quot;'''Labhraím''' le mo chomharsain [gach maidin]&quot;
| &quot;'''Siaradaf''' â fy nghymydog [bob bore]
|}

===&quot;Conjugated&quot; prepositions===
As in other modern [[Celtic languages]], Breton pronouns are fused into preceding prepositions to produce a sort of [[inflected preposition|&quot;conjugated&quot; preposition]]. Below are some examples in Breton, [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and [[Irish language|Irish]].

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 90%&quot;&gt;Note that in the examples above the [[Goidelic languages]] (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) use the preposition meaning &quot;at&quot; to show possession while the [[Brythonic languages]] use &quot;with&quot;. The Goidelic languages, however, do use the preposition &quot;with&quot; to express &quot;belong to&quot; (Irish &quot;is liom an leabhar&quot;, Scottish &quot;is leam an leabhar&quot;, Manx &quot;she lhiam yn lioar&quot; The book belongs to me).

Note also that the above examples of Welsh are the [[Literary Welsh morphology#Prepositions|formal written language]]. The order and preposition may differ slightly in [[Colloquial Welsh morphology#Prepositions|colloquial Welsh]] (Formal &quot;mae car gennym&quot;, North Wales &quot;mae gynnon ni gar&quot;, South Wales &quot;mae car gyda ni&quot;). &lt;/span&gt;

===Initial consonant mutations===
{{Main|Breton mutations}}
Breton has four initial [[consonant mutation]]s: though modern Breton lost the nasal mutation of [[Welsh language|Welsh]], it also has a 'hard' mutation, in which voiced stops become voiceless, and a 'mixed' mutation, which is a mixture of hard and soft mutations.

==Vocabulary==
&lt;!-- This section should contain a discussion of any special features of the vocabulary (or lexicon) of the language, like if it contains a large number of borrowed words or a different set of words for different politeness levels, taboo groups, etc. --&gt;
&lt;!-- This paragraph underneath doesn't deal with Breton vocabulary but English vocabulary. This paragraph belongs on a page about English borrowings, not on a page about the Breton language. --&gt;
*'''Some words that passed into French and in English'''
The English words ''[[dolmen]]'' and ''[[menhir]]'' have been borrowed from French, which supposedly took them from Breton. However, this is uncertain: for instance, ''menhir'' is ''peulvan'' or ''maen hir'' (&quot;long stone&quot;), ''maen sav'' (&quot;straight stone&quot;) (two words : noun + adjective) in Breton. ''Dolmen'' is a misconstructed word (it should be ''taol-'''''v'''''aen''). Some studies state{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that these words were borrowed from [[Cornish language|Cornish]]. ''Maen hir'' can be directly translated from Welsh as &quot;long stone&quot; (which is exactly what a menhir or maen hir is).

to jabber in foreign tongue : French ''baragouiner'' from ''bara'' 'bread' and ''gwin'' 'wine'.

sea gull (big one) : French ''goéland'' from ''gwelan'' same root as gull &lt; Welsh ''gwylan''

==Orthography==

The first Breton texts, contained in the Leyde manuscript, were written at the end of the 8th century: fifty years prior to the [[Strasbourg Oaths]], considered to be the earliest example of [[French language|French]]. After centuries of orthography [[calque]]d on the French model, in the 1830s Le Gonidec created a modern phonetic system.

During the early years of the 20th century, a group of writers known as ''Emglev ar Skrivanerien'' elaborated and reformed Le Gonidec's system, making it more suitable as a super-dialectal representation of the dialects of [[Cornouaille]], Leon and Trégor. This '''KLT''' (from '''''K'''ernev'', '''''L'''eon'' and '''''T'''reger'', the Breton names for Cornouaille, Leon and Trégor) orthography was established in 1911. At the same time writers using the more divergent Vannetais dialect developed a system also based on that of Le Gonidec to represent their dialect.

Following proposals made during the 1920s, the KLT and Vannetais orthographies were merged in 1941 to create an orthographic system that could represent all four dialects. One of the most salient features of this ''{{lang|br|Peurunvan}}'' (&quot;wholly unified&quot;) orthography was the inclusion of the ''zh'' [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]], which represents a /h/ in Vannetais, which corresponds to a /z/ in the KLT dialects.

In 1955 a new orthography was proposed by [[François Falc'hun]] and the group Emgleo Breiz, which had the aim of using a set of graphemes closer to the conventions of French. This ''Orthographie Universitaire'' (&quot;University Orthography&quot;, known in Breton as ''Skolveurieg'') was given official recognition by the French authorities as the &quot;official orthography of Breton in French education&quot;. This orthography was met with strong opposition and is largely only used by the magazine ''Brud Nevez'' and the publishing house Emgléo Breiz.

Between 1971 and 1974 a new standard orthography has been devised&amp;nbsp;— the ''etrerannyezhel'' or ''interdialectale''. This system is based on derivation of the words.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Today the majority of writers continue to use the Peurunvan orthography, including most Breton-language schools. See [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Breton/Breton_pronunciation] for an introduction to Breton orthography and pronunciation.

===Differences between ''Skolveurieg'' and ''Peurunvan''===
Both orthographies make use of the [[Latin alphabet]], with the supplemental signs ''â, ê, î, ñ, ô, û, ù, ü'', and ''é,'' which is used only in Skolveurieg.

Differences between the two systems are particularly noticeable in word endings. In Peurunvan, final [[obstruent]]s, which are devoiced in absolute final position and voiced in [[sandhi]], before voiced sounds are represented by a grapheme that indicates a voiceless sound. In OU they are written as voiced but represented as voiceless before suffixes: '''braz''' ''big'', '''brasoc'h''' ''bigger''.

In addition, Peurunvan maintains the KLT convention, which distinguishes noun/adjective pairs with nouns written with a final voiced consonant and adjectives with a voiceless one. There is, however, no distinction in pronunciation, e.g. '''brezhoneg''' ''Breton language'' vs. '''brezhonek''' ''Breton (adj)''.

[[Image:Dun Carloway.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Dun Carloway]] broch, [[Lewis]], Scotland]]
A '''Broch''' is an [[Iron Age]] [[drystone]] hollow-walled structure of a type found only in [[Scotland]]. Brochs include some of the most sophisticated examples of drystone architecture ever created, and belong to the classification &quot;complex [[atlantic roundhouse|Atlantic Roundhouse]]&quot; devised by Scottish [[archaeologist]]s in the 1980s. Their origin is a matter of some controversy. The theory that they were defensive military structures is not accepted by many modern archaeologists (see the 'general references' below), while the alternative notion that they were farmhouses is dismissed by some others. Although most stand alone in the landscape, some examples exist of brochs surrounded by clusters of smaller dwellings. There is controversy about whether or not brochs were roofed.

==Origin and definition==
The word ''broch'' is derived from Lowland Scots 'brough', meaning (among other things) fort. In the mid-19th century Scottish antiquaries called brochs 'burgs', after [[Old Norse]] ''borg'', with the same meaning. Place names in Scandinavian Scotland such as Burgawater and Burgan show that O.N. ''borg'' was the original word used for these structures in the north. Brochs are often referred to as 'duns' in the west. The antiquaries began to use the spelling 'broch' in the 1870s.

A precise definition for the word has proven to be elusive. Brochs are the most spectacular of a complex class of roundhouse buildings found throughout &quot;Atlantic Scotland&quot;. The Shetland Amenity Trust lists about 120 sites in [[Shetland]] as candidate brochs, perhaps an overestimate, while ''The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland'' identifies a total of 571 candidate broch sites throughout the country. Researcher Euan MacKie has proposed a much smaller total for Scotland of 104.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2003) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broch of Mousa - geograph.org.uk - 2800.jpg|thumb|left|[[Broch of Mousa]]]]
The origin of brochs is a subject of continuing research. Sixty years ago most archaeologists believed that brochs, usually regarded as castles, were built by immigrants who had been displaced and pushed northward first by the intrusions of Belgic tribes into what is now south-east England towards the end of the second century BC, and later by the [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman invasion]] of southern Britain from AD 43 onwards. Yet there is now little doubt that the hollow-walled broch tower was purely an invention from what is now modern Scotland, or that even the kinds of pottery found within them that most resembled south Britain styles were local hybrid forms. The first of the modern review articles on the subject (MacKie 1965)&lt;ref&gt;MacKie, E. W. (1965) 'The origin and development of the broch and wheelhouse building cultures of the Scottish Iron Age'. Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 31, pages 93-146.&lt;/ref&gt; did not, as is commonly believed, propose that brochs were built by immigrants, but rather that a hybrid culture of a small number of immigrants with the native population of the Hebrides produced them in the first century BC, basing them on earlier, simpler promontory forts. This view contrasted for example with that of Sir Lindsay Scott, who argued&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Sir Lindsay (1947), ‘The problem of the brochs’, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 13, pages 1-36.&lt;/ref&gt;—following Childe (1935)&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V. G. (1935) ''The Prehistory of Scotland''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;—for a wholesale migration into Atlantic Scotland of people from south-west England.

MacKie's theory has fallen from favour too, mainly because from the 1970s there was a general move away from 'diffusionist' explanations in archaeology towards those involving exclusively indigenous development. Meanwhile, the increasing number (albeit still pitifully few) of [[radiocarbon]] dates for the primary use of brochs (as opposed to their later, secondary use) still suggests that most of the towers were built in the 1st centuries BC and AD.&lt;ref&gt;Parker Pearson, M. &amp; Sharples, N. ''et al.'' (1999) ''Between land and sea: excavations at Dun Vulan, South Uist''. Sheffield.&lt;/ref&gt; A few such dates may be earlier, notably the one proposed for [[Old Scatness Broch]] in Shetland, where a sheep bone dating to 390–200 BC has been reported&lt;ref&gt;Dockrill, S. J., Outram, Z. and Batt, C. M. (2006) Time and place: a new chronology for the origin of the broch based on the scientific dating programme at the Old Scatness Broch, Shetland, ''PSAS'', v. 136, p. 89-110, ISSN 0081-1564&lt;/ref&gt; The other broch claimed to be substantially older than the 1st century BC is Crosskirk in Caithness but a recent review of the evidence suggests that it cannot plausibly be assigned a date earlier than the 1st centuries BC/AD&lt;ref&gt;MacKie, E. W. (2007) ''The Roundhouses, Brochs and Wheelhouses of Atlantic Scotland c. 700 BC - AD 500: architecture and material culture. Part 2 The Mainland and the Western Islands''. British Archaeological Reports British Series. Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the C14 dates for the Shetland sites see [http://www.shetland-heritage.co.uk/amenitytrust/archaeology/scatness/scatness_2002.html Shetland Amenity Trust] Retrieved 14 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
[[Image:Map-brochs.png|thumb|150px|right|Global overview of the distribution of brochs.]]
The distribution of brochs is centred on northern Scotland. [[Caithness]], [[Sutherland]] and the [[Northern Isles]] have the densest concentrations, but there are also a great many examples in the west of Scotland and the [[Hebrides]].

Although mainly concentrated in the northern Highlands and the Islands, a few examples occur in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] (for example [[Edin's Hall Broch]]), on the west coast of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and near [[Stirling]]. This small group of southern brochs has never been satisfactorily explained.

==Purposes==
[[File:Kilphedir broch.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The remains of Kilphedir broch, [[Sutherland]], are surrounded by massive earthworks.]] The original interpretation of brochs, favoured by nineteenth century antiquarians, was that they were defensive structures, places of refuge for the community and their livestock. They were sometimes regarded as the work of Danes or Picts.

From the 1930s to the 1960s, archaeologists like [[V. Gordon Childe]] and later John Hamilton&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, J.R.C. (1968) ''Excavations at Clickhimin, Shetland''. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; regarded them as castles where local landowners held sway over a subject population.

The castle theory fell from favour among Scottish archaeologists in the 1980s, due to a lack of supporting archaeological evidence. These archaeologists suggested that defensibility was never a major concern in the siting of a broch, and argued that they may have been the &quot;[[stately home]]s&quot; of their time, objects of prestige and very visible demonstrations of superiority for important families (Armit 2003). Once again, however, there is a lack of archaeological proof for this reconstruction, and the sheer number of brochs, sometimes in places with a lack of good land, makes it problematical.

Brochs' close groupings and profusion in many areas may indeed suggest that they had a primarily defensive or even offensive function. Some of them were sited beside precipitous cliffs and were protected by large ramparts, artificial or natural: a good example is at Burland near Gulberwick in [[Shetland]], on a clifftop and cut off from the mainland by huge ditches. Often they are at key strategic points. In [[Shetland]] they sometimes cluster on each side of narrow stretches of water: the broch of [[Mousa]], for instance, is directly opposite another at Burraland in Sandwick. In [[Orkney]] there are more than a dozen on the facing shores of Eynhallow Sound, and many at the exits and entrances of the great harbour of [[Scapa Flow]]. In [[Sutherland]] quite a few are placed along the sides and at the mouths of deep valleys. Writing in 1956 John Stewart suggested that brochs were forts put up by a military society to scan and protect the countryside and seas.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. (1956) ''An Outline of Shetland Archaeology'', Lerwick : Shetland Times Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, some archaeologists consider broch sites individually, doubting that there ever was a single common purpose for which every broch was constructed. There are differences between the various areas in which brochs are found, with regard to position, dimensions and likely status. For example, the broch 'villages' which occur at a few places in [[Orkney]] have no parallel in the [[Western Isles]].

==Structures==
Brochs vary from 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;metres (16–50&amp;nbsp;ft) in internal diameter, with 3&amp;nbsp;metre (10&amp;nbsp;ft) thick walls. On average, the walls only survive to a few metres. There are five extant examples of towers with significantly higher walls: Dun Carloway on [[Lewis]], Dun Telve and Dun Troddan in [[Glenelg, Scotland|Glenelg]], [[Broch of Mousa|Mousa]] in [[Shetland]] and [[Dun Dornaigil]] in Sutherland, all of whose walls exceed 6.5&amp;nbsp;m (21&amp;nbsp;ft) in height.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2003) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Mousa's walls are the best preserved and are still 13&amp;nbsp;m tall, however it is not clear how many brochs originally stood this high. A frequent characteristic is that the walls are galleried (the outer and inner wall skins are separate but tied together with linking stone slabs, with an open space between). These linking slabs may in some cases have served as steps to higher floors. Beside the door, it is normal for there to be a cell breaking off from the passage; this is known as the guard cell. It has been found in some Shetland brochs that guard cells in entrance passageways are close to large door-check stones. Though there was much argument in the past, it is now generally accepted that brochs were roofed, probably with a conical timber framed roof covered with a locally sourced thatch. The evidence for this assertion is still fairly scanty, though excavations at Dun Bharabhat, Lewis, have supported it. The main difficulty with this interpretation continues to be the potential source of structural timber, though bog and driftwood may have been plentiful sources.

On the islands of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] there are very few cells at [[ground floor]]. However, most brochs have scarcements (ledges) which would have allowed the construction of a very sturdy wooden first floor (first spotted by the antiquary George Low in [[Shetland]] in 1774), and excavations at Loch na Berie on the Isle of Lewis show signs of a further, second floor (e.g. stairs on the first floor, which head upwards). Some brochs such as Dun Dornaigill and [[Culswick]] in Shetland have unusual triangular lintels above the entrance door.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=1252119992 &quot;Dun Dornaigil&quot;] The Megalithic Portal. Retrieved 11 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockstanza.info/node/11 &quot;Culswick&quot;] RockStanza. Retrieved 11 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the case of [[Old Scatness]] in [[Shetland]] (near [[Jarlshof]] and [[Burroughston Broch|Burroughston]] on [[Shapinsay]], brochs were sometimes located close to [[arable land]] and a [[water supply|source of water]] (some have wells or natural springs rising within their central space).&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (Oct. 7, 2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=7891 ''Burroughston Broch''] The Megalithic Portal. Retrieved 11 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, on the other hand, they were sited in wilderness areas (e.g. [[Levenwick]] and [[Culswick]] in [[Shetland]], [[Castle Cole]] in [[Sutherland]]). Brochs are often built beside the sea ([[Carn Liath (broch)|Carn Liath]], Sutherland); sometimes they are on islands in [[lochs]] (e.g. [[Clickimin]] in [[Shetland]]).

About 20 Orcadian broch sites include small settlements of stone buildings surrounding the main tower. Examples include Howe, near [[Stromness]], [[Gurness Broch]] in the north west of [[Mainland, Orkney]], Midhowe on [[Rousay]] and Lingro near [[Kirkwall]] (destroyed in the 1980s). There are &quot;broch village&quot; sites in Caithness, but elsewhere they are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2003) p. 95-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most brochs are unexcavated&lt;ref&gt;Armit (2003) p. 51 notes that of 140 Atlantic roundhouses in the [[Outer Hebrides]] only 14 have been &quot;at least partially excavated&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those that have been properly examined show that they continued in use for many centuries, although the interiors were often modified and changed, and they underwent many phases of habitation and abandonment. The end of the broch period par excellence seems to have come around AD 200-300.

The skills involved in broch building are currently being explored by drystone dyker Irwin Campbell&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brochbuild.co.uk/ Irwin Campbell] brochbuild.co.uk. Retrieved 11 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and AOC Archaeology Ltd., based in Edinburgh.

He gained prominence in the 1970s for playing Jodie Dallas on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' and became a Hollywood film star during the late 1980s and 1990s, appearing in the critical and box office successes ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' and ''[[City Slickers]]''. He has hosted the [[Academy Awards]] eight times.

==Early life==
Crystal was born in the Doctor's Hospital in [[Manhattan]] and grew up in [[Long Beach, New York]], the son of Helen (née Gabler), a housewife, and Jack Crystal, a record company executive and producer of [[jazz]] records, who owned and operated the Commodore Record store.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Billy Crystal Biography | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/61/Billy-Crystal.html | work=filmreference.com | accessdate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/articles/arti0102_03.htm | title=Jack Crystal: A Man To Remember | first=Joe | last=Kane | accessdate=January 16, 2008 | work=Allaboutjazz}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle was musician and songwriter [[Milt Gabler]], and his brother, Richard &quot;Rip&quot; Crystal, is a television producer. Crystal grew up in a Jewish family that he has described as &quot;large&quot; and &quot;loving&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; [[700 Sundays by Billy Crystal]]{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/06/sunday/main1015865.shtml | date=November 6, 2005 | title=Life Is Short, Laugh Hard | work=CBS News | first=Rita | last=Braver}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billie Holiday]] was one of Crystal's babysitters during his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000345/bio| title=Billy Crystal: Biography | first= | last= | accessdate=March 30, 2011 | work=[[IMDB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from [[Long Beach High School (New York)|Long Beach High School]], Crystal attended [[Marshall University]] in [[Huntington, West Virginia]], on a baseball scholarship, having learned the game from his father, who pitched for [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]]. Crystal never played a game at Marshall because the program was suspended during his freshman year. He did not return as a sophomore, staying back in New York with his future wife. He then went on to [[Nassau Community College]], and later attended [[New York University]], where he graduated with a B.F.A. from NYU's [[Tisch School of the Arts]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800015850/bio | title=Billy Crystal Biography | work=Yahoo! Movies | accessdate = January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the Editor-in-Chief of the [[BG News]] from 1969–70.

==Career==
===Television===
Crystal returned to New York and performed regularly at ''[[The Improv]]'' and ''[[Catch a Rising Star]]''. He studied film and television direction under [[Martin Scorsese]] at [[New York University]]. In 1976, Crystal appeared on an episode of ''[[All in the Family]]''. He was on the dais for the [[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]] of Muhammad Ali on February 19, 1976, where he did [[impression]]s of both Ali and sportscaster [[Howard Cosell]]. He was scheduled to appear on the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (October 11, 1975), but his sketch was cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Billy Crystal, 2nd Visit | series = Inside the Actors Studio | airdate = October 8, 2007 | url = http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guest/Billy_Crystal_-_2nd_Visit | network = Bravo | season = 13 | number = 1307 | credits = Lipton, James (host)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did do a stand-up bit later in that first season as &quot;Bill Crystal&quot;, on the April 17, 1976, episode. 

Crystal's earliest prominent role was as [[Jodie Dallas]] on ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', one of the first unambiguously gay characters in the cast of an American television series. He continued in the role the series' entire 1977–1981 run.

After hosting ''Saturday Night Live'' in 1984, he joined the regular cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; His most famous recurring sketch was his parody of [[Fernando Lamas]]{{ndash}} Fernando, a smarmy talk show host whose [[catch phrase]], &quot;You look... mahvelous!,&quot; became a media sensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; Crystal subsequently released an album of his stand-up material titled ''Mahvelous!'' in 1985, as well as the single &quot;You Look Marvelous&quot;, which peaked at #58 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] during the same year. Also in the 1980s, Crystal starred in an episode of [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theater]]'' as the smartest of the three little pigs.

===Acting in film and hosting the Oscars===
Crystal's first film role was in [[Joan Rivers]]'s 1978 film ''[[Rabbit Test (film)|Rabbit Test]]''. Crystal also made game show appearances such as ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[All Star Secrets]]'' and ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $20,000 Pyramid]]''. He holds the record for getting his contestant partner to the top of the pyramid in the bonus round in the fastest time, 26 seconds.

Crystal appeared briefly in [[Rob Reiner]]'s 1984 &quot;[[rockumentary]]&quot; ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' as Morty The Mime, a waiter dressed as a mime at one of Spinal Tap's parties. He shared the scene with a then-unknown, non-speaking [[Dana Carvey]]. Crystal's line in the film was &quot;Mime is money.&quot; Reiner directed Crystal again in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987).

Reiner directed Crystal for a third time in the classic romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), for which Crystal was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. Crystal then starred in the buddy comedy ''[[City Slickers]]'' (1991), which proved very successful both commercially and critically and for which Crystal was nominated for his second Golden Globe.

Following the success of these films, Crystal wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' (1992) and ''[[Forget Paris]]'' (1995). In the former, Crystal played a serious role in aging makeup, as an egotistical comedian who reflects back on his career. He directed the made-for-television movie ''[[61*]]'' (2001) based on [[Roger Maris]]'s and [[Mickey Mantle]]'s race to break [[Babe Ruth]]'s single-season home run record in 1961. This earned Crystal an [[Emmy]] nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.

Crystal has continued working in film, including ''[[Analyze This]]'' (1999) and ''[[Analyze That]]'' (2002) with [[Robert De Niro]], and in the English version of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' as the voice of [[Calcifer]]. Pixar originally approached him to provide the voice of [[Buzz Lightyear]] in ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995). He turned down that offer, but regretted it after the film became one of the most popular releases of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; Crystal later went on to provide the voice of Mike Wazowski in the Pixar film, ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), which was nominated for the inaugural [[Best Animated Feature]] Oscar.

Crystal hosted the [[Academy Awards]] broadcast in 1990–1993, 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2004; and he reportedly turned down hosting the 2006 ceremony to concentrate on his one-man show, ''700 Sundays''. His eight times as the M.C. is second only to [[Bob Hope]]'s 18 in most ceremonies hosted. At the [[83rd Academy Awards]] ceremony in 2011, he appeared as a presenter for a digitally inserted Bob Hope and before doing so was given a standing ovation. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] said when Crystal came onstage about two hours into the show, he got the first laughs of the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110227/OSCARS/110229986 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Oscars: &quot;King&quot; wins, show loses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadway===
Crystal won the 2005 [[Tony Award]] for Best Special Theatrical Event for ''700 Sundays'', a two-act, [[One-person show|one-man play]], which he conceived and wrote about his parents and his childhood growing up on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; He toured the U.S. with the show in 2006 and Australia in 2007.

Following the initial success of the play, Crystal wrote the book ''700 Sundays'' for [[Warner Books]], which was published on October 31, 2005. In conjunction with the book and the play that also paid tribute to his uncle, [[Milt Gabler]], Crystal produced two CD compilations: ''Billy Crystal Presents: The Milt Gabler Story'', which featured his uncle's most influential recordings from [[Billie Holiday]]'s &quot;[[Strange Fruit]]&quot; to &quot;[[Rock Around the Clock]]&quot; by [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]]; and ''Billy Remembers Billie'' featuring Crystal's favorite Holiday recordings.

==Philanthropy==

&lt;!-- &quot;Comic Relief&quot; in this context is a USA charity for combating homelessness; the only Wikipedia article featuring a charity by that name refers to a UK charity for combating hunger. I STRONLY suggest that someone create an article for Comic Relief USA! --&gt;

In 1986, Crystal started hosting ''[[Comic Relief (charity)#United States|Comic Relief]]'' on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; Founded by [[Bob Zmuda]], Comic Relief raises money for [[homeless]] people in the United States.

On September 6, 2005, on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', Crystal and [[Jay Leno]] were the first celebrities to sign a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle to be auctioned off for Gulf Coast relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=The Associated Press |title=Leno's autographed bike raises $500,000 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-09-30-leno-bike_x.htm | work= USAToday | date=September 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal has participated in the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] [[Museum of Tolerance]] in Los Angeles. Portraying himself in a video, Crystal introduces museum guests to the genealogy wing of the museum.

==New York baseball==
On March 12, 2008, Crystal signed a minor league contract, for a single day, to play with the [[New York Yankees]], and was invited to the team's major league spring training. He wore uniform number 60, in honor of his upcoming 60th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Billy Crystal to sign contract with Yankees | url = http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=ApQysfnqvYEYnzAzS7waMwc5nYcB?slug=ap-yankees-crystal&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns| publisher = Yahoo | date = March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13, in a spring training game against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], Crystal led off as the [[designated hitter]]. He managed to make contact, fouling a [[fastball]] up the [[first base]] line, but was eventually struck out by Pirates pitcher [[Paul Maholm]] on 6 pitches and was later replaced in the batting order by [[Johnny Damon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080313&amp;content_id=2423946&amp;vkey=spt2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy Crystal strikes out in only at-bat]&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on March 14, his 60th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/23566549/ |title=Yankees release Billy Crystal on 61st birthday - Baseball - NBCSports.com |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=March 14, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although a life-long Yankee fan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/sports/baseball/19crystal.html?_r=1&amp;8dpc | work=The New York Times | title=Feeling Lonely Behind the Facade | first=Billy | last=Crystal | date=April 19, 2009 | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is a part-owner of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], even earning a [[World Series]] ring in 2001 when the Diamondbacks beat his beloved Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Billy Crystal Strikes Out in New Career |publisher=The Insider |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/727182_Billy_Crystal_Strikes_Out_in_New_Career |date=March 14, 2008 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the movie ''City Slickers'', Crystal wears a [[New York Mets]] baseball cap.

==Personal life==
Billy Crystal and his wife Janice have two daughters, actress [[Jennifer Crystal Foley|Jennifer]] and producer Lindsay, and are now grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/celebrity-parents-billy-crystal/ &quot;Celebrity Parents: Billy Crystal&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In addition to his [[Golden Globe Award]]-nominations, [[Emmy Awards]], and [[Tony Award]], Crystal won the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show]] for ''700 Sundays'' and received the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Billy Crystal, Clearly Funny | publisher = The Washington Post | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/01/AR2007050101252.html | date = May 2, 2007 | first = Jacqueline | last = Trescott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio between the black hole [[Schwarzschild radius]] and the observer distance to it is 1:9.

{{General relativity|cTopic=Phenomena}}
A '''black hole''' is a region of space from which nothing, not even [[light]], can escape. The theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that a sufficiently compact [[mass]] will deform [[spacetime]] to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is an undetectable surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called &quot;black&quot; because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect [[black body]] in [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater.

Objects whose gravity field is too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by [[John Michell]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. The first modern solution of general relativity containing a black hole was found by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was not fully appreciated for another four decades. Long considered a mathematical curiosity, it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed black holes were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of [[neutron star]]s sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.

Black holes [[stellar black hole|of stellar mass]] are expected to form when heavy stars collapse in a [[supernova]] at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of solar masses may be formed.

Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other [[matter]]. Astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in [[binary star|binary systems]], by studying their interaction with their companion stars. There is growing consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]]. In particular, there is strong evidence of a black hole of more than 4&amp;nbsp;million [[solar mass]]es at the center of our [[Milky Way]].

The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was first put forward by [[geologist]] [[John Michell]] in a letter written to [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1783 to the [[Royal Society]]:

{{quote|If the semi-diameter of a sphere of the same density as the Sun were to exceed that of the Sun in the proportion of 500 to 1, a body falling from an infinite height towards it would have acquired at its surface greater velocity than that of light, and consequently supposing light to be attracted by the same force in proportion to its vis inertiae, with other bodies, all light emitted from such a body would be made to return towards it by its own proper gravity.|John Michell&lt;ref name=&quot;Michell1784&quot;&gt;

===General relativity===
In 1915, [[Albert Einstein]] developed his theory of [[general relativity]], having earlier shown that gravity does influence light's motion. Only a few months later, [[Karl Schwarzschild]] found a [[Schwarzschild metric|solution]] to [[Einstein field equations]], which describes the [[gravitational field]] of a [[point mass]] and a spherical mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarzschild1916&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution had a peculiar behaviour at what is now called the [[Schwarzschild radius]], where it became [[mathematical singularity|singular]], meaning that some of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the time. In 1924, [[Arthur Eddington]] showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of coordinates (see [[Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates]]), although it took until 1933 for [[Georges Lemaître]] to realize that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was an unphysical [[coordinate singularity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HooftHist&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1931, [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] calculated, using general relativity, that a non-rotating body of [[electron-degenerate matter]] above a certain limiting mass (now called the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] at 1.4 solar masses) must have an infinite density. In other words, the object must have a radius of zero.&lt;ref name=venkataraman92&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself stable because of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. But in 1939, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and others predicted that neutron stars above approximately three solar masses (the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]]) would collapse into black holes for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar, and concluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least some stars from collapsing to black holes.&lt;ref name=&quot;OV1939&quot;&gt;

Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called &quot;frozen stars,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates|Finkelstein's solution]] extended the Schwarzschild solution for the future of observers falling into a black hole. A [[Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates|complete extension]] had already been found by [[Martin Kruskal]], who was urged to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;

These results came at the beginning of the [[golden age of general relativity]], which was marked by general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research. This process was helped by the discovery of [[pulsar]]s in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, neutron stars, like black holes, were regarded as just theoretical curiosities; but the discovery of pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of compact objects that might be formed by gravitational collapse.

In this period more general black hole solutions were found. In 1963, [[Roy Kerr]] found [[Kerr metric|the exact solution]] for a [[rotating black hole]]. Two years later, [[Ezra T. Newman|Ezra Newman]] found the [[axisymmetric]] solution for a black hole that is both rotating and [[electric charge|electrically charged]].&lt;ref&gt;

The analogy was completed when Hawking, in 1974, showed that [[quantum field theory]] predicts that black holes should radiate like a [[black body]] with a temperature proportional to the [[surface gravity]] of the black hole.&lt;ref name=Hawking1974/&gt;

The term &quot;black hole&quot; was first publicly used by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] during a lecture in 1967. Although he is usually credited with coining the phrase, he always insisted that it was suggested to him by somebody else. The first recorded use of the term is in a 1964 letter by Anne Ewing to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Properties and structure==
The [[no-hair theorem]] states that, once it achieves a stable condition after formation, a black hole has only three independent physical properties: [[mass]], [[electric charge|charge]], and [[angular momentum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HeuslerNoHair&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any two black holes that share the same values for these properties, or parameters, are indistinguishable according to [[classical mechanics|classical]] (i.e. non-[[quantum mechanics|quantum]]) mechanics.

These properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole. For example, a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of [[Gauss's law]], the [[ADM mass]], far away from the black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|2004|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the angular momentum can be measured from far away using [[frame dragging]] by the [[gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]].

When an object falls into a black hole, any [[physical information|information]] about the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is lost to outside observers. The behavior of the horizon in this situation is closely analogous to that of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and [[electrical resistance]], a [[dissipative system]] (see [[membrane paradigm]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Because a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very little information about what went in. The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole horizon, including the total [[baryon number]], [[lepton number]], and all the other nearly conserved pseudo-charges of particle physics. This behavior is so puzzling that it has been called the [[black hole information loss paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Physical properties===
The simplest black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum. These black holes are often referred to as [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild black hole]]s after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution]] in 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarzschild1916&quot;/&gt; According to [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]], it is the only [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]] that is [[Spherically symmetric spacetime|spherically symmetric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=Appendix B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass. The popular notion of a black hole &quot;sucking in everything&quot; in its surroundings is therefore only correct near a black hole's horizon; far away, the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Solutions describing more general black holes also exist. [[Charged black hole]]s are described by the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]], while the [[Kerr metric]] describes a [[rotating black hole]]. The most general [[stationary spacetime|stationary]] black hole solution known is the [[Kerr–Newman metric]], which describes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum.&lt;ref name=shapiro_teukolsky1983&gt;{{cite book

While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass. In [[Planck units]], the total electric charge&amp;nbsp;''Q'' and the total angular momentum&amp;nbsp;''J'' are expected to satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;Q^2+\left ( \tfrac{J}{M} \right )^2\le M^2\, &lt;/math&gt;
for a black hole of mass ''M''. Black holes saturating this inequality are called [[extremal black hole|extremal]]. Solutions of Einstein's equations violating the inequality exist, but do not have a horizon. These solutions have [[naked singularity|naked singularities]] and are deemed ''unphysical''. The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] rules out the formation of such singularities through the gravitational collapse of [[energy conditions|realistic matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv

Due to the relatively large strength of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]], black holes forming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star.

Black holes are commonly classified according to their mass, independent of angular momentum ''J'' or electric charge ''Q''. The size of a black hole, as determined by the radius of the event horizon, or [[Schwarzschild radius]], is roughly proportional to the mass ''M'' through
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{sh} =\frac{2GM}{c^2} \approx 2.95\, \frac{M}{M_\mathrm{Sun}}~\mathrm{km,}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;sh&lt;/sub&gt; is the Schwarzschild radius and M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[solar mass|mass of the Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relation is exact only for black holes with zero charge and angular momentum, for more general black holes it can differ up to a factor of 2.
