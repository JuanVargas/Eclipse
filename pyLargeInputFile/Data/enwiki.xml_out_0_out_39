of Information Services, 1988. Bermuda&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, it is the only one to have met continuously as a legislature since its inception through to today.
[[Image:Bermuda-The State House.jpg|thumb|right|The State House, the home of Bermuda's [[Parliament of Bermuda|parliament]] 1620–1815]]

The Constitution of Bermuda came into force on 1 June 1967 and was amended in 1989 and 2003. The head of government is the [[Premier of Bermuda|premier]]. A cabinet is nominated by the premier and appointed officially by the governor. The legislative branch consists of a [[bicameral parliament]] modelled on the [[Westminster system]]. The [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] is the upper house consisting of 11 members appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier and the leader of the opposition. The [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], or lower house, has 36 members elected by the eligible voting populace in secret ballot to represent geographically defined constituencies. [[Elections in Bermuda|Elections]] must be called at no more than five-year intervals. The [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] won the most recent general election held on 18 December 2007, winning 22 of 36 seats in the House of Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sweet Victory for Brown as Dunkley Out | publisher=[[The Royal Gazette]] | date=19 December 2007 | url=http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/index.jsp | accessdate=19 Dec. 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her victory at the Progressive Labour Party delegates' conference in October 2010, the current premier is [[Paula Cox]]. The [[United Bermuda Party]] serves in [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].
The Progressive Labour Party leadership favours independence from the United Kingdom, although polls have indicated that this is not supported by the population. While a referendum in 1995 on independence was defeated by a substantial margin, the [[Bermuda Industrial Union]] and the Progressive Labour Party (then in the Opposition) had called for a boycott of the referendum, having an unquantified impact on the result.

There are few accredited diplomats in Bermuda. The United States maintains the largest diplomatic mission in Bermuda, comprising both the United States Consulate and the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Services at the [[Bermuda International Airport]]. The current U.S. Consul General is Grace Shelton, who replaced [[Gregory W. Slayton]] as the U.S. Chief of Mission in Bermuda in August 2009. Given that the United States is by far Bermuda's largest trading partner (providing over 71% of total imports, 85% of tourist visitors, and an estimated $163&amp;nbsp;billion of U.S. capital in the Bermuda insurance/re-insurance industry alone, and the fact that an estimated 5% of Bermuda residents are U.S. citizens, which represents 14% of all foreign-born persons), American diplomatic presence is seen as an important element in the Bermuda political landscape.

A [[General Election]] must be held in Bermuda every five years. Following the PLP's re-election in 2007, the next election must be held no later than 2012.

== Role in international relations ==
As an [[British overseas territory|Overseas Territory]] of the United Kingdom, Bermuda has no seat in the [[General Assembly of the United Nations|United Nations]] and is represented by Britain in matters of [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|foreign affairs]]. To promote its economic interests abroad Bermuda maintains representative offices in key influential cities such as London&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonoffice.gov.bm/ Bermuda Government office in London]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Washington D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcoffice.gov.bm/ Bermuda Government office in Washington, D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bermuda's proximity to the United States has made it the site of past summit conferences between British Prime Ministers and U.S. Presidents. The first summit was held in December 1953, at the insistence of Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], to discuss relations with the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. Participants at the conference included Churchill, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and French Premier [[Joseph Laniel]]. In 1957, a second summit conference was held; this time British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] arrived earlier than President Eisenhower, to make it clear that they were meeting on British territory, as tensions were still high regarding the previous year's conflict over the [[Suez Canal]]. It was said the two discussed the general situation of the world. Macmillan returned in 1961 for the third summit with President [[John F. Kennedy]], who was familiar with Bermuda, having made numerous personal visits. The meeting was called to discuss [[Cold War]] tensions arising from construction of the [[Berlin Wall]]. The most recent summit conference in Bermuda between the two powers occurred in 1990, when British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met U.S. President George Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Keith Forbes | title= Bermuda's distinguished visitors over the years | publisher=Royal Gazette | url= http://www.bermuda-online.org/specialvisitors.htm | accessdate= 22 Sep. 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct meetings between the President of the United States and the [[Premier of Bermuda]] have been rare. The most recent meeting was on 23 June 2008, between Premier [[Ewart Brown]] and President [[George W. Bush]]. Prior to this, the leaders of Bermuda and the United States had not met at the White House since a 1996 meeting between Premier David Saul and President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name=rg&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Kent|title=Premier meets the President | url=http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d86c3730030004&amp;sectionId=48|work=[[The Royal Gazette]] |publisher=|date=24 Jun. 2008 |accessdate=24 Jul. 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four men were among 22 Uyghurs who claimed to be refugees, who were captured in 2001 in Pakistan after fleeing the [[American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan]]. They were suspected of training to assist [[Taliban]]'s military. They were cleared as safe for release from Guantánamo in 2005 or 2006. But U.S. domestic law prohibited deporting them back to China, their country of citizenship, because the U.S. government determined that China was likely to abuse their human rights.

In September 2008 the men were cleared of all suspicion, and Judge Ricardo Urbina in Washington ordered their release. However domestic opposition to their admittance to the United States was very strong,{{Citation needed |reason=no one protested|date=May 2010}} and, until Bermuda and [[Palau]] agreed to accept them in June 2009, the U.S. had failed to find a home for them.

The secret bilateral discussions that led to prisoner transfers between the U.S. and the devolved Bermuda government sparked diplomatic ire from the United Kingdom, which was not consulted on the move despite Bermuda being a British territory. The British Foreign Office issued the following statement: &quot;We've underlined to the Bermuda Government that they should have consulted with the United Kingdom as to whether this falls within their competence or is a security issue, for which the Bermuda Government do not have delegated responsibility. We have made clear to the Bermuda Government the need for a security assessment, which we are now helping them to carry out, and we will decide on further steps as appropriate.&quot;

== Armed forces ==
{{Main|Military of Bermuda}}
[[Image:Rembrance Day Parade Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Remembrance Day Parade, Hamilton, Bermuda]]

Once known as ''the Gibraltar of the West'', the defence of Bermuda remains the responsibility of the British government. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda became the Royal Navy's Western Atlantic headquarters, before which the Bermuda government had maintained [[militia]] for the defence of the colony. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, these militias became superfluous and were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony did raise [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the military garrison.

Due to its strategic location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval and air base (during the Second World War).

In May 1940, the U.S. requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the United Kingdom granted the U.S. base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received in exchange. However, one of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the U.S. Army built would be used jointly by the U.S. and the U.K. (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of 5.8&amp;nbsp;km² (2¼&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi, 1,400 acres) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[U.S. Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[U.S. Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[German Navy|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the U.S. Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.

The original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a seaplane base until the mid-1960s, became the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex and provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size.. An additional U.S. Navy compound known as Naval Facility Bermuda (NAVFAC Bermuda), a [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility. Although leased for 99 years, U.S. forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].

Canada, which had operated a war-time naval base, ''[[HMCS Somers Isles]]'', on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head, in the ''West End'' of the islands during this time.

In the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small [[Royal Navy]] supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS Malabar]], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.

In both World War I and World War II, Bermudians served in the British armed forces. Amongst the latter was Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest ranking soldier. After the war, he was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and children of Bermudians had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey, who, when promoted to that rank at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.

Today, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription in which balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part time, once they turn 18.

[[File:Bermudian-dollars-$50.jpg|thumb|Bermudian $50 Banknote]]
Since switching from the [[Bermudian pound]] in 1970, Bermuda's currency has been the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the US$. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy a small exchange rate for the purchase of US dollars with Bermudian dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.butterfieldbank.bm/Rates/Foreign_Exchange/home.htm Bank of Butterfield Exchange Rate Page]&lt;/ref&gt; Bermudian notes carry the image of [[HM Queen Elizabeth II]]. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority for all banknotes and coins, as well as being responsible for the regulation of financial institutions. There is a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins at the Royal Naval Dockyard Museum.

According to the Bermuda Government's Economic Statistics Division, Bermuda's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] was $5.85&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007, or $91,477 per-capita, giving Bermuda the highest GDP per capita in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette17Dec08&quot; /&gt;  According to the Bermuda Stock Exchange in 2009 Bermuda the median per capita income is much lower as these statistics represent a small number of high earners and its &quot;public debt ratios still compare quite favourably with those of €˜AA' peers&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The affordability of housing has become a prominent issue over the past few years. The [[CIA]] [[World Factbook]] lists the average cost of a house in June 2003 as $976,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; while real estate agencies have claimed that this figure had risen to $1.6&amp;nbsp;million by 2006 but has significantly been devalued since the financial crisis as large percentage of foreigners have left Bermuda for Switzerland as well as other tax havens ,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?sectionId=60&amp;articleId=7d7151330030077 &quot;Average cost of houses hits $1.6m&quot;], Jonathan Kent, ''The Royal Gazette'', 10 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and to $1.845&amp;nbsp;million by early 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bermudasun.bm/main.asp?SectionID=24&amp;SubSectionID=270&amp;ArticleID=34741&amp;TM=49374.21 &quot;Average family home now $1.8m&quot;], Meredith Ebbin, ''Bermuda Sun'', 2 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; though such high figures have been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?sectionId=65&amp;articleId=7d7161330030116 &quot;$1.6m average house price?

Bermuda is an [[offshore financial centre]], which results from its low direct [[taxation]] on personal or corporate income. The local tax system is based upon import duties, payroll taxes and [[consumption tax]]es. The legal system is derived from that of the United Kingdom, with recourse to English courts of final appeal. However, foreign private individuals cannot easily open bank accounts or subscribe to mobile phone or internet service.

As the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly developed international business economy; it is a [[financial export]]er of financial services, primarily [[insurance]], [[reinsurance]], [[investment fund]]s and [[special purpose vehicle]]s (SPV). Finance and international business now constitute the largest sector of Bermuda's economy.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt; However in September 2009, it was reported that a growing number of companies were moving from Bermuda to Ireland as part of a search for &quot;a more stable environment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent.ie |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/world/willis-moves-tax-base-here-ahead-of-us-curbs-1892709.html |title=Willis moves tax base here ahead of US curbs – World, Business |work=The Irish Independent  |date=22 Sep. 2009 |accessdate=20 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of leading international insurance companies are based in Bermuda, making the territory one of the world's largest reinsurance centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2006/10/25/73563.htm Insurance Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Those internationally owned and operated businesses that are physically based in Bermuda—of which there are around four hundred—are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies (ABIC). In total, over 1,500 exempted or international companies are currently registered with the [[Registrar of Companies]] in Bermuda.

Thanks to its favourable tax regime and a highly reactive regulatory framework Bermuda is the domicile of choice for the implementation of insurance-related innovative solutions also known as [[Alternative Risk Transfer]] (ART). ART includes [[captive insurance]]s, [[Finite Risk insurance]] and insurance [[securitisation]] such as [[Cat bonds]].

The [[Bermuda Stock Exchange]] (BSX), established in 1971, is now the world's largest fully electronic offshore securities market, with a current market capitalisation (excluding mutual funds) in excess of US$330&amp;nbsp;billion{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. There are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange, of which almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures attracted by Bermuda's regulatory environment. The Exchange specialises in listing and trading of capital market instruments such as equities, debt issues, funds (including hedge fund structures) and depository receipt programmes.

The BSX is a full member of the [[World Federation of Exchanges]] and is located in an [[OECD]] member nation. It also has Approved Stock Exchange status under Australia's Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) taxation rules and Designated Investment Exchange status by the UK's Financial Services Authority.

Tourism is Bermuda's second largest industry, with the island attracting over one-half million visitors annually, of whom more than 80% are from the United States. Other significant sources of visitors are from Canada and the United Kingdom. Tourists arrive either by cruise ship or by air at [[Bermuda International Airport]], the only airport on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070111/NEWS/101110129 Tourism in 2006, ''Royal Gazette'', 11 Jan. 2007]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
The Bermuda Education Act 1996 requires that only three categories of schools can operate in the Bermuda Education system:

* ''aided school'', has all or a part of its property vested in a body of trustees or board of governors and is partially maintained by public funding or, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, has received a grant-in-aid out of public funds.

* ''maintained school'', has the whole of its property belonging to the Government and is fully maintained by public funds.

* ''private school'', not maintained by public funds and has not, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, received any capital grant-in-aid out of public funds. The private school sector consists of 6 traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys’ school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s and in 1996, one of the maintained public schools became a private school.

Prior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated and when the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formally maintained &quot;white&quot; schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools. The rest became part of the public school system and were either aided or maintained.

At present there are 26&amp;nbsp;schools in the Bermuda Public School System, 18 of which are primary schools, five are middle schools, two senior schools and one special school. There is also an Alternative Programme provided for students with behavioural challenges who cannot function in the public mainstream. There are two aided primary schools, two aided middle schools and one aided senior school.

For higher education, the [[Bermuda College]] offers various [[associate degrees]] and other certificate programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bermuda College |url=http://www.bercol.bm/ |accessdate=10 Feb. 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda does not have any four-year colleges or universities.

In May 2009, Bermudian Government's application was approved to become a contributory member of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI). Bermuda's membership is slated to allow Bermudian students to enter the University at an agreed upon subsidised rate possibly as early as the 2009/2010 school year. UWI also agrees that their Open Campus (online degree courses) would become open to Bermudian students in the future, with Bermuda becoming the 13th country to have access to the Open Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bermuda joins the UWI Family |url=http://cavehill.uwi.edu/news/releases/release.asp?id=132 |accessdate=19 Jun. 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/article.php?news_id=17279 |title=Bermuda joins UWI |accessdate=5 Jul. 2009 |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=25 Jun. 2009 |month=06 |work=CaribbeanNetNews |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main sights==
[[Image:BDA Bermuda.jpg|thumb|One of Bermuda's pink sand beaches, at Astwood Park]]
Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, [[cerulean]] blue ocean waters are popular with tourists and many of Bermuda's hotels are located along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a designated [[World Heritage Site]]. [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers can explore numerous [[shipwreck|wrecks]] and [[coral reefs]] in relatively shallow water (typically {{convert|30|-|40|ft|0|disp=s|abbr=on}} in depth) with virtually unlimited visibility. Many nearby reefs are readily accessible from shore by [[snorkelling|snorkellers]], especially at [[Church Bay, Bermuda|Church Bay]].

Bermuda's most popular visitor attraction is the Royal Naval Dockyard, which includes the Bermuda Maritime Museum. Other attractions include the [[Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bamz.org |title=Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo |publisher=Bamz.org |date= |accessdate=20 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens, lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with its impressive [[stalactites]] and underground saltwater pools.

It is not possible to rent a car on the island; however, visitors can hire [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] for use as private transport, or use public transport.

== Fauna ==
{{Main|Flora and fauna in Bermuda}}

The only indigenous [[mammal]]s of Bermuda are five species of bats, all of which also occur in the eastern United States—''[[Lasionycteris noctivagans]]'', ''[[Lasiurus borealis]]'', ''[[Lasiurus cinereus]]'', ''[[Lasiurus seminolus]]'', and ''[[Perimyotis subflavus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grady, F.V. and Olson, S.L. 2006.

Journal of Mammalogy 87(1):148–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda includes: its national bird the [[Bermuda Petrel]], or the [[Bermuda Rock Skink]].

== Arts and culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Bermuda}}
Bermuda's culture is a mixture of the various sources of its population, though little trace remains of the various African slaves, Spanish-Caribbean, Irish, or Scots cultures evident in the 17th century, with [[Anglo-Saxon]] culture becoming dominant. Today, the only language other than English that is spoken by any substantial part of the population is Portuguese, following one hundred and sixty years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]). There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]]. A second wave of immigration from the [[West Indies]] has been sustained throughout the 20th century, although, unlike the Africans who immigrated to that area as indentured servants (or who were imported as slaves) in the 17th century, the more recent arrivals have mostly come from English speaking countries (albeit, most of the West Indian islands whose populations now speak English were then part of the [[Spanish Empire]]). This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[Calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post Second World War aviation. While Calypso music appealed more to the visitors than to the locals, [[Reggae]] has been embraced since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaican]] immigration.

Bermuda's early literary history was largely limited to non-Bermudian writers commenting on the island. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] [[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]] (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, ''Battle of the Summer Islands'' (1645).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem Hunter: ''Battle of the Summer Islands'', by Edmund Waller.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html Bartleby.com, Inc.: ''III. Writers of the Couplet. § 4. Edmund Waller.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, a large number of books were written and published locally, though few were aimed at a wider market than Bermuda (most of these being scholarly reference books, rather than creative writing). One Bermudian novelist, Brian Burland, has achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally, although the first (and undoubtedly the most important, historically) notable book credited to a Bermudian was the ''History of Mary Prince'', a slave narrative by a Bermudian woman, [[Mary Prince]], which helped to end slavery in the [[British Empire]]. Bermuda's proximity to the United States means that many aspects of US culture are reflected or incorporated into Bermudian culture. Many non-Bermudian writers have also made Bermuda their home, or have had homes here, including [[A.J. Cronin]] and [[F. Van Wyck Mason]], who wrote on Bermudian subjects.

Dance and [[Music of Bermuda|music]] are important in Bermuda. The dances of the colourful ''Gombey Dancers'', seen at many events, are heavily influenced by African cultural traditions.

Bermuda has produced, or been home, to actors (such as [[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]], [[Diana Dill]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Will Kempe (actor)|Will Kempe]], and most famously, [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]). Noted musicians have included local icons [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], who performed for many decades in both Bermuda and The United States (and appearing on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s televised variety show), jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]], pop singer [[Heather Nova]] and more recently dancehall artist [[Collie Buddz]]. In 1979, [[Gina Swainson]] was crowned &quot;[[Miss World]]&quot;.

Every year Bermuda hosts an international film festival, which shows many independent films. One of the festival's founders is film producer and director [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], co-founder of the [[Rankin/Bass]] production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bermudafilmfest.com/ |title=Index |publisher=bermudafilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=20 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bermuda water colours painted by local artists are sold at various galleries and elaborately hand-carved cedar sculptures are another speciality. One such {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} sculpture created by Bermudian artisan Chesley Trott is on display at the airport's baggage claim area. Local artwork may also be viewed at several galleries around the island. Alfred Birdsey was one of the more famous and talented water colourists, his impressionistic landscapes of [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] and the surrounding sailboats, homes, and bays of Bermuda are world-renowned.

Every Good Friday, Bermudians of all ages build kites, usually of a traditional Bermudian type, which are flown to symbolise Christ's ascent. A [[Bermuda kite|Bermudian kite]] is made to geometric designs, quite colourful, and is an art form as much as a recreational tool. Despite this, Bermudian kites are very airworthy, holding world records for altitude and duration of flight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

== Sports ==
{{Main|Sports and recreation in Bermuda}}
[[Image:Bermuda shorts.jpg|thumb|Bermuda's 2004 Olympic team attired in [[Bermuda shorts]] at the opening ceremonies, as televised by [[NBC]]]]
Sport is a popular pastime in Bermuda, especially [[cricket]], [[association football|football]], [[sailing]], [[horse riding]]/[[pony racing]], [[golf]] and [[rugby union]].

[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. Bermuda's team holds the world record for conceding the highest number of [[Run (cricket)|runs]] ever in the history of the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]]. They conceded 413 runs in a 50 overs, one-day international, game against India. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], who is a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual &quot;Cup Match&quot; cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday.

Bermuda has large amount of golf courses of which some were maintained by Uighur's refugees from Guantinamo Bay. In 2007 Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16–17 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season ending tournament is between only four golfers – the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda again in 2008 and 2009. Bermudian Quinn Talbot was once the World one-armed golf champion.

The Government announced in 2006 that it will provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and [[Bermuda national football team|football]] teams. Bermuda's most prominent footballers include [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Ralph Bean (footballer)|Ralph Bean]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team in order to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team plays in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]].

[[Sailing]], [[fishing]], and [[equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport–Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year old tradition. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |date= |accessdate=20 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's Katura Horton-Perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the Olympic Games. Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, [[Clarence Hill (boxer)|Clarence Hill]], who won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also competed in Men's [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] (head first luge) at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy. Patrick Singleton placed 19th, with a final time of 1:59.81. [[Jillian Teceira]] competed in the Beijing Olympics in 2010. It is also tradition for Bermuda to march in the Opening Ceremony in Bermuda shorts, regardless of the summer or winter Olympic celebration. Bermuda also competes in the biennial [[International Island Games Association|Island Games]], which it will host in 2013.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Bermuda}}
A July 2005 estimate put Bermuda's population at 65,365. The ethnic makeup of Bermuda is 54.8% African-Caribbean,&lt;ref name=&quot;acs-aec.org&quot;/&gt; 34.1% European, and 6.4% multiracial. The islands have a small but growing Asian community. A significant segment of the population is also of Portuguese ancestry (10%), the result of immigration from Portuguese islands (especially the [[Azores]]) during the past 160 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~portwestind/diaspora/waves_of_migration.htm |title=The Portuguese of the West Indies |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=31 Jul. 2001 |accessdate=20 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some islanders, especially in [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St David's]], trace their ancestry to Native Americans. Hundreds were shipped to Bermuda, documentation supports Peruvian slaves[ MamaDo], Peruvian ancestress to many Bermudians; being brought to Bermuda in the early 19th century. The best known examples were the [[Algonquian peoples]] who were exiled from the [[New England]] colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century, notably in the aftermaths of the [[Pequot War]], and [[King Philip's War]].

Several thousand [[expatriate]] workers, principally from the UK, Canada, the West Indies, South Africa and the U.S., also reside in Bermuda, primarily engaged in specialized professions such as accounting, finance, and insurance. Others are employed in various trades, such as hotels, restaurants, construction, and landscaping services. Of the total workforce of 38,947 persons in 2005, government employment figures state that 11,223 (29 percent) are non-Bermudians.&lt;ref&gt;Bermuda ''Sun'', 4 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bordered by [[Brazil]] to the north and east, [[Paraguay]] and [[Argentina]] to the south, and [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] to the west.

Prior to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], the [[Andes|Andean]] region of Bolivia was a part of the [[Inca Empire]] - the largest state in [[Pre-Columbian America]]. The [[Spanish Empire]] conquered the region in the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial period, this territory was called ''[[Upper Peru]]'' and was under the administration of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], which included most of [[Spanish Empire|Spain's South American colonies]]. After declaring independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the [[Republic]], named for [[Simón Bolívar]], on 6 August 1825. Bolivia has struggled through periods of political instability, [[dictatorship]]s and economic woes.

Bolivia is a [[democracy|Democratic]] Republic that is divided into nine departments. Its geography is varied from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the Amazon Basin. It is a [[developing country]], with a Medium [[Human Development Index]] score, and a poverty level around 60%. Its main economic activities include [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fishing]], [[mining]], and [[manufacturing]] goods such as textiles, clothing, refined metals, and [[refinery|refined petroleum]]. Bolivia is very [[Geology of Bolivia|wealthy in minerals]], especially [[tin]].

The Bolivian population, estimated at 10&amp;nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asians]] and [[Africans]]. The main language spoken is Spanish, although the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua language]]s are also common and all three, as well as 34 other [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s, are official. The large number of different cultures within Bolivia has contributed greatly to a wide diversity in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.

==Etymology==
Bolivia was named for [[Simón Bolívar]], a leader in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://salempress.com/store/samples/great_lives_from_history_19th/great_lives_from_history_19th_bolivar.htm Simón Bolívar] Salem Press&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antonio José de Sucre]] had been given the option by Bolívar to either keep ''[[Upper Peru]]'' (present-day Bolivia) under the newly formed [[Republic of Peru]], to unite with the [[United Provinces of Rio de la Plata]], or to formally declare its independence from the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] that had dominated most of the region. Sucre opted to create a new nation and, with local support, named it in honor of Simón Bolívar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historia-bolivia.com/6-de-Agosto-Independencia-de-Bolivia/6 6 de Agosto: Independencia de Bolivia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the original name given to the newly formed country was ''Republic of Bolívar''. The name would not change to ''Bolivia'' until some days later when congressman ''Manuel Martín Cruz'' proposed: &quot;''If from [[Romulus]] comes Rome, then from [[Bolívar]] comes Bolivia''&quot; ({{lang-es|Si de Rómulo Roma, de Bolívar Bolivia}}). The name stuck and was approved by the Republic on 3 October 1825.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/01/11/what-countries-are-named-after-individuals-or-families/] What countries are named after individuals or families?&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] changed the country's name from the &quot;Republic of Bolivia&quot; to the &quot;Plurinational State of Bolivia&quot; in recognition of the multi-ethnic nature of the country and the enhanced position of Bolivia's indigenous peoples under the new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truth-out.org/topstories/120609vh03 Morales highly favoured for re-election in Bolivia] Truth Out/Associated Press 6 December [2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8729971.stm Can Bolivia’s indigenous groups dance in harmony?] BBC 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7842574.stm Bolivia poll won’t end opposition] BBC 24 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Bolivia}}
[[File:Huari-with-tiahuanaco.png|thumb|Tiwanaku at its largest territorial extent, AD 950]]
The region that is now known as Bolivia has been constantly occupied for over 2,000 years, when the Aymara arrived in the region. Present-day Aymara associate themselves with an advanced civilization situated at [[Tiwanaku]], in Western Bolivia. The capital city of Tiwanaku dates as early as 1500 BC as a small agriculturally based village.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Brian M. 'The Seventy Great Mysteries of the Ancient World: Unlocking the Secrets of Past Civilizations'. New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern [[Andes]]. According to early estimates, at its maximum extent, the city covered approximately 6.5 square kilometres, and had between 15,000 – 30,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Alan L. 'The Tiwankau: Portrait of an Andean Civilization'. Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, 1993. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; However, satellite imaging was used recently to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku, arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valley of the Spirits&quot;&gt;Kolata, Alan L. ''Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara''. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around AD 400, Tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state. Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. However, Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many aspects. In order to expand its reach Tiwanaku became very political creating colonies, trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependant), and state cults.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997&quot;&gt;McAndrews, Timothy L. et al. 'Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia'. Journal of Field Archaeology 24 (1997): 67–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire continued to grow with no end in sight. William H. Isbell states that &quot;Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between AD 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isbell, William H. 'Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon'. 731–751.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiwanaku continued to absorb cultures rather than eradicate them. Archaeologists have seen a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics in the cultures who became part of the Tiwanaku empire. Tiwanaku gained its power through the trade it implemented between all of the cities within its empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997&quot;/&gt;

The elites gained their status by the surplus of food they gained from all of the regions and then by having the ability to redistribute the food among all the people. This is where the control of [[llama]] herds became very significant to Tiwanaku. The llama herds were essential for carrying goods back and forth between the centre and the periphery as well as symbolizing the distance between the commoners and the elites. Their power continued to grow in this manner of a surplus of resources until about AD 950. At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata, Alan L. 1993&quot;&gt;Kolata, Alan L. 'The Tiwankau: Portrait of an Andean Civilization'. Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point in time there was a significant drop in precipitation for the Titicaca Basin. Some archaeologists even venture to say that a great drought occurred. As the rain became less and less many of the cities further away from Lake Titicaca began to produce fewer crops to give to the elites. As the surplus of food ran out for the elites their power began to fall. The capital city became the last place of production, due to the resiliency of the raised fields, but in the end even the intelligent design of the fields was no match for the weather. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, their main source of power, dried up. The land was not inhabited for many years after that.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata, Alan L. 1993&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Inca-expansion.png|thumb|Inca Expansion (1438–1527)]]
Between 1438 and 1527, the Incan empire, on a mass expansion, acquired much of what is now western Bolivia. The Incans would not maintain control of the region for long however, as the rapidly expanding Inca Empire was internally weak. As such, the Spanish conquest would be remarkably easy.

===Colonial period===
The Spanish conquest of the Inca empire began in 1524 and was mostly completed by 1533. The territory now called Bolivia was then known as &quot;Upper Peru&quot; and was under the authority of the Viceroy of [[Lima]]. Local government came from the [[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Audiencia de Charcas]] located in Chuquisaca (La Plata—modern [[Sucre]]). Founded in 1545 as a mining town, [[Potosí]] soon produced fabulous wealth, becoming the largest city in the New World with a population exceeding 150,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/potosi/ The High Place: Potosi]. John Demos.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 16th century Bolivian [[silver]] was an important source of revenue for the [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;MSN Encarta, [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html Conquest in the Americas]. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQDCbGf Archived] 31 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A steady stream of natives served as labor force (the Spanish employed the pre-Columbian draft system called the [[Mita (Inca)|mita]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bolivia/29.htm |title=Bolivia – Ethnic Groups |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upper Peru was bounded to [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776. [[Túpac Katari]] led the indigenous rebellion that laid siege to [[La Paz]] in March 1781, during which 20,000 people died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/~ems19/rebellions/rebellions.html Rebellions]. History Department, Duke University.&lt;/ref&gt; As Spanish royal authority weakened during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]], sentiment against colonial rule grew.

===Independence and subsequent wars===
The [[Bolivian War of Independence|struggle for independence]] started in the city of [[Sucre]] in 1809, with the [[Chuquisaca Revolution]] (Chuquisaca was then the name of the city). That revolution, which created a local government Junta, was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]], during which Bolivia actually declared independence. Both revolutions were short-lived, and defeated by the Spanish authorities, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent. Bolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]]. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by [[Antonio José de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Simón Bolívar]]. After 16 years of war the Republic was [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed]] on 6 August 1825, named Bolivia in honor of Bolívar.

In 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of [[Marshal]] [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]], invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, [[General]] [[Luis José de Orbegoso]]. Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina, Chile's ally, declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentinian expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]].

On the same field, the Chilean and Peruvian rebel army surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. In Chile, public outrage over the treaty forced the government to reject it. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.

Following the independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agustín Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. The Peruvian army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Ingavi]] on 20 November 1841, where Gamarra was killed. The Bolivian army under General [[José Ballivián]] then mounted a counter-offensive, capturing the Peruvian port of [[Arica, Chile|Arica]]. Later, both sides signed a [[peace treaty]] in 1842, putting a final end to the war.

===Economic instability and continued wars===
[[File:Bolivia Altiplano 2004.jpg|thumb|thumbnail|[[Manuel Rivera-Ortiz]]: Widow Of The Mines, Potosí, Bolivia 2004]]
A period of political and economic instability in the early to mid-19th century weakened Bolivia. Then in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83) against Chile, it lost its access to the sea and the adjoining rich ''salitre'' ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]) fields, together with the port of [[Antofagasta]].

Since independence, Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries in wars. It also lost the [[Acre (state)|state of Acre]], in the Acre War; important because this region was known for its production of rubber. Peasants and the Bolivian army fought briefly but after a few victories, and facing the prospect of a total war against Brazil, it was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]] in 1903, in which Bolivia lost this rich territory. Popular myth has it that Bolivian president Mariano Melgarejo (1864-71) traded the land for what he called &quot;a magnificent white horse&quot; and Acre was subsequently flooded by Brazilians which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with Brazil.

In the late 19th century, an increase in the world price of gold brought Bolivia relative prosperity and political stability. During the early 20th century, [[tin]] replaced gold as the country's most important source of wealth. A succession of governments controlled by the economic and social elite followed [[laissez-faire]] capitalist policies through the first thirty years of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bolivien-liest.de/en/country_en.html] Background note: Bolivia-Source-Bolivien-liest.de&lt;/ref&gt;

Living conditions of the native people, who constitute most of the population, remained deplorable. With work opportunities limited to primitive conditions in the mines and in large estates having nearly feudal status, they had no access to education, economic opportunity, and [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]]. Bolivia's defeat by Paraguay in the [[Chaco War]] (1932–35), where Bolivia lost a great part of the [[Gran Chaco]] region in dispute, marked a turning-point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harold Osborne |title=Bolivia: A Land Divided |publisher=London: Royal Institute of International Affairs |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=History World |title=History of Bolivia |publisher=National Grid for Learning |year=2004 |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ac11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Juan Forero |title=History Helps Explain Bolivia's New Boldness |work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/weekinreview/07forero.html | date=7 May 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010}} [http://www.geography.wisc.edu/archiveNews/2006/pdf/NYT-History%20Geography%20Bolivia.pdf (PDF)], University of Wisconsin–Madison, Department of Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalist Revolutionary Movement===
[[File:Llama en la laguna Colorada Potosí Bolivia.jpg|thumb|A [[llama]] in the [[Laguna Colorada]], a shallow salt lake in the southwestern Bolivian sector of the [[Altiplano]].]]

The [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (MNR) emerged as a broadly based party. Denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections, the MNR led a successful revolution in 1952. Under President [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]], the MNR, having strong popular pressure, introduced [[universal suffrage]] into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land-reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the country's largest tin mines.

12 years of tumultuous rule left the MNR divided. In 1964, a military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew President Estenssoro at the outset of his third term. The 1969 death of President [[René Barrientos Ortuño]], a former member of the junta elected president in 1966, led to a succession of weak governments. Alarmed by the rising Popular Assembly and the increase in popularity of The Presidente Juan Jose Torres, the military, the MNR, and others installed Colonel (later General) [[Hugo Banzer Suárez]] as president in 1971.

Banzer ruled with MNR support from 1971 to 1974. Then, impatient with schisms in the coalition, he replaced civilians with members of the armed forces and suspended political activities. The economy grew impressively during most of Banzer's presidency, but [[human rights]] violations and eventual fiscal crises undercut his support. He was forced to call elections in 1978, and Bolivia again entered a period of political turmoil.

===CIA activities and Che Guevara===
{{Main|CIA activities in Bolivia}}
The CIA had been active in providing finances and training to the Bolivian military in 1960s. The revolutionary leader [[Che Guevara]] was killed by a team of CIA officers and Bolivian Army on 9 October 1967 in Bolivia. CIA reported that Guevara was captured on 8 October as a result of the clash with the Cuban-led guerrillas. He had a wound in his leg, but was otherwise in fair condition. At 1150 hours on 9 October the Second Ranger Battalion received direct orders from Bolivian Army Headquarters in La Paz to kill Guevara. These orders were carried out at 1315 hours the same day with a burst of fire from an M-2 automatic rifle. [[Félix Rodríguez (Central Intelligence Agency)|Felix Rodriguez]] was a CIA officer on the team with the Bolivian Army that captured and shot Guevara.&lt;ref name=BBC-2007-10-8&gt;{{Cite journal

===Military governments: García Meza and Siles Zuazo===
Elections in 1979 and 1981 were inconclusive and marked by fraud. There were coups d'état, counter-coups, and caretaker governments. In 1980, General [[Luis García Meza Tejada]] carried out a ruthless and violent coup d'état that did not have popular support. He pacified the people by promising to remain in power only for one year. (At the end of the year, he staged a televised rally to claim popular support and announced, &quot;''Bueno, me quedo'',&quot; or, &quot;All right; I'll stay [in office].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/0120/1137626790492.html |title=Astroturfing all the way to No 1 |author=Brian Boyd |date=20 January 2006 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was deposed shortly thereafter.) His government was notorious for human-rights-abuses, [[drug-trafficking]], and economic mismanagement; during his presidency, the inflation that later crippled the Bolivian economy could already be felt. Later convicted in absentia for various crimes by attorney [[Juan del Granado]], including murder, García Meza was extradited from Brazil and began serving a 30-year prison sentence in 1995.

After a military rebellion forced out Meza in 1981, three other military governments in 14 months struggled with Bolivia's growing problems. Unrest forced the military to convoke the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]] elected in 1980 and allow it to choose a new chief executive. In October 1982, [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] again became president, 22 years after the end of his first term of office (1956–60).

===Sánchez de Lozada and Banzer: Liberalizing the economy===
[[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic reform was the &quot;capitalization&quot; program, under which investors, typically foreign, acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises, such as the state petroleum corporation, telecommunications system, airlines, [[Rail transport in Bolivia|railroad]]s, and electric utilities, in return for agreed upon capital investments.

The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent and sometimes violent protests, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare [[coca]]-growing region, from 1994 through 1996. The de Lozada government pursued a policy of offering monetary compensation for voluntary eradication of illegal coca by its growers in the Chapare region. The policy produced little net reduction in coca, and in the mid-1990s Bolivia accounted for about one-third of the world's coca that was being processed into [[cocaine]]. The coca leaf has long been part of the Bolivian culture, as indigenous workers have traditionally used the leaf for its properties as a mild stimulant and appetite suppressant.

During this time, the umbrella labor-organization of Bolivia, the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), became increasingly unable to effectively challenge government policy. A teachers' strike in 1995 was defeated because the COB could not marshal the support of many of its members, including construction and factory workers. The state also used selective martial law to keep the disruptions caused by the teachers to a minimum. The teachers were led by [[Trotskyite]]s, and were considered to be the most militant union in the COB. Their downfall was a major blow to the COB, which also became mired in internal corruption and infighting in 1996.

In the 1997 elections, General [[Hugo Banzer]], leader of the [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] party (ADN) and former dictator (1971–1978), won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. General Banzer formed a coalition of the ADN, MIR, UCS, and CONDEPA parties, which held a majority of seats in the Bolivian Congress. The Congress elected him as president, and he was inaugurated on 6 August 1997. During the election-campaign, Banzer had promised to suspend the privatization of the state-owned oil-company, YPFB. But this seemed unlikely to happen, considering Bolivia's weak position globally. The Banzer government basically continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor.

The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export-commodities, and reduced employment in the coca-sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public-sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofnations.net/southamerica/bolivia.html] History of Bolivia-Source-Historyofnations.net&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outset of his government, President Banzer launched a policy of using special police-units to physically eradicate the illegal coca of the Chapare region. The policy produced a sudden and dramatic four-year decline in Bolivia's illegal coca-crop, to the point that Bolivia became a relatively small supplier of coca for cocaine. Those left unemployed by coca-eradication streamed into the cities, especially El Alto, the slum-neighborhood of La Paz. The MIR of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the Banzer government, supporting this policy (called the Dignity Plan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://chakana.nl/files/pub/AssiesSalman_2005_Ethnicity-and-Politics-in-Bolivia.pdf] Ethnicity and Politics in Bolivia-Source-Ethnopolitics, Vol. 4, No. 3, 269–297, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the country experienced large scale protests and uprising against foreign company take over of the water resources in several regions which effectively doubled the water prices . See [[Cochabamba protests of 2000|Cochabamba Protests]]. The [[Cochabamba protests of 2000]], also known as the &quot;Cochabamba Water Wars,&quot; were a series of protests that took place in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, between January 1999 and April 2000 because of the privatization of the municipal water supply.

On 6 August 2001, Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer. He died less than a year later. Vice President [[Jorge Quiroga|Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ramírez]] completed the final year of his term.

In the June 2002 national elections, former President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (MNR) placed first with 22.5% of the vote, followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader [[Evo Morales]] ([[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement Toward Socialism]], MAS) with 20.9%. Morales edged out populist candidate [[Manfred Reyes Villa]] of the [[New Republican Force]] (NFR) by just 700 votes nationwide, earning a spot in the congressional run-off against Sánchez de Lozada on 4 August 2002.

A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of Sánchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time. The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], and social inclusion.

In 2003 the [[Bolivian gas conflict]] broke out. On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes which erupted when a caravan of oil trucks escorted by police and soldiers deploying tanks and heavy-caliber machine guns tried to breach a barricade. On 17 October 2003 Evo Morales' supporters from [[Cochabamba]] tried to march into [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], the largest city of the eastern lowlands where support was strong for the president. They were turned back. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, Sanchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.

In March 2004, the new president Carlos Mesa announced that his government would hold a series of rallies around the country, and at its embassies abroad, demanding that Chile return to Bolivia a stretch of seacoast that the country lost in 1884 after the end of the War of the Pacific. Chile has traditionally refused to negotiate on the issue, but Mesa nonetheless made this policy a central point of his administration.

However, the country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, [[Eduardo Rodríguez]], was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa.

===''Plan de Todos''===

Mobilizing against [[neoliberalism]] as a common enemy of the people, the indigenous population of the [[Andes|Andean]] region was able to achieve widespread government reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucero|first=José Antonio|title=Decades Lost and Won: The Articulations of Indigenous Movements and Multicultural Neoliberalism in theAndes|editor=Phil Oxhorn, Kenneth Roberts, and John Burdick|publisher=Palgrave|date=Forthcoming|series=Beyond Neoliberalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivia, in particular, was quite successful due to the prominence of an indigenous population and the persistence of reformist policies. In 1993, [[Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada]] ran for [[President of Bolivia|president]] in alliance with the [[Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari|Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement]], which inspired indigenous-sensitive and multicultural-aware policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact94/wf950032.txt|title=1994 CIA World FactBook|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (colloquially known as Goni) was able to shift Bolivian society by selling state firms and constitutionally acknowledging the existence of a multicultural and multiethnic population. Current development has led to a neoliberal citizenship regime in which [[civil rights]] are expressed through [[private property]] ownership, formal democracy and [[Representative democracy|representation]], and an investment in the maintaining of infrastructure.

In the 1990s, Bolivia introduced, the ''Plan de Todos'', which led to the decentralization of government, introduction of [[intercultural bilingual education]], implementation of [[Agriculture|agrarian]] [[legislation]], and [[privatization]] of state owned businesses. The ''Plan de Todos'' main incentive was to encourage popular participation among the [[Demographics of Bolivia|Bolivian people]]. The law recognizes the existence of [[barrio]]s and rural communities as [[Territorially Based Organizations (Bolivia)|Territorially Based Organizations]] (TBOs) and has oversight boards known as ''rómiles de agilancia'', or vigilance committees, that are responsible for overseeing [[Local government|municipal government]]s and planning projects. The ''Plan'' formally acknowledged the existence of 311 [[Municipality|municipalities]], which benefited directly based on the size of their populations. The ''Plan de Todos'' inspired the development of a [[Democratic capitalism|market democracy]] with minimally regulated capitalist economy. The ''Plan'' explicitly stated that Bolivian citizens would own a minimum of 51% of enterprises; under the Plan, most [[Government-owned corporation|state owned enterprises]] (SOEs), besides mines, were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia de la República de Bolivia|url=http://www.mirabolivia.com/edu/historia.htm|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This privatization of SOEs led to innovative neoliberal structuring that acknowledged a diverse population within Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118840742/abstract|title=Restructuring Citizenship in Bolivia: El Plan de Todos.|last=Kohl|first=Benjamin |accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law of Popular Participation (Bolivia)|Law of Popular Participation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=1997 Oct. http://www.latautonomy.org/LeyPP2a.PDF|title=Ley de Participación Popular y Movimiento Popular en Argentina|last=Ströbele|first=Juliana |language=Spanish|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave municipalities the responsibility of maintaining various infrastructures (and offering services): health, education, systems of irrigation, which stripped the responsibility away from the state. The state provides municipalities with twenty percent of federal [[tax revenue]] so that each municipality can adequately maintain these infrastructures. The Law also redistributes political power to the local level.

===The Morales administration===
{{main|Presidency of Evo Morales}}
[[File:La paz Bolivia view 2008.jpg|thumb|[[La Paz]] skyline. The city is the highest capital in the world.]]

The two main candidates for the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2005|2005 Bolivian presidential election]] held on 18 December 2005 were [[Evo Morales|Juan Evo Morales Ayma]] of the MAS Party and [[Jorge Quiroga]], leader of the [[Social and Democratic Power]] (PODEMOS) Party and former head of the [[Nationalist Democratic Action|Acción Democrática Nacionalista]] (ADN) Party. Morales won the election with 53.7% of the votes, an [[absolute majority]], unusual in Bolivian elections. He was sworn in on 22 January 2006, for a five-year term. Prior to his official inauguration in La Paz, he was inaugurated in an [[Aymara people|Aymara]] ritual at the archeological site of [[Tiwanaku]] before a crowd of thousands of Aymara people and representatives of leftist movements from across Latin America. Though highly symbolic, this ritual was not historically based and primarily represented native Aymaras — not the main Quechua-speaking population. Since the Spanish conquest in the early 16th century, this region of South America, where there is a majority native population, has been ruled mostly by descendants of European immigrants.

On 1 May 2006, Morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to [[Bolivian gas conflict|re-nationalize Bolivian hydrocarbon assets]]. While stating that the initiative would not be an expropriation, Morales sent Bolivian troops to occupy 56 gas installations simultaneously, including the two [[Petrobras]]-owned refineries which provide over 90% of Bolivia's refining-capacity. All foreign energy firms were required to sign new contracts within 180 days giving Bolivia majority ownership, and up to 82% of revenues for the largest natural gas fields. All such firms signed contracts. Reports from the Bolivian government and the companies involved are contradictory as to plans for future investment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

By far the biggest customer for Bolivian hydrocarbons has been Brazil, which imports two-thirds of Bolivia's natural gas via [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s operated by the semi-private Petrobras. Since gas can only be exported from landlocked Bolivia via Petrobras' large (and expensive) pipelines, the supplier and customer are strongly linked. Petrobras has announced plans to produce enough natural gas by 2011 to replace that now supplied by Bolivia. Bolivia's position is strengthened by the knowledge that hydrocarbon reserves are more highly valued now than at the times of previous nationalizations, and by the pledged support of President [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]].

Fulfilling a campaign promise, Morales opened on 6 August 2006, the [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly]] to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5251306.stm |title=– Push for new Bolivia constitution |publisher=BBC News |date=6 August 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems immediately arose when, unable to garner the two-thirds votes needed to include controversial provisions in the constitutional draft, Morales' party announced that only a simple majority would be needed to draft individual articles while two-thirds needed to pass the document in full. Violent protests arose in December 2006 in parts of the country for both two-thirds and departmental autonomy, mostly in the eastern third of the country, where much of the hydrocarbon wealth is located. MAS and its supports believed two-thirds voting rules would give an effective veto for all constitutional changes to the conservative minority.

In August 2007, more conflicts arose in Sucre, as the city demanded the discussion of the seat of government inside the assembly, hoping the executive and legislative branch could return to the city, but assembly and the government said this demand was overwhelmingly impractical and politically undesirable. The conflict turned into violence, and the assembly was moved to a military area in Oruro. Although the main opposition party boycotted the session, a constitutional draft was approved on 24 November.

In May 2008, Evo Morales was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Bolivia has ratified the treaty.

In the 2009 national general elections, Evo Morales was re-elected with 64.22% of the vote. His party, [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]], also won a two-thirds majority in both houses of the [[National Congress of Bolivia|National Congress]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Bolivia}}
[[File:Bl-map.png|right|250px|thumb|Map of Bolivia]]
At {{convert|1098580|km2|sqmi}}, Bolivia is the world's 28th-largest country.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook. Retrieved from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html.&lt;/ref&gt; It lies between latitudes [[9th parallel south|9°]] and [[23rd parallel south|23°S]], and longitudes [[57th meridian west|57°]] and [[70th meridian west|70°W]].

Bolivia has been a landlocked nation since 1879, when it lost its coastal department of [[Antofagasta Region|Litoral]] to [[Chile]] in the [[War of the Pacific]]. However, it does have access to the Atlantic via the [[Paraguay River]].

Many ecological zones are represented within Bolivia's territory. The western highlands of the country are situated in the [[Andes]] and include the Bolivian [[Altiplano]]. The eastern lowlands include large sections of Amazonian [[rainforest]]s and the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco Plain]]. The highest peak is [[Nevado Sajama]] at {{convert|6542|m|ft|abbr=off}} located in the [[Oruro Department]]. [[Lake Titicaca]] is located on the border between Bolivia and Peru. The [[Salar de Uyuni]], the world's largest [[salt flat]], lies in the southwest corner of the country, in [[Potosí Department]].

===Climate===
[[Image:Dust Storm over Bolivia.jpg|thumb|upright|Dust Storm over Bolivia.]]

The weather in Bolivia can vary drastically from one climatic zone to another. The summer months in Bolivia are November through March. The weather is typically warmer and wetter during these months. April through October, the winter months, are typically colder and drier.

In the highlands, the weather can be very cold and temperatures frequently go below zero at night, especially on the [[Altiplano]]. Snow is common in Potosí during the winter months and sometimes also falls on La Paz and Oruro. In contrast, winter in Sucre, Cochabamba and Tarija on the Cordillera Real is a time of blue skies and comfortable temperatures.

The weather in the rainforest is usually very hot and is often very wet. The drier period of the year is May to October. The section of the rainforest that borders the Cordillera Real of the Andes Mountains is a bit cooler, but still very wet. As altitude declines, the temperature rises. Additionally many rivers and aquatic zones will dry up very noticeably in winter and then flood in summer creating an unpredictable landscape.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Bolivia}}
The [[geology of Bolivia]] compromises a variety of different [[lithology|lithologies]] as well as [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] and sedimentary environments. On a synoptic scale geological units coincide with topographical units, to begin the country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the [[subduction]] processes in the Pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable [[platform (geology)|platforms]] and [[shield (geology)|shields]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Bolivia}}
Bolivia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in [[Latin America]], despite being rich in [[natural resource]]s. Bolivia's 2002 gross domestic product (GDP) totaled USD $7.9&amp;nbsp;billion. Economic growth is about 2.5% per year, and inflation was expected to be between 3% and 4% in 2002 (it was under 2% in 2001). Bolivia was rated 'Repressed' by the 2010 [[Index of Economic Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/Ranking.aspx |title=Country rankings for trade, business, fiscal, monetary, financial, labor and investment freedoms |publisher=Heritage.org |date= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite a series of mostly political setbacks, between 2006 and 2009 the Morales administration has spurred growth higher than at any point in the preceding 30 years. The growth was accompanied by a moderate decrease in inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/bolivian-economy-during-morales-administration/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cochabamba1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cochabamba]]]]

Bolivia's current economic situation remains lackluster, a factor that can be linked to several factors from the past three decades. The first major blow to the Bolivian economy came with a dramatic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s, which impacted one of Bolivia's main sources of income and one of its major mining-industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crabtree | first=J. | coauthors = Buffy, G.; Pearce, J. | title=The Great Tin Crash: Bolivia and the World Tin Market | journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=174–175 |year=1988 | doi=10.2307/3338459 | publisher=Bulletin of Latin American Research, Vol. 7, No. 1 | jstor=3338459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second major economic blow came at the end of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s as economic aid was withdrawn by western countries who had previously tried to keep a market-liberal regime in power through financial support.

Since 1985, the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity. A major reform of the customs service in recent years has significantly improved transparency in this area.
Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-liberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment, and foreign ownership of companies enjoys virtually no restrictions in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35751.htm#econ] Economy of Bolivia-Source-US State Government&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolivia has the second largest [[natural gas]] reserves in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7607158.stm |title=Anti-Morales protests hit Bolivia |publisher=BBC News |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has a long-term sales-agreement to sell natural gas to Brazil through 2019. The government held a binding referendum in 2005 on the Hydrocarbon Law.

The US Geological Service estimates that Bolivia has 5.4&amp;nbsp;million cubic tonnes of [[lithium]] which represents 50%–70% of world reserves. The light metal is used to make high-capacity batteries used in electric cars and such. The spinoff effect of lithium mining could cause Bolivia to become the &quot;Saudi Arabia of the Green World.&quot; However, to mine for it would involve disturbing the country's salt flats (called [[Salar de Uyuni]]), an important natural feature which boosts tourism in the region. The government does not want to destroy this unique natural landscape, to meet the rising world demand for lithium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7607624.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Bolivia's lithium mining dilemma | date=10 September 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000, Hugo Banzer, the former President of Bolivia, signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia's fourth-largest city, [[Cochabamba]]. Shortly thereafter, the company tripled the water rates in that city, an action which resulted in [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests and rioting]] among those who could no longer afford clean water.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Hattam, &quot;[http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200109/lol1.asp &quot;Who Owns Water?&quot;] ''Sierra'', September 2001, v.86, iss.5, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PBS Frontline/World [http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bolivia/ &quot;Leasing the Rain&quot;], Video, June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst Bolivia's nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over the state of the economy, the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the water contract.

Bolivian exports were $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2002, from a low of $652&amp;nbsp;million in 1991. Imports were $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion in 2002. Bolivian [[tariff]]s are a uniformly low 10%, with capital equipment charged only 5%. Bolivia's trade-deficit was $460&amp;nbsp;million in 2002.

[[File:Piles of Salt Salar de Uyuni Bolivia Luca Galuzzi 2006 a.jpg|thumb|right|Salt mounds in [[Salar de Uyuni]]. Each mound is about a meter high.]]
Bolivia's trade with neighboring countries is growing, in part because of several regional preferential trade agreements it has negotiated. Bolivia is a member of the [[Andean Community of Nations]] and enjoys nominally free trade with other member countries.

The United States remains Bolivia's largest trading partner. In 2002, the United States exported $283&amp;nbsp;million of merchandise to Bolivia and imported $162&amp;nbsp;million.

[[File:Camino a Samaipata Santa Cruz Bolivia.jpg|left|thumb|Camino a Samaipata Santa Cruz Bolivia]]
Agriculture accounts for roughly 15% of Bolivia's GDP. Soybeans are the major [[cash crop]], sold into the Andean Community market.

Bolivia's government remains heavily dependent on foreign assistance to finance development projects. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5&amp;nbsp;billion to its foreign [[creditor]]s, with $1.6&amp;nbsp;billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the [[Paris Club]] mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF programs since 1987, though economic crises in recent years have undercut Bolivia's normally good record.
[[File:Uros people-Lake Titicaca.jpg|thumb|150 px|right|[[Uro]] person on floating an islet in Titicaca.]]
The rescheduling of agreements granted by the Paris Club has allowed the individual creditor countries to apply very soft terms to the rescheduled debt. As a result, some countries have forgiven substantial amounts of Bolivia's bilateral debt. The U.S. government reached an agreement at the Paris Club meeting in December 1995 that reduced by 67% Bolivia's existing debt stock. The Bolivian government continues to pay its debts to the multilateral development banks on time. Bolivia is a beneficiary of the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC debt relief programs, which by agreement restricts Bolivia's access to new soft loans.

The income from tourism becomes more important. [[Tourism in Bolivia|Bolivia's tourist industry]] has grown gradually since about 1990.

[[File:Mujeres aymara con siku y caja - flickr-photos-micahmacallen-85524669 (CC-BY-SA).jpg|thumb|180 px|right|Festival in [[Sucre]]]]
Bolivia's ethnic distribution is estimated to be 30% [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking and 25% [[Aymara language|Aymara]]-speaking. The largest of the approximately three dozen native groups are the [[Quechuas]] (2.5&amp;nbsp;million), [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] (2&amp;nbsp;million), then Chiquitano (180,000), and [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] (125,000). So the full [[Amerindian]] population is at 55%; the remaining 30% is [[mestizo]] (mixed Amerindian and European), and around 15% are [[White Latin American|whites]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html Bolivian people]&lt;/ref&gt;

The white population consists mostly of ''[[criollo people|criollo]]s'', which in turn consist of families of relatively unmixed Spanish ancestry, descended from the early Spanish colonists. These have formed much of the aristocracy since independence. Other smaller groups within the white population are Germans, who founded the former national airline [[Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano]], as well as Italians, [[Basque people|Basques]], [[Croats]], Russians, Poles and other minorities, many of whose members descend from families that have lived in Bolivia for several generations. Some 40,000 German-speaking [[Mennonites in Bolivia|Mennonite]]s live in eastern Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/americas/21bolivia.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Bolivian Reforms Raise Anxiety on Mennonite Frontier]. The New York Times. 21 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miners at Work Potosi (pixinn.net).jpg|left|thumb|Young miners at work in [[Potosí]]]]
The [[Afro Bolivian]] community numbers more than 0.5% of the population, descended from African slaves that were transported to work in Brazil and then migrated westward into Bolivia. They are mostly concentrated in the [[Yungas]] region ([[Nor Yungas Province|Nor Yungas]] and [[Sud Yungas Province|Sud Yungas]] provinces) in the [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|department of La Paz]]. There are also Japanese who are concentrated mostly in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], and Middle Easterners who became prosperous in commerce.

Bolivia is one of the least developed countries in South America. Almost two-thirds of its people, many of whom are subsistence farmers, live in poverty. Population density ranges from less than one person per square kilometre in the southeastern plains to about ten per square kilometre (25&amp;nbsp;per sq.&amp;nbsp;mi) in the central highlands. As of 2006, the population is increasing about 1.45% per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;BackgroundNote&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Background Note: Bolivia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35751.htm |accessdate=17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major cities are [[La Paz]] (administrative capital), [[Sucre]] (capital), [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] (largest population), [[El Alto]], [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] and [[Cochabamba]].

According to [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Bolivia]] 28.1% of the population of Bolivia spoke an [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous language]] as a first language in 2007. Approximately 90% of the children attend primary-school but often for a year or less. Until the 2001 census the literacy rate was low in many rural areas, but, according to the [[CIA]], the [[List of countries by literacy rate|literacy rate]] was 87% nationwide, which is similar to Brazil's but below the South American average. Nevertheless in 2008 after the campaign &quot;Yes I can&quot;, Bolivia was declared illiteracy-free under the [[UNESCO]] standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;literacyBBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Bolivia declares literacy success |author=|newspaper=BBC News|date= 21 December 2008|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7794293.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;a first language&quot; is questionable as it fails to make a distinction of whether this means only language spoken, or one of multiple learned nearly simultaneously, or one first and then others later (in which case it would be more insightful to put the percentages for &quot;first language&quot; as well as &quot;total speaker&quot; percentages). Also indigenous languages have historically been underrepresented and the 2001 census statistics are too old (especially given Bolivia's recent history) and requires a newer inquiry.

==Politics and government==
{{Main|Politics of Bolivia|Foreign relations of Bolivia}}
[[File:LaPaz Plaza Pedro Di Murillo 10.2004.jpg|thumb|The government building of the [[National Congress of Bolivia]] at the Plaza Murillo in central [[La Paz]].]]
Bolivia has been governed by democratically elected governments since 1982, when a long string of military coups came to an end. Presidents [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] (1982–85) and [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985–89) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005. The current president is [[Evo Morales]], the first indigenous Bolivian to serve as head of state. 

The [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitution]], drafted in 2006-07 and approved in 2009, provides for balanced executive, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers, as well as several levels of autonomy. The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system and processes.

Bolivia's nine departments received greater autonomy under the Administrative Decentralization law of 1995. Departmental autonomy further increased with the first popular elections for departmental governors (''prefectos'') on 18 December 2005, after long protests by the pro-autonomy department of Santa Cruz.

Bolivian cities and towns are governed by directly elected mayors and councils. Municipal elections were held on 5 December 2004, with councils elected to five-year terms. The Popular Participation Law of April 1994, which distributes a significant portion of national revenues to municipalities for discretionary use, has enabled previously neglected communities to make striking improvements in their facilities and services.

The departments of Tarija, Beni, Pando and Santa Cruz are sometimes known as the &quot;half moon&quot; because of the crescent shape of the departments when looked at together in the east of the country. They also have in common conservative politics and rich fossil fuel deposits.

===Legislative branch===
Bolivia's government is a republic. The ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]]. The ''Cámara de Diputados'' (Chamber of Deputies) has 130 members elected to five year terms, seventy from single-member districts (''circunscripciones'') and sixty by proportional representation. The ''Cámara de Senadores'' (Chamber of Senators) has 36 members (four per department), elected to five year terms.

===Executive branch===
{{Cabinet of Evo Morales 2010-}}
The executive branch is headed by a President and Vice President, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[popular vote]]. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.&lt;ref&gt;Constitución Política del Estado, art. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prisons====
There are 53 [[prisons in Bolivia]] which incarcerate around 8,700 people as of 2010. The prisons are managed by the Penitentiary Regime Directorate ({{lang-es|Dirección de Régimen Penintenciario}}). There are 17 prisons in [[Departments of Bolivia|departmental]] capital cities and 36 provincial prisons.

===Electoral branch===
The electoral branch of Bolivia's government, formally the [[Plurinational Electoral Organ]], is an independent branch of government which replaced the [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]] in 2010. The branch consists of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the nine Departmental Electoral Tribunals, Electoral Judges, the anonymously selected Juries at Election Tables, and Electoral Notaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Posesionan a cuatro Vocales del Tribunal Supremo Electoral | work = La Jornada | accessdate = 2011-04-28 | date = 2010-08-16 | url = http://www.jornadanet.com/n.php?a=51574-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilfredo Ovando presides over the seven-member Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Its operations are mandated by the Constitution and regulated by the Electoral Regime Law (Law 026, passed 2010). The Organ's first elections will be the country's first [[Bolivian judicial election, 2011|judicial election]] in October 2011 and five municipal special elections expected to be held in 2011.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Departments of Bolivia|Provinces of Bolivia|Municipalities of Bolivia|Cantons of Bolivia}}
[[File:Bolivia departments named.png|right|thumb|Map of the [[departments of Bolivia]].]]

Bolivia is divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]] (''departamentos''); capitals in parentheses:
* [[Beni Department|Beni]] ([[Trinidad, Bolivia|Trinidad]])
* [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]] ([[Sucre]])
* [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] ([[Cochabamba]])
* [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz]] ([[La Paz]])
* [[Oruro Department|Oruro]] ([[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]])
* [[Pando Department|Pando]] ([[Cobija]])
* [[Potosí Department|Potosí]] ([[Potosí]])
* [[Santa Cruz Department|Santa Cruz]] ([[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]])
* [[Tarija Department|Tarija]] ([[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]])
Additionally, the departments are further divided into 100 provinces (''provincias''), and the provinces are each divided into municipalities (''municipios'') and cantons (''cantones''), which handle local affairs.

==Military==
[[File:GuentherZ 2006-08 12 0891 Jagdpanzer Kuerassier OeBH.jpg|thumb|An [[SK-105 Kürassier|SK-105]], the [[main battle tank]] of the Bolivian army.]]
The [[Military of Bolivia|Bolivian military]] comprises three branches: an Army, Navy (an empty navy) and Air Force. The legal age for voluntary admissions is 18; however, when the numbers are small the government recruits anyone as young as 14.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html CIA -The World Factbook – Bolivia]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tour of duty]] is generally 12 months. The Bolivian government annually spends $130&amp;nbsp;million on defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolivia Military Profile 2006|year=2006 |url=http://indexmundi.com/bolivia/military_profile.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolivian Army has around 31,500 men. There are six military regions (regiones militares—RMs) in the army. The Army is organized into ten divisions.

Though it is landlocked Bolivia keeps a navy. The [[Bolivian Naval Force]] (''Fuerza Naval Boliviana'' in Spanish) is a naval force about 5,000 strong in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/28/bolivia | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bolivia's landlocked sailors pine for the high seas | first=Rory | last=Carroll | date=28 August 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bolivian Air Force]] ('Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' or 'FAB') has nine air bases, located at La Paz, Cochabamba, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]], [[Puerto Suárez]], [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]], [[Villamontes]], [[Cobija]], [[Riberalta]], and [[Roboré]].

==Civil aviation==

{{See also|List of airlines of Bolivia|List of airports in Bolivia}}

The General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics (Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil—DGAC) formerly part of the FAB, administers a civil aeronautics school called the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (Instituto Nacional de Aeronáutica Civil—INAC), and two commercial air transport services TAM and TAB.

===TAM (Transporte Aéreo Militar)===

'[[TAM – Transporte Aéreo Militar]] (the Bolivian Military Airline) is an airline based in La Paz, Bolivia. It is the civilian wing of the 'Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' (the Bolivian Air Force), operating passenger services to remote towns and communities in the North and Northeast of Bolivia. TAM (a.k.a. TAM Group 71) has been a part of the FAB since 1945.

A similar airline serving the [[Beni Department]] with small planes is [[Amaszonas|Línea Aérea Amaszonas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.amaszonas.com |title=Amaszonas |publisher=Amaszonas |date= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; using smaller planes than TAM.

===TAB (Transportes Aéreos Bolivianos)===

Although a civil transport airline, [[TAB – Transportes Aéreos Bolivianos]], was created as a subsidiary company of the FAB in 1977. It is subordinate to the Air Transport Management (Gerencia de Transportes Aéreos) and is headed by an FAB general. TAB, a charter heavy cargo airline, links Bolivia with most countries of the [[Western Hemisphere]]; its inventory included a fleet of Hercules C130 aircraft. TAB was headquartered adjacent to [[El Alto International Airport]]. TAB also flew to Miami and [[Houston]], with stops in [[Panama]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Bolivia}}
{{See also|Music of Bolivia|Public holidays in Bolivia}}
[[File:Niños ejecutando una tarkeada.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Bolivian children playing [[tarka]]]]
Bolivian culture has been heavily influenced by the Quechua, the Aymara, as well as by the popular cultures of Latin America as a whole.

The cultural development is divided into three distinct periods: precolumbian, colonial, and republican. Important [[archaeology|archaeological]] ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, [[ceramic]]s, and [[weaving]]s remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include [[Tiwanaku]], [[El Fuerte de Samaipata]], [[Incallajta]], and [[Iskanawaya]]. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and have seen little archaeological exploration.&lt;ref name=BackgroundNote/&gt;

[[File:Diablada oruro fraternidad.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Diablada of Oruro|Diablada]], dance primeval, typical and main of [[Carnival of Oruro]] a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] since 2001 in Bolivia (''Image: Fraternidad Artística y Cultural &quot;La Diablada&quot;''.]] 

The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local native and mestizo builders and [[artisan]]s, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, painting, and sculpture known as &quot;Mestizo Baroque&quot;. The colonial period produced not only the paintings of Pérez de Holguín, Flores, Bitti, and others but also the works of skilled but unknown stonecutters, woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. An important body of Native Baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered in recent years and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;BackgroundNote&quot;/&gt;

Bolivian artists of stature in the twentieth century include Guzmán de Rojas, Arturo Borda, [[María Luisa Pacheco]], [[Roberto Mamani Mamani]], [[Alejandro Mario Yllanes]], [[Alfredo Da Silva]], and [[Marina Núñez del Prado]],[[William Vega]].

Bolivia has a rich [[folklore]]. Its regional [[folk music]] is distinctive and varied. The &quot;devil dances&quot; at the annual carnival of Oruro are one of the great folkloric events of South America, as is the lesser known carnival at [[Tarabuco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BackgroundNote&quot;/&gt;
The best known of the various festivals found in the country is the &quot;[[Carnaval de Oruro]]&quot;, which was among the first 19 &quot;Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity,&quot; as proclaimed by the UNESCO in May 2001.

Entertainment includes [[association football|football]], which is the national sport, as well as [[table football]], which is played on street corners by both children and adults.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Bolivia}}
[[Image:Bolivia la paz literacy LOC.jpg|thumb|200 px|Literacy class in the El Alto section of La Paz]]
Under [[UNESCO]] standards, Bolivia has been declared free of illiteracy in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;literacyBBC&quot;/&gt;

Bolivia has a wide variety of public and private universities. Among them: [[Universidad San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca]] USFX – Sucre, founded in 1624; [[Universidad Mayor de San Andres]] UMSA – La Paz, founded in 1830; [[Universidad Mayor de San Simon]] UMSS – Cochabamba, founded in 1832; [[Universidad Autonoma Gabriel Rene Moreno]] UAGRM – Santa Cruz de la Sierra, founded in 1880; [[Universidad Tecnica de Oruro]] UTO – Oruro, founded in 1892; [[Universidad Autónoma Tomás Frías]] UATF – Potosi, founded in 1892; [[Universidad Juan Misael Saracho]] UJMS – Tarija, founded in 1946; [[Universidad Catolica Boliviana San Pablo]] UCB, founded in 1966; [[Universidad Técnica del Beni]] UTB – Trinidad, founded in 1967; [[Universidad Nur]] NUR, founded in 1982; [[Universidad Privada de Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] UPSA – Santa Cruz de la Sierra, founded in 1984; [[Universidad Nacional Siglo XX]] UNSXX – Llallagua, founded in 1986; [[Universidad Privada del Valle|Universidad del Valle]] UNIVALLE -Cochabamba, founded in 1988; [[Universidad Privada Boliviana]] UPB, founded in 1993; [[Universidad Privada Franz Tamayo]] UPFT, founded in 1993 and [[Universidad Amazónica de Pando]] UAP – Cobija, founded in 1993.

Bordered by [[Croatia]] to the north, west and south, [[Serbia]] to the east, and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, Bosnia and Herzegovina is [[Landlocked#Nearly landlocked|almost landlocked]], except for {{convert|26|km|abbr=none}} of [[Adriatic Sea]] coastline, centered on the town of [[Neum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coastline&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2060.html Field Listing – Coastline], ''[[The World Factbook]]'', 2006-08-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563626/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.html Bosnia and Herzegovina: I: Introduction]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}, ''[[Encarta]]'', 2006. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQDsIKK Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the country is mountainous centrally and to the south, hilly in the northwest, and flatland in the northeast. Inland is the larger geographic region with a moderate [[continental climate]], marked by hot summers and cold, snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and plane topography. 

First mentioned in the [[De Administrando Imperio]] in 950, Bosnia was an emerging province between the eastern and western halves of the [[Roman Empire]]. Bosnia developed into a [[Ban (title)|banate]] with the historical land father [[Ban Kulin]] ruling over the Bosnian Banate that would later form the foundation for the Kingdom of Bosnia. 
The [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] was one of the medieval kingdoms of the Balkans, that emerged as a political autonomous entity in the late 12th century, becoming a Kingdom in the late 14th century. Its capitals were modern day [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]] and [[Jajce]]. Being of plural character and not taking the state religions like its neighboring states, Bosnia becomes a diplomatic stronghold in the Balkans alongside with the [[Republic of Ragusa]] in the early 14th century. The kingdom later fell after the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the late 14th century. Over the coming decades the Kingdom lost its Dobri Krstjani and [[bogomil]] identity which segregates the country's identity giving Bosnia-Herzegovina a complex national structure. Later annexed by The Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bosnia-Herzegovina becomes the 18th state of the empire. Bosnia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after WWI and after WWII the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was founded in the old city of the Bosnian kings [[Jajce]].
After declaring itself an independent state after the democratic elections in 1992, Bosnia-Herzegovina regained independence after being part of different empires for nearly four centuries.

Today the country is home to three ethnic groups, or so-called &quot;[[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent people]]&quot;, a term unique for Bosnia-Herzegovina. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest group of the three, with [[Serbs]] second and [[Croats]] third. Regardless of ethnicity, a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is often identified in [[English language|English]] as either [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] or [[Herzegovinians|Herzegovinian]]. The terms [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] and [[Bosnia]]n are maintained as a regional rather than ethnic distinction, and Herzegovina has no precisely defined borders of its own. 

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a [[parliamentary republic]], which has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]], with a third region, the [[Brčko District]], governed under [[local government]].

Formerly one of the six federal units constituting the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], Bosnia and Herzegovina gained its independence during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s. Bosnia and Herzegovina can be described as a [[parliamentary democracy]] that is transforming its economy into a market-oriented system, and it is a [[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|potential candidate]] for [[Member state of the European Union|membership]] in the [[European Union]] and has been a candidate for [[NATO]] membership since April 2010, when it received a [[Membership Action Plan]] at the summit in [[Tallinn]]. Additionally, the nation has been a member of the [[Council of Europe]] since 24 April 2002 and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean|Mediterranean Union]] upon its establishment on 13 July 2008.

==History==
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

===Pre-Slavic Period (until 958)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (until 958)}}

Bosnia has been inhabited since at least the [[Neolithic]] age. The earliest Neolithic population became known in the [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] as the [[Illyrians]]. [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations in the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC were also notable. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages. Conflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in [[229 BC|229&amp;nbsp;BC]], but Rome would not complete its annexation of the region until [[9|AD&amp;nbsp;9]].

[[File:Daorson.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Walls of ancient [[Daorson]], Ošanići near [[Stolac]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, 3rd century BC.]]
It was precisely in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Seutonius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Seutonius]], Tiberius 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; This was the Roman campaign against the revolt of indigenous communities from [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known in history as the [[Great Illyrian Revolt]], and also as the [[Pannonian revolt]], or [[Bellum Batonianum]], the latter named after two leaders of the rebellious Illyrian communities, [[Bato I|Bato]]/Baton of the [[Daesitiates]], and Bato of the [[Breuci]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Norma. Tacitus: Annals I, 2002, ISBN 1-85399-358-1. It had originally been joined to Illyricum, but after the great Illyrian/Pannonian revolt of AD 6 it was made a separate province with its own governor&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Illyrian revolt was a rising up of Illyrians against the Romans, more specifically a revolt against [[Tiberius]]' attempt to recruit them for his war against the [[Germans]]. The Illyrians put up a fierce resistance to the most powerful army on earth at the time (the [[Roman Army]]) for four years (AD 6 to AD 9), but they were finally subdued by Rome in AD 9, with the Roman side suffering heavy losses.

The last Illyrian stronghold, of which their defence won the admiration of Roman historians, is said to have been Arduba.&lt;ref&gt;Stipčević, Aleksandar, The Illyrians-History and Culture, 1974, Noyess Press&lt;/ref&gt; Bato of Daesitiates was captured and taken to Italy. It is alleged that when Tiberius asked Bato and the Daesitiates why they had rebelled, Baton was reputed to have answered: &quot;''You Romans are to blame for this; for you send as guardians of your flocks, not dogs or shepherds, but wolves''.&quot; Bato spent the rest of his life in the Italian town of Ravenna.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from the entire [[Roman Empire]] settled among the Illyrians, and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region.&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;{{cite book |last=Malcolm | first=Noel | title=Bosnia: A Short History |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |year=1996 |page= |chapter= |isbn=0814755615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was originally part of [[Illyria]] up until the Roman occupation. Following the split of the Roman Empire between 337 and 395 AD, Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Some claim that the region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Illyrians]] were conquered by the [[European Avars|Avars]] in the 6th century.

===Medieval Bosnia (958–1463)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (958–1463)}}
[[File:Bogumili-tvrtka1.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]] ruled in 1353–1366 and again in 1367–1377 as ban and in 1377–1391 as the first King of Bosnia (later also Serbia)]]

Modern knowledge of the political situation in the west Balkans during the [[Early Middle Ages]] is unclear. Upon their arrival, the Slavs brought with them a tribal social structure which probably fell apart and gave way to [[Feudalism]] only with [[Franks|Frankish]] penetration into the region in the late 9th century. It was also around this time that the [[Illyrians]] were [[Christianization|Christianized]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina, because of its geographic position and terrain, was probably one of the last areas to go through this process, which presumably originated from the urban centers along the [[Dalmatia]]n coast.

The principalities of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] split control of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 9th and 10th century, but by the [[High Middle Ages]] political circumstance led to the area being contested between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the Byzantine Empire. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century, Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as an independent state under the rule of local ''[[Ban (title)|bans]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The first Bosnian monarch was [[Ban Borić]]. The second was [[Ban Kulin]] whose rule marked the start of a controversy with the [[Bosnian Church]], an indigenous [[Bogomilism|Bogomilism]] sect considered heretical by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church, which he allowed access in the country. In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254.

Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by the power struggle between the [[Šubić]] and [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromanić]] became ''Ban''. By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his nephew [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. Tvrtko crowned himself on 26 October 1377 as Stephen Tvrtko I the [[List of rulers of Bosnia|King]] of [[Raška (state)|Rascia]], [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], the [[Adriatic Sea|Seaside]].

Based on archaeological evidence, he was crowned in the in Mile near [[Visoko during the Middle Ages|Visoko]] in the church which was built in the time of [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromanić]]'s reign, where he was also buried alongside his uncle Stjepan II.&lt;ref name=Mile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&amp;lang=1&amp;action=view&amp;id=1341|title=declared as national monument|year=declared as national monument}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=An&gt;Anđelić Pavao, Krunidbena i grobna crkva bosanskih vladara u Milima (Arnautovićima) kod Visokog.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] had already started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463.

===Ottoman Era (1463–1878)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1463–1878)}}
[[File:Ottomanbosnia.PNG|thumb|left|250px|The [[Bosnia Province, Ottoman Empire|Ottoman province of Bosnia]] in the 17th century.]]
The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and [[cultural landscape]]. The Ottomans allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity&amp;nbsp;— a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;&gt;Riedlmayer, Andras (1993). [http://www.kakarigi.net/manu/briefhis.htm A Brief History of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. The Bosnian Manuscript Ingathering Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Bosnia the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The three centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to the restriction imposed by the [[Ottoman Empire]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996). Historija Bošnjaka. Sarajevo: BZK Preporod. ISBN 9958-815-00-1&lt;/ref&gt; and conversions-for-gain.

The Bosnian Christian communities also experienced major changes. The Bosnian [[Franciscan]]s (and the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] population as a whole) were to some minor extent protected by official imperial decree. The [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] community in Bosnia – initially confined to Herzegovina and Podrinje – spread throughout the country during this period and went on to experience relative prosperity until the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Meanwhile, the schismatic Bosnian Church disappeared altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

As the Ottoman Empire continued their rule in the [[Balkans]] ([[Rumelia]]), Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province, and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into regional centers of trade and [[urban culture]] and were then visited by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian architecture]] such as the country's first library in [[Sarajevo]], [[madrassa]]s, school of [[Sufi philosophy]], and [[clock tower]] (Sahat Kula), along with numerous other important cultural structures, bridges such as the [[Stari Most]] and the [[Tsar's Mosque]] and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque]].

Furthermore, some Bosnians played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and [[political history]] during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt; Bosnian recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] and [[Battle of Krbava field|Krbava field]], while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals such as [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]; generals such as [[Isa-Beg Isaković]], [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] and [[Telli Hasan Pasha]]; administrators such as [[Ferhat-paša Sokolović]] and [[Osman Gradaščević]]; and [[Vizier|Grand Viziers]] such as the influential [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović]]. Some Bosnians emerged as [[Sufi]] mystics, scholars such as [[Ali Džabič]]; and poets in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic]], and [[Persian language]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt;

However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the conclusion of the [[Great Turkish War]] with the [[treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 once again made Bosnia the Empire's westernmost province. The following century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague. The Porte's false efforts at [[Ottoman military reform efforts|modernizing]] the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to become great hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms.

This, combined with frustrations over political concessions to nascent Christian states in the east, culminated in a famous and ultimately unsuccessful revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]], in 1831 after the Turkish Sultan [[Mahmud II]] slaughtered and abolished the [[Janissary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt; Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate. Later agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation which eventually led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

===Austro-Hungarian rule (1878–1918)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)}}
[[File:Gavrilo princip memorial plaque 2009 edit1.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque commemorating the location of the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]].]]
At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to Salonika that &quot;would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914, Volume I|publisher= Oxford University Press |year=1952|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired [an ...] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini 1952 33&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914, Volume I|publisher= Oxford University Press |year=1952|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, behind which stood the [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Albert]], were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution by his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion was lost by 179 to 95. By the Opposition rank and file the gravest accusations were raised against Andrassy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini 1952 33&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although an Austro-Hungarian side quickly came to an agreement with Bosnians, tensions remained in certain parts of the country (particularly south) and a mass emigration of predominantly Slavic dissidents occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a &quot;model [[colony]]&quot;.

With the aim of establishing the province as a stable [[political spectrum|political model]] that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism, Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and generally to provide for modernisation. The Austro-Hungarian Empire built the three [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches in Sarajevo and these three churches are among only 20 Catholic churches in the state of Bosnia.

Within three years of formal occupation of Bosnia Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary, in 1881, obtained German, and more importantly, Russian, approval for the annexation of these provinces, at the time which best suited Vienna. This mandate was formally ratified by the [[League of the Three Emperors|Dreikaiserbund (Three Emperor's Treaty)]] on June 18 of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini17&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p37, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the accession of Czar Nicholas II, however, the Russians reneged on the agreement, asserting in 1897 the need for special scrutiny of the Bosnian Annexation issue at an unspecified future date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini19&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p94, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt;

External matters began to affect the Bosnian Protectorate, however, and its relationship with Austria-Hungary. A bloody coup occurred in Serbia, on June 10, 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in Belgrade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini70&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p140, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; Serb attempts to foment agitation followed, advocating a unified South Slavic state, ruled from Belgrade. This gained little support amongst most of the population of Bosnia Herzegovina, and only found fertile ground with disaffected portions of the Orthodox minority. Also, the revolt in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, raised concerns that the Istanbul government might seek the outright return of Bosnia Herzegovina. These factors caused the Austrian-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question, sooner, rather than later.

On July 2, 1908, in response to the pressing of the Austrian-Hungarian claim, the Russian Imperial Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky offered to support the Bosnian Annexation in return for Vienna's support for Russia's bid for naval access through the [[Dardanelles]] Straits into the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini71&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p195, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; With the Russians being, at least, provisionally willing to keep their word over Bosnia Herzegovina for the first time in 11 years, Austria-Hungary waited a reasonably adequate time and then published the annexation proclamation on October 6, 1908. The international furore over the annexation announcement caused Izvolsky to drop the [[Dardanelles]] Straits question, altogether, in an effort to obtain a European conference over the Bosnian Annexation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini72&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p227, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; This conference never materialized and without English or French support, the Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909.

The political tensions caused by all this culminated on 28 June 1914, when Serb nationalist youth [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in Sarajevo — an event that proved to be the spark that set off [[World War I]]. Although some Bosnians died serving in the armies of the various warring states, Bosnia and Herzegovina itself managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt;

===The First Yugoslavia (1918–1941)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1918–1941)}}

Following the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over [[redistribution (economics)|property redistribution]], and formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt; The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major [[ethnic group]]s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as [[Mehmed Spaho]] ensured that the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Subdivisions|banates]] or ''[[banovina (region)|banovinas]]'' that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration.

The famous [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|Cvetković-Maček Agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of Croatia|Croatian banate]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a partition of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt; However, outside political circumstances forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention to the rising threat posed by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]]. Following a period that saw attempts at [[appeasement]], the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact|Tripartite Treaty]], and a [[coup d'état]], Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

===World War II (1941–45)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1941–1945)}}
[[File:Neretva most.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The railway bridge over the [[Neretva|Neretva river]], was destroyed twice during the [[battle of the Neretva]].]]
[[File:Dolina heroja-Spomenik-Tjentiste2.JPG|225px|thumb|Monument commemorating the [[Battle of the Sutjeska|Battle of Sutjeska]] in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina.]]

Once the kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by Nazi forces in [[World War II]], all of Bosnia was ceded to the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. The Croat leaders embarked on a campaign of extermination of [[Serbs]], [[Jew]]s, [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]], [[communism|communist]] and large numbers of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] by setting up a number of [[Extermination camp|death camps]].

The Handschar division was commanded by German officers, and composed of native Germans from Croatia (Volksdeutsche), Croat Christians and Bosniaks (considered ethnic Croats during World War II), who are Muslims from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was the largest of the Muslim-oriented divisions and the SS Divisions with 21,065 men[citation needed], of whom 2,800 were Croat Christians and the remainder Bosnian Muslims. The number of Christians was higher than directed by Himmler, who had allowed a 10% Christian component only after the recruitment of sufficient Muslims proved difficult.[15] The division had a Muslim Imam for each battalion other than the all-German signal battalion.[16] Initially there was a small Albanian component. In 1943 a number of Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak region were recruited and teamed up into Battalion I/2 (later I/28). This was perhaps the best trained and equipped Nazi Albanian military formation during the war. Ironically, via rail on 17 April 1944, the formation was transferred directly from combat in Bosnia to Kosovo following the creation of 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian). The head of Waffen SS recruitment, SS Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger reported to Himmler that the Albanians &quot;... were quite sad about leaving.&quot;

Under its leader Ante Pavelić, the Ustaša subjected ethnic Serbs, together with much smaller minorities of Jews and Roma, to a campaign of genocidal persecution. Of that number, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Ustaše killed 330,000–390,000 ethnic Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

Starting in 1941, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] under the leadership of the Croatian Tito organized its own multi-ethnic resistance group, the Partisans, who fought against both Axis and [[Chetnik]] forces. On 25 November 1943 the [[AVNOJ|Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Habsburg borders.

Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans, but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead. All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its peoples bore the brunt of fighting. Eventually the end of the war resulted in the establishment of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], with the [[Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|constitution of 1946]] officially making Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

===Socialist Yugoslavia (1945–1992)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1945–1992)}}

Because of its central geographic position within the Yugoslavian federation, post-war Bosnia was strategically selected as a base for the development of the [[defense (military)|military defense]] industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in the [[Bosnian War|war]] that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was peaceful and prosperous.
Though considered a political backwater of the federation for much of the 1950s and 1960s, in the 1970s strong Bosnian political elite ascended fueled in part by Tito's leadership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia's [[diplomatic corps]].

While working within the communist system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref name=&quot;Stojic&quot;&gt;Stojic, Mile (2005). [http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=3058&amp;reportid=170 Branko Mikulic – socialist emperor manqué]. [[BH Dani]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic hardly escaped the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time unscathed. With the fall of the Soviet Union and the start of the break-up of Yugoslavia, the old communist doctrine of tolerance began to lose its potency, creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence.

===The Bosnian War (1992–1995)===
{{Main|Bosnian War}}

The 1990 parliamentary elections led to a [[National Assembly|national assembly]] dominated by three ethnically based parties, which had formed a loose coalition to oust the communists from power. [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]'s subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]] (overwhelmingly favored among Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored among Bosniaks and Croats).

The [[Serbs|Serb]] [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]], consisting mainly of the [[Serbian Democratic Party|Serb Democratic Party]] members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska|Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990. This Assembly established the [[Republika Srpska|Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 9 January 1992, which became [[Republika Srpska]] in August 1992.

On 18 November 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the ruling party in the Republic of Croatia, the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), proclaimed the existence of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]], as a separate &quot;political, cultural, economic and territorial whole,&quot; on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with [[Croatian Defence Council|Croat Defence Council]] (HVO) as its military part.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Prlić et al. (IT-04-74)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/prl-ii040304e.htm|title=ICTY: Prlić et al. (IT-04-74)}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bosnian government did not recognize it. The [[Constitutional court|Constitutional Court]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Herzeg-Bosnia]] illegal, first on 14 September 1992 and again on 20 January 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secnet069.un.org/x/cases/prlic/ind/en/prl-ii040304e.htm|title=Prlic et al.

A declaration of Bosnia and Herzegovina sovereignty in October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence from [[Yugoslavia]] in February and March 1992 boycotted by the great majority of the Serbs. The turnout in the independence referendum was 63.4 per cent and 99.7 per cent of voters voted for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://csce.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=UserGroups.Home&amp;ContentRecord_id=250&amp;ContentType=G&amp;ContentRecordType=G&amp;UserGroup_id=5&amp;Subaction=ByDate|title=The Referendum on Independence in Bosnia-Herzegovina: February 29 – March 1, 1992|year=1992|publisher=Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|page=19|accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence shortly afterwards. Following a tense period of escalating tensions and sporadic military incidents, open warfare began in Sarajevo on April 6.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Evstafiev-sarajevo-building-burns.jpg|thumb|right|The parliament building in the centre of Sarajevo burns after being hit by tank fire during the siege in 1992.]]

Secret discussions between [[Franjo Tuđman]] and [[Slobodan Milošević]] on the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia were held as early as March 1991 known as [[Karađorđevo agreement]]. Following the declaration of independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs attacked different parts of the country. The state administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively ceased to function having lost control over the entire territory. The Serbs wanted all lands where Serbs had a majority, eastern and [[western Bosnia]].

The Croats and their leader Tuđman also aimed at securing parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Croatian. The policies of the Republic of Croatia and its leader Franjo Tuđman towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were never totally transparent and always included Franjo Tuđman's ultimate aim of expanding Croatia's borders. Bosnian Muslims, the only ethnic group loyal to the Bosnian government, were an easy target, because the Bosnian government forces were poorly equipped and unprepared for the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Naletilić and Martinović verdict - A. Historical background&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/naletilic/trialc/judgement/nal-tj030331-1.htm#IIA|title= ICTY: Naletilić and Martinović verdict – A. Historical background}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased diplomatic pressure for the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) to withdraw from the republic's territory which they officially did. However, in fact, the Bosnian Serb members of JNA simply changed insignia, formed the [[Army of the Republika Srpska|Army of Republika Srpska]], and continued fighting. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia, supported by volunteers and various [[paramilitary|paramilitary forces]] from Serbia, and receiving extensive humanitarian, logistical and financial support from the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], Republika Srpska's offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

Initially, the Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in Eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces – military, police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers – applied the same pattern: Bosniak houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. 2.2 million refugees were displaced by the end of the war (of all three nationalities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0c58.pdf|title=The humanitarian operation in Bosnia, 1992–95: the dilemmas of negotiating humanitarian access|month=May|year=1999|publisher=United Nations High Commission for Refugees|accessdate=2008-06-24|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, where they were mistreated in many ways including being raped repeatedly. Serb soldiers or policemen would come to these detention centres, select one or more women, take them out and rape them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement - Foča&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC|title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements}}{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1992 the focus switched to [[Novi Travnik]] and [[Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje|Gornji Vakuf]] where the Croat Defence Council (HVO) efforts to gain control were resisted. On 18 June 1992 the Bosnian Territorial Defence in Novi Travnik received an [[ultimatum]] from the HVO which included demands to abolish existing Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions, establish the authority of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and pledge allegiance to it, subordinate the Territorial Defense to the HVO and expel Muslim refugees, all within 24 hours. The attack was launched on June 19. The elementary school and the [[Post office|Post Office]] were attacked and damaged.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY – Kordic and Cerkez judgment – II. Persecution: The HVO Take-Overs B. Novi Travnik – [http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/kor-tj010226e-4.htm#IIB]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gornji Vakuf was initially attacked by Croats on 20 June 1992, but the attack failed. The [[Graz agreement]] caused deep division inside the Croat community and strengthened the separation group, which led to the conflict with Bosniaks. One of the primary pro-union Croat leaders, [[Blaž Kraljević]] (leader of the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS) armed group) was killed by HVO soldiers in August 1992, which severely weakened the moderate group who hoped to keep the Bosnian Croat alliance alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Sarajevo, i poslije'', Erich Rathfelder, [[Munich|München]] 1998 [http://www.hsp1861.hr/vijesti/201129erra.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation became more serious in October 1992 when Croat forces attacked Bosniak population in [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]]. According to ''[[Jadranko Prlić]] indictment'', HVO forces cleansed most of the Muslims from the town of Prozor and several surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Prlić et al. (IT-04-74)&quot; /&gt; In the same time, Croats from the towns of Konjic and Bugojno were forced to abandon their homes, while many of them were killed or held in [[Internment|concentration camps]]. Alliance between Croats and Muslims broke and most of the Croats were forced to abandon cities with Muslim majority (Sarajevo, Zenica).

By 1993, when an armed conflict erupted between the predominantly Bosniak government in Sarajevo and the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, about 70% of the country was controlled by Republika Srpska. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] violations against non-Serbs were rampant in these areas. DNA teams have been used to collect evidence of the atrocities committed by Serbian forces during these campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Court wants exemplary Karadzic trial&quot;, [[BBC News]], 2008-07-24, retrieve 2009-07-12 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7522908.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; One single most prominent example is the [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica Massacre]], ruled [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]. An estimated 7,000 Bosnians were killed by the Serbian [[political authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Geography of Genocide''&quot;, Allan D. Cooper, p. 178, University Press of America, 2008, ISBN 0-7618-4097-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1994, the signing of the Washington Accords between the leaders of the republican government and Herzeg-Bosnia led to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which absorbed the territory of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and that held by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation soon liberated the small [[Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia]].

A [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|NATO bombing campaign]] began in August, 1995, against the Army of Republika Srpska, after the [[Srebrenica massacre]]. Meanwhile, a ground offensive by the allied forces of Croatia and Bosnia, based on the treaty in Split by Tudjman and Izetbegović, pushed the Serbs away from territories held in western Bosnia which paved the way to negotiations.
In December 1995, the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] by the presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Alija Izetbegović]]), Croatia ([[Franjo Tuđman]]), and Serbia ([[Slobodan Milošević]]) brought a halt to the fighting, roughly establishing the basic structure of the present-day state. The number of identified victims is currently at 97,207, and the recent research estimates the total number to be less than 110,000 killed (civilians and military),&lt;ref name=&quot;hundred thousand&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/eujp/2005/00000021/F0020002/00006852|publisher=European Journal of Population|title=War-related Deaths in the 1992–1995 Armed Conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A Critique of Previous Estimates and Recent Results|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hundredthousand&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=L23677389|publisher=Reuters|title=Research halves Bosnia war death toll to 100,000|date=2005-11-23}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hundredthousandplus&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/March/20060302182114MVyelwarC0.6359674.html| publisher=U.S. Department of State|title=Review of European Security Issues|date=2006-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.8 million displaced.

According to numerous [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) judgments the conflict involved Bosnia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later [[Serbia and Montenegro]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882595|title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882594|title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Croatia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Srebrenica massacre memorial gravestones 2009 1.jpg||thumb|right|220px|Gravestones at the [[Srebrenica Genocide memorial]].]]
The Bosnian government charged Serbia of complicity in genocide in Bosnia during the war at the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). The ICJ ruling of 26 February 2007 effectively determined the war's nature to be international, though exonerating Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by Serb forces of [[Republika Srpska]]. The ICJ concluded, however, that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces and failed to punish those who carried out the genocide, especially general [[Ratko Mladić]], and bring them to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13685.pdf|title=ICJ: The genocide case: Bosnia v. Serbia|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges ruled that the criteria for genocide with the specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]'') to destroy Bosnian Muslims were met [[Srebrenica massacre|only in Srebrenica]] or Eastern Bosnia in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/02/26/international/i033600S38.DTL&amp;type=politics| title=Courte: Serbia failed to prevent genocide, UN court rules|date=2007-02-26|agency=Associated Press|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia is located in the western [[Balkans]], bordering [[Croatia]] ({{convert|932|km|mi|disp=s|abbr=on}}) to the north and south-west, [[Serbia]] ({{convert|302|km|mi|disp=s|abbr=on}}) to the east, and [[Montenegro]] ({{convert|225|km|mi|disp=s|abbr=on}}) to the southeast. It lies between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[46th parallel north|46° N]], and longitudes [[15th meridian east|15°]] and [[20th meridian east|20° E]].

The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central [[Dinaric Alps]]. The northeastern parts reach into the [[Pannonian Plain|Pannonian basin]], while in the south it borders the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. The country has only 20 kilometers (12&amp;nbsp;mi) of coastline,&lt;ref name=&quot;coastline&quot;/&gt; around the town of [[Neum]] in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by United Nations law, Bosnia has a right of passage to the outer sea. Neum has many hotels and is an important tourism destination.

The country's name comes from the two regions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], which have a very vaguely defined border between them. Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four fifths of the entire country, while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the south part of the country.

The major cities are the capital [[Sarajevo]], [[Banja Luka]] in the northwest region known as [[Bosanska Krajina]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Tuzla]] in the northeast, [[Zenica]] and [[Doboj]] in the central part of Bosnia and [[Mostar]], the capital of [[Herzegovina]].

The south part of Bosnia has Mediterranean climate and a great deal of agriculture. Central Bosnia is the most mountainous part of Bosnia featuring predominate mountains [[Vlašić (mountain)|Vlašić]], [[Čvrsnica Mountain|Čvrsnica]], and Prenj. Eastern Bosnia also features mountains like [[Trebević]], [[Jahorina]], [[Igman]], [[Bjelašnica Mountain|Bjelašnica]] and [[Treskavica]]. It was here that the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] were held.

Eastern Bosnia is heavily forested along the river [[Drina]], and overall close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in Central, Eastern and Western parts of Bosnia. Northern Bosnia contains very fertile agricultural land along the river Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Parapannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The river Sava and corresponding [[Posavina]] [[Drainage basin|river basin]] hold the cities of Brčko, [[Šamac|Bosanski Šamac]], [[Bosanski Brod]] and [[Gradiška|Bosanska Gradiška]].

The northwest part of Bosnia is called Bosanska Krajina and holds the cities of [[Banja Luka]], [[Prijedor]], [[Cazin]], [[Velika Kladuša]] and [[Bihać]]. Kozara [[National park|National Park]] is in this forested region.

There are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web|title=Watershed Management in Mountain Regions in Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0269e/A0269E05.pdf|publisher=FAO|page=113|author=Izet Čengić, Azra Čabaravdić}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Sava River|Sava]] is the largest river of the country, but it only forms its northern [[natural border]] with Croatia. It drains 76%&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; of the country's territory into the Danube and the Black Sea. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore also a member of the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]] (ICPDR).
*The [[Una (Sava)|Una]], [[Sana River|Sana]] and [[Vrbas River|Vrbas]] are right tributaries of Sava river. They are located in the northwestern region of Bosanska Krajina.
*The [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river gave its name to the country, and is the longest river fully contained within it. It stretches through central Bosnia, from its source near [[Sarajevo]] to Sava in the north.
*The [[Drina]] flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, and for the most part it forms a natural border with Serbia.
*The [[Neretva]] is the major river of Herzegovina and the only major river that flows south, into the Adriatic Sea.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the Pannonian [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian [[deciduous|deciduous forests]].

==Government and politics==
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2010}}
{{Main|Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Bk-map.png|thumb|200px|Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (FBiH), [[Republika Srpska]] (RS), and [[Brčko District]] (BD).]]
Bosnia and Herzegovina has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton accord]]. Most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996 the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves. The [[Brčko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000 out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of [[local government]]. The Brčko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHR&quot;&gt;OHR Bulletin 66 (February 3, 1998). [http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/chronology/bulletins/default.asp?content_id=4991#8 – Final hearing of the Arbitration Tribunal in Vienna]. OHR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third level of Bosnia and Herzegovina's political subdivision is manifested in [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. All of them have their own cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws implemented to ensure the equality of all constituent people.

The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipalities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided in 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska in 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.

Besides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four &quot;official&quot; cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Istočno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).

As a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on.) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state.
[[File:Zgrada prijateljstva između Grčke i Bosne i Hercegovine.JPG|left|200px|thumb|The Bosnian Parliament building after reconstruction.]]
The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.

The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people (Federation votes for the Bosniak/Croat, [[Republika Srpska]] for the [[Serbs|Serb]]).

The Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.

The [[National Parliament|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members, two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.

The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency.

However, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html|title=''The Contradictions of &quot;Democracy&quot; without Consent'', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.

== Military==
{{Main|Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:BHArmy 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bosnian soldiers]]
The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] had been founded in 2004. 

The Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 10,000 active and 5,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces has 2,500 personnel and about 45 aircraft. All of its aircraft are utility helicopters and basic trainers. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPAD]] hand-held missiles, [[SAM]] missile batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. Almost all of its anti-aircraft equipment is of Soviet origin, though it also operates some U.S. and Swedish hardware.

==Foreign relations==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{See also|Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union}}
[[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|EU integration]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it initiated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] in 2007. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, Member States of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm |title=European Commission – Enlargement – Bosnia and Herzegovina – Relations with the EU |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, relations with its neighbors of [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] have been fairly stable since the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995.

On April 23, 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina received the [[Membership Action Plan]] from [[NATO]], which is the last step before full membership in the alliance. Full membership is expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.

{{Main|Demographics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Demographic history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{See|Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Religion in Bosnia and Herzegovina|List of people from Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

Bosnia is home to three ethnic &quot;[[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]]&quot;: [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]]. Tensions between the three constitutional peoples remain high and often provoke political disagreements.

According to the [[1991 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|1991 census]], Bosnia and Herzegovina had a population of 4,377,033. Ethnically, 1,902,956 (43%) were Bosniaks, 1,366,104 (31%) Serbs, and 760,852 (17%) Croats, with 242,682 (6%) [[Yugoslavs]]. The remaining 2% of the population – numbering 104,439 – consisted of various other ethnicities. 99% of the population spoke [[Serbo-Croatian]]. According to 2000 data from the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], Bosnia's largest ethnic groups are Bosniaks (48%), Serbs (37.1%) and Croats (14.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong correlation between ethnic identity and [[religion in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]: [[Islam|Muslims]] constitute 45% of the population, [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serb Orthodox]] 36%, [[Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] 15%, and other groups, including [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]], 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108438.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2008 – Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large population migrations during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s have caused demographic shifts in the country. No census has been taken since 1991, and political disagreements have made it impossible to organize one. Nevertheless, a census has been planned for 2011. As almost all of the post-war data is simply an estimate, a census would be a statistical, inclusive, and objective way to analyze the demographics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most sources, however, estimate the population to be about four million, representing a decrease of 350,000 since 1991.

According to BHAS (Agency for Statistics of BiH) estimation of population done on 30 June 2009 is 3,842,566.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Timur|last=Ljubuncic|url= http://www.bhas.ba/eng/Default.asp |title=Agencija za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine - BHAS |publisher=Bhas.ba |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Largest municipalities ===
{{Largest cities of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

Other cities like [[Bijeljina]] (1991 census, 96,796) and [[Brčko]] (1991 census, 87.627) have grown after the war, but it is almost impossible to determine the current population in BiH, and the estimates are often exaggerated for political purposes, or local rivalries.

Bosnia faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing market reforms to its formerly centrally planned economy. One legacy of the previous era is a greatly overstaffed military industry; under former leader [[Josip Broz Tito]], military industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants but fewer commercially-viable firms.

For the most of Bosnia's history, [[agriculture]] has been based on small and inefficient privately owned farms; food has traditionally been a net import for the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/225/t225-4.htm|title=A Divided Bosnia, January 29, 1996, Aleksandar Ciric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war in the 1990s caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy.&lt;ref&gt;Daclon, Corrado Maria (1997). Bosnia. Maggioli. Italy&lt;/ref&gt; GDP fell by 75% and the destruction of physical infrastructure devastated the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/skills/training/publ/pub12.htm|title=Post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina – Martha Walsh – Employment Sector|publisher=ILO|date=|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the production capacity has been restored, the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties. Figures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004; this and Bosnia's shrinking [[Government debt|national debt]] being positive trends, but high unemployment and a large [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]] remain cause for concern.

The national currency is the ([[Euro]]-pegged) [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark|Convertible Mark]] (KM), controlled by the [[currency board]]. Annual inflation is the lowest relative to other countries in the region at 1.9% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|title=[[The World Factbook|World Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international debt was $3.1 billion (2005 est) – the smallest amount of debt owed of all the former Yugoslav republics. [[Gross domestic product|Real GDP]] growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Central Bank of BiH]] and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has one of the highest [[List of countries by income equality|income equality rankings]] in the world, ranking eighth out of 193 nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/HDR06-complete.pdf#page=335|title=Table 15: Inequality in income or expenditure|accessdate=2007-01-09| publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=2006|format=PDF|work=Human Development Report 2006|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Bosnia and Hercegovina's PPS GDP per capita stood at 30 per cent of the EU average in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-25062009-BP/EN/2-25062009-BP-EN.PDF|title=GDP per capita in PPS|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Stećci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], Petar Tiješić, Karlo Mijić, Špiro Bocarić, Petar Šain, Đoko Mazalić, Roman Petrović and Lazar Drljača. Later, artists such as: Ismet Mujezinović, Vojo Dimitrijević, Ivo Šeremet, and Mica Todorović amongst others came to rise. After World War II artists like: Virgilije Nevjestić, Bekir Misirlić, Ljubo Lah, Meha Sefić, Franjo Likar, [[Mersad Berber]], Ibrahim Ljubović, Dževad Hozo, Affan Ramić, Safet Zec, Ismar Mujezinović, and Mehmed Zaimović rose in popularity. [[Ars Aevi]] a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.

[[File:Evstafiev-vedran-smailovic-sarajevo1992w.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Vedran Smailović]], the cellist of Sarajevo.]]
Traditional Bosnian and Herzogovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and [[Rock music]] has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zonic]], [[Goran Bregović]], Davorin Popović, [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Edo Maajka]] and [[Dino Merlin]]. Also, it would be unfair not to mention some of the talented composers such as [[Đorđe Novković]], Esad Arnautalić, [[Kornelije Kovač]], and many pop and [[Rock bands|rock band]]s, for example, [[Bijelo dugme|Bijelo Dugme]], [[Indexi]], [[Plavi orkestar|Plavi Orkestar]], [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], who were among the leading ones in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia is home to the composer [[Dušan Šestić]], the creator of the current [[national anthem]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer [[Marija Šestić]], composer [[Saša Lošić|Sasa Losic]] and pianist [[Saša Toperić|Sasha Toperich]]. In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient Gusle. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.

===Cinema===

===Sports===
Bosnia and Herzegovina has produced many athletes. Many of them were famous in the Yugoslav national teams before Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence.

The most important international [[sport|sporting event]] in the [[history of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was the hosting of the [[1984 Winter Olympics|14th Winter Olympics]], held in [[Sarajevo]] from the 7th to 19 February 1984.
Some notable local [[Olympic Games|Olympians]] were:
*[[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome]], 1960: [[Tomislav Knez]] and Velimir Sombolac (football),
*[[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo]], 1964: [[Mirsad Fazlagić]] (football),
*[[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich]], 1972: [[Abaz Arslanagić]], [[Milorad Karalić]], [[Nebojša Popović (handballer)|Nebojša Popović]], Đorđe Lavrinić, Dobrivoje Seleć (handball)
*[[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow]], 1980: [[Mirza Delibašić]] and Ratko Radovanović (basketball)
*[[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]], 1984: [[Zdravko Rađenović]], [[Zlatan Arnautović]] (handball) and Anto Josipović (boxing).

The [[RK Borac Banja Luka|Borac]] [[team handball|handball]] club has won seven [[Yugoslav Handball Championship]]s, as well as the European Championship Cup in 1976 and the International Handball Federation Cup in 1991.

The [[KK Bosna|Bosna]] [[basketball]] club from Sarajevo were European Champions in 1979. The [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslav national basketball team]], which medaled in every world championship from 1963 through 1990, included Bosnian players such as [[Dražen Dalipagić]] and [[Mirza Delibašić]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina regularly qualifies for the [[EuroBasket|European Championship in Basketball]]. [[Jedinstvo Aida]] [[women's basketball]] club, based in Tuzla, has won the 1989 European Championships in Florence.

The Tuzla-Sinalco [[karate]] club from Tuzla has won the most Yugoslav championships, as well as four European Championships and one World Championship.

The Bosnian [[chess]] team has been [[Yugoslav Chess Championship|Champion of Yugoslavia]] seven times, in addition to winning four European championships: 1994 in [[Lyon]], 1999 in [[Bugojno]], 2000 in [[Neum]], and 2001 in Kallithea Elassonos. Chess grandmaster [[Borki Predojević]] has also won two European Championships: [[Litochoro]] ([[Greece]]) in 1999, and [[Kallithea Elassonos]] (Greece) in 2001.

Middle-weight [[boxing|boxer]] [[Marijan Beneš]] has won several Championships of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslav Championships and the European Championship.&lt;ref name=nezavisne&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nezavisne.com/revija/tekst3-050612.php|title=Ring zamijenio nalivperom|publisher=Nezavisne novine|date=2005-06-12|language=Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 he won the World Title against [[Elisha Obed]] from the Bahamas. Another middle-weight boxer, [[Anton Josipović]] won the Olympic Gold in Los Angeles, 1984. He also won Yugoslav Championship in 1982, the Championship of the Balkans in 1983, and the Belgrade Trophy in 1985.

[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It dates from 1903, but its popularity grew significantly after World War I. At the local level, [[Sarajevo]] (1967 and 1984), [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo|Željezničar]] (1972) have both won the Yugoslav Championship. The former [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav national football team]] has included a number of Bosnian players, such as [[Josip Katalinski]], [[Dušan Bajević]], [[Miroslav Blažević]], [[Ivica Osim]], [[Safet Sušić]], [[Idriz Hošić]] and [[Mirsad Fazlagić]].

Today, the team of Bosnia and Herzegovina has modern footballers like [[Edin Džeko]], [[Zvjezdan Misimović]], [[Vedad Ibišević]], [[Emir Spahić]], [[Asmir Begović]], [[Miralem Pjanić]] and others. The independent [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team]] has not qualified for a European or World Championship.

Bosnian national teams have struggled to draft the best national players. Many players born in Bosnia and Herzegovina choose to play for other countries because of their ethnic identification and because of higher salaries offered by other teams. For example [[Mario Stanić]] and Mile Mitić were both born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but play for Croatia and Serbia respectively. Other internationally famous players from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who have made similar choices, are: [[Darijo Srna]], [[Mladen Petrić]], [[Neven Subotić]], [[Vedran Ćorluka]], [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] (born and raised in [[Sweden]], his mother a Croat, his father a Bosnian), [[Marko Marin]], [[Zoran Savić]], [[Vladimir Radmanović]], [[Zlatko Junuzović]], [[Aleksandar Nikolić]], [[Savo Milošević]], and [[Zdravko Kuzmanović]].

Bosnia and Herzegovina was the world champion of [[volleyball at the 2004 Summer Paralympics]]. Many among those on the team lost their legs in the Bosnian War.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Cevapcici in somun.JPG.jpg|thumb|Bosnian ćevapi.]]
[[Bosnian cuisine]] uses many [[spice]]s, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, [[carrot]]s, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, [[milk]], [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of [[Austria]]n rule, there are many influences from [[Central Europe]]. Typical meat dishes include primarily [[beef]] and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. Some local specialties are [[Ćevapčići|ćevapi]], [[burek]], [[dolma]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[pilaf]], [[goulash]], [[ajvar]] and a whole range of Eastern sweets. Local wines come from [[Herzegovina]] where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Herzegovinian loza (similar to Italian [[Grappa]] but less sweet) is very popular. Plum (''rakija'') or apple (''jabukovača'') alcohol beverages are produced in the north. In the south, distilleries used to produce vast quantities of [[brandy]] and supply all of ex-Yugoslavian alcohol factories (brandy is the base of most [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]]).

===Leisure activities===
Coffeehouses, where [[Turkish coffee#Bosnia-Herzegovina|Bosnian coffee]] is served in [[cezve|džezva]] with [[Turkish Delight|rahat lokum]] and sugar cubes, proliferate Sarajevo and every city in the country. Coffee drinking is a favorite Bosnian pastime and part of the culture. Bosnians are believed to be the heaviest coffee drinkers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofsevdah.com/bosnian-traditional-coffee/ |title=Bosnian traditional coffee &quot; World of Sevdah |publisher=Worldofsevdah.com |date=2007-03-08 |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Botswana''', officially the '''Republic of Botswana''' ({{lang-tn|Lefatshe la Botswana}}), is a country located in [[Southern Africa]]. The citizens are referred to as &quot;Batswana&quot; (singular: Motswana). Formerly the British [[protectorate]] of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on 30 September 1966. It has held free and fair democratic [[Elections in Botswana|elections]] since independence.

Geographically the country is flat and up to 70% of Botswana is covered by the [[Kalahari Desert]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. It meets [[Zambia]] at a single point.

A small, landlocked country of just over two million people, Botswana was one of the poorest countries in Africa at the time it gained independence from Britain in 1966, with a GDP per capita of about US$70. Botswana has transformed itself, moving into the ranks of middle-income status to become one of the fastest growing economies in the world with its average annual growth rate of about 9 percent with a GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita of about $14,800 (2010 IMF estimate).

Botswana’s impressive track record of good governance and economic growth, supported by prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management, stands in contrast to the country’s high levels of poverty and inequality and generally low human development indicators. While education expenditure is high at 10 percent of GDP and significant educational achievements have been attained, including the provision of nearly universal and free education, overall outcomes have not created the skills and workforce Botswana needs. Unemployment has been persistently high at near 20 percent, household incomes are much lower in rural than in urban areas (HIES 2002/03), and, while rural poverty rates have fallen, they remain significantly higher than in urban areas. The rate of HIV/AIDS infection has declined as a result of the government's aggressive introduction of anti HIV/AIDS drugs which are provided free of charge to the citizens.

As one of the world's fastest growing economies, Botswana is trying to diversify its economy which is heavily dependent on diamonds, beef market and tourism; which amongst other things is the proposed innovation hub project which will catapult the country to the world of innovations and innovation technology and researches in line with other institutions both local and international. Other minerals are soda ash, copper and nickel matte, gold, and coal.

==History==
{{Main|History of Botswana}}
[[Image:BotswanaDwelling.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A traditional dwelling&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Image:Gaboronecitycentre.JPG|thumb|City centre buildings in [[Gaborone]], Botswana]]

In the 19th century, hostilities broke out between [[Tswana people|Tswana]] inhabitants of Botswana and [[Ndebele people|Ndebele]] tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the north-east. Tensions also escalated with the [[Boer]] settlers from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to the east. After appeals by the Batswana leaders [[Khama III]], Bathoen and Sebele for assistance, the British Government put &quot;Bechuanaland&quot; under its protection on 31 March 1885. The northern territory remained under direct administration as the Bechuanaland Protectorate and is modern-day Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the [[Cape Colony]] and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa. The majority of [[Setswana]]-speaking people today live in South Africa.

When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]) and [[Swaziland]] (the &quot;High Commission Territories&quot;) were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, a vague undertaking was given to consult their inhabitants, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, Britain kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa.

An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regularized tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.

In June 1964, Britain accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from [[Mafeking|Mafikeng]] in South Africa, to the newly established [[Gaborone]], which sits near its border. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966. [[Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the [[Bamangwato|Ngwato]] chiefship, was elected as the first president, re-elected twice.

The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, [[Quett Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to [[Ian Khama]] (son of the first president), who resigned his position as leader of the [[Botswana Defence Force]] to take up this civilian role.

A long-running dispute over the northern border with [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]] was the subject of a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] in December 1999, which ruled that [[Kasikili Island]] belongs to Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southern-eagle.com/namibia/namgeninfo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and government==
{{Main|Politics of Botswana|Human rights in Botswana}}
{{See also|Foreign relations of Botswana}}
The politics of Botswana take place in a framework of a [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Botswana]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of Botswana]]. [[Botswana general election, 2009|The most recent election]], its tenth, was held on 16 October 2009.

Since independence was declared, the party system has been dominated by the [[Botswana Democratic Party]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. According to [[Transparency International]], Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and ranks similarly close to [[Portugal]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table 2008 Corruption Perception Index 2008]. Retrieved 7-23-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The national anthem is [[Fatshe leno la rona]].

===Administrative divisions===

&lt;!-- Blank space above for formatting purposes --&gt;
At {{convert|600370|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} Botswana is the world's 47th-largest country (after [[Ukraine]]). It is comparable in size to [[Madagascar]], and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of [[Texas]] or the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]]. It lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[27th parallel south|27°S]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[30th meridian east|30°E]].

The country is predominantly flat, tending toward gently rolling [[plateau|tableland]]. Botswana is dominated by the [[Kalahari Desert]], which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The [[Okavango Delta]], the world's largest inland [[River delta|delta]], is in the northwest. The [[Makgadikgadi Pan]], a large [[salt pan (geology)|salt pan]], lies in the north.

The [[Limpopo River]] Basin, the major landform of all of [[southern Africa]], lies partly in Botswana, in the southeast of the country. The [[Cuando River|Chobe River]] lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and [[Namibia]] (Caprivi Region). The Chobe River meets with the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] at a place called [[Kazungula]] (meaning a small sausage tree, a point where [[Sebitwane]] and his [[Makololo|Makololo tribe]] crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).

Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, where [[Blue Wildebeest]], [[antelope]]s, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered [[African Wild Dog]]. [[Chobe National Park]], found in the [[Chobe District]], has the world's largest concentration of [[African elephant]]s. The park covers about {{convert|11000|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and supports about 350 species of birds.
[[Image:Botswana sunrise.jpg|thumb|left|Sunrise in Botswana]]
The Chobe National Park and [[Moremi Game Reserve]] (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] located in the Kalahari desert in [[Ghanzi District]]; [[Makgadikgadi Pans National Park]] and [[Nxai Pan National Park]] are in [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]] in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned: located where the [[Shashe River]] and Limpopo River meet in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is [[Mokolodi Nature Reserve]] near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like the [http://www.khamarhinosanctuary.com/ Khama Rhino Sanctuary] (for Rhinoceros) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for Flamingos). They are both located in Central District.

===Environmental problems===
[[Image:Moremi gorge 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Moremi Gorge, in the Tswapong Hills east of [[Palapye]], Botswana. The porous rock absorbs rainwater, which then seeps out forming permanent cascades and pools. The hills provide one of Botswana's two breeding sites for the endangered [[cape vulture]].]]

Botswana is currently facing two major [[Natural environment|environment]]al problems: [[drought]] and [[desertification]].  The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country.  Due to the drought, 75% of the country’s human and animal populations are dependent on groundwater.  [[Groundwater]] use has eased the effects of drought, but has left a toll on the land. Groundwater is retrieved through drilling deep boreholes, which leads to the erosion of the land.  Surface water is very scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by [[rainfall]].  Due to this 95% of the country raises [[cattle]] and [[livestock]] as a means for an income.  Therefore, it is not a surprise to see that 71% of the country’s land is used for communal [[grazing]], which has been a major cause for the desertification of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;rala.is&quot;&gt;{{citation | publisher = Rala | place = IS | url = http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | title = Darkoh | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana, the land is continuing to be exploited. The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase. From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 1.7 million to 5.5 million&lt;ref name = &quot;rala.is&quot; /&gt;{{rp |64}}.  Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, nearly a 200% increase.  “Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is presently the largest single source of rural income”.  “Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use.  Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change”.&lt;ref name = &quot;rala.is&quot; /&gt;  It has been reported that the [[Okavango Delta]] is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |title= Botswana, US sign 'Debt-for-Nature' agreement |publisher=Afrol | date = | accessdate = 2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana, the largest inland delta in the world and is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol.com&quot;/&gt;

The Department and Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement project to reintroduce indigenous [[vegetation]] into communities in Kgalagadi South, Kweneng North and Boteti.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = UNCCD | url = http://www.unccd.int/iydd/documents/NOTCDIB.pdf | title = NOTCDIB | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land. The [[United States Government]] has also entered into an agreement with Botswana, giving them $7 million US dollars to reduce Botswana’s debt by $8.3 million US dollars.  The stipulation of the US reducing Botswana’s debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive [[Conservation biology| conservation]] of the land.&lt;ref name =&quot;afrol.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] claims that a major problem behind the overexploitation of resources, including land, in Botswana, is due to the [[poverty]] level.  To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana.  The purpose of the project is to draw from “indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems”.  The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, in order to draw these in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty.  The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development&lt;ref name = &quot;afrol1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 | title = Botswana villages fighting desertification |publisher=Afrol |date= |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence==
{{Main|Botswana Defence Force}}
At the time of independence Botswana had no armed forces. It was only after attacks from the [[Rhodesia]]n and [[South African Army|South African]] armies{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that the [[Botswana Defence Force]] (BDF) was formed in self-defence in 1977. The president is commander in chief and appoints a defence council. The BDF has approximately 12,000 members.

Following political changes in South Africa and the region, the BDF's missions have increasingly focused on prevention of [[poaching]], [[Emergency management|preparing for disasters]], and foreign [[peacekeeping]]. The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF, and a large segment of its officer corps has received U.S. training. It is considered an apolitical and professional institution.

Since independence, Botswana has had one of the fastest growth rates in [[per capita income]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of State website, [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1830.htm#econ Background Note: Botswana], May 2009. Retrieved 7-23-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Botswana has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country. By one estimate, it has the fourth highest [[gross national income]] at [[purchasing power parity]] in Africa, giving it a standard of living around that of [[Mexico]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Klaus Kästle |url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/GNI_PPP_of_countries.htm |title=GNI PPP table |publisher=Nationsonline.org |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[economic growth]] averaged over 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Botswana has a [[List of countries by economic freedom|high level of economic freedom]] compared to other African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.botswanaifsc.com/news/botswana_ranked_africas_leader.html |title=Botswana ranked Africa's leader in economic freedom }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has maintained a sound [[fiscal policy]], despite consecutive [[deficit|budget deficits]] in 2002 and 2003, and a negligible level of [[External debt|foreign debt]]. It earned the highest sovereign [[credit rating]] in Africa and has stockpiled foreign exchange reserves (over $7 billion in 2005/2006) amounting to almost two and a half years of current imports.

[[Debswana]], the largest [[list of diamond mines|diamond mining]] company operating in Botswana, is 50% owned by the government.&lt;ref name=botswana&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/business/worldbusiness/09nocera.html?ref=business|title=Diamonds are Forever in Botswana|accessdate=2010-03-15| date=August 8, 2008 |author=[[Joe Nocera]]|work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mineral industry provides about 40% of all government revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbankbotswana&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/BOTSWANAEXTN/0,,menuPK:322821~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:322804,00.html | title=Botswana Country Brief | publisher=World Bank }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, significant quantities of uranium were discovered, and mining is projected to begin by 2010. Several international mining corporations have established regional headquarters in Botswana, and prospected for diamonds, gold, uranium, copper, and even oil, many coming back with positive results. Government announced in early 2009, that they would try and shift their economic dependence on diamonds, over serious concern that diamonds are predicted to dry out in Botswana over the next twenty years.

An array of financial institutions populates the country’s financial system, with pension funds and commercial banks being the two most important segments by asset size. Banks remain profitable, well-capitalized, and liquid, as a result of growing national resources and high interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/botswana/botswana-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A Botswana Financial Sector Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Botswana’s competitive banking system is one of Africa’s most advanced.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} Generally adhering to global standards in the transparency of financial policies and banking supervision, the financial sector provides ample access to credit for entrepreneurs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The opening of Capital Bank in 2008 brought the total number of licensed banks to eight.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The government is involved in banking through state-owned financial institutions and a special financial incentives program that is aimed at increasing Botswana’s status as a financial centre.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Credit is allocated on market terms, although the government provides subsidized loans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Reform of non-bank financial institutions has continued in recent years, notably through the establishment of a single financial regulatory agency that provides more effective supervision.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The government has abolished exchange controls, and with the resulting creation of new portfolio investment options, the Botswana Stock Exchange is growing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The constitution prohibits the nationalization of private property and provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly. Botswana is ranked second only to South Africa among sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2009 International Property Rights Index.

While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves a number of sectors for citizen participation. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatization of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchise fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.

==Demographics==
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand. Bushmen in Botswana.]]
[[File:Gathering food in the Okavango.jpg|thumb|A girl in the [[Okavango Delta]].]]
{{Main|Demographics of Botswana}}

Botswana's main ethnic groups are [[Batswana]], [[BaKalanga]], [[Bushmen]] or [[AbaThwa]] also known as Basarwa. Other tribes are [[Bayei]], Bambukushu, [[Basubia]], Baherero and Bakgalagadi. Other groups of ethnicities in Botswana include whites and Indians, both groups being roughly equally small in number. [[Indians in Botswana|Botswana's Indian]] population is made up of many Indian-Africans of several generations, from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, South Africa, and so on, as well as first generation Indian immigrants. The [[White African|white population]] is native to Botswana or from other parts of Africa including Zimbabwe and South Africa. The white population speaks either English or Afrikaans and makes up roughly 3% of the population.

Since 2000, because of deteriorating economic conditions in Zimbabwe, the number of [[Zimbabweans in Botswana]] has risen into the tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=National and international responses to the Zimbabwean exodus: implications for the refugee protection regime|publisher=Policy Development and Evaluation Service, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]|series=Research Papers|volume=175|last=Betts|first=Alexander|last2=Kaytaz|first2=Ezra|year=2009|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/retrieveattachments?openagent&amp;shortid=MINE-7UL4R6&amp;file=Full_Report.pdf|format=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Khutse Kalahari Lodge.jpg|thumb|A [[rondavel]] at Khutse Kalahari Lodge, Botswana.]]
The official language of Botswana is [[English language|English]] although [[Setswana]] is widely spoken across the country. In Setswana [[prefix]]es are more important than they are in many other languages. These prefixes include &quot;Bo&quot;, which refers to the country, &quot;Ba&quot;, which refers to the people, &quot;Mo&quot;, which is one person, and &quot;Se&quot; which is the language. For example, the main tribe of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.

An estimated 70 percent of the country's citizens identify themselves as Christians. Anglicans, Methodists, and the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa make up the majority of Christians. There are also congregations of Lutherans, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, Baptists, the Dutch Reformed Church, Mennonites, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Christian sects.

According to the 2001 census, the country's [[Muslim]] community, primarily of South Asian origin, numbers slightly more than 5,000. The 2001 census also lists approximately 3,000 [[Hindus]] and 700 [[Baha'is]]. Approximately 20 percent of citizens espouse no religion.

{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Botswana}}

Like elsewhere in the Sub-Saharan Africa, the [[economic impact of AIDS]] is considerable. Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 2002–3 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana | Botswana has been hit]] very hard by the [[AIDS pandemic]]; in 2006 it was estimated that [[life expectancy]] at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years.&lt;ref name=Kallings&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=J Intern Med| year = 2008 | volume = 263 | issue = 3 | pages = 218–43| title=The first postmodern pandemic: 25 years of HIV/AIDS|author=Kallings LO|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x |pmid=18205765|url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Botswana]] was estimated at 24% for adults in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = UNAIDS | url = http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/GlobalReport/2006/ | title = Global Report | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the government began a comprehensive program involving free or cheap generic anti-retroviral drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus.

Approximately one in six [[Tswana people| Batswana]] has [[HIV]], giving Botswana the second highest infection rate in the world after nearby [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.avert.org/aidsbotswana.htm HIV and Aids in Botswana | publisher = Avert (International Aids Charity) | accessdate = 2009-23-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The government recognizes that [[AIDS]] will affect the economy and is trying to combat the epidemic, including free [[Antiretroviral drug|anti-retroviral drug]] treatment and a nation-wide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program. Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% to just 4%.

===Cancer===
The [[Cancer Association of Botswana]] is a voluntary [[non-governmental organization]]. The association is a member of the Union for International Cancer Control. The Association supplements existing services through provision of [[cancer]] prevention and health awareness programmes, facilitating access to health services for cancer patients and offering support and counseling to those affected.&lt;ref name=&quot;UICC Cancer Association of Botswana&quot;&gt;[http://www.uicc.org/membership/cancer-association-botswana UCII page for Cancer Association of Botswana), retrieved 2010-11-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[Image:University of Botswana dorms.jpg|thumb|Residence hall of the [[University of Botswana]] in Gaborone, Botswana]]
{{Main|Education in Botswana}}

Botswana has made great strides in educational development since independence in 1966{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and only a very small percentage of the population attended secondary school. Botswana increased its adult literacy rate from 69% in 1991 to 83% in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;[http://stats.uis.unesco.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the discovery of diamonds and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the [[Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (BGCSE). Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.

After leaving school, students can attend one of the six technical colleges in the country, or take vocational training courses in [[teaching]] or [[nursing]]. The best students enter the [[University of Botswana]], [[Botswana College of Agriculture]] [http://www.bca.bw], and The [[Botswana Accountancy College]] in Gaborone. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. A high majority of these students are government sponsored. A larger influx of tertiary students is expected when construction of the nation's second international university, The [[Botswana International University of Science and Technology]], is completed in [[Palapye]].

One notable [[International]] [[University]] is [[Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]] that offers various [[Associate Degree]](s) in [[Creative Arts]]. This has helped many youths develop and create their own businesses across the country.

The quantitative gains have not always been matched by qualitative ones. Primary schools in particular still lack resources, and the teachers are less well paid than their secondary school colleagues. The Botswana Ministry of Education&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.bw/index.php?id=10]&lt;/ref&gt; is working to establish libraries in primary schools in partnership with the [[African Library Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanlibraryproject.org/about-us/our-partners/139-library-partner-botswana-ministry-of-education]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Botswana]] hopes that by investing a large part of national income in education, the country will become less dependent on diamonds for its economic survival, and less dependent on expatriates for its skilled workers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Botswana invests 21% of its government spending in education.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref&quot; /&gt;

In January 2006, Botswana announced the reintroduction of school fees after two decades of free state education&lt;ref&gt;BBC News website, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4601360.stm Botswana brings back school fees]. Retrieved 2009-23-7.&lt;/ref&gt; though the government still provides full scholarships with living expenses to any Botswana citizen in university, either at the University of Botswana or if the student wishes to pursue an education in any field not offered locally, such as medicine, they are provided with a full scholarship to study abroad.

==Sports==
{{See also|Botswana at the Olympics}}
[[Association Football|Football]] is the most popular Sport in Botswana. Other popular Sports in Botswana are [[Cricket]], [[Tennis]], [[Rugby football|Rugby]], [[Softball]], [[team handball|Handball]], [[Golf]] and [[Track and Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20060126|title=Sparks to fly at Diamond|publisher=Botswana Press Agency (BOPA)|accessdate=2008-01-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20040813|title=Opinion the Academic World|publisher=Botswana Press Agency (BOPA)|accessdate=2008-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061003050400/http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20040813 |archivedate = October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botswana is an associate member of the [[International Cricket Council]].

[[Contract bridge]] has a strong following. The game of ''Bridge'' was first played in Botswana over 30 years ago and grew in popularity during the 1980s. Many British expatriate school teachers informally taught ''Bridge'' in Botswana’s secondary schools. The Botswana Bridge Federation (BBF) was founded in 1988 and continues to organize tournaments. The game has remained popular and the BBF has over 800 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnsc.co.bw/affiliates/bridge_federation.htm|title=Botswana Bridge Federation|publisher=Botswana National Sports Council|accessdate=2008-05-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227184536/http://www.bnsc.co.bw/affiliates/bridge_federation.htm |archivedate = February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the BBF invited the [[English Bridge Union]] to host a week-long Bridge teaching program in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/news/2008/BotswanaTrip.htm|title=English Bridge Union|publisher=English Bridge Union|accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Tsodilo Hills rock paintings4.jpg|thumb|Rock paintings of [[Tsodilo Hills]]]]
{{Main|Culture of Botswana}}

Besides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana-whether construed as members of the Tswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana.
The Scottish writer, Alexander McCall Smith, has written a number of popular novels ([[No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]] series) about Botswana that entertain as well as inform the reader about the culture and customs of Botswana.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Botswana}}
Tswana music is mostly vocal and performed without drums; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Tswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane, Segankure/Segaba, and for the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music.

===Visual arts===
{{Main|Art of Botswana}}
In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of [[Etsha]] and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting [[basket]]s from [[Mokola Palm]] and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through color use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.

Other notable artistic communities include [[Thamaga Pottery]] and [[Oodi Weavers]], both located in the southeastern part of Botswana.

The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/[[Bushmen]]) over twenty thousand years ago within the [[Kalahari]] desert.

In addition to these more traditional arts there are a number of extremely talented artists who use modern means to express themselves. There are a few galleries around Botswana that display paintings and sculptures. Some pieces are inspired by the beautiful Botswana landscapes and others by the people themselves.

===Cuisine===
[[Image:Boerewors raw.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Boerewors]]]]
{{Main|Cuisine of Botswana}}
The cuisine of Botswana is unique but also shares some characteristics with other cuisine of [[Southern Africa]]. Examples of Botswana food are [[Pap (food)|Pap]], [[Boerewors]], [[Samp]], [[Vetkoek]] and [[Mopane worms]]. A food unique to Botswana includes [[Seswaa]], heavily [[salted]] mashed-up [[meat]].

Apart from its coastline with the [[South China Sea]], it is completely surrounded by the [[federated state|state]] of [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]], and in fact it is separated into two parts by [[Limbang]], which is part of Sarawak. It is the only sovereign state completely on the island of [[Borneo]], with the remainder of the island belonging to [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. Brunei's population is around [[Bruneian People|400,000]] (July 2010). 

Brunei can trace its beginnings to the 7th century, when it was a subject state of the [[Srivijaya]]n empire under the name [[Po-ni]].&lt;ref&gt;See Johannes L. Kurz &quot;Boni in Chinese Sources: Translations of Relevant Texts from the Song to the Qing Dynasties&quot;, paper accessible under http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=172 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; It later became a [[vassal state]] of [[Majapahit]] empire before converting to [[Islam]] in the 15th century. At the peak of [[Bruneian Empire|its empire]], the sultanate had control that extended over the coastal regions of modern-day [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]], the [[Sulu archipelago]], and the islands off the northwest tip of [[Borneo]]. The [[thalassocracy]] was visited by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521 and fought the [[Castille War]] in 1578 against [[Spain]]. Its empire began to decline with the forced ceding of [[Sarawak]] to [[James Brooke]] and the ceding of [[Sabah]] to the British [[North Borneo Chartered Company]]. After the loss of [[Limbang]], Brunei finally became a British [[protectorate]] in 1888, receiving a resident in 1906. In the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak|post-occupation years]], it formalised a [[constitution]] and fought an [[Brunei Revolt|armed rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pocock  |first=Tom |title=Fighting General – The Public &amp;Private Campaigns of General Sir Walter Walker |year=1973 |edition=First |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0002112957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunei regained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]] on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1970s and 1990s, averaging 56% from 1999 to 2008, has transformed Brunei Darussalam into a newly industrialised country.

Brunei has the second highest [[Human Development Index]] among the [[South East Asia]] nations after [[Singapore]], and is classified as a [[Developed Country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Human Development Reports |publisher=United Nations |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/ |accessdate=2009-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), Brunei is ranked 4th in the world by [[gross domestic product]] per capita at [[purchasing power parity]].&lt;ref&gt;Data refer to the year 2009.

==Etymology==
According to legend, Brunei was founded by Awang Alak Betatar. His move from Garang [location required]{{Clarify|what location?|date=August 2010}} to the Brunei river estuary led to the discovery of Brunei. His first exclamation upon landing on the shore, as the legend goes, was “Baru nah!” (Which in English loosely translates as &quot;that's it!&quot; or &quot;there&quot;) and thus, the name “Brunei” was derived from his words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/03/08/treasuring-bruneis-past/| title=South east Asian Archaeology, Treasuring Brunei's past| date=2 April 2010| publisher=Southeast Asian Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was renamed &quot;Barunai&quot; in the 14th Century, possibly influenced by the Sanskrit word varunai (वरुण), meaning &quot;seafarers&quot;, later to become &quot;Brunei&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The word &quot;Borneo&quot; is of the same origin. In the country's full name &quot;Negara Brunei Darussalam&quot;(بروني دارالسلام), &quot;Darussalam&quot; means &quot;Abode of Peace&quot; in Arabic, while &quot;Negara&quot; means &quot;Country&quot; in Malay. &quot;Negara&quot; derives from the Sanskrit Nagara (नगर), meaning &quot;city&quot;.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Brunei}}
The power of the [[Sultanate]] of Brunei was at its peak between the 15th to the 17th centuries, with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; The efforts of the Brunei Sultans in spreading Islam helped to spread the religion not only in Borneo but also as far north as to the southern Philippines islands. When Malacca fell to the Portuguese in 1511, it was Brunei that played a major role in the spread of Islam in the region.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

By the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei, and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, [[Alonso Beltran]], a Spanish traveler described it as being five stories tall and built on the water. Most likely it had five layers of roofs to represent the Five Pillars of Islam. This mosque was destroyed by the Spanish in June that same year.

[[Europe]]an influence gradually brought an end to this [[regional power]], as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. Piracy was also detrimental to the kingdom.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Later, there was a brief war with [[Spain]], in which Brunei's capital was occupied. Eventually the sultanate was victorious but lost territories to [[Spain]]. The decline of the [[Bruneian Empire]] culminated in the 19th century, when Brunei lost much of its territory to the [[White Rajahs]] of [[Sarawak]], resulting in its current small landmass and separation into two parts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Brunei was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[protectorate]] from 1888 to 1984,&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; and occupied by [[Japan]] from 1941 to 1945 during [[World War II]].

There was a small [[rebellion]] against the [[monarchy]] during the 1960s, which was suppressed with help from the [[United Kingdom]]. This event became known as the [[Brunei Revolt]] and was partly responsible for the failure to create the [[North Borneo Federation]]. The rebellion partially affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the [[Malaysia|Malaysian Federation]].

== Politics and government ==
{{Main|Politics of Brunei}}
[[File:Hassanal Bolkiah.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hassanal Bolkiah]], [[Sultan of Brunei]].]]
Brunei has a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional sultanate]]. It has a legal system based on [[English common law]], although Islamic [[shariah law]] supersedes this in some cases.&lt;ref name=cia /&gt; 

The political system in the country is governed by the constitution and the tradition of the Malay Islamic Monarchy, the concept of “Melayu Islam Beraja” (MIB). The three components of MIB cover Malay culture, Islamic religion and the political framework under the monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruneipress.com.bn&quot;/&gt;

Under Brunei's 1959 [[constitution]], [[His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah]] is the [[head of state]] with full executive authority, including emergency powers, since 1962. The Sultan's role is enshrined in the national ideology known as '''[[Melayu Islam Beraja]]''' ('''MIB'''), or [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[Muslim]] [[Monarchy]]. The country has been under hypothetical [[martial law]] since [[Brunei Revolt]] of 1962. The Royal family retains a venerated status within the country.

=== Press freedom ===
[[News media|Media]] in Brunei is extremely pro-government.
The country has been given Not Free status by [[Freedom House]]; press criticism of the government and monarchy is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/pfs/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=6929&amp;year=2007&amp;pf |title=Freedom Of The Press – Brunei (2006) |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the press is not overtly hostile towards other viewpoints and is not restricted on only publishing articles regarding the government. The government allowed a printing and publishing company, Brunei Press SDN BHD, to form in 1953. It continues to print the leading English daily ''[[Borneo Bulletin]]''. This paper began as a weekly community paper, became the country's daily paper in 1990 and &quot;remains the foremost source of information on local and foreign affairs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bruneipress.com.bn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruneipress.com.bn/brunei/brunei.html |title=About Brunei |publisher=Bruneipress.com.bn |date=1998-07-30 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from The ''Borneo Bulletin'', there is also the ''[[Media Permata]]'', the local Malay newspaper which is circulated daily. ''[[The Brunei Times]]'', another newspaper written in English is an independent newspaper published in Brunei Darussalam. It is owned by the company, Brunei Times Sdn Bhd which consist of a group of prominent local businessmen.

As for mass media, the Brunei government owns and operates six television channels with the introduction of digital TV using DVB-T (RTB 1, RTB 2, RTB 3 (HD), RTB 4, RTB 5 and RTB New Media (Game portal) and five radio stations (National FM, Pilihan FM, Nur Islam FM, Harmony FM and Pelangi FM). A private company has made cable television available (Astro-Kristal) as well as one private radio station, Kristal FM.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruneipress.com.bn&quot;/&gt;

== Foreign relations ==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Brunei}}
With its traditional ties with the [[United Kingdom]], it became the 49th member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] immediately on the day of its independence on 1 January 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=
http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/commonwealth.htm| title=MOFAT, Commonwealth| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Brunei Darussalam}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its first initiatives toward improved regional relations, Brunei joined [[ASEAN]] on January 7, 1984, becoming the sixth member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Background Note:Brunei Darussalam/Profile:/Foreign Relations |publisher=United States State Department |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2700.htm |accessdate=2007-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It later joined the [[United Nations]] at the 39th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and became a full member on 21 September 1984 as a means to achieve recognition of its sovereignty and full independence from the world community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/unitednation.htm| title=MOFAT, UN| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Brunei Darussalam}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is an Islamic country, Brunei Darussalam became a full member of the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] in January 1984 at the Fourth [[Islamic Summit]] held in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.bn/foreignpolicy/oic.htm| title=MOFAT, OIC| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Brunei Darussalam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its accession to the [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum (APEC) in 1989, Brunei hosted the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November 2000 and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.apec.org/apec/leaders__declarations/2000.html| title=APEC, 2000 Leaders' Declaration| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for other economic ties, Brunei Darussalam became an original member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) since it came into force in 1 January 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.bn/economytrade/wto.htm| title=MOFAT, WTO| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a major player in [[BIMP-EAGA]] which was formed during the Inaugural Ministers’ Meeting in [[Davao]], [[Philippines]] on March 24, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.bn/economytrade/bimpeaga.htm| title=MOFAT, BIMP-EAGA| date=30 March 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunei is recognized by every nation in the world. It shares a close relationship particularly with the Philippines and other nations such as [[Singapore]]. In April 2009, Brunei and the [[Philippines]] signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) that seeks to strengthen the bilateral cooperation of the two countries in the fields of agriculture and farm-related trade and investments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://businessmirror.com.ph/home/economy/9637-rp-brunei-sign-farm-cooperation-deal.html &quot;RP, Brunei sign farm-cooperation deal&quot;]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Territorial disputes ===
Brunei is one of many nations to lay claim to some of the disputed [[Spratly Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The status of Limbang as part of Sarawak was disputed by Brunei since the area was first annexed in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html |title=the CIA World Fact Book |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue flared up again in 2010 when former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad publicly criticised Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's government for secretly negotiating with Brunei to have them give up their claim over Limbang in exchange for Malaysia giving up its claim on two oil-rich plots in the South China Sea. Brunei has since insisted that no agreement has been reached over the Limbang issue, and that it was not even discussed despite Abdullah's claim that Brunei has given up its claims on the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/5/9/nation/6188182&amp;sec=nation A tale of two oil blocks] The Star.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Brunei}}
[[File:Map of Brunei Demis.png|thumb|150px|right]]
Brunei is a [[southeast asia]]n country consisting of two unconnected parts with the total area of {{convert|5765|km2|sqmi|0}}. It has {{convert|161|km|mi|0}} of coastline next to the [[South China sea]], and it shares a 381 kilometre (237&amp;nbsp;mi) border with Malaysia. It has {{convert|500|km2|sqmi|0}} of territorial waters, and an 200&amp;nbsp;nm [[exclusive economic zone]].&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; 

77% of the population lives in the eastern part of Brunei, while only about 10,000 live in the mountainous south eastern part (the district of [[Temburong]]). The total population of Brunei Darussalam is approximately 408,000 (July 2010) of which around 150,000 live in the capital [[Bandar Seri Begawan]].&lt;ref&gt;2001 Summary Tables of the Population Census. Department of Statistics, Brunei Darussalam&lt;/ref&gt; Other major towns are the port town of [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]], the oil producing town of [[Seria]] and its neighboring town, [[Kuala Belait]]. In the [[Belait]] district, the [[Panaga]] area is home to large numbers of expatriates due to [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and British Army housing and recreational facilities. 

Most of Brunei is within the [[Borneo lowland rain forests]] ecoregion that covers most of the island but there are areas of [[Borneo montane rain forests|mountain rain forests]] inland.

The [[climate of Brunei]] is [[tropical climate|tropical]].&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; The average annual temperature is {{convert|26.1|°C}}, with the April–May average of {{convert|24.7|°C}} and the October–December average of {{convert|23.8|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bruneiweather.com.bn/content/summary3pix.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Brunei}}
This small, wealthy [[economic system|economy]] is a mixture of [[foreign corporation|foreign]] and [[domestic policy|domestic]] entrepreneurship, government regulation, [[social welfare|welfare]] measures, and [[village]] [[tradition]]. [[petroleum|Crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] production account for nearly half of its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides for all [[medical]] services and subsidizes [[rice]] and housing.

Brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal [[social cohesion]] although it became a more prominent player by serving as [[chairman]] for the 2000 [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum. Stated plans for the future include upgrading the [[labour (economics)|labour]] force, reducing [[unemployment]], strengthening the [[banking]] and [[tourism]] sectors, and, in general, further widening the economic base.

The national airline, [[Royal Brunei Airlines|Royal Brunei]], is trying to make Brunei a hub for international travel between Europe and Australia/New Zealand, and also has services to major Asian destinations. Brunei is increasingly importing from other countries.

=== The Brunei Halal brand ===
Brunei Darussalam in July 2009 launched its national [[halal]] branding scheme Brunei Halal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hadi Dp Mahmudbandar Seri Begawan |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/en/local_business/2009/08/01/brunei_pioneers_national_halal_branding |title=Brunei pioneers national halal branding |publisher=Bt.com.bn |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows manufacturers in Brunei and in other countries to use the premium Brunei Halal trademark to help them penetrate lucrative markets in countries with significant numbers of Muslim consumers. The Brunei Halal brand is said to be the first proper attempt to put together a global halal brand that will reap the potential commercial returns of catering to the consumption needs of Muslims worldwide.

As envisioned by the Sultanate, the use of the Brunei Halal brand would signify to Muslim consumers the manufacturers' strict compliance with laws relating to Islamic teachings. Brunei also aims to build confidence in the brand through strategies that will both ensure the halal integrity of the products and unfaltering compliance with set rules governing the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing process, logistics and distribution.

A new company, government-owned Brunei Wafirah Holdings Sdn Bhd, has been established as the owner of the Brunei Halal brand. Wafirah has entered into a joint venture with Brunei Global Islamic Investment and Hong Kong-based logistics firm Kerry FSDA Limited to form Ghanim International Food Corporation Sdn Bhd. Ghanim International manages the use of the Brunei Halal trademark. Producers that want to use the brand are required to first acquire the Brunei halal label (or the certification for compliance with accepted manufacturing and slaughtering practices under Islam) through the Department of Syariah Affairs' Halal Food Control Section. They can then approach Ghanim for their application to use the brand.

=== Agriculture ===
To achieve its target for food self-sufficiency, Brunei renamed its Brunei Darussalam Rice 1 to Laila Rice during the launch of the &quot;Padi Planting Towards Achieving Self-Sufficiency of Rice Production in Brunei Darussalam&quot; ceremony at the Wasan padi fields in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ubaidillah Masli, Goh De Noand Faez Hani BRUNEI-MUARA |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/en/home_news/2009/04/28/laila_rice_to_bruneis_rescue |title='Laila Rice' to Brunei's rescue |publisher=Bt.com.bn |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, the Royal Family reaped the first few Laila padi stalks, after years of multiple attempts to boost local rice production, a goal which was envisioned about half a century ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ubaidillah Masli, Deno Gohand Faez HaniBRUNEI-MUARA |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/en/home_news/2009/08/04/hm_inaugurates_laila_harvest |title=HM inaugurates Laila harvest |publisher=Bt.com.bn |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health care ==
All Brunei citizens have access to free health care from public hospitals. The largest hospital in Brunei is [[Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital]] (RIPAS) hospital situated in the country's capital [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]. There are two private medical centres, Gleneagles JPMC Sdn Bhd .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gleneaglesjpmc.com.bn/|title=Gleneagles JPMC|accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerudong Park Medical Centre]]. As of 2008, no hospitals in Brunei were undergoing [[international healthcare accreditation]].

There is currently no [[medical school]] in Brunei, and Bruneians wishing to study to become doctors must attend university overseas. However, the Institute of Medicines had been introduced at the [[Universiti Brunei Darussalam]] and a new building has been built for the faculty. The building, including research lab facilities, was completed in 2009. There has been a School of Nursing since 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.find-health-articles.com/rec_pub_17004384-nursing-staff-education-brunei.htm |title=FHA – [Nursing staff education in Brunei – Article Summary |publisher=Find-health-articles.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 58 nurse managers were appointed in RIPAS to improve service and provide better medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bandar Seri Begawan |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/en/home_news/2009/03/19/58_nurse_managers_appointed |title=58 nurse managers appointed &amp;#124; The Brunei Times |publisher=Bt.com.bn |date=2009-03-19 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, The nursing college merged with the Institute of Medicines at the Universiti Brunei Darussalam to produce more nurses and midwives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hadi Dp Mahmudbandar Seri Begawan |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/en/home_news/2008/12/06/problem_needs_nursing_with_care |title=Problem needs nursing with care &amp;#124; The Brunei Times |publisher=Bt.com.bn |date=2008-12-06 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is now called the PAPRSB (Pengiran Anak Puteri Rashidah Sa'datul Bolkiah) Institute of Health Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubd.edu.bn/academic/faculty/im/index2.htm |title=Institute of Medicine |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health Promotion Centre opened in November 2008 and serves to educate the public on the importance of having a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;bt.com.bn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bandar Seri Begawan |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/en/home_news/2009/04/17/hrh_visits_health_promotion_centre |title=HRH visits Health Promotion Centre &amp;#124; The Brunei Times |publisher=Bt.com.bn |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in Brunei}}

The major population centres in the country are linked by a network of 2,800 kilometres of road. The 135&amp;nbsp;km highway from Muara Town to Kuala Belait is being upgraded to a dual carriageway.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruneipress.com.bn&quot;/&gt;

Brunei is accessible by air, sea and land transport. [[Brunei International Airport]] is the main entry point to the country. [[Royal Brunei Airlines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruneiair.com/ |title=Welcome to Royal Brunei Airlines |publisher=Bruneiair.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the national carrier. The ferry terminal at Muara services regular connections to Labuan island (Malaysia). The speedboats provide passenger and goods transportation to the Temburong district. The main highway running across Brunei is the Tutong-Muara Highway. The country's road network is well developed. Brunei has one main sea port located at Muara. The export of its petroleum products is carried out through dedicated terminals.

With one private car for every 2.09 persons, Brunei Darussalam has one of the highest car ownership rates in the world. This has been attributed to the absence of comprehensive transport system, low import tax, inexpensive maintenance and low unleaded petrol price of B$0.53 per litre.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruneipress.com.bn&quot;/&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Brunei}}
The population of Brunei is 395,027, of which 75 per cent live in urban areas. The average life expectancy is 75.96 years.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Brunei}}
The official [[language]] of the nation is [[Brunei Melayu]], a standardised form of [[Malay language|Malay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://bruneitimes.com.bn/art-culture/2010/08/04/perambahan-unique-feature-brunei-malay&lt;/ref&gt; [[English language|English]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are also spoken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;Martin, P.

[[Islam]] is the official [[religion]] of Brunei,&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; and the sultan is the head of the religion in the country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Two-thirds of the population adheres to Islam. Other faiths practiced are [[Buddhism]] (13 percent, mainly by the Chinese) and [[Christianity]] (10 percent).&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; [[Freethought|Freethinkers]], mostly Chinese, form about seven percent of the population. Although most of them practice some form of religion with elements of Buddhism, [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]], they prefer to present themselves as having professed no religion officially, hence regarded as [[atheists]] in official censuses. Followers of indigenous religions are about two percent of the population.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Brunei}}
The culture of Brunei is predominantly [[Malay people|Malay]] (reflecting its ethnicity), with heavy influences from [[Islam]], but is seen as more conservative than [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of religious freedom, see http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71334.htm (United States Department of State).&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunei's culture mainly derived from the Old Malay World, which encompassed the Malay
Archipelago and from this stemmed what is known as the Malay Civilisation. Based on historical
facts, various cultural elements and foreign civilisations had a hand in influencing the culture of
this country. Thus, the influence of culture can be traced to four dominating periods of animism,
Hinduism, Islam and the West. However, it was Islam that managed to wind its roots deeply
into the culture of Brunei hence it became a way of life and adopted as the state's ideology and
philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpm.gov.bn/pmo1/index.php?view=article&amp;id=185%3Alanguage-and-culture&amp;format=pdf&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=209&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prohibition of alcohol ===
As a [[Sharia]] country, the sale and public consumption of [[alcohol]] is banned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunei Tourism Website&quot;&gt;[http://www.tourismbrunei.com/info/do.html Brunei Tourism Website (Government appointed)]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslims are allowed to purchase a limited amount of alcohol from their point of embarkation overseas for their own private consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruneipress.com.bn&quot;/&gt;

=== Notable Bruneians ===
* [[Dk Najibah Era Al-Sufri]], a member of the [[Kaspersky Commonwealth Antarctic Expedition]]
* [[Wu Chun]], member of [[Fahrenheit (Taiwanese band)|Fahrenheit]]
* [[Hill Zaini|Hill]], male singer and actor
* [[Zul F]], winner of 2005 Brunei Idol
* [[Maria (Brunei Artist)|Maria]], local female singer
* [[Eqah]], female singer
* [[D'Hask]], rock band
* [[Craig Adams (ice hockey)|Craig Adams]], two time [[Stanley Cup]] winner, born in [[Seria]], plays for [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]

The '''Virgin Islands''', often called the '''British Virgin Islands''' ('''BVI'''), is a [[British overseas territory]], located in the [[Caribbean]] to the east of [[Puerto Rico]]. The islands make up part of the [[Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands archipelago]], the remaining islands constituting the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]. British Virgin Islands government publications had traditionally continued to commence with &quot;''The Territory of the Virgin Islands''&quot;, but recently, more legislation now simply refers to the Territory as the &quot;''British Virgin Islands''&quot;. &lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The Interpretation Act (Cap 136) (1985) defines the &quot;Territory&quot; as simply the &quot;Virgin Islands&quot;; but the Insolvency Act, 2003 defines a &quot;foreign company&quot; as 'a body corporate that is incorporated, registered or formed outside the ''British Virgin Islands''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The British Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of [[Tortola]], [[Virgin Gorda]], [[Anegada]] and [[Jost Van Dyke]], along with over fifty other smaller islands and [[cay]]s. Approximately 15 of the islands are inhabited. The capital, [[Road Town]], is situated on Tortola, the largest island which is approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide. The islands have a total population of about 22,000, of whom approximately 18,000 live on Tortola.

==History==
{{Main|History of the British Virgin Islands}}
The Virgin Islands were first settled by the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] from [[South America]] around 100 BC (though there is some evidence of [[Amerindian]] presence on the islands as far back as 1500 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Samuel M. ed. ''The Indigenous People of the Caribbean''. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1997. ISBN 0-8130-1692-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Arawaks inhabited the islands until the 15th century when they were displaced by the more aggressive [[Caribs]], a tribe from the [[Lesser Antilles]] islands, after whom the [[Caribbean Sea]] is named.

The first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 on his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus gave them the fanciful name ''Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Vírgenes..'' (Saint Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins), shortened to ''Las Vírgenes'' (The Virgins), after the legend of [[Saint Ursula]].

The [[Spanish Empire]] claimed the islands by discovery in the early 16th century, but never settled them, and subsequent years saw the English, Dutch, French, Spanish and Danish all jostling for control of the region, which became a notorious haunt for pirates. There is no record of any native Amerindian population in the British Virgin Islands during this period, although the native population on nearby [[Saint Croix, United States Virgin Islands|St. Croix]] was decimated. Some Carib Amerindians still live on nearby [[Saint Croix]].

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] established a [[Dutch Virgin Islands|permanent settlement]] on the island of [[Tortola]] by 1648. In 1672, the [[England|English]] captured Tortola from the Dutch, and the English annexation of [[Anegada]] and [[Virgin Gorda]] followed in 1680. Meanwhile, over the period 1672&amp;ndash;1733, the Danish gained control of the nearby islands of [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], [[Saint John, United States Virgin Islands|St. John]] and [[Saint Croix|St. Croix]].

[[File:St Phillips Church, Tortola.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ruins of [[St. Phillip's Church|St Phillip's Church, Tortola]], one of the most important historical ruins in the Territory.]]
The British islands were considered principally a strategic possession, but were planted when economic conditions were particularly favourable. The British introduced [[sugar cane]] which was to become the main crop and source of foreign trade, and slaves were brought from [[Africa]] to work on the sugar cane plantations. The islands prospered economically until the middle of the 1800s, when a combination of the [[Slavery in the British Virgin Islands|abolition of slavery in the Territory]], a series of disastrous hurricanes, and the growth in the [[sugar beet]] crop in Europe and the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, a major market for sugar from the Territory, the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846]] also created a considerable downward effect on the price of Caribbean sugar cane.&lt;/ref&gt; significantly reduced sugar cane production and led to a period of economic decline.

In 1917, the [[United States]] purchased St. John, St. Thomas and St. Croix from Denmark for US$25 million, renaming them the [[United States Virgin Islands]].

The British Virgin Islands were administered variously as part of the [[British Leeward Islands]] or with [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], with an Administrator representing the British Government on the Islands. Separate colony status was gained for the Islands in 1960 and the Islands became autonomous in 1967. Since the 1960s, the islands have diversified away from their traditionally agriculture-based economy towards tourism and financial services, becoming one of the wealthiest areas in the Caribbean.

{{Main|Geography of the British Virgin Islands}}
The British Virgin Islands comprise around sixty tropical Caribbean islands, ranging in size from the largest, Tortola {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, to tiny uninhabited [[islets]]. They are located in the [[Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands archipelago]], a few miles east of the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. The [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] lies to the north of the islands, and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lies to the south. Most of the islands are volcanic in origin and have a hilly, rugged terrain. Anegada is geologically distinct from the rest of the group and is a flat island composed of limestone and coral.

In addition to the four main islands of [[Tortola]], [[Virgin Gorda]], [[Anegada]], and [[Jost Van Dyke]], other islands include:

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of the British Virgin Islands}}
The British Virgin Islands enjoy a tropical climate, moderated by [[trade wind]]s. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. In the capital, [[Road Town]], typical daily maxima are around {{convert|32|°C|1|lk=on}} in the summer and {{convert|29|°C|1}} in the winter. Typical daily minima are around {{convert|24|°C|1|lk=on}} in the summer and {{convert|21|°C|1}} in the winter. Rainfall averages about {{convert|1150|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year, higher in the hills and lower on the coast. Rainfall can be quite variable, but the wettest months on average are September to November and the driest months on average are February and March. Hurricanes occasionally hit the islands, with the hurricane season running from June to November.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the British Virgin Islands}}
[[File:Old LegCo Building, Road Town.jpg|right|thumb|Legislative Council building in [[Road Town]].  The High Court sits upstairs.]]
Executive authority in British Virgin Islands is vested in [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]] and is exercised on her behalf by the [[Governor of the British Virgin Islands]]. The Governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[British Government]]. Defence and Foreign Affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom.

A new constitution was adopted in 2007 (the Virgin Islands Constitution Order, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/em2007/uksiem_20071678_en.pdf Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force when the [[Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands|Legislative Council]] was dissolved for the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 2007|2007 general election]]. The Head of Government under the new constitution is the [[Premier of the British Virgin Islands|Premier]] (prior to the new constitution the office was referred to as [[Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands|Chief Minister]]), who is elected in a general election along with the other members of the ruling government as well as the members of the opposition. A Cabinet is nominated by the Premier and appointed by the Governor. The Legislature consists of the Queen (represented by the Governor) and a [[unicameral]] [[House of Assembly]] made up of 13 elected members plus the Speaker and the Attorney-General.

The current Governor is [[William Boyd McCleary]] (since 2010). The current Premier is [[Ralph T. O'Neal]] (since 22 August 2007).

==Economy==
[[File:Roadtown, Tortola.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Road Town]], Tortola, British Virgin Islands]]
{{Main|Economy of the British Virgin Islands}}
As an [[offshore financial centre]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesherald.com/articles/2009/05/09/business/doc4a04ef4f516e1869586320.txt&lt;/ref&gt; the British Virgin Islands enjoys one of the more prosperous economies of the Caribbean region, with a per capita average income of around $38,500 (2004 est.)&lt;ref&gt;CIA. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vi.html Economy: British Virgin Islands]. The World Factbook, CIA publications, 19 December. 2006. Retrieved 25 December. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;twin pillars&quot; of the economy are tourism and financial services. Politically, tourism is the more important of the two, as it employs a greater number of people within the Territory, and a larger proportion of the businesses in the tourist industry are locally owned, as are a number of the highly tourism-dependent sole traders (for example, taxi drivers and street vendors). Economically however, financial services associated with the territory's status as an offshore financial centre are by far the more important. 51.8% of the Government's revenue comes directly from licence fees for offshore companies, and considerable further sums are raised directly or indirectly from payroll taxes relating to salaries paid within the trust industry sector (which tend to be higher on average than those paid in the tourism sector).

[[Tourism]] accounts for 45% of national income. The islands are a popular destination for U.S. citizens. In 2006 a total of 825,603 people visited the islands (of whom 443,987 were cruise ship passengers). Tourists frequent the numerous white sand [[beach]]es, visit The Baths on Virgin Gorda, [[Snorkeling|snorkel]] the [[coral reef]]s near Anegada, or experience the well-known bars of Jost Van Dyke. The BVI are known as one of the world's greatest sailing destinations, and charter sailboats are a very popular way to visit less accessible islands. Every year since 1972 the BVI has hosted the Spring Regatta, which is a seven-day collection of sailing races throughout the islands. A substantial number of the tourists who visit the BVI are [[cruise ship]] passengers, although they produce far lower revenue per head than charter boat tourists and hotel based tourists. They are nonetheless important to the substantial (and politically important) taxi driving community.

Substantial revenues are also generated by the registration of [[Offshore company|offshore companies]]. As of June 2008, 823,502 companies were so registered (of which 445,865 were 'active'). In 2000 KPMG reported in its survey of [[Tax haven|offshore jurisdictions]] for the [[United Kingdom]] government that over 41% of the world's offshore companies were formed in the British Virgin Islands. Since 2001, financial services in the British Virgin Islands have been regulated by the independent [[British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission|Financial Services Commission]]. While at one time the BVI was well regarded as a good domicile for captive insurance services, this changed beginning in recent years with the change of insurance regulators in 2007 and the government's increasing pressure to hire only locals (&quot;[[Belonger status|belongers]]&quot;) in the insurance industry. Official reports from the Financial Services Commission reflect as of June 30, 2010 only 207 captives in the BVI. Informed sources report that the actual number is closer to 100, with the 50% decline over the last four years attributable to the lack of ability within the FSC in administering insurance companies. Beginning in 2008 there was a mass exodus of captives for better staffed jurisdictions like Anguilla.

Agriculture and industry account for only a small proportion of the islands' GDP. Agricultural produce includes fruit, vegetables, sugar cane, livestock and poultry, and industries include rum distillation, construction and boat building.

The official currency of the British Virgin Islands has been the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] since 1959, a currency also used by the [[United States Virgin Islands]].

The British Virgin Islands are a major target for drug traffickers, who use the area as a gateway to the United States. According to the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, &quot;Problems associated with drug trafficking are potentially the most serious threat to stability in the BVI&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/north-central-america/british-virgin-islands/ British Virgin Islands Country Profile], Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of the British Virgin Islands}}
The population of the Islands is around 21,730 in 2003. The majority of the population (83%) are [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro-Caribbean]], descended from the slaves brought to the islands by the British. Other large ethnic groups include those of British and other European origin.

The 2004 Census reports:
* 83.4% African/negroid
* 7% European/caucasian
* 9.6% Others*
{{Smaller|* Includes Indian, Carib, Amerindian and mixed}}

The islands are overwhelimingly [[Christian]] (96%)  with the largest individual Christian denominations being [[Methodist]] (33%), [[Anglican]] (17%), and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] (10%){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. [[Muslims]] constitute approximately 1.2% of the population according to a 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands are heavily dependent upon migrant labour. In 2004 migrant workers accounted for 50% of the total population. 32% of workers employed in the British Virgin Islands work for the Government.

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in the British Virgin Islands}}
There are {{convert|113|km|mi|0}} of roads. The main airport ([[Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport]], also known as Beef Island Airport) is located on Beef Island, which lies off the eastern tip of Tortola and is accessible by the [[Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, British Virgin Islands|Queen Elizabeth II Bridge]]. Virgin Gorda and Anegada have their own smaller airports. The main harbour is in [[Road Town]]. There are also ferries that operate within the British Virgin Islands and to the neighbouring United States Virgin Islands. As in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], cars in the British Virgin Islands drive on the left side of the road. The roads are often quite steep and winding, and ruts can be a problem when it rains.

==Education==
The British Virgin Islands operates several government schools as well as private schools. There is also a community college, [http://www.hlscc.edu.vg/ H. Lavity Stoutt Community College], that is located on the eastern end of Tortola. This college was named after Honourable [[Lavity Stoutt]] (Chief Minister).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvi.gov.vg/products.asp?iProd=35&amp;iCat=12&amp;hierarchy=0 British Virgin Islands Schools], BVI Government website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Because of its location and climate the British Virgin Islands has long been a haven for sailing enthusiasts. Sailing is regarded as one of the foremost sports in all of the BVI. Calm waters along with steady breezes culminate to make some of the best sailing conditions in the Caribbean (some{{Who|May 2009|date=May 2009}} say the world).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Many sailing events are held in the waters of this country, the largest of which is a week-long series of sailing races called the Spring Regatta.

This is the premier sailing event of the Caribbean. With several races hosted each day. Boats include everything from full-size mono-hull yachts to dinghies. Captains and their crews come from all around the globe to attend these races. The Spring Regatta is part race, part party, part festival. There are races, games, and music during the day, and some crazy partying at night. The Spring Regatta is normally held on the first week of April, annually [http://www.vacationtortola.com/Yacht-Races.html].

===Language===

The primary language is English with a quick creole accent.{{Clarify|reason = &quot;quick&quot;??|date=April 2010}}

===Music===
{{Main|Music of the Virgin Islands}}
The traditional music of the British Virgin Islands is called ''fungi'' after the local [[cornmeal]] dish with the same name, often made with [[okra]]. The special sound of fungi is due to a unique local fusion between African and European music. It functions as a medium of local history and folklore and is therefore a cherished cultural form of expression that is part of the curriculum in BVI schools. The fungi bands, also called &quot;scratch bands&quot;, use instruments ranging from [[calabash]], washboard, [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and [[ukulele]], to more traditional western instruments like keyboard, banjo, guitar, bass, triangle and saxophone. Apart from being a form of festive dance music, fungi often contains humorous social commentaries, as well as BVI oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, Dexter J.A. [http://dexterpenn.smugmug.com/gallery/4068409 Music of the British Virgin Islands: Fungi]. Retrieved 13 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular singer [[Iyaz]] is from the British Virgin Islands. In the music video for his song [[Replay]] he had the flag of the British Virgin Islands in the background.

'''Burkina Faso''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-Burkina Faso.ogg|b|ər|ˌ|k|iː|n|ə|_|ˈ|f|ɑː|s|oʊ}} {{respell|bər|KEE|nə}} {{respell|FAH|soh}}; {{IPA-fr|byʁkina faso|lang}}) –  also known by its short-form name '''Burkina''' – is [[landlocked country]] in [[west Africa]]. It is surrounded by six countries: [[Mali]] to the north, [[Niger]] to the east, [[Benin]] to the southeast, [[Togo]] and [[Ghana]] to the south, and [[Côte d'Ivoire]] to the southwest.

Its size is {{convert|274,200|km2}} with an estimated population of more than 15,757,000. Formerly called the '''Republic of Upper Volta''', [[Geographical renaming|it was renamed]] on August 4, 1984, by President [[Thomas Sankara]] to mean &quot;the land of upright people&quot; in [[Mòoré language|Mòoré]] and [[Dioula language|Dioula]], the major native languages of the country. Figuratively, &quot;Burkina&quot; may be translated, &quot;men of integrity,&quot; from the Mòoré language, and &quot;Faso&quot; means &quot;father's house&quot; in Dioula. The inhabitants of Burkina Faso are known as ''Burkinabè'' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|ər|ˈ|k|iː|n|ə|b|eɪ}} {{respell|bər|KEE|nə-bay}}).

Burkina Faso was populated between 14,000 and 5000 BC by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the country's northwestern region.  Farm settlements appeared between 3600 and 2600 BC.  What is now central Burkina Faso was principally composed of [[Mossi Kingdoms|Mossi]] kingdoms.  These Mossi Kingdoms would become a French protectorate in 1896. After gaining independence from [[France]] in 1960, the country underwent many governmental changes until arriving at its current form, a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]]. The president is [[Blaise Compaoré]].

Burkina Faso's capital is [[Ouagadougou]]. It is a member of the [[African Union]], [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]],
[[La Francophonie]], [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]] and [[Economic Community of West African States]].

==History ==
{{main|History of Burkina Faso}}

===Early history===
The territory of today's Burkina Faso was populated early, between 14,000 and 5000 BC, by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the northwestern part of the country, whose tools, such as [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], [[chisel]]s and [[arrowhead]]s, were discovered in 1973 by
Simran Nijjar. Settlements with farmers appeared between 3600 and 2600 BC. On the basis of traces of the farmers' structures, the settlements appear to have been permanent. The use of iron, ceramics and polished stone developed between 1500 and 1000 BC, as well as a preoccupation with spiritual matters, as shown by burial remains.

Relics of the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] are found in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions. Sometime between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Dogon left the area  to settle in the cliffs of [[Bandiagara]]. Elsewhere, the remains of high walls are localized in the southwest of Burkina Faso (as well as in the Côte d'Ivoire), but the people who built them have not yet been identified.

The central part of Burkina Faso included a number of [[Mossi Kingdoms|Mossi]] kingdoms, the most powerful of which were those of Wagadogo (Ouagadougou) and Yatenga. These kingdoms emerged probably in the early sixteenth century from obscure origins veiled by legend featuring a heterogeneous set of warrior figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Michel Izard, Moogo. L'émergence d'un espace étatique ouest-africain au XVIe siècle&lt;/ref&gt;

===From colony to independence===

[[File:Burkina-faso-dourtenga.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional homes in south-east Burkina Faso]]
After a decade of intense rivalry and competition between the  [[England|English]] and the [[France|French]], waged through treaty-making expeditions under military or civilian explorers, the [[Mossi Kingdoms|Mossi]] kingdom of Ouagadougou was defeated by French colonial forces and became a French protectorate in 1896. The eastern region and the western region, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler [[Samori Ture]] complicated the situation, came under French occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso today was nominally conquered; however, control of many parts remained uncertain.

The French and English convention of 14 June 1898 ended the scramble between the two colonial powers and drew the borders between the countries' colonies. On the French side, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony of [[French West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].

[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War 1]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs sénégalais|Senegalese Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government, known as the Volta-Bani War.&lt;ref&gt;Mahir Saul and Patrick Royer, West African Challenge to Empire, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The French government finally suppressed the movement, but only after suffering defeats and being forced to gather the largest expeditionary force of its colonial history up to that point. Armed opposition also wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.

[[French Upper Volta]] was established on March 1, 1919. This move was a result of French fears of the recurrence of armed uprising along with economic considerations, and  to bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger. The new colony was named [[Upper Volta|Haute Volta]] and François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]].Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy – based on [[coercion]] – failed, and revenue stagnated. The colony was later dismantled on September 5, 1932, being split up between the Côte d'Ivoire, [[French Sudan]] and [[Niger]]. Côte d'Ivoire received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and [[Bobo-Dioulasso]].
[[File:Pionniers de la révolution.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Children of the 1983–1987 revolution]]

The decision to split the colony was reversed during the intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On September 4, 1947, the colony was revived as a part of the [[French Union]], with its previous boundaries.  On 11 December 1958, it achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] and became the [[Republic of Upper Volta]] and a member of the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories began with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of July 23, 1956. This act was followed by reorganizational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on December 11, 1958. Full independence from France was received in 1960.

===Upper Volta===
{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}
The Republic of Upper Volta ({{lang-fr|République de Haute-Volta}}) was established on December 11, 1958, as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]]. The name Upper Volta indicated that the country contains the upper part of the [[Volta River]] system. The river's three tributaries are called the [[Black Volta]], [[White Volta]] and [[Red Volta]], and the colors of the national flag corresponded to these parts of the river system.

Before attaining autonomy it had been [[French Upper Volta]] and  part of the [[French Union]]. On August 5, 1960, it attained full independence from [[French Fourth Republic|France]].  The first president, [[Maurice Yaméogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for five-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966 when after much unrest—mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants—the military intervened.

The military coup deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoulé Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years, and on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on November 25, 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a bloodless coup. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later, on November 7, 1982, by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.

Factional infighting developed between moderates in the CSP and the radicals, led by Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], who was appointed prime minister in January 1983. The internal political struggle and Sankara's leftist rhetoric led to his arrest and subsequent efforts to bring about his release, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaoré]]. This release effort resulted in yet another military coup d'état on August 4, 1983.

After the coup, Sankara formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with himself as president. Sankara also established Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) to &quot;mobilize the masses&quot; and implement the CNR's revolutionary programs. The CNR, whose exact membership remained secret until the end, contained two small intellectual Marxist-Leninist groups. Sankara, Compaore, Capt. [[Henri Zongo]], and Maj. [[Jean-Baptiste Lingani]]—all leftist military officers—dominated the regime.

On August 4, 1984, as a final result of President Sankara's zealous activities, the country's name was eventually changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, which translates to &quot;land of honest people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kingfisher Geography Encyclopedia. ISBN 1-85613-582-9. Page 170&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Burkina Faso ===

On October 15, 1987 Sankara was killed by an armed gang with twelve other officials in a coup d'état organised by his former colleague, Blaise Compaoré. Deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries was one of the reasons given, with Compaore stating that Sankara jeopardised foreign relations with former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast. Prince Johnson, a former Liberian warlord allied to Charles Taylor, told Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) that it was engineered by Charles Taylor. After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days.

Sankara's body was dismembered and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave, while his widow and two children fled the nation. Compaoré immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara's policies, returned the country back under the IMF fold, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara's legacy. As of 2010, Compaoré is entering his 23rd year in power. He &quot;has become immensely wealthy&quot; and purchased a presidential plane to reflect his personal prestige, while landlocked Burkina Faso ranks as the third least developed country in the world.

In February-April 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked an uprising throughout the country, coupled with a military mutiny and a strike of the magistrates. See [[2011 Burkina Faso mutiny]].

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Burkina Faso}}
[[File:Tertius Zongo.jpg|thumb|Former prime minister Tertius Zongo]]
The incumbent Blaise Compaoré seized power in a coup d'état in 1987, betraying his long-time friend and ally [[Thomas Sankara]], who was killed in the coup.

The [[constitution]] of 2 June 1991 established a semi-presidential government with a [[parliament]] which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of seven years.

In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. The amendment also would have prevented the [[incumbent]] president, [[Blaise Compaoré]], from being reelected.

However, in October 2005, notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates, the constitutional council ruled that, because Compaoré was the sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office.  This cleared the way for his candidacy in [[Burkina Faso presidential elections, 2005|the 2005 election]]. On 13 November, Compaoré was reelected in a landslide, because of a divided political opposition.

In the 2010 November Presidential elections, President Compaoré is reelected for another term in office.

The parliament consists of one chamber known as the National Assembly which has 111 seats with members elected to serve five year terms. There is also a constitutional chamber, composed of ten members, and an economic and social council whose roles are purely consultative.

Political freedoms are severely restricted in Burkina Faso, with human rights organisations decrying numerous acts of state-sponsored violence against journalists and other politically active members of society.

==Regions, provinces, and departments==
[[File:BurkinaFaso Regions.png|right|350px|Regions of Burkina Faso.]]
{{main|Regions of Burkina Faso|Provinces of Burkina Faso|Communes of Burkina Faso}}
Burkina Faso is divided into thirteen [[region]]s, forty-five [[province]]s, and 301 [[Departments of Burkina Faso|department]]s. The regions are:

*[[Boucle du Mouhoun Region|''Boucle du Mouhoun'']]
*[[Cascades Region|''Cascades'']]

==Military, police, and security forces==
{{main|Military of Burkina Faso}}
The country employs numerous police and security forces, generally modeled after organizations used by French police, and France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces in Burkina Faso.&lt;ref&gt;Das, Dilip K. and Palmiotto, Michael J., ''World Police Encyclopedia'', Routledge, ISBN 0415942500, 9780415942508, (2005), pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Gendarmerie Nationale'' is organized along military lines, with most police services delivered at the brigade level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Das, pp. 139–141&quot;&gt;Das, pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Gendarmerie]] operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence, and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Das, pp. 139–141&quot;/&gt;

There is also a municipal police force controlled by the Ministry of Territorial Administration; a national police force controlled by the Ministry of Security; and an autonomous Presidential Security Regiment (''Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle'', or RSP), a ‘palace guard’ devoted to the protection of the President of the Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Das, pp. 139–141&quot;/&gt;  Both the gendarmerie and the national police are subdivided into both administrative and judicial police functions; the former are detailed to protect public order and provide security, the latter are charged with criminal investigations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Das, pp. 139–141&quot;/&gt;

All foreigners and citizens are required to carry photo ID passports, or other forms of identification or risk a fine, and police spot identity checks are commonplace for persons traveling by auto, [[Share taxi|bush-taxi]], or bus.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of State, ''[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1075.html Burkina Faso: Country Specific Information'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office, [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso ''Sub-Saharan Africa: Burkina Faso'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The army consists of some 6,000 men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national People's Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35 years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties.  According to ''Jane’s Sentinel Country Risk Assessment'', Burkina Faso's Army is small and poorly equipped, but has numbers of wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa.

The army is relatively well-funded and motivated by African standards, although undermanned for its force structure.  The regular army is believed to be neglected in relation to the élite Presidential Security Regiment (RSP) and reports have emerged in recent years of disputes over pay and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Sentinel-Security-Assessment-West-Africa/Army-Burkina-Faso.html Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment – West Africa]'', 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an air force with some 19 operational aircraft, but no navy, as the country is landlocked. Military expenses constitute approximately 1.2% of the nation’s GDP.

In April 2011, there was an [[2011 Burkina Faso mutiny|army mutiny]]; the president named new chiefs of staff, and a curfew was imposed in [[Ouagadougou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13107109|accessdate=2011-04-17|title=Burkina Faso capital under curfew after army mutiny|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
{{MapLibrary|Burkina_sat.png|Burkina Faso}}
{{main|Geography of Burkina Faso|Climate of Burkina Faso}}
Burkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes [[9th parallel north|9°]] and [[15th parallel north|15°N]] (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6°W]] and [[3rd meridian east|3°E]].

It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]], which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a [[Precambrian]] [[massif]]. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a [[sandstone]] massif, where the highest peak, Ténakourou, is found at an elevation of {{convert|749|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to {{convert|150|m|ft|0|sp=us}} high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is {{convert|400|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than {{convert|600|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.

The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the [[Black Volta]] (or ''Mouhoun''), the [[White Volta]] (''Nakambé'') and the [[Red Volta]] (''Nazinon''). The Black Volta  is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the [[Komoé River|Komoé]], which flows to the southwest. The basin of the [[Niger River]] also [[drainage basin|drains]] 27% of the country's surface.

The Niger's [[tributary|tributaries]] – the Béli, the Gorouol, the Goudébo and the Dargol – are [[Torrent (stream)|seasonal streams]] and flow for only four to six months a year. They still, however, can cause large [[flood]]s. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, [[Lake Bam|Bam]] and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli and Markoye. [[Drought|Water shortages]] are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.
[[File:WP 35, SDr9776.JPG|left|thumb|[[Savanna]]h near the [[Gbomblora Department]], on the road from [[Gaoua]] to [[Batié, Burkina Faso|Batié]].]]

Burkina Faso has a primarily [[tropics|tropical]] climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between {{convert|600|and|900|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rainfall; in the dry season, the [[harmattan]] – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The [[Sahel]] in the north typically receives less than {{convert|600|mm|in|1|sp=us}} &lt;ref name=relationship&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sim.org/country.asp?fun=1&amp;CID=18|title=SIM Country Profile: Burkina Faso|accessdate=August 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, {{convert|5|–|47|°C|°F|1|lk=on}}.

A relatively dry [[tropical savanna]], the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the [[Horn of Africa]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and borders the [[Sahara]] to its north and the fertile region of the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] to the South. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north [[latitude]], the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than {{convert|900|mm|in|1|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=relationship /&gt; of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.

Burkina Faso's natural resources include [[manganese]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], [[phosphate]]s, [[pumice]], [[salt]] and small deposits of [[gold]].

Burkina Faso's fauna and flora are protected in two national parks and several reserves: see [[List of national parks in Africa]], [[Nature reserves of Burkina Faso]].

==Economy==
[[File:Burkina Faso - Madame Badoun.jpg|thumb|Shop in Burkina Faso.]]
{{main|Economy of Burkina Faso}}
Burkina Faso has one of the lowest [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] [[per capita]] figures in the world: $1,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA World Factbook, GDP Per Capita Rank Order |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agriculture]] represents 32% of its gross domestic product and occupies 80% of the working population. It consists mostly of livestock but also, especially in the south and southwest, of growing [[sorghum]], [[pearl millet]], [[maize|maize (corn)]], [[peanut]]s, [[rice]] and [[cotton]]. A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid.

[[Remittance]]s used to be an important source of income to Burkina Faso until the 1990s, when unrest in Côte d'Ivoire, the main destination for Burkinabe emigrants, forced many to return home. Remittances now account for less than 1% of GDP.

Burkina Faso is part of the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UMEOA) and has thus adopted the CFA Franc, which is issued by the Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO), situated in [[Dakar]], Senegal. The BCEAO is not only responsible for the monetary and reserve policy of the member states, but also for the regulation and oversight of financial sector and banking activity. A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999. Micro-finance institutions are governed by a separate law, which regulates micro-finance activities in all WAEMU countries. The [[insurance]] sector is regulated through the Inter-African Conference on Insurance Markets (CIMA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is mining of [[copper]], [[iron]], [[manganese]] and, [[gold]]. These operations provide employment, international aid, and in some cases hospitals at mines for the public.

Burkina Faso also hosts the International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou, better known by its French name as [[SIAO]], ''Le Salon International de l' Artisanat de Ouagadougou'', one of the most important African handicraft fairs.

Burkina Faso is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA).&lt;ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Ouagadougou place nations unies.JPG|thumb|United Nations Square in [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso]]
{{main|Demographics of Burkina Faso|Languages of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso's 15.3 million people belong to two major West African cultural groups—the Voltaic and the Mande (whose common language is [[Dioula language|Dioula]]). The Voltaic Mossi make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso from Ghana and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is still led by the [[Mogho Naba]], whose court is in Ouagadougou.&lt;ref name=bn&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2834.htm &quot;Burkina Faso&quot;].

Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state. Most of Burkina's people are concentrated in the south and center of the country, sometimes exceeding 48 per square kilometer (125/sq. mi.). Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe migrate to Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, many for seasonal agricultural work. These flows of workers are obviously affected by external events; the September 2002 coup attempt in Côte d'Ivoire and the ensuing fighting there have meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe returned to Burkina Faso.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

{{main|Religion in Burkina Faso}}

Exact statistics on religion in Burkina Faso are approximate because Islam and Christianity are consistently practiced in tandem with indigenous religious beliefs, the [[Government of Burkina Faso]] stated in its most recent census (2006) that 60.5% of the population practice [[Islam]], and that the majority of this group belong to the [[Sunni]] branch,&lt;ref name=RGPH2006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cns.bf/IMG/pdf/Depliant_Resultats_Definitifs_du_RGPH_2006.pdf|title=Recensement général de la population et de l'habitation de 2006|author=Comité national du recensement |date=july 2008|work=|publisher=Conseil national de la statistique|accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report2010&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148665.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Burkina Faso]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (November 17, 2010). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; while a growing minority adheres to the [[Shi'a]] branch. A significant numbers of Sunni Muslims identify with the [[Tijaniyah]] [[Sufi]] order. The Government also estimated that some 23.2% are Christians (19% being [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and 4.2% members of various [[Protestant]] denominations), 15.3% follow [[African traditional religion|Traditional indigenous beliefs]], 0.6% have other religions, and 0.4% have none (atheism is virtually nonexistent).&lt;ref name=RGPH2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=report2010/&gt;

A popular saying in Burkina Faso claims that &quot;50% are [[Muslim]], 50% are [[Christian]], and 100% are [[animist]]&quot;. This shows the large level of acceptance of the various religions amongst each other. Even for Muslims and Christians, ancient animist rites are still highly valued. The Great Mosque of [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] was built by people of all faiths working together.

[[Literature in Burkina Faso]] is based on the [[oral tradition]], which remains important.
In 1934, during [[France|French]] occupation, Dim-Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his ''Maximes, pensées et devinettes mossi'' (''Maximes, Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi''), a record of the oral history of the [[Mossi people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KS&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The [[theatre of Burkina Faso]] combines traditional Burkinabè  performance with the [[colonialism|colonial]] influences and post-colonial efforts to educate rural people to produce a distinctive national theatre. Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with [[mask]]s. Western-style theatre became common during colonial times, heavily influenced by [[French theatre]]. With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by [[Theatre of the Oppressed|forum theatre]] aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Faso's rural people.

The [[cuisine of Burkina Faso]], typical of [[west Africa]]n cuisine, is based around [[staple food]]s of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[rice]], [[maize]], [[peanut]]s, [[potato]]es, [[bean]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s  and [[okra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ox&quot;&gt;{{cite web

A typical Burkinabè beverage is Banji or Palm Wine, which is fermented palm sap, and Zoom-kom. Especially the town of [[Banfora]] is known for its good quality Banji, though one should be wary of the Banji sold by [[hawker (trade)|hawkers]] as it is often not very fresh and may contain added water.

August 30, 2009, Burkina Faso experienced the worst flood in the country's recent history, leaving 150,000 people homeless, and more than 8 people dead. Burkina Faso people requested international aid to help the victims and rebuild the country. Japan, France, Ivory Coast and the European Union responded, while the Burkina American community requested that the president of the United States of America extend a helping hand to the victims of the flood. MANY people have unhealthy water

==Cinema==
{{main|Cinema of Burkina Faso}}

The [[cinema of Burkina Faso]] is an important part of [[West Africa]]n and [[Africa]]n film industry.&lt;ref&gt;Spaas,Lieve, &quot;Burkina Faso,&quot; in ''The Francophone Film: A Struggle for Identity,''  pp. 232–246. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Burkina's contribution to [[African cinema]] started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969.  Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes.  For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Sankara (In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagaoudougou). Among the best known directors from Burkina Faso are: [[Gaston Kaboré]], [[Idrissa Ouedraogo]] and [[Dani Kouyate]],&lt;ref&gt;Turégano, Teresa Hoefert, ''African Cinema and Europe: Close-Up on Burkina Faso'', Florence: European Press Academic, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Burkina also produces popular television series such as Bobodjiouf. The internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate also make popular television series.

==Sports==
{{Main|Sport in Burkina Faso}}
Sport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football (soccer),basketball, cycling, Rugby union, handball, tennis, athletics, boxing and martial arts. Football is very popular in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country. The national team is nicknamed &quot;Les Etalons&quot; (&quot;the Stallions&quot;) in reference to the legendary horse of Princess [[Yennenga]]. In 1998, Burkina Faso hosted the African Cup of Nations for which the Omnisport Stadium in Bobo-Dioulasso was built.The country is currently ranked 42nd in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=m/fullranking.html|accessdate=2011-02-10|title=FIFA.com - The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{main|Education in Burkina Faso}}
[[Image:Dourtenga school.JPG|thumb|left|280px|School children in Dourtenga]]
Education in Burkina Faso is divided into primary, secondary and higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Burkina-Faso-EDUCATION.html |title=Education – Burkina Faso |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However schooling costs approximately CFA 50,000 ($97 USD) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts. An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships. In order to proceed from elementary to middle school, middle to high school or high school to college, national exams must be passed. Institutions of higher education include the [[University of Ouagadougou]], The Polytechnical University in  [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] and the University of Koudougou, which is also a teacher training institution. There are private colleges in the capital city of [[Ouagadougou]] but these are affordable by only a small portion of the population.

There is also an [[International School of Ouagadougou]] (ISO), which is an American-based private school located in Ouagadougou.

The [[United Nations]] Development Program Report ranks Burkina Faso as the country with the lowest level of literacy in the world, despite a concerted effort to double its literacy rate from 12.8% in 1990 to 25.3% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_20072008_en_complete.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National and independent media==
{{main|Media of Burkina Faso}}
The nation's principal media outlet is its state-sponsored combined television and radio service, ''Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina'' (RTB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtb.bf/ |title='&amp;#39;Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina'&amp;#39; |publisher=Rtb.bf |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''RTB'' broadcasts on two [[medium-wave]] ([[Amplitude modulation|AM]]) and several [[Frequency modulation|FM]] frequencies.  Besides RTB, there are also a number of privately owned sports, cultural, music, and religious FM radio stations.  ''RTB'' also maintains a worldwide short-wave news broadcast (''Radio Nationale Burkina'') in the French language from the capital at Ouagadougou using a 100&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter on 4.815 and 5.030&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Station World, ''[http://radiostationworld.com/locations/burkina_faso/ Burkina Faso: Governmental Broadcasting Agencies]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to develop an independent press and media in Burkina Faso have been intermittent.  In 1998, investigative journalist [[Norbert Zongo]], his brother Ernest, his driver, and another man were assassinated by unknown assailants, and the bodies burned.  The crime was never solved.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists, [http://www.cpj.org/africa/burkina-faso/ ''Burkina Faso'']&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an independent Commission of Inquiry later concluded that Norbert Zongo was killed for political reasons because of his investigative work into the death of David Ouedraogo, a chauffeur who worked for François Compaoré, President Blaise Compaoré's brother.In January 1999, François Compaoré was charged with the murder of David Ouedraogo, who had died as a result of torture in January 1998. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after an appeal.  In August 2000, five members of the President's personal security guard detail (''Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle'', or RSP) were charged with the murder of Ouedraogo.  RSP members Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama, and Ousseini Yaro, investigated as suspects in the Norbert Zongo assassination, were convicted in the Ouedraogo case and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters Sans Frontieres, ''[http://www.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article&amp;id_article=2485 What’s Happening About The Inquiry Into Norbert Zongo’s Death?]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reporters Sans Frontieres, ''[http://www.ifex.org/burkina_faso/2006/07/21/outrageous_denial_of_justice_in/ Outrageous Denial Of Justice]'' 21 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the death of Norbert Zongo, several protests regarding the Zongo investigation and treatment of journalists have been prevented or dispersed by government police and security forces.  In April 2007, popular radio reggae host Karim Sama, whose programs feature reggae songs interspersed with critical commentary on alleged government injustice and corruption, received several death threats.&lt;ref&gt;IFEX, ''[http://www.ifex.org/burkina_faso/2007/04/30/radio_station_temporarily_pulls/ Radio Station Temporarily Pulls Programme After Host Receives Death Threats]'', 26 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Sama's personal car was later burned outside the private radio station ''Ouaga FM'' by unknown vandals.&lt;ref&gt;FreeMuse.org, ''[http://www.freemuse.org/sw19077.asp Death threat against Reggae Radio Host]'', 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) wrote to President Compaoré to request his government investigate the sending of e-mailed death threats to journalists and radio commentators in Burkina Faso who were critical of the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;  In December 2008, police in Ouagadougou questioned leaders of a protest march that called for a renewed investigation into the unsolved Zongo assassination.  Among the marchers was Jean-Claude Meda, the president of the Association of Journalists of Burkina Faso.&lt;ref&gt;Keita, Mohamed, ''[http://cpj.org/blog/2008/12/burkina-faso-police-question-zongo-protesters.php#more Burkina Faso Police Question Zongo Protesters]'', Committee to Protect Journalists, 15 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Bahamas]] is a stable, developing nation with an economy heavily dependent on [[tourism]] and [[offshore banking]]. Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences had led to solid GDP growth in recent years, but the slowdown in the US economy and the attacks of September 11, 2001 held back growth in these sectors in 2001-03. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for about 15% of GDP. However, since December 2000, when the government enacted new regulations on the financial sector, many international businesses have left The Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on growth in the US, the source of more than 80% of the visitors. In addition to tourism and banking, the government supports the development of a &quot;2nd-pillar&quot;, e-commerce.

==Basic Ingredients of the Bahamian Economy==
The Bahamian economy is almost entirely dependent on tourism and financial services to generate foreign exchange earnings. Tourism alone provides an estimated 60% of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) and employs about half the Bahamian workforce. In 2004, over half a million tourists visited The Bahamas, most of whom are from the [[United States]].

A major contribution to the recent growth in the overall Bahamian economy is Kerzner International's Atlantis Resort and Casino, which took over the former Paradise Island Resort and has provided a much needed boost to the economy. In addition, the opening of Breezes Super Club and Sandals Resort also aided this turnaround. The Bahamian Government also has adopted a proactive approach to courting foreign investors and has conducted major investment missions to the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], and [[Canada]]. The primary purpose of the trips was to restore the reputation of The Bahamas in these markets.

Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for up to 17% of GDP, due to the country's status as an offshore financial center. As of December 1998, the government had licensed 418 banks and trust companies in The Bahamas. The Bahamas promulgated the International Business Companies (IBC) Act in January 1990 to enhance the country's status as a leading financial center. The act served to simplify and reduce the cost of incorporating offshore companies in The Bahamas. Within 9 years, more than 84,000 [[International Business Company|IBC]]-type companies had been established. In February 1991, the government also legalized the establishment of [[Asset-protection trust|Asset Protection Trusts]] in The Bahamas. In December 2000, partly as a response to appearing the plenary [[FATF Blacklist]], the government enacted a legislative package to better regulate the financial sector, including creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit and enforcement of &quot;[[Know your customer|know-your-customer]]&quot; rules. Other initiatives include the enactment of the Foundations Act in 2004 and the planned introduction of legislation to regulate [[Trust company|Private Trust Companies]].

{{see also|Agriculture in the Bahamas}}
[[Agriculture]] and fisheries industry together account for 5% of GDP. The Bahamas exports lobster and some fish but does not raise these items commercially. There is no largescale agriculture, and most agricultural products are consumed domestically. The Bahamas imports more than $250 million in foodstuffs per year, representing about 80% of its food consumption. The government aims to expand food production to reduce imports and generate foreign exchange. It actively seeks foreign investment aimed at increasing agricultural exports, particularly specialty food items. The government officially lists beef and pork production and processing, fruits and nuts, dairy production, winter vegetables, and mariculture (shrimp farming) as the areas in which it wishes to encourage foreign investment.

The Bahamian Government maintains the value of the [[Bahamian dollar]] on a par with the [[U.S. dollar]]. The Bahamas is a beneficiary of the U.S.-[[Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act]] (CBTPA), Canada's [[CARIBCAN]] program, and the European Union's Lome IV Agreement. Although the Bahamas participates in the political aspects of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), it has not entered into joint economic initiatives with other Caribbean states.

The Bahamas has a few notable industrial firms: the Freeport pharmaceutical firm, PFC Bahamas (formerly Syntex), which recently streamlined its production and was purchased by the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche; the BORCO oil facility, also in Freeport, which transships oil in the region; the [[Commonwealth Brewery]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], which produces [[Heineken Pilsener|Heineken]], [[Guinness]], and [[Kalik]] beers; and [[Bacardi|Bacardi Corp.]], which distills rum in Nassau for shipment to the U.S. and European markets. Other industries include sun-dried sea salt in Great Inagua, a wet dock facility in Freeport for repair of cruise ships, and mining of aragonite—a type of limestone with several industrial uses—from the sea floor at Ocean Cay.

The Hawksbill Creek Agreement established a duty-free zone in Freeport, The Bahamas' second-largest city, with a nearby industrial park to encourage foreign industrial investment. The [[Hong Kong]]-based firm, [[Hutchison Whampoa]], has opened a container port in Freeport. The Bahamian Parliament approved legislation in 1993 that extended most Freeport tax and duty exemptions through 2054.

The Bahamas is largely an [[International trade|import]], [[service economy]]. There are about 110 U.S.-affiliated businesses operating in The Bahamas, and most are associated with [[tourism]] and [[banking]]. With few domestic resources and little industry, The Bahamas imports nearly all its food and manufactured goods from the United States. American goods and services tend to be favored by Bahamians due to cultural similarities and heavy exposure to American advertising.

==Business environment==
The Bahamas offers attractive features to the potential investor: a stable democratic environment, relief from personal and corporate income taxes, timely repatriation of corporate profits, proximity to the U.S. with extensive air and [[telecommunication]]s links, and a good pool of skilled professional workers. The Government of The Bahamas welcomes foreign [[investment]] in tourism and banking and has declared an interest in agricultural and industrial investments to generate local employment, particularly in white-collar or skilled jobs. Despite its interest in foreign investment to diversify the economy, the Bahamian Government responds to local concerns about foreign competition and tends to protect Bahamian business and labor interests. As a result of domestic resistance to foreign investment and high labor costs, growth can stagnate in sectors which the government wishes to diversify.

The country's infrastructure is best developed in the principal cities of Nassau and Freeport, where there are relatively good paved roads and international airports. Electricity is generally reliable, although many businesses have their own backup generators. In Nassau, there are two daily newspapers, three weeklies, and several international newspapers available for sale. There also are eight radio stations. Both Nassau and Freeport have a television station. Cable TV also is available locally and provides most American programs with some Canadian and European channels.

==Areas of opportunity==
The best U.S. export opportunities remain in the traditional areas of foodstuffs and manufactured goods: vehicles and [[automobile parts]]; [[hotel]], [[restaurant]], and [[medical]] supplies; and [[computer]]s and electronics. Bahamian tastes in consumer products roughly parallel those in the U.S. With approximately 85% of the population of primarily [[African]] descent, there is a large and growing market in the Bahamas for &quot;ethnic&quot; personal care products. Merchants in southern [[Florida]] have found it profitable to advertise in Bahamian publications. Most imports in this sector are subject to high but nondiscriminatory tariffs.

The Bahamas has the 47th freest economy in the world according to [[The Heritage Foundation]] 2010 ''[[Index of Economic Freedom]]''. The Bahamas is ranked 7th out of 29 countries in the South and Central America/Caribbean region, and its overall score is higher than the regional and world averages. Total government spending, including consumption and transfer payments, is relatively low. In the most recent year, government spending equaled 23.4 percent of GDP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Government of Barbados''' consists of: [[Monarchy of Barbados|The Monarch]], HM [[Queen Elizabeth II]] (and her representative the [[Governor General of Barbados|Governor-General]], HE Sir [[Clifford Husbands]]); The Prime Minister, [[The Hon.]] [[Freundel Stuart]], and his [[Cabinet of Barbados|Cabinet]]; ([[Parliament of Barbados|Parliament]]) as legislature, divided into two chambers ([[Senate of Barbados|Senate]] and [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]), and an independent judiciary. In keeping with the evolution of the [[Westminster system]] of governance, Barbados has evolved into a [[Parliamentary democracy]] and [[Constitutional monarchy]], meaning that all [[Political power|real power]] rests with the Parliament.
Executive authority is vested in both the Prime Minister and Cabinet who are collectively responsible to Parliament. Barbadian law is rooted historically on [[English law|English common law]], and the [[Constitution of Barbados]] implemented in 1966, is supreme [[law of the land]].

==History==
The government has been chosen by elections since [[Barbadian general election, 1961|1961 elections]], when Barbados achieved full [[Self-governing colony|self-governance]].  Before then, the government was a [[Crown colony]] consisting of either colonial administration solely (such as the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]]), or a mixture of colonial rule and a partially-elected assembly, such as the [[Legislative Council of Barbados|Legislative Council]].  Both the [[Barbados Labour Party]] and the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] have formed the government in the elections since 1961.

== Executive Branch ==
The Prime Minister and Cabinet is formed by the [[political party]] which gains a simple majority in the [[Elections in Barbados|general election]]s held in [[Barbados]].  These elections constitutionally must be held no longer than every five years apart, however elections can be called whenever the Government so chooses to seek a new mandate or loses a vote of [[no confidence]] in [[Parliament of Barbados|Parliament]].  It is part of [[Politics of Barbados|Barbados' political system]] and supported by the [[Barbadian Public Service|Public service]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Communications in Belarus''' are dominated by the state which owns most of the corporations and infrastructure.

==Telephone system==

The Ministry of Telecommunications controls all telecommunications originating within the country through its carrier [[unitary enterprise]], [[Beltelecom]], which is a controlled as a monopoly. The phone calling code for Belarus is +375.

===Domestic===
Belarus has 3 (velcom, MTS and life) GSM operators, the NMT-450 and CDMA-2000 operator. Mobile operators are experiencing rapid growth. [[Minsk]] has a digital metropolitan network; waiting lists for telephones are long; fixed line penetration is improving although rural areas continue to be undeserved; intercity - Belarus has developed fibre-optic backbone system presently serving at least 13 major cities (1998); Belarus's fibre optics form synchronous digital hierarchy rings through other countries' systems; an inadequate analogue system remains operational.

===International===
Belarus is a member of the Trans-European Line (TEL), Trans-Asia-Europe Fibre-Optic Line (TAE) and has access to the Trans-Siberia Line (TSL); three fibre-optic segments provide connectivity to [[Latvia]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]]; worldwide service is available to Belarus through this infrastructure; additional analogue lines to Russia; [[Intelsat]], [[Eutelsat]], and [[Intersputnik]] earth stations

==Media==
===Perestroika===
During the time of [[perestroika]] and after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] media expression flourished, with a wide variety of newspapers that presented a wide variety of points of view.

=== Lukashenko period ===
[[File:Belarus-Minsk-Mass Media in Belarus-For Diaspora.jpg|thumb|200px|&quot;[[Mass Media]] in Belarus&quot; exhibition. &quot;Mass Media for Diaspora&quot; booth. May 5, 2005]]
During the first 10 years of Lukashenko's presidency, most of the Belarusian media outlets (newspapers, radio, television) were brought under the control of the state.  The state-controlled media present pro-[[government]] points of view and interpretation of events as in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period. There are a number of privately owned media outlets, mostly small independent newspapers. They operate under a permanent threat of being closed down for violating various government regulations, such as mis-stating their corporate name on publications or operating out of an office not registered with the government (in fact, this is the situation for all private enterprises in Belarus).

===Television===
Television channels with news content and nationwide coverage are all either [[state owned]] or state controlled (i.e. state bodies own more than 50 percent of the shares). There is not a single privately owned TV channel with nationwide coverage. Licences for TV and radio broadcasters are issued by the Republican Commission on Television and Radio Broadcasting, the chair of which is the minister of information. Other regulatory functions are undertaken by the information ministry directly. The only producer of broadcast news is the [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus|Belarusian Television and Radio Company]] (BT). Regional channels produce 25-40 percent of their own programming. They do not produce their own news or current affairs programmes, relying instead on news from national channels. Some 400,000 homes in Belarus have satellite dishes.

===Radio===
According to the Ministry of Information, there are 151 radio channels in Belarus, 30 broadcast on FM frequencies.

===Newspapers===
There are two types of newspaper, divided into sharply contrasting camps, namely state owned and privately owned. State owned newspapers make up some 80-85 percent of newspaper circulation. The state owned newspapers have large circulations running into hundreds of thousands.

In 1999, it became obligatory to register with the
state press distributor.

The most important of these is the daily [[Sovetskaya Belarussia]] – Belarus segodnya (Soviet Belarus – Belarus Today), published by the presidential administration, with a circulation of about 500,000. Other significant [[state owned newspapers]] are the daily [[Respublika]] (The Republic), published by the [[Cabinet of Ministers]], and the weeklies [[Sem’ Dnei]] (Seven Days) and [[Narodnaya Gazeta]] (The People’s Paper).

===Internet===
According to a 2006 survey of 1,500 adults by Satio, a third of Belarusians use the Internet—38% of the urban population and 16% of the rural population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mk.by/archiv/22.12.2006/rub2.php#2 Минский Курьер: №1096 Пятница 22 Декабря 2006г&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to other data Internet penetration in Belarus is 35.1 %&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats4.htm#europe Europe Internet Usage Stats and Population Statistics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; - this indicates the highest level of penetration of all the [[CIS]] countries. The second closest being Russia with 16.5%. Yet another study by the UN indicates 56.5% of population are internet-users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/sdteecb20071_en.pdf UNCTAD.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Belorussian Internet&quot; is widely called [[ByNet]] ([[:be:Байнет|Байнет]]) (as an analogue of [[Runet]]).

====Broadband Internet access====
The state [[Telecom monopoly]] [[Beltelecom]], holds exclusive interconnection with internet providers outside of Belarus. Beltelecom owns all the backbone channels which are linked to [[Tata Communications]] (former [[Teleglobe]]), [[Synterra]] and [[Rostelecom]] ISP's.

Until 2005-2006 broadband access (mostly using [[ADSL]]) was available only in a few major cities in Belarus. In [[Minsk]] there were a dozen of privately owned ISP's and in some other big cities Beltelecom's broadband was available. Outside this area the only options for Internet access were [[dial-up]] from Beltelecom or [[GPRS]]/[[cdma2000]] from mobile operators. In 2006 [[Beltelecom]] introduced a new trademark ''Byfly'' for its [[ADSL]] access. As of 2008 Byfly is available in all [[administrative centre]]s of Belarus. Other ISP's started expanding their networks outside of Minsk too.

=== Limited free expression ===
Many western human rights groups state that [[civil right]]s, and free expression are severely limited in Belarus, though there are some individuals and groups that refuse to be controlled and some journalists have disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,CPJ,,BLR,47c5669223,0.html UNHCR.org]&lt;/ref&gt; What makes the situation complex, is that the relatively free [[Russia]]n media is allowed to transmit television programming, sell newspapers and conduct journalistic activities in Belarus (though some Russian journalists have been expelled by the Belarusian government) thus giving some members of the public, typically those in large cities with many Russian residents, access to an alternative point of view in the [[Russian language]] (nearly all [[Belarusians]] understand and most of them speak Russian).

Because the Belarus government severely limits free expression, several opposition media outlets are broadcast from nearby countries to help provide Belarusians alternative points of view.  This includes the [[Belsat]] TV station and [[European Radio for Belarus]] (Eŭrapéjskaje Rádyjo dla Biełarúsi)&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, Dissent hits belarus via Warsaw, January 29, 2011, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704680604576110221620742008.html?mod=googlenews_wsj&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, media watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked 167 countries worldwide in terms of press freedom, with the countries with the most free press receiving the lowest ranks, and the countries with the most restricted press receiving the highest ranks.    Belarus was ranked 144th out of 167 countries, making it one of the lowest European countries in terms of press freedom. By comparison, the same index ranked neighbor Ukraine, 138th; and Russia, 140th. The closest other European countries were considerably better in terms of freedom, with [[Serbia]] ranked 77th and [[Romania]] 70th.

The '''Armed Forces of [[Belarus]]''' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: ''Узброеныя сілы Рэспублікі Беларусь - УС РБ'', ''Uzbrojenyja sily Respubliki Bielaruś''), ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Boopyжённыe cилы Pecпyблики Бeлapycь'', ''Vooruzhennye sily Respubliki Belarus'') consist of the [[Army]] and the [[Air force|Air and Air Defense Forces]], all under the command of the [[Ministry of Defense (Belarus)|Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus]]. Lieutenant general Yurij Viktorovich Zhadobin is the Minister of Defense since December 4, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mod.mil.by/gadobin.html&lt;/ref&gt; Being a [[landlocked country]], Belarus has no [[navy]].

The previous [[Belarusian National Republic]] of March 1918 to 1919 did not have time to create [[armed forces]] in its brief existence, although attempts to create a military have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radabnr.org/en/bibliographyen.htm Selected Bibliography of works on the struggle for Belarusian Independence 1900-1921 in the Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library in London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Belarus has conducted effective military reforms within the last decade which have reshaped its armed forces as a relatively effective force for a small state in somewhat difficult economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Steven J Main, [http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/cee/g126 The Belarusian Armed Forces: A Military-Political History 1991-2003], [[Conflict Studies Research Centre]], RMA Sandhurst, 2003. This is the definitive work in English on the recent history of Belarus's armed forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus''' (Russian: Министерство обороны Республики Беларусь, Belarusian: Мiнiстэрства абароны Рэспублікі Беларусь) is the government organization that is charged with the duties of raising and maintaining the Armed Forces of Belarus. The formation of the ministry began in 1992, a year after the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] and Belarus becoming an independent state. 

==History==
On September 20, 1991 the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed resolution &quot;On the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus&quot; and on January 11, 1992 resolution &quot;On the Armed Forces deployed in the territory of the Republic of Belarus.&quot; Practical steps followed the declarative resolutions. On March 18, 1992 the parliament passed resolution &quot;On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus&quot; that bound the government &quot;to start the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus as of March 20, 1992&quot; and &quot;to submit to the Supreme Soviet for approval the suggested structure of the Armed Forces, their size and order of their material and technical supplies&quot;.

On November 3, 1992, Belarus passed the law &quot;On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus&quot; defining the status, structure and guiding principles of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Bykovsky &amp; Alexander Vasilevich, [http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/5-2001/dp/mdafb/ Military Development and the Armed Forces of Belarus], Moscow Defence Brief, CAST, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction of presidency the law was amended twice: on September 4, 1996 and on November 9, 1999 but on the whole the law retains its initial contents.

== Organization ==
[[File:Ministry of Defense Republic of Belarus.jpg|thumb|130px|Symbol of the [[Belarusian Ministry of Defense]].]]

Until 1992 the [[Belorussian Military District]] of the USSR comprised the [[5th Guards Tank Army]], the 7th tank army, the 28th army, the 120th Guards Motor Rifle Division, the 51st Guards aviation division, the 72nd Guards United Training Center and also logistical units and formations. In addition to these troops Belarus was the area of deployment for units subordinated directly to the USSR Defense Ministry and chief commanders of different Armed Forces services, namely the 103rd Guards air-borne division, the 38th Guards air-borne brigade, the 11th corps of the 2nd Separate Air Defense Army, the [[1st Air Army|26th Air Army]] and also units and formations of the [[Strategic Rocket Forces]], [[Long Range Aviation]], the Navy and special forces.

In May 1992 the [[Belorussian Military District]] was abolished, and on January 1, 1993 all service personnel on Belarussian soil were required to either take an oath of loyalty to Belarus, or leave. This oath however did not alleviate concerns regarding loyalty to Russia in time of crisis, especially since nearly 50% of all military personnel were ethnically Russian at the end of 1992.

Current personnel in the armed forces number 72,940 ([[IISS]] 2007), although a reduction to 60,000 is planned. Most soldiers are [[conscripts]] serving for a period 12 months (with higher education) or 18 month (without). The branches are as follows&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, [[IISS]] Military Balance 2007, p.158-159&lt;/ref&gt;:

* '''[[Belarusian Land Forces|Army]]''': 29,600 soldiers (6th Guards Mechanized Brigade ([[Grodno]]), 11th Guards Mechanized Brigade ([[Slonim]]) 120th Guards Mechanized Brigade ([[Minsk]]), two air-mobile brigades (mech)&lt;ref&gt;http://belarmy.by/istoria-belarusi/suxoputnye-vojska-respubliki-belarus&lt;/ref&gt;, 5th Separate Spetznaz Brigade, five artillery brigades and four regiments, two MRL regiments, 15th, 29th, 115th, 120th and 302nd SAM Brigades, two SSM brigades, two brigades and one regiment of engineers, 8th NBC independent brigade, two signals brigades, 40th independent NBC battalion. Army equipment includes 1800 MBT, 2600 AFV/APC. The weapons and equipment storage bases include the 50th (Brest), 19th&lt;ref&gt;One of the equipment storage bases is the 19th, the former 19th Guards Tank Division at Zaslonovo in the [[Lepiel]] region. On October 1, 2003 the base has strongly added in &quot;weight&quot;. From other bases of storage of arms and techniques now we are distinguished favourably by new structure.

Weapons storage bases that have been disbanded include the 29th, 30th, [[193rd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|193rd]], and the storage base that used to be the 8th Guards Tank Division at Marina Gorka.

* '''[[Belarusian Air Force|Air Force and Air Defense Forces]]''': 18,170 personnel (two fighter/interceptor bases, four FGA/reconnaissance squadrons, one transport air base, training aircraft, and attack and support helicopters, SAM units). Air Force equipment included in 2004 260 FGA/training aircraft and 80 attack helicopters.

*'''Internal Troops''' Three independent brigades and seven independent battalions (consecutively numbered).

On 21 December 2001, a major reorganization of the Ground Forces produced two operational-territorial commands, formed from two former corps headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main, 2003&quot;&gt;Main, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; All Belarus ground forces are now grouped within these two commands, the Western Operational Command at [[Grodno]], former from the previous 28th Army Corps, the former Soviet [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th Army]], and the North Western Operational Command, the former 65th Army Corps, at [[Borisov]].

In 1995 the Military Academy of Belarus was set up on the basis of two military educational institutions - the Minsk Air Defense and Rocket School of the Air Defense Forces and the Minsk Higher Military Command School. Its 10 departments train officers of 38 specialties for practically all arms of service. Also in 1995 it was given the status of a government institution of secondary special military education for young men.

Since about 2001, territorial defense forces, which as of 2002 number around 150,000, have been forming, organized into battalions, companies, and platoons spread across Belarus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main, 2003&quot;/&gt;

== Equipment ==
[[File:Belarus-Transporting T-72.jpg|thumb|right|[[T-72]]B being transported]]
The military forces of Belarus are exclusively armed with Soviet-era equipment inherited from the Soviet Union. Although large in numbers some Western experts consider some of it outdated. The MBTs are of Russian type [[T-72]], [[T-62]], and [[T-55]], and AFVs are of Russian type [[MT-LB]], [[BMP-2]], [[BMP-1]], and the [[BMD-1]], and Russian type trucks are the [[GAZ-66]] and the [[KAMAZ-6560]]. The Air Force is equipped with [[MiG-29]], [[Su-27]] fighters, [[Su-24]], [[Su-25]] bombers, as well as [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]], [[Mi-24]], and the Polish built [[Mil Mi-2|Mi-2]] attack helicopters. In December 2005 Belarus bought 10 [[Aero L-39|L-39]] jet trainer aircraft from [[Ukraine]], and plans were announced to buy 18 used [[Su-30]]K fighters. In 2006 four batteries ('[[Division (military)#USSR.2FRussian_Federation|divisions]]' in Russian terminology; about 6 systems each) of [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] anti-aircraft systems were acquired from Russia to reinforce the united CIS air defense system ([[:ru:Объединённая система ПВО СНГ]])

== Military doctrine ==
The military goals of the armed forces of Belarus are to defend the interests of the Belarusian state. This however is at times ambiguous, and is made even more complex with the various agreements that have been recently signed with Russia. Membership in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], as well as the 1996 treaty on the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]] and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State in 1999, has confirmed a close partnership with Russia. Much of the air defense system is integrated into the Russian defense network, and in 2006 the two nations signed an agreement on the creation of a unified air defense system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2006/russia-061019-rianovosti02.htm Russia, Belarus to sign agreement on joint air defense system], GlobalSecurity.org, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Belarus}}
The [[Byelorussian SSR]] was one of only two [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republics to be separate members of the [[United Nations]] (the other being the [[Ukrainian SSR]]). Both republics and the [[Soviet Union]] joined the UN when the organization was founded in 1945.

==Prior to 2001==
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], at which Belarus gained its independence, Belarus became a member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Bank]]. It has also been [[Union State|politically united with Russia]] since 2 April 1996.

===Belarus–Russia relations===
{{see|Foreign relations of Russia towards Belarus}}
The introduction of [[free trade]] between Russia and Belarus in mid-1995 led to a spectacular growth in bilateral trade, which was only temporarily reversed in the wake of the [[History of post-Soviet Russia#The crises of 1998|financial crisis of 1998]]. President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] sought to develop a closer relationship with Russia. The framework for the Union of Russia and Belarus was set out in the Treaty On the Formation of a Community of Russia and Belarus (1996), the Treaty on Russia-Belarus Union, the Union Charter (1997), and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State (1999). The integration treaties contained commitments to [[monetary union]], [[civil rights|equal rights]], single citizenship, and a common defence and [[foreign policy]].

===Belarus–European Union relations===
{{Main|Belarus–European Union relations}}
Following the recognition of Belarus as an independent state in December 1991 by the [[European Community]], EC/EU-Belarus relations initially experienced a steady progress. The signature of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) in 1995 signaled a commitment to political, economic and trade cooperation. Some assistance was provided to Belarus within the framework of the [[TACIS]] programme and also through various aid programs and loans. However, progress in EU-Belarus relations stalled in 1996 after serious setbacks to the development of democracy, and the [[Drazdy conflict]]. The EU did not recognize the 1996 constitution, which replaced the 1994 constitution. The [[Council of the European Union]] decided against Belarus in 1997: The PCA was not concluded, nor was its trade-related part; Belarusian membership in the [[Council of Europe]] was not supported; bilateral relations at the ministerial level were suspended and EU technical assistance programs were frozen.
Acknowledging the lack of progress in relation to bilateral relations and the internal situation following the position adopted in 1997, the EU adopted a step-by-step approach in 1999, whereby sanctions would be gradually lifted upon fulfillment of the four benchmarks set by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. In 2000, some moderately positive developments toward the implementation of recommendations made by the OSCE AMG were observed but were not sufficient in the realm of access to fair and free elections.

===Belarus–United States relations===
The United States has encouraged Belarus to conclude and adhere to agreements with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, as well as to undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June 1992 but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Belarus is eligible for [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] short-term financing [[insurance]] for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated. The IMF granted standby credit in September 1995, but Belarus has fallen off the program and did not receive the second tranche of funding, which had been scheduled for regular intervals throughout 1996.

The United States - along with the European Union - has restricted the travel of President Alexander Lukashenko and members of his inner circle, as well as imposing economic sanctions.

==Present situation (2001 onwards)==
===Belarus-Russia relations===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Lukashenko and Putin2.jpg|thumb|[[Lukashenko]] talks to the President of Russia, [[Vladimir Putin]]]] --&gt;
Russia remains the largest and most important partner for Belarus both in the political and economic fields. After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' [[customs union|customs duties were unified]] in March 2001 but the customs controls were soon restored. In terms of trade, almost half of Belarusian export goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian [[industry]], Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of [[raw materials]] and components. After initial negotiation with the [[Central Bank of the Russian Federation|Russian Central Bank]] on [[monetary union]], the [[Russian ruble]] was set to be introduced in Belarus in 2004, but this was postponed first until 2005, then until 2006, and now seems to have been suspended indefinitely.

===Belarus-European Union relations===
The structure of Belarus trade reflects the low competitiveness and output decline of manufacturing industry in the country over the past decade, leading to the predominance of primary production, work-intensive goods as exports. Belarusian exports to the EU consist mainly of agricultural and textile products, while imports from the EU are primarily machinery.

Belarus is a beneficiary of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The European Commission decided in 2003 to initiate an investigation into violations of freedom of association in Belarus as the first step towards a possible temporary withdrawal of the GSP from Belarus.

[[Image:Belarus pro EU rally.jpg|thumb|left|Rally in the center of [[Minsk]] to support closer ties with the European Union, 2007]]
In December 2004, the EU adopted a position aimed at imposing travel restrictions on officials from Belarus responsible for the fraudulent parliamentary elections and referendum on 17 October 2004, and for human rights violations during subsequent peaceful political demonstrations in [[Minsk]].
The [[European Parliament]] released a statement in March 2005 in which it denounced the Belarusian government as a dictatorship. The European parliamentarians were primarily concerned about the suppression of independent media outlets in the country and the fraudulent referendum. A resolution of the European Parliament declared that the personal bank accounts of President Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarusian officials should be tracked and frozen.

In 2005, [[Amnesty International]] reported a ''pattern of deliberate obstruction, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders'' in Belarus. [[Reporters Without Borders]] accused the Belarusian authorities of hounding and arresting journalists from the country's Polish minority. Lukashenko has closed the country's main Polish newspaper, printing a bogus paper instead with the same name and size that praises his incumbent government. Several foreign, mainly Polish, journalists have been arrested or expelled from the country. Lukashenko accused Poland of an attempt to overthrow his government by stirring up a peaceful revolution in Belarus comparable to the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] in 2004.

Later in 2005 the Belarusian [[riot police]] seized the headquarters of the [[Union of Poles in Belarus]], an association representing the 400,000 [[ethnic minority]] Polish living in western areas the country that were part of Poland until [[World War II]]. The dispute between Poland and Belarus escalated further as Poland responded by recalling its ambassador from Belarus for indefinite consultations, and called on the European Union to impose sanctions on the Belarusian leadership in order to curtail the [[human rights]] abuses in Belarus. Belarusian papers described this as a 'dirty political game', and part of a 'cold war' waged on president Lukashenko. Polish Foreign Minister [[Adam Rotfeld]] said a clampdown was under way, aimed at destroying ''&quot;all elements of political pluralism and independence&quot;'' in Belarus.

[[Image:EU27-2009-Eastern Partnership.svg|thumb|Members of the Eastern Partnership]]
In August 2005 the EU's executive commission called for human rights to be respected in Belarus. The commission said it was considering offering support to independent media in the country and had set aside more than eight million euros from its budget to offer support for human rights activities. France expressed her solidarity with Poland on the issue of human rights in Belarus a day after the EU declared it was worried about the situation in that country. Several former Soviet Republics, including neighbouring Ukraine, also expressed their concerns about the development of the situation in Belarus.

In May 2009 Belarus and the EU agree on cooperation in the [[Eastern Partnership]] (EaP). However, it is contended by some scholars that the (EaP) is unable to create a workable partnership.&lt;ref name=Korosteleva2008&gt;[[Elena Korosteleva]], “The Limits of the EU Governance: Belarus ' Response to the European Neighbourhood Policy”, Contemporary Politics, Vol. 15(2), June 2009, pp. 229–45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belarus-United States relations===
{{Main|Belarus–United States relations}}
[[Image:Krasovskaya Zavadskaya Bush.jpg|thumb|[[George W. Bush|US President Bush]] greets widows of Belarusian politicians whose disappearance is blamed on orders of [[Lukashenko|President Lukashenko]], 2006]]
Belarus has had an ongoing discussion to relaunch IMF-backed reforms, concluding an arrangement for an IMF Staff-monitored program (SMP) in 2001. However, the authorities did not follow through with reforms as hoped, leaving an uncertain future for IMF-backed cooperation. Belarus authorities have said on several occasions that they find IMF intervention and recommendations in Belarus counter-productive to the economical development of those countries.
The relationships with the United States have been further strained, after [[Congress of the United States]] unanimously passed the [[Belarus Democracy Act of 2004]].

On 7 March 2008 the government of Belarus ejected the US Ambassador [[Karen B. Stewart]] from the country, following a row over travel restrictions placed on President Lukashenko and sanctions against state-owned chemical company [[Belneftekhim]]. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry announced at the same time that it was recalling its own ambassador to the US. This was followed by the expulsion of ten other U.S. embassy staff from Minsk in late April. At the same time the government of Belarus ordered the U.S. Embassy in Minsk to cut its staff by half.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[White House]] spokesman described the expulsion as &quot;deeply disappointing&quot;.

===Relations with third countries===
Due to strained relations with the United States and the European Union, as well as occasional high-level disputes with Russia over prices on core imported natural resources such as oil and gas, Belarus aims to develop better relations with countries in other regions like Middle East, Asia, and [[Latin America]].

Transmission is primary by fiberoptic or coax [[cable network]] ([[DVB-C]]) or copper [[telephone line]] (x[[DSL]]).  Terrestrial transmission ([[DVB-T]]) also exists.  In terms of television, there were 25 broadcast stations in 1997, and a further 10 repeaters.  This digital terrestrial network is owned by [[Norkring|Norking Belgium]].  Small operators of analog networks exist.  Satellite transmission ([[DVB-S]]) in Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia is operated by [[Airfield Holding|Airfield Belgium]] or [[Digidream]].  MNO's [[Proximus]] and [[Mobistar]] offer digital television over mobile phone ([[DVB-H]]).

In 1997, 4.72 million televisions were owned nationwide.

[[Public television]] in Belgium is controlled by the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] for the Dutch speaking region ([[Flanders]] and [[Brussels]]) the [[RTBF]] for the French speaking region ([[Wallonia]] and Brussels) and the [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] for the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German community]] in Belgium.

Numerous private operators exist.  The main competitors in the Flanders and Brussels regions are [[Vlaamse Media Maatschappij|VMMa]], [[SBS Broadcasting Group|SBS Belgium]] and [[Media ad Infinitum]].  VMMa is a joint venture of [[De Persgroep]] and [[Roularta Media Group]].  The main competitors in the Wallonia and Brussels regions are [[RTL Group]] and [[AB Groupe]].

Next to these regional channels, local channels exists.  E.g. [[TV Oost]] and [[ROB TV]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transport in [[Belgium]]''' is facilitated with well-developed road, air, rail and water networks. The rail network has 2,950 [[km]] of electrified tracks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infrabel.be/portal/page/portal/pgr_inf2_e_internet/infrabel_short_desc/historique&lt;/ref&gt; The road network has 118,414&amp;nbsp;km of roads among which 1,747&amp;nbsp;km of motorways, 13,892 of main roads and 102,775&amp;nbsp;km of other paved roads.&lt;ref&gt;http://statbel.fgov.be/fr/modules/publications/statistiques/circulation_et_transport/longueur_du_reseau_routier_revetu_en_km.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; Urban rail network is also developed in [[Brussels]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Charleroi]]. The ports of [[port of Antwerp|Antwerp]] and [[port of Bruges-Zeebrugge|Bruges-Zeebrugge]] are two of the biggest seaports in [[Europe]]. The [[Brussels National Airport]] is Belgium's biggest airport.

==Railways==
:''Main article'': [[Rail transport in Belgium]]. ''See also:'' [[High-speed rail in Belgium]]

Rail transport in Belgium was historically managed by the [[National Railway Company of Belgium]], known as SNCB in French and NMBS in Dutch. In 2005, the public company was split into 2 companies: [[Infrabel]], which manages the rail network and SNCB/NMBS itself, which manages the freight and passenger services. Both companies are held by a third company, named SNCB/NMBS Holding. There is a total of 3,536 kilometres, (2,563&amp;nbsp;km double track (as of 1998)), of which 2,950&amp;nbsp;km are electrified, mainly at 3,000 volts DC but with 351&amp;nbsp;km at 25 kV 50&amp;nbsp;Hz AC (2004) and all on [[standard gauge]] of {{RailGauge|sg}}. In 2004 the National Railway Company of Belgium, carried 178.4 million passengers a total of 8,676 million passenger-kilometres. Due to the high population density, operations are relatively profitable, so tickets are cheap and the frequency of services is high. The NMBS/SNCB is permanently updating its rolling stock.

The network currently includes [[High-speed rail in Belgium|four high speed lines]], three operating up to 300&amp;nbsp;km/h, and one up to 260&amp;nbsp;km/h. [[HSL 1]] runs from just south of Brussels to the French border, where it continues to [[Lille]], and from there to [[Paris]] or [[London]]. [[HSL 2]] runs from [[Leuven]] to [[Liège]]. [[HSL 3]] continues this route from Liège to the German border near [[Aachen]]. [[HSL 4]] runs from Antwerp to [[Rotterdam]] by meeting [[HSL-Zuid]] at the border with [[Netherlands]].

Electrification is at [[List of current systems for electric rail traction|3 kV DC]], with the exception of the new high-speed lines, and of two recently electrified lines in the south of the country which are at [[List of current systems for electric rail traction|25 kV AC]]. Trains, contrary to tram and road traffic, run on the left.

** {{flagicon|Luxembourg}} [[Rail transport in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] —  no voltage change at the border (the line Arlon-Luxembourg is at 3 kV d.c. and the line Gouvy-Luxembourg is at 25 kV a.c.)

===Urban rail===
{{main|Brussels RER}}
An urban commuter rail network, Brussels RER ({{lang-fr|Réseau express régional Bruxellois}}, {{lang-nl|Gewestelijk ExpresNet}}), is currently being set up the capital. It was initially supposed to be in service in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.b-rail.be/projects/pages/inv07.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but some observers expect it not to be ready before 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lalibre.be/economie/actualite/article/338350/pas-de-rer-a-bruxelles-avant-2016.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metros and Light Rail===
{{see also|Trams in Europe}}

In Belgium an extensive system of tram-like local railways called ''[[Vicinal tramway|vicinal or buurtspoor]]'' lines crossed the country in the first half of the 20th century, and had a greater route length than the main-line [[railway]] system. The only survivors of the vicinal/buurtspoor system are the [[Belgian coast tram|Kusttram]] (covering almost the entire coast from France to the Netherlands, being the longest tram line in the world) and some sections of the [[Charleroi Pre-metro]]. Urban tram networks exist in Antwerp (the [[Antwerp Pre-metro]]), [[Ghent]] and Brussels (the [[Brussels trams]]), and are gradually being extended. The only [[rapid transit]] system in Belgium is the [[Brussels Metro]]. Some heavy [[rapid transit|metro]] infrastructures were built in Brussels, Antwerp and the Charleroi area, but these are currently used by [[light rail]] vehicles, and their conversion to full [[rapid transit|metro]] is not envisaged at present due to lack of funds.

Regional transport in Belgium is operated by regional companies: [[De Lijn]] in [[Flanders]] operates the Kusttram and the Antwerp pre-metro as well as a bus network, [[TEC]] in [[Wallonia]] operates the Charleroi pre-metro as well as a bus network and [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|MIVB/STIB]] in the [[Brussels Capital-Region]] operates the Brussels metro as well as the Brussels tram and bus network. Despite this regional organization, some bus and tram routes operated by STIB/MIVB go beyond the regional border, and some bus routes operated by TEC or De Lijn transport passengers from the Flemish or Walloon regions to the capital city.

==Roads==
The road network in Belgium is managed by regional authorities, meaning that a road section in Flanders is managed by the [[Flemish Government]], a road section in Brussels by the [[Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels government]] and a road section in Wallonia by the [[Walloon Government]]. This explains that road signs in Flanders are written in Dutch, even when referring to a Walloon region, and conversely, which can be confusing for foreigners who ignore the different translations of Flemish or Walloon cities in the other language. The road network in Belgium is made of highways, national (or regional) roads (the secondary network) and communal roads (or streets). Communal roads are managed at the municipal level. There are also a number of orbital roads in Belgium around major cities.

* ''total:'' 152,256&amp;nbsp;km (2006)
* ''country comparison to the world:'' 35
:* ''paved:'' 119,079 km (including 1,763 km of expressways)
:* ''unpaved:'' 33,177 km

===Highways===
{{main|List of motorways in Belgium}}

The highways in Belgium are marked with a letter '''A''' and a number. Most often however the European numbering system for the [[international E-road network]] is used. There is however not always a one-on-one relationship between the two numbering systems along the whole length of the highways.

*[[A1 road (Belgium)|A1]] ([[European route E19|E19]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Antwerp]] - [[Breda]]
*[[A2 road (Belgium)|A2]] ([[European route E314|E314]]): [[Leuven]] - [[Lummen]] - [[Genk]]
*[[A3 road (Belgium)|A3]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Leuven]] - [[Liège (city)|Liège]] - [[Aachen]]
*[[A4 road (Belgium)|A4]] ([[European route E411|E411]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Wavre]] - [[Namur (city)|Namur]] - [[Arlon]] - [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]
*[[A10 road (Belgium)|A10]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Bruges]] - [[Ostend]]
*[[A13 road (Belgium)|A13]] ([[European route E313|E313]]): [[Antwerp]] - [[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]] - [[Hasselt]] - [[Liège]]
*[[A14 road (Belgium)|A14]] ([[European route E17|E17]]): [[Lille]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Antwerp]]
*[[A17 road (Belgium)|A17]] ([[European route E403|E403]]): [[Bruges]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Tournai]]
*[[A18 road (Belgium)|A18]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Bruges]] - [[Veurne]] - [[Dunkerque]]

===Ringways===
The ringways (or orbital roads) around bigger cities have their own series of numbers. The names start with a '''R''' then a first digit indicating the (old) province, and sometimes a second digit to further differentiate in between different ringways.

Some major examples are:
*[[R0 road (Belgium)|R0]] is the outer ringway around [[Brussels]]. The [[R20 road (Belgium)|R20]] and [[R22 road (Belgium)|R22]] are (parts of) inner ringways around Brussels.
*[[R1 road (Belgium)|R1]] is the southern half ringway and [[R2 road (Belgium)|R2]] is the northern half ringway around [[Antwerp]].
*[[R3 road (Belgium)|R3]] is the outer ringway and [[R9 road (Belgium)|R9]] is the inner ringway around [[Charleroi]]. The inner ring is counterclockwise-only.
*[[R4 road (Belgium)|R4]] is the outer ringway and [[R40 road (Belgium)|R40]] is the inner ringway around [[Ghent]].
*[[R6 road (Belgium)|R6]] is the outer ringway and [[R12 road (Belgium)|R12]] is the inner ringway around [[Mechelen]].
*[[R8 road (Belgium)|R8]] is the outer ringway and [[R36 road (Belgium)|R36]] is the inner ringway around [[Kortrijk]].
*[[R23 road (Belgium)|R23]] is the ringway around [[Leuven]].
*[[R30 road (Belgium)|R30]] is the inner ringway around [[Bruges]].

===National roads===
The national roads are marked with a letter '''N''' and a number.

The principal national roads fan out from Brussels, numbered in clockwise order:
*[[N1 road (Belgium)|N1]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Mechelen]] - [[Antwerp]]
*[[N2 road (Belgium)|N2]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Leuven]] - [[Diest]] - [[Hasselt]] - [[Maastricht]]
*[[N3 road (Belgium)|N3]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Leuven]] - [[Tienen]] - [[Sint-Truiden]] - [[Liège (city)|Liège]] - [[Aachen]]
*[[N4 road (Belgium)|N4]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Wavre]] - [[Namur (city)|Namur]] - [[Marche-en-Famenne]] - [[Bastogne]] - [[Arlon]]
*[[N5 road (Belgium)|N5]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Charleroi]] - [[Philippeville]]
*[[N6 road (Belgium)|N6]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] - [[Soignies]] - [[Mons]]
*[[N7 road (Belgium)|N7]]: [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] - [[Ath]] - [[Tournai]]
*[[N8 road (Belgium)|N8]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Ninove]] - [[Oudenaarde]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Ypres]] - [[Veurne]] - [[Koksijde]]
*[[N9 road (Belgium)|N9]]: [[Brussels]] - [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Eeklo]] - [[Bruges]] - [[Ostend]]

Secondary national roads intersect these.

National roads have an N plus 1, 2 or 3 digits. National roads numbered with 3 digits are provincial roads, their first number indicating the province:
* N1xx Province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerpen]]
* N2xx Provinces of [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]]
* N3xx Province of [[West Flanders]]
* N4xx Province of [[East Flanders]]
* N5xx Province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]]
* N6xx Province of [[Liège (province)|Liège]]
* N7xx Provinve of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]
* N8xx Province of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]]
* N9xx Province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]]

===Waterways===
The Belgian waterway network has 2,043&amp;nbsp;km, 1,532&amp;nbsp;km of which in regular commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobilit.fgov.be/fr/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The main waterways are the [[Albert Canal]] connecting Antwerp to Liège, the [[Ghent–Terneuzen Canal]] through the port of Ghent connecting Ghent with the [[Westerschelde]], the [[Boudewijn Canal]] through the port of Bruges-Zeebrugge connecting Bruges with the [[North Sea]], the [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]], [[Brussels-Scheldt Maritime Canal]] and [[Scheldt]] connecting Charleroi to Antwerp, the [[Nimy-Blaton-Péronnes Canal]] and Scheldt connecting the [[Borinage]] to Antwerp, the connection between the North Sea and Antwerp and the connection between [[Dunkerque]] and Liège via the Nimy-Blaton-Péronnes Canal, the [[Canal du Centre (Belgium)|Canal du Centre]], the lower [[Sambre]] and the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]]. Waterways are managed on a regional level in Belgium. The region of Brussels only managed 14&amp;nbsp;km of waterways from the [[Anderlecht]] lock to the [[Vilvoorde]] bridge. In Flanders, the management of waterways is outsourced to 4 companies: NV De Scheepvaart, Département Mobiliteit en Openbare Werken, Agentschap voor Maritieme Dienstverlening en Kust and Waterwegen en Zeekanaal NV.

==Pipelines==
Crude oil 158&amp;nbsp;km; refined products 535&amp;nbsp;km; natural gas 1,330&amp;nbsp;km (2008)

==Air transport==
{{main|List of airports in Belgium}}

According to the 2009 CIA World Factbook, there are a total of 43 airports in Belgium, 27 of which have paved runways. Airplane passengers in Belgium can use 5 airports, the largest of which being the [[Brussels Airport]]. The other airports are the [[Ostend-Bruges International Airport]], the [[Brussels-South Charleroi Airport]], the [[Liège Airport]] and the [[Antwerp International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belgium.be/en/mobility/airports/&lt;/ref&gt; Other airports are military airports or small civil airports with no scheduled flights. Well-known military airports include the [[Melsbroek Air Base]] and the [[Beauvechain Air Base]]. Belgium has also 1 [[heliport]].

The Belgian national airline used to be [[Sabena]] from 1923 to 2001, until it went into bankruptcy. A new Belgian airline named [[SN Brussels Airlines]] was subsequently founded by business man [[Etienne Davignon]]. The company was then renamed as [[Brussels Airlines]] in 2006. In 2009, Brussels Airlines was taken over by German airline [[Lufthansa]].

The '''economy of [[Benin]]''' remains underdeveloped and dependent on [[subsistence agriculture]] and [[cotton]]. Cotton accounts for 40% of GDP and roughly 80% of official export receipts. There is also production of [[textile]]s, palm products, and [[cocoa bean]]s. [[Maize]] (corn), [[bean]]s, [[rice]], [[peanut]]s, [[cashew]]s, [[pineapple]]s, [[cassava]], [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], and other various tubers are grown for local subsistence. Benin began producing a modest quantity of offshore oil in October 1982. Production ceased in recent years but exploration of new sites is ongoing. A modest fishing fleet provides fish and shrimp for local subsistence and export to Europe. Formerly government-owned commercial activities are now privatized. A French [[brewing|brewer]] acquired the former state-run brewery. Smaller businesses are privately owned by Beninese citizens, but some firms are foreign owned, primarily French and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]. The private commercial and agricultural sectors remain the principal contributors to growth.

==Economic development==
Since the transition to a [[Democracy|democratic]] government in 1990, Benin has undergone an economic recovery. A large injection of external investment from both private and public sources has alleviated the economic difficulties of the early 1990s caused by global recession and persistently low commodity prices (although the latter continues to affect the economy). The manufacturing sector is confined to some light industry, which is mainly involved in processing primary products and the cow production of consumer goods. A planned joint [[hydroelectric]] project with neighboring [[Togo]] is intended to reduce Benin's dependence on imported energy mostly from [[Ghana]], which currently accounts for a significant proportion of the country's imports. The service sector has grown quickly, stimulated by economic liberalization and fiscal reform, and the use of modern technology such as automobiles and computers has grown considerably as a result. Membership of the [[CFA Franc Zone]] offers reasonable currency stability as well as access to French economic support. Benin sells its products mainly to France and, in smaller quantities, to the Netherlands, Korea, Japan, and India. France is Benin's leading source for imports. Benin is also a member of the [[West Africa]]n economic community [[ECOWAS]].

Despite its rapid growth, the economy of Benin still remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth in real output averaged a sound 5% since 1996, but a rapid population rise offset much of this growth on a per capita basis.  Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Commercial and transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in [[Nigeria]], particularly fuel shortages.

Although [[trade unions in Benin]] represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of [[child labor|child labour]], and the continuing issue of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banks and Finance==

Benin’s financial sector is dominated by banks, and in general remains shallow. However, a series of reforms were undertaken in the 1990s, which resulted in the consolidation of the banking sector and in the privatization of all state banks.

A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999. There is no customer deposit insurance system.

Benin has a lively and diversified microfinance sector. Data from 2003 by the Central Bank stated a penetration rate of microfinance services of almost 60 percent. In 2006 the Ministry of Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women counted 762 organizations with 1308 branches, including Cooperatives, NGOs, Savings/Credit Associations and government projects. Programmes for strengthening the sector are carried out on national and regional levels, such as the PRAFIDE (Programme Régional d’Appui à la finance Décentralisée). The microfinance sector is also subject to supervision through the Central Bank as well as the responsible Ministry for Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women.

Benin is member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeur Mobiliés (BRVM) located in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. Stocks were issued by a number of companies in the region. Listed bonds were partly issued by companies and partly by governments of the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UEMOA).

The payment and settlement system and clearing mechanisms were reformed in 2004 through the BCEAO and offer RTGS and SWIFT access to banks, financial institutions, the stock exchange as well as the Central bank and special banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/benin/benin-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A Benin: Financial Sector Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy of [[Bhutan]], one of the world's smallest and least developed, is based on [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], which provide the main livelihood for more than 60% of the population. Agriculture consists largely of [[subsistence farming]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned with [[India]]'s through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's financial assistance. The industrial sector is technologically backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian [[migrant labor]]. Model education, social, and environment programs are underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. [[Hydropower]] exports to India have boosted Bhutan's overall growth, even though [[GD]]P fell in 2008 as a result of a slowdown in India, its predominant export market.

Bhutan's [[hydropower]] potential and its attraction for [[tourism|tourists]] are key resources. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare. Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are underway with support from multilateral development organizations. Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in such areas as industrial licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.

In 2004, Bhutan became the first country in the world to ban smoking and the selling of tobacco.

The '''Lhop''' or '''Doya people''' are a little-known tribe of southwest [[Bhutan]].  The Bhutanese believe them to be the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] inhabitants of the country, although this claim has not been substantiated by anthropologists. The Lhop are found in the low valleys of [[Samtse]] and near [[Phuntsholing]] in the [[Duars]]. They are also known as the Lhops, Lhopu, or Lhokpu and speak a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language.  They total approximately 2,500 persons.

The dress of the Lhop resembles the [[Lepcha]], but they bear little similarity with the [[Bhutia]] in the North and the [[Toto tribe|Toto]] in the west. The Doya trace their descent [[matrilineality|matrilineally]], marry their [[cross cousin]]s, and embalm the deceased who are then placed in a foetal position in a circular sarcophagus above the ground. They follow a blend of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] mixed with [[animism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Different cultures through history have depicted [[blindness]] in a variety of ways; among the [[Greeks]], for example, it was a punishment from the gods, for which the afflicted individual was often granted compensation in the form of artistic genius. [[Judeo-Christian]] [[literature]] positioned blindness as a flaw; only through a cure could God’s love be made manifest, when the scales would fall away from the eyes of an afflicted individual upon contact with a holy man or relic. Almost without exception in early literature, blind people could bring this condition down upon themselves through sin or trespasses against the gods, but were never the sole instruments of its reversal.

==Blind people in literature written by visually-able authors==
It is impossible to make a blanket generalization about how the blind were treated in literature beyond that point - they were marvelous, gifted, evil, malicious, ignorant, wise, helpless, innocent, or burdensome depending upon who wrote the story - except to say that blindness is perceived to be such a loss that it leaves an indelible mark on a person’s character.

Even pioneers in training the blind, such as [[Dorothy Harrison Eustis]], harboured negative stereotypes about them. Blind people had, in her opinion, grown so accustomed to waiting on others as to be passive and 'whiney.'

Father Thomas Carroll, who founded the Carroll Centre for the Blind, wrote ''Blindness: What It Is, What It Does and How to Live with It'' in 1961. In it, he characterized blindness in terms of 20 losses, and as the ‘death’ of the sighted individual.

In &quot;Moumoku Monogatari&quot; [[Junichiro Tanizaki]] retells the well-known tale of [[Oda Nobunaga]]　and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] from the perspective of a blind servant. The character is portrayed as demonstrating a number of traditional Japanese virtues, but ultimately falls prey to his own human flaws.

&quot;[[The Country of the Blind]]&quot;, a short story by [[H. G. Wells]], is one of the most well-known stories featuring sightless characters. A sighted man finds himself in a country that has been isolated from the rest of the world for centuries, wherein all the inhabitants are blind even as their ancestors had been. These people are depicted as self-sufficient, having developed their other senses, but they are ultimately closed-minded and insular to the point of [[xenophobia]]. As they themselves have no sight, they wish to deprive the traveler of his own eyes in this allegorical tale of stagnation.

==Literature by blind people==
While blind and visually impaired people had contributed to the body of common literature for centuries, one notable example being the author of ''Paradise Lost'', [[John Milton]], the creation of autobiographical materials, or materials specific to blindness, is relatively new.

Most people are familiar with [[Helen Keller]], who was both blind and deaf, but there has been considerable progress since the publication of her work.

* Blind author [[Tom Sullivan (singer)|Tom Sullivan]] has written several inspirational books, including ''If You Could See What I Hear'', about his life and accomplishments.
* [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who suffered from a congenital condition that caused him to become blind by middle age, discussed his condition in many autobiographical and semi-autobiographical works.
* Stephen Kuusisto wrote about his experiences as a visually impaired person in ''Planet of the Blind,'' and his upcoming memoir, ''Eavesdropping: A Life By Ear''.
* John Hull, a university lecturer, wrote about going blind in ''Touching the Rock: An Experience of Blindness''.
* Georgina Kleege, visually impaired since age 11, wrote about her life and how it was affected by cultural perceptions of blindness in ''Sight Unseen''.
*[[Sally Hobart Alexander]] became blind when she was about 25 and a schoolteacher, during the 1970s, because of an eye disease. She wrote at least three autobiographical books about adapting to blindness.
*French author [[Jacques Lusseyran]], who was visually impaired at the age of 7 when he injured his eyes on the sharp corner of a teacher's desk, became part of the French resistance during World War II. He spent a year in concentration camps, surviving the experience and writing several books. &quot;And There Was Light&quot; chronicles his experiences from early childhood until his liberation from a concentration camp.

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is located in [[Southeastern Europe]], in the western [[Balkans]]. It has a 932&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Croatia]] to the north and southwest, a 312&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Serbia]] to the east, and a 215&amp;nbsp;km border with [[Montenegro]] to the southeast. It borders the Adriatic Sea along its 23&amp;nbsp;km (14&amp;nbsp;mi) coastline.

The most striking features of the local terrain are valleys and mountains which measure up to 2386 m in height. The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central [[Dinaric Alps]]. The northeastern parts reach into the [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian basin]], while in the south it borders the [[Adriatic]].

The country's natural resources include: coal, iron, bauxite, manganese, forests, copper, chromium, lead, zinc and hydro power.

==Regions==
[[File:BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA REGIONS.jpg|thumb|200px|Right|Regions map of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
The country's name comes from the two regions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], which have a very vaguely defined border between them. Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four fifths of the entire country, while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the south part of the country.

The major cities are the capital [[Sarajevo]], [[Banja Luka]] in the northwest region known as [[Bosanska Krajina]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Tuzla]] in the northeast, Zenica and Doboj in the central part of Bosnia and [[Mostar]], the capital of [[Herzegovina]].

The south part of Bosnia has Mediterranean climate and a great deal of agriculture. Central Bosnia is the most mountainous part of Bosnia featuring predominate mountains [[Vlašić]], [[Čvrsnica]], and [[Prenj]]. Eastern Bosnia also features mountains like [[Trebević]], [[Jahorina]], [[Igman]], [[Bjelašnica]] and [[Treskavica]]. It was here that the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] were held.

Eastern Bosnia is heavily forested along the river Drina, and overall close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in Central, Eastern and Western parts of Bosnia. Northern Bosnia contains very fertile agricultural land along the river Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Parapannonian Plain stretching into neighbouring Croatia and Serbia. The river Sava and corresponding [[Posavina]] river basin hold the cities of Brčko, Bosanski Šamac, Bosanski Brod and Bosanska Gradiška.

The northwest part of Bosnia is called [[Bosanska Krajina]] and holds the cities of [[Banja Luka]], [[Prijedor]], [[Sanski Most]], [[Jajce]], Cazin, Velika Kladuša and [[Bihać]]. [[Kozara National Park]] and Mrakovica WWII monument is located in this region.

The country has only {{convert|20|km|mi|1}} of coastline,&lt;ref name=&quot;coastline&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2060.html Field Listing - Coastline], ''[[The World Factbook]]'', 2006-08-22&lt;/ref&gt; around the town of [[Neum]] in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, although surrounded by Croatian peninsulas it is possible to get to the middle of the Adriatic from Neum. By United Nations law, Bosnia has a right of passage to the outer sea. Neum has many hotels and is an important tourism destination.

==Rivers==

There are seven major rivers in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina:

*The [[Una (Sava)|Una]] in the northwest part of Bosnia flows along the northern and western border of Bosnia and Croatia and through the Bosnian city of Bihać. It is a very beautiful river and popular for rafting and adventure sports.

*The [[Sana River|Sana]] flows through the city of Sanski Most and Prijedor and is a tributary of the river Sava in the north.

*The [[Vrbas]] flows through the cities of Gornji Vakuf - Uskoplje, Bugojno, Jajce, Banja Luka, Srbac and reaches the river Sava in the north. The Vrbas flows through the central part of Bosnia and flows outwards to the North.

*The River [[Bosna]] is the longest river in Bosnia and is fully contained within the country as it stretches from its source near Sarajevo to the river Sava in the north. It gave its name to the country.

*The [[Drina River|Drina]] flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, at many places in the border between Bosnia and Serbia. The Drina flows through the cities of Foča, Goražde and Višegrad.

*The [[Neretva]] river is a large river in Central and Southern Bosnia, flowing from Jablanica south to the Adriatic Sea. The river is famous as it flows through the famous city of Mostar.

*The [[Sava]] river is the largest river in Bosnia and Herzegovina but not the largest river that is flowing through Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Sava river flows through Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Sava is making a natural border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia and towns like Brčko, Bosanski Šamac, Bosanska Gradiška lies on the river.

==Phytogeography==

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.

== Climate ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
'''Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. Members of the parliament are chosen according to a [[proportional representation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;http://izbori.ba/documents/ZAKONI/POIZpw110508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The system of government established by the [[Dayton Accord]] is an example of [[consociationalism]], as representation is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power. 

Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into two ''Entities'' - the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]], which each have largely autonomous political power, as well as the district of [[Brčko District|Brčko]], which is jointly administered by both. Each of the Entities has its own constitution.
:''See [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]''

==Dayton Agreement==
Due to the [[Dayton Agreement]], signed 14 December 1995, Bosnia and Herzogovina forms an international protectorate, with decisive power given to the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It retained Bosnia's exterior border and created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government - based on proportional representation similar to that which existed in the former socialist regime - is charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal policy.

The Dayton Agreement established the Office of the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] (OHR) to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. About 250 international and 450 local staff members are employed by the OHR.

==High Representative==
{{main|High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief executive officer for the international civilian presence in the country. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly or to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative are often seen as dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/KnausandMartin.pdf Knaus and Martin, Travails of the European Raj, Journal of Democracy, 14(3):60 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sshl/pdf/JISB%20BOS%203%20-%20Parish.pdf Matthew Parish, The Demise of the Dayton Protectorate, Journal of Intevention and Statebuilding December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Even the symbols of Bosnian statehood (flag, coat of arms) have been chosen by the Highest Representative rather than by the Bosnian people. The source of the authority of the High Representative is essentially contractual. His mandate derives from the Dayton Agreement, as confirmed by the [[Peace Implementation Council]], an ad hoc body with a Steering Board composed of representatives of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[United States]], the [[presidency of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], and the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]].

==Executive branch==
The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serb]], [[Croat]]), each elected as [[incumbent]] of the Chair for an 8-month term within their 4-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people (Federation votes for the Bosniak/Croat, Republika Srpska for the Serb). The Presidency is the [[head of state]] institution and it is mainly responsible for the [[foreign policy]] and proposing the [[budget]]. 

The Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.

The Council is responsible for carrying out various policies and decisions in the fields of diplomacy, economy, inter-Entity relations and other matters as agreed by the Entities.

Each of the Entities has its own Council of Ministers, which deal with internal matters not dealt with by the state Council.

==Judicial branch==
=== Constitutional Court ===

The [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the RS, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency.

Terms of initial appointees are 5 years, unless they resign or are removed for cause by consensus of the other judges. Once appointed, judges are not eligible for reappointment. Judges subsequently appointed will serve until the age of 70, unless they resign or are removed for cause. Appointments made 5 years after the initial appointments may be governed by a different law of selection, to be determined by the Parliamentary Assembly.

Proceedings of the Court are public, and decisions will be published. Rules of court are adopted by a majority of the Court, and decisions are final and binding.

The Constitutional Court's original jurisdiction lies in deciding any constitutional dispute that arises between the Entities or between Bosnia and Herzegovina and an Entity or Entities. Such disputes may be referred only by a member of the Presidency, by the Chair of the Council of Ministers, by the Chair or Deputy Chair of either chamber of the Parliamentary Assembly, or by one-fourth of the legislature of either Entity.

The Court also has appellate jurisdiction within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===State Court===
The [[State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] consists of three divisions - Administrative, Appellate and Criminal - having jurisdiction over cases related to state-level law and appellate jurisdiction over cases initiated in the entities.

A War Crimes Chamber was added in January 2005, and has currently adopted two cases transferred from the ICTY, as well as dozens of war crimes cases initiated in cantonal courts.

The State Court also deals with organized crime, economic crime and corruption cases. For example, former Presidency member [[Dragan Ćović]] is currently on trial for involvement in organized crime syndicates.

===Human Rights Chamber===
The [[Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (''Dom za ljudska prava za Bosnu i Hercegovinu'') has displayed activity between March 1996 and 31 December 2003. It was a judicial body established under Annex 6 to the [[General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Dayton Peace Agreement]]).

===Entities===
The entities each have a Supreme Court. Each entity also has a number of lower courts. There are 10 cantonal courts in the Federation, plus a number of municipal courts. The Republika Srpska has five municipal courts.

This page discusses the '''Economy of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]''' since Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of sovereignty in October [[1991]] and the declaration of independence from the former [[Yugoslavia]] on 3 March 1992.

==Overview==

Bosnia and Herzegovina faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing market reforms to its formerly centrally-planned economy. One legacy of the previous era is a greatly overstaffed military industry; under former leader [[Josip Broz Tito]], military industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants but fewer commercially viable firms. Although agriculture is almost all in private hands, farms are small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally is a net importer of food. Industry remains greatly overstaffed, a holdover from the [[socialist]] economic structure of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito had pushed the development of military industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina was saddled with a host of industrial firms with little commercial potential.

The [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] caused production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995 and unemployment to soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996-99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000-02. Part of the lag in output was made up in 2003-05. National-level statistics are limited and do not capture the large share of black market activity.

The [[konvertibilna marka]] (convertible mark or BAM)- the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however, has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all the Communist-era payments bureaus were shut down; foreign banks, primarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A sizable current account deficit and high unemployment rate remain the two most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.

The [[centrally planned economy]] has resulted in some legacies in the economy. [[Industry]] is greatly overstaffed, reflecting the rigidity of the planned economy. Under Josip Broz Tito, military industries were pushed in the republic; Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants for military reasons - Bosnia was in the center of former Yugoslavia.

[[Image:Mostar Ruined Office Building 2009 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|War-ruined bank building in [[Mostar]]]]
[[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina#19th and 20th century|Three years of War]] (1992–1995) destroyed the economy and infrastructure in Bosnia, causing [[unemployment]] to soar, as well as causing the death of about 100,000 people and displacing half of the population. Mean wages were $4.36 per manhour in 2009.

Bosnia has been facing a dual challenge: not only must the nation recover from the war, but it also has to finish the transition from [[socialism]] to [[capitalism]].

With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996-98 at high percentage rates on a low base; but output growth slowed appreciably in 1999, and GDP remains far below the 1990 level.

Economic data are of limited use because, although [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|both entities]] issue figures, national-level statistics are not available. Moreover, official data do not capture the large share of activity that occurs on the [[black market]]. The [[Grey market]] is a notable source of income for Bosnian traders.

A Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in late 1997, successful debt negotiations were held with the [[London Club]] in December 1997 and with the [[Paris Club]] in October 1998, and a new currency, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]], was introduced in mid-1998. In 1999, the Convertible Mark gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank dramatically increased its reserve holdings.

Due to Bosnia's strict currency board regime, [[inflation]] has remained low in the entire country.

The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and [[humanitarian aid]] from the international community. Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) assistance accounts for 20%-25% of [[economic growth]] in Bosnia.

However, growth has been uneven throughout the post-war period, with the Federation outpacing the RS. According to World Bank estimates, GDP growth was 62% in the Federation and 25% in the RS in 1996, 35% in the Federation and flat in the RS in 1997, and continued growth in the Federation in 1998.

Movement has been slow, but considerable progress has been made in economic reform since peace was re-established in the republic. [[Banking]] reform lagged, as did the implementation of [[privatization]]. Many companies (mainly factories) that were privatized faced massive problems, causing the owners to reduce salaries and deny the workers their salaries. Combined with persistent inter-ethnic problems in the country, for many workers this meant that they had a useless job, getting paid perhaps after two three or even six months late only for one month, but one which they clung on to. They don't want to leave the job because they think someone from another nationality will then get it. The privatized factories are now owned mostly by Germans and foreigners, who used webcams to monitor the workers. One example of all this is the Alloy factory in [[Jajce]] which produces wheels for cars, sold in Germany or other EU members.

The [[tourism]] sector has been recovering and helping the economy altogether in the process, with popular winter skiing destinations as well as summer countryside tourism. An estimated 500,000 tourists visit Bosnia and Herzegovina every year and contribute much of the foreign currency in the country. Of particular note is the [[diaspora]] population which often returns home during the summer months, bringing in an increase in retail sales and food service industry.

[[Political corruption]] is one of the more acute problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the main one that accounts for low amount of tax money used for the population, due to government inefficiency and corruption, especially at the lowest levels.

Bosnia has been preparing for an era of declining international assistance. Bosnia's most immediate task remains economic revitalization to create jobs and [[income]]. In order to do this the workers need to form unions and demand their payment or similar. The owners need to pay the salaries all months the full salary agreed upon.

The Bosnian government plans to issue an international tender for the construction of the 350&amp;nbsp;km long Corridor 5c in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will passes along the route Budapest-Osijek-Sarajevo-Ploče. The highway along this corridor is the most significant roadway in B&amp;H and the shortest communication route between Middle Europe and the Adriatic. The routing of the road passes through the central part of the country in the North-South direction from Donji Svilaj to the border of B&amp;H, north from the Croatian port of Ploce, following the rivers Bosna and Neretva. More than 50% of the total population and the economic activity of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies within the zone of influence along this route.

Project documentation for that highway is ready, so in January 2006, the Bosnian government will issue an international tender for construction of the highway Corridor 5C using a DBFOT system (Design, Build, Finance, Operate, Transfer). Using this system, the concessionaire secures finance, bears all business risks and upon expiration of the concession period, transfers the highway to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The estimated cost for the construction of the highway is 2.5 billion EUR.

The '''Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Oružane snage Bosne i Hercegovine, OSBIH'' [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]]: Оружане снаге Босне и Херцеговине, ОСБИХ) is the official [[military]] force of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Bosnian Armed forces were unified in 2005 and are composed of two founding [[army|armies]]: [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]]-[[Bosnian Croat|Croat]], [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Bosnian Serb]], [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], founded in 2004, is in charge of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The supreme commander of the Bosnian Armed Forces is the current president of Bosnia and Herzegovina thus the Presidency commands the Bosnian Army, then the Bosnian Ministry of Defence with the minister [[Selmo Cikotić]], then the Chiefs of Joint Staff with [[Sifet Podžić]] as the head of the chiefs. The BiH Chief of Joint Staff is Lieutenant General Miladin Milojčić. [[Conscription]] was completely abolished in Bosnia and Herzegovina effective on and from 1 January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/special/dayton/peacekeeping/feature-11 NATO and the Defence Reform Commission: partners for progress (SETimes.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; ]&lt;/ref&gt; There are supposed to be 10,000 Active troops, 5000 Reserve troops, and 500 Civilian staff.

The Bosnia and Herzegovina Defense Law addresses the following areas: the Military of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Government Institutions, Entity jurisdictions and structure, Budget and Financing, Composition of Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, War declaration, Natural disasters, Conflict of interests and professionalism, Oath to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Flags, Anthem and Military Insignia, and transitional and end orders.

==History==
The AFBiH was formed from three armies of the [[Bosnian War]] period: the Bosnian (dominantly Bosniak with numbers of Serbs and Croats) [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the Bosnian Serb [[Army of Republika Srpska]], and the Croat Defence Council.

The Army of the Republic of Bosnia And Herzegovina was created on 15 April 1992 during the early days of the [[Bosnian War]]. Before the ARBiH was formally created, there existed [[Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Territorial Defence]], an official military force of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a number of [[paramilitary]] groups such as the [[Green beret#Green Berets of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Green Berets]], [[Patriotic League]], and [[civil defense]] groups, as well as many criminal gangs and collections of police and military professionals. The army was formed under poor circumstances, with a very low number of [[tanks]], [[Armored Personnel Carrier|APC]]s and no military aviation assets. The army was divided into Corps, each Corp was stationed in a territory. First commander was [[Sefer Halilović]].

The Army of Republika Srpska was created on 12 May 1992. Before the VRS was formally created, there were a number of [[paramilitary]] groups such as the Srpska Dobrovoljačka Garda, [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|Beli Orlovi]], as well as some [[Russians|Russian]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and other volunteers. Most of the paramilitary groups were not under the command of [[General]] [[Ratko Mladić]]. The army was equipped with ex-[[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] inventory. It had about 200 tanks, mostly [[T-55]]s and 85 [[M-84]]s, and 150 APCs with several heavy artillery pieces. The Air Defense of VRS has shot down several aircraft, like [[F-16]], [[Mirage 2000]], [[F-18]] and one [[Croatian Air Force]] [[MiG-21]]. The VRS received support from the [[Yugoslav Army]] and [[FRY]] until 1994, when Slobodan Milošević stopped military relations with [[Republika Srpska]].

The [[Croatian Defence Council]] was the main military formation of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia during the Bosnian War and it was first organized military force to with the aim to control the Croat populated areas. It is not to be confused with the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS) which was a separate Croatian military unit.

In 1995-96, a [[NATO]]-led international peacekeeping force ([[IFOR]]) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning on December 21, 1995 to implement and monitor the military aspects of the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]]. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force or [[SFOR]]. The number of SFOR troops was reduced first to 12,000 and then to 7,000. SFOR was in turn succeeded by an even smaller, [[European Union]]-led European Union Force, [[EUFOR Althea]]. As of 2004, EUFOR Althea numbered around 7,000 troops.

As the joint AFBiH began to develop, troops began to be sent abroad. Bosnia and Herzegovina deployed a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel as part of the [[Multinational force in Iraq]]. The unit was first deployed to [[Fallujah]], then [[Talil Air Base]], and is now located at [[Camp Echo]]. In December 2006, the Bosnian government formerly extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th infantry division to Iraq in August 2008, their mission will be to protect/guard [[Camp Victory]] in [[Baghdad]].

==Structure==
The Military units are commanded by the '''Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina Joint Staff''' in Sarajevo. There are two major commands under the Joint Staff: Operational Command and Support Command.

There are three regiments that are each formed by soldiers from the three ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs and trace their roots to the armies that were created during the Bosnian war. These regiments have their distinct ethnic insignias and consist of three active battalions each. Each regiments three battalions divided evenly between the three active brigades of the Army.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The implementation of the [[Dayton Accords]] of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as well as the [[international community]], on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. Within [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], relations with its neighbors of [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]] have been fairly stable since the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995.

==Foreign relations==
===Bulgaria===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Bulgaria relations}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina-Bulgaria relations are foreign relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Bulgaria]]. Both countries established diplomatic relations on 15 January 1992. Since 1996, Bulgaria has an embassy in [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.bg/sarajevo/index.php?lang=en   Bulgarian embassy in Sarajevo]&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina has an embassy in [[Sofia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.bg/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7978&amp;Itemid=384  Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: direction of the Bosnian embassy in Sofia]&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries are full members of the [[Southeast European Cooperation Process]], of the [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative]], of the [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]], of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and of the [[Council of Europe]]. Bulgaria was the first country to recognize Bosnia as an independent country.

===Canada===

Bosnia and Herzegovina is represented through the [[Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Ottawa]], while Canada is represented by the Embassy of Canada in Budapest. Three Canadian organizations operate programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina: [[Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]] (DFAIT), the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] (DND). Canada strongly supports the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] hoping it can help bring more stability to the region. Through the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] Canada has given more than [[Canadian dollar|CA$]] 144 million in development assistance.

Exports of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Canada are worth about [[United States dollar|US$]] 5.31 million per year, while exports of Canada to Bosnia and Herzegovina value about US$ 5.34 million per year.

===Croatia===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia relations}}
Discussions continue with [[Croatia]] on several small disputed sections of the boundary related to maritime access that hinder final ratification of the 1999 border agreement.

Sections of the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] river and villages at the base of Mount [[Plješevica]] are in Croatia, while some are in Bosnia, which causes an excessive number of border crossings on a single route and impedes any serious development in the region. The [[Zagreb]]-[[Bihać]]-[[Split (city)|Split]] railway line is still closed for major traffic due to this issue. The road [[Karlovac]]-[[Plitvice Lakes]]-[[Knin]], which is on the [[European route]] E71, is becoming increasingly unused because Croatia built a separate highway to the west of it.

The border on the Una river between [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]] on the northern, Croatian side of the river, and [[Bosanska Kostajnica]] on the southern, Bosnian side, is also being discussed. A river island between the two towns is under Croatian control, but is claimed by Bosnia. A shared border crossing point has been built and has been functioning since 2003, and is used without hindrance by either party.

The Herzegovinian [[municipality]] of [[Neum]] in the south makes the southernmost part of Croatia an [[exclave]] and the two countries are negotiating special transit rules through Neum to compensate for that. Recently Croatia has opted to build a [[Pelješac bridge|bridge to the Pelješac peninsula]] to connect the Croatian mainland with the exclave but Bosnia and Herzegovina has protested that it will close their way to [[international waters]] (although Croatian territory and [[territorial waters]] surround Bosnian-Herzegovinan ones completely) and has suggested that the bridge must be higher than 55 meters for free passage of all types of ships. Negotiations are still being held.

===Cyprus===

Cyprus recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina’s independence on 7 February 2000, both countries established diplomatic relations on the same date. Bosnia and Herzegovina is represented in Cyprus through its embassy in Tel Aviv (Israel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/All/7E131F7AD636D54DC22571B1003E3C1C?OpenDocument  Cyprus Ministry of Foreign Affairs: direction of the Bosnian representation to Cyprus]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyprus is represented in Bosnia and Herzegovina through its embassy in Budapest (Hungary).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/All/1F8CC4155ED1B01DC22572790026874C?OpenDocument  Cyprus Ministry of Foreign Affairs: direction of the Cypriot representation to Bosnia and Herzegovina]&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean, of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and of the Council of Europe.

===Czech Republic===

The Czech Republic recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina’s independence on 8 February 1992. Both countries established diplomatic relations on 8 April 1993. Bosnia and Herzegovina has an embassy in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czechembassy.org/wwwo/mzv/default.asp?id=16049&amp;ido=10194&amp;idj=2&amp;amb=1  Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs: direction of the Bosnian embassy in Prague]&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech Republic has an embassy in Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzv.cz/sarajevo/en/index.html  Czech embassy in Sarajevo]&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries are full members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and of the Council of Europe.

===Denmark===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina – Denmark relations}}

===Germany===
[[Germany]] is one of the most important partners of Bosnia and Herzegovina in foreign affairs. Bilateral relations have developed steadily since diplomatic ties were established in mid-1994. Germany was closely involved in efforts to bring about peace before and after the conclusion of the [[Dayton Agreement]]. There is also a long tradition of economic relations between Germany and Bosnia. When the country was still part of the former Yugoslavia, joint ventures and cooperation played a large role here (motor industry, metal processing, textile industry/contract processing work, steel and chemicals). After the war, Germany took on a spearheading role in investments in production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is undergoing a transitional phase from a centrally planned to a market economy. These investments are concentrated primarily in vehicle assembly and parts supply, the construction industry/cement, raw materials processing/ aluminum and regional dairy farming.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/Laenderinformationen/01-Laender/BosnienHerzegowina.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===

Greece recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina’s independence in 1992. Both countries established diplomatic relations on 30 November 1995. Since 1998, Bosnia and Herzegovina has an embassy in Athens. Since 1996, Greece has an embassy in Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/Bosnia+-+Herzegovina/  Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the relation with Bosnia and Herzegovina]&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean, of the Southeast European Cooperation Process, of the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative, of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and of the Council of Europe.

===Hungary===

Hungary recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina’s independence on 9 April 1992. Both countries established diplomatic relations on 10 April 1992. Bosnia and Herzegovina has an embassy in [[Budapest]]. Hungary has an embassy in [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kulkepviselet/BH/HU  Hungarian embassy in Sarajevo (in Hungarian only)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries are full members of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and of the [[Council of Europe]].

===Malaysia===
Malaysia, under Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], had been one of the strongest supporters of the Bosnian cause during the war. Malaysia sent UN Peacekeeping troops to the former Yugoslavia. Malaysia maintains a number of investments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the most significant is the [[Bosmal City Center|Bosmal Group]]. Bosmal is a joint venture set up between Malaysian and Bosnian interests. A number of Bosnian students are currently studying at the [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] in [[Petaling Jaya]]. Malaysia maintains an embassy in Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina maintains an embassy in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

===Romania===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Romania relations}}
Romania recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina’s independence on 1 March 1996, both countries established diplomatic relations on the same day. Bosnia and Herzegovina has an embassy in [[Bucharest]]. Romania has an embassy in [[Sarajevo]]. Relations were described as &quot;excellent&quot; by the foreign ministers in 2006, ahead of the opening of the Bosnian embassy in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csees.net/index.php?page=news&amp;news_id=52111&amp;country_id=6|title=Bosnia-Romania relations &quot;excellent&quot; - foreign ministers|date=7 May 2006|work=Onasa news agency|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Russia relations}}
Bosnia is one of the countries where Russia has contributed troops for the NATO-led stabilization force. Others were sent to Kosovo, and Serbia. Russia usually takes a pro-Serbian stand in resolutions relating to Bosnia and this has complicated relations between Russia and Bosnia.

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Pakistan relations}}
Pakistan and Bosnia and Herzegovina enjoy close and cordial relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mofa.gov.pk/bosnia/contents.aspx?type=statements&amp;id=1&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan recognised the independence of Bosnia from Yugoslavia in 1992. Pakistan sent in UN Peacekeeping forces to the former Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav wars. During the war, Pakistan supported Bosnia while providing technical and military support to Bosnia. Approximately 90,000 Pakistani people went to Bosnia during the Yugoslav wars, accounting for 20% of the volunteer military force. Pakistan and Bosnia have a free trade agreement. During the War time, Pakistan had hosted thousands of Bosnians as refugees in Pakistan. Pakistan has also provided medium-tech to high Tech weapons to Bosnian Government in the past.

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia has provided enormous financial assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina since its independence in 1992. Saudi interests also funded for the construction of the [[King Fahd Mosque (Sarajevo)|King Fahd Mosque]], which is currently the largest mosque in Sarajevo. Bosnia and Herzegovina maintains an embassy in [[Riyadh]] and Saudi Arabia maintains an embassy in Sarajevo.

===Serbia===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–Serbia relations}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina filed a suit against the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (today [[Serbia]]) before the [[International Court of Justice]] for aggression and genocide during the [[Bosnian War]] which was dismissed and Serbia was found innocent. Sections along the [[Drina River]] remain in dispute between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.

===United States===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina–United States relations}}
The 1992-1995 war in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was ended with the crucial participation of the [[United States]] in brokering the 1995 [[Dayton Accords]]. After leading the diplomatic and military effort to secure the Dayton agreement, the United States has continued to lead the effort to ensure its implementation. The United States maintains command of the [[NATO]] headquarters in [[Sarajevo]]. The United States has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help with infrastructure, humanitarian aid, economic development, and military reconstruction in Herzegovina and Bosnia. The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) has played a large role in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina, including programs in economic development and reform, democratic reform ([[Mass media|media]], [[elections]]), [[infrastructure]] development, and training programs for Bosnian professionals, among others. Additionally, there are many [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) that have likewise played significant roles in the reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2868.htm#relations&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU accession==
The [[accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] (SAP) is the EU's policy framework. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, member states of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign support==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina receives support from donor programs of:
* [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD)
* [[European Union]]
* [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]
* [[International Monetary Fund]]
* [[USAID]]

In the 3 years since the Dayton Accords were signed, over $4 billion in foreign aid has flown into Bosnia, about $800 million of it coming from SEED funds. As stated above, this support has been key to the growth and revitalization of the economy and infrastructure in the republic. However, most of this aid has been targeted at the Federation; the previous government of the RS was anti-Dayton and not assisted by the U.S. The election of the &quot;Sloga&quot; or &quot;Unity&quot; Coalition government, led by Prime Minister Dodik, has shifted the balance of power in the [[Republika Srpska]] (RS) to a pro-Dayton stance and will result in an upsurge of funding to the RS from the international community.

In addition to SEED funding, [[USAID]] programs have been crucial to the redevelopment of Bosnia and Herzegovina. USAID has programming in the following areas: economic policy reform and restructuring; private sector development (the Business Development Program); infrastructure rebuilding; democratic reforms in the media, political process and elections, and rule of law/legal code formulation; and training programs for women and diplomats.

==International organizations==
[[BIS]], [[Council of Europe|CE]], [[CEI]], [[EBRD]], [[ECE]], [[FAO]], [[G-77]], [[IAEA]], [[IBRD]], [[ICAO]], [[ICCt]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[IFRCS]], [[ILO]], [[IMF]], [[IMO]], [[Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[IOM]] (observer), [[ISO]], [[ITU]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]] (guest), [[Organization of American States|OAS]] (observer), [[OIC]] (observer), [[OPCW]], [[OSCE]], [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative|SECI]], [[UN]], [[UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[UNIDO]], [[UNMEE]], [[UPU]], [[WHO]], [[WIPO]], [[WMO]], [[WToO]], [[WTrO]] (observer)

==Refugees and internally displaced persons==
*''refugees (country of origin):'' 7,269 (Croatia)
*''IDPs:'' 131,600 (Bosnian Croats, Serbs, and Bosniaks displaced in 1992-95 war) (2007)

==Illicit drugs==
Increasingly a transit point for [[heroin]] being trafficked to Western Europe; minor transit point for [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]; remains highly vulnerable to money-laundering activity given a primarily cash-based and unregulated economy, weak law enforcement, and instances of corruption.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Batswana]], a term also used to denote all citizens of [[Botswana]], refers to the country's major ethnic group (called the &quot;Tswana&quot; in [[South Africa]]). Prior to European contact, the Batswana lived as herders and farmers under tribal rule.

==Before European contact==
{{Main|Bantu expansion}}
Sometime between 200-500&amp;nbsp;AD, Bantu speaking peoples, who originated in the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] area (today part of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] and [[Zambia]]), and had been [[Bantu expansion|expanding across sub-Saharan Africa]], crossed the [[Limpopo River]], entering the area today known as [[South Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

There were 2 broad waves of immigration to South Africa; [[Nguni people|Nguni]] and Sotho-Tswana. The former settled in the eastern coastal regions, while the latter settled primarily in the area known today as the [[Highveld]] &amp;mdash; the large, relatively high central plateau of southern Africa.

By 1000AD the Bantu colonization of most of South Africa had been completed, with the possible exception of what is now the [[Western Cape]] and the [[Northern Cape]], which are believed to have been inhabited by [[Khoisan]] people until [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonisation. The Bantu-speaking society was highly a decentralized feudal society organized on a basis of [[kraals]] (an enlarged clan), headed by a chief, who owed a very hazy allegiance to the nation's head chief. According to Neil Parsons's online &quot;Brief History of Botswana&quot;:

{{quote|&quot;From around 1095 south-eastern Botswana saw the rise of a new culture, characterized by a site on Moritsane hill near Gabane, whose pottery mixed the old western style with new Iron Age influences derived from the eastern Transvaal (Lydenburg culture). The Moritsane culture is historically associated with the Khalagari (Kgalagadi) chiefdoms, the westernmost dialect-group of Sotho (or Sotho-Tswana) speakers, whose prowess was in cattle raising and hunting rather than in farming.

“In east-central Botswana, the area within 80 or 100 kilometres of Serowe (but west of the railway line) saw a thriving farming culture, dominated by rulers living on Toutswe hill, between about 600-700AD and 1200-1300AD. The prosperity of the state was based on cattle herding, with large corrals in the capital town and in scores of smaller hill-top villages. (Ancient cattleandsheep/goatcorrals are today revealed by characteristic grassgrowing on them.) The Toutswe people were also hunting westwards into the Kalahari and trading eastwards with the Limpopo. East coast shells, used as trade currency, were already being traded as far west as Tsodilo by 700AD.

“The Toutswe state appears to have been conquered by its Mapungubwe state neighbour, centred on a hill at the Limpopo-Shashe confluence, between 1200AD and 1300AD. Mapungubwe had been developing since about 1050 AD because of its control of the early gold trade coming down the Shashe, which was passed on for sale to sea traders on the Indian Ocean. The site of Toutswe town was abandoned, but the new rulers kept other settlements going - notably Bosutswe, a hill-top town in the west, which supplied the state with hunting products, caught by Khoean hunters, and with Khoesan cattle given in trade or tribute from the Boteti River. But Mapungubwe's triumph was short-lived, as it was superseded by the new state of Great Zimbabwe, north of the Limpopo River, which flourished in control of the gold trade from the 13th to the 15th centuries. It is not known how far west the power of Great Zimbabwe extended. Certainly its successor state, the Butua state based at Kame near Bulawayo in western Zimbabwe from about 1450 onwards, controlled trade in salt and hunting dogs from the eastern Makgadikgadi pans, around which it built stone- walled command posts.&quot;|Neil Parsons|Brief History of Botswana&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thuto.org/ubh/bw/bhp1.htm Brief History of Botswana]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Bechuanaland Protectorate==
{{main|Bechuanaland Protectorate}}
[[Image:Kapstaaten 1905.png|thumb|300px|right|German map in use in 1905 still showing the undivided Bechuanaland area]]
[[Image:British bechuanaland 1887.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A map of 1887 showing the Protectorate and British Bechuanaland]]
[[Image:Botswana Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Modern Botswana. The country's borders have been stable since independence in 1966]]
In the late 19th century, hostilities broke out between the [[Shona people|Shona]] inhabitants of Botswana and [[Ndebele people|Ndebele]] tribes who were migrating into the territory from the [[Kalahari Desert]]. Tensions also escalated with the [[Boer]] settlers from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. After appeals by the Batswana leaders [[Khama III]], Bathoen and Sebele for assistance, the British Government on 31 March 1885 put &quot;[[Bechuanaland]]&quot; under its protection. The northern territory remained under direct administration as the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] and is today's Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the [[Cape Colony]] and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa; the majority of [[Setswana]]-speaking people today live in South Africa. The [[Tati Concessions Land]], formerly part of the [[Matabele kingdom]], was administered from the Bechuanaland Protectorate after 1893, to which it was formally [[annexation|annexed]] in 1911.

When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]), and [[Swaziland]] (the &quot;High Commission Territories&quot;) were not included, but provision was made for
their later incorporation. However, a vague undertaking was given to consult their inhabitants, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, Britain kept delaying, and it never occurred. The election of the
National Party government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa.   

An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils representing Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regularized tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.

==Independent Botswana==
In June 1964, Britain accepted proposals for democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved from [[Mafeking|Mafikeng]] in South Africa, to newly established [[Gaborone]] in 1965. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966. [[Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the [[Bamangwato|Ngwato]] chiefship, was elected as the first president, re-elected twice, and died in office in 1980. The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, [[Ketumile Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in his own right in 1999
and re-elected in 2004. In April 2008, Vice President Lt. Gen. Seretse Khama Ian Khama ([[Ian Khama]]), son of Seretse Khama the first president, succeeded to the presidency when Festus Mogae retired.

'''[[Botswana]]''' is a landlocked country located in Southern [[Africa]], north of [[South Africa]].  [[Botswana]] occupies an area of 600,370 square kilometres, of which 585,000&amp;nbsp;km² are land.  Botswana has land boundaries of combined length 4,013 kilometres, of which the constituent boundaries are shared with [[Namibia]], for 1,360&amp;nbsp;km; [[South Africa]] 1,840&amp;nbsp;km; [[Zimbabwe]], 813&amp;nbsp;km and [[Zambia]], less than 1&amp;nbsp;km.  Much of the population of Botswana is concentrated in the eastern part of the country.

|1}}. Sunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;General Survey of Climatology, Landsberg (ed.),Elsevier, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orography===
The land is predominantly flat to gently undulating [[tableland]], although there is some hilly country, where mining is carried out. The [[Kalahari Desert]] is in the central and the southwest.  The [[Okavango Delta]], the world's largest inland delta, is in the northwest and the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]], a large [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pan]] lies in the north-central area.  The Makgadikgadi has been established as an early habitation area for primitive man; This large seasonal [[wetland]] is composed of several large component pans, the largest being [[Nwetwe Pan]], [[Sua Pan]] and [[Nxai Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=22373&amp;mode=&amp;order=0 ''Makgadikgadi'', Megalithic Portal, ed. A.Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt; Botswana's lowest elevation point is at the junction of the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and Shashe Rivers, at a height of 513 m.  The highest point is [[Monalanong Hill]], at 1,494 m.
The country is divided into four drainage regions, which are sometimes indistinct due to the arid nature of the climate:
* the [[Chobe River]] on the border with the [[Caprivi Strip]] of Namibia together with a small adjacent swampy area is part of the [[Zambezi]] basin;
* most of the north and central region of the country is part of the [[Okavango]] inland drainage basin;
* the easternmost part of the country falls into the [[Limpopo]] drainage basin;
* the southern and southwestern regions, which are the driest of all, are drained by the Molopo river along the South African border and the [[Nossob River|Nossob river]] through the [[Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park|Kalahari Gemsbok National Park]], and are technically part of the basin of the [[Orange river]]. None of these rivers normally flows as far as the Orange, however. (The last recorded confluence was in the 1880s.)&lt;ref&gt;Times Comprehensive Atlas, (2007), Times Books, London&lt;/ref&gt;
Except for the Chobe, Okavango, [[Boteti]] and [[Limpopo river]]s, most of Botswana's rivers cease to flow during the dry and early rainy seasons.

===Natural hazards===
Botswana is affected by periodic droughts, and seasonal August winds blow from the west, carrying sand and dust, which can obscure visibility.

==Environment==

Current environmental issues in Botswana are overgrazing, desertification and the existence of only limited fresh water resources.

Research from the [[University of Botswana]] has found that the common practice of [[Grazing#Disadvantages|overstocking cattle]] to cope with drought losses actually depletes scarce [[biomass]], making ecosystems more vulnerable. The study of the Kgatleng district predicts that by 2050 the cycle of mild drought is likely to become shorter —18 months instead of two years—due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/sub-suharan-africa/news/sub-saharan-africa-news-in-brief-10-22-april-2008.html Sub-Saharan Africa news in brief: 10–22 April 2008 - SciDev.Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===International agreements===
Botswana is a party to the following international agreements:  Diamond Industry, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection and Wetlands.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Botswana]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point - the [[tripoint]] with [[Zambia]] and [[Namibia]], [[Ngamiland District]]
* Eastern-most point - the [[tripoint]] with [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]], [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]]
* Southern-most point - [[Bokspits]], [[Kgalagadi District]]
* Western-most point - the western section of the border with [[Namibia]]*

* ''Note: Botswana does not have a western-most point as the western section is formed by the 22° longitude''

{{Politics of Botswana}}
'''Politics of Botswana''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Botswana]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Parliament of Botswana]]. Since independence the party system has been dominated by the [[Botswana Democratic Party]] (BDP), which has never lost power since independence. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

[[Botswana]] is formally a multiparty constitutional democracy. Each of the elections since independence in September 1966 has been freely and fairly contested and has been held on schedule. The country's small white minority and other minorities participate freely in the political process. There are two main rival parties and a number of smaller parties. Some argue that the openness of the country's political system has been a significant factor in Botswana's stability and economic growth. General elections are held at least every 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1830.htm Background Note: Botswana]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative branch==
The National Assembly has 57 elected and 4 appointed members [http://www.bartleby.com/151/fields/59.html]; it is expanded following each census (every 10 years). Parliament elects the state president.

There are 57 [[Parliamentary constituencies of Botswana|parliamentary constituencies]] in Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.bw/pgcontent.php?UID=615|title=Constituencies|publisher=Parliament of Botswana|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advisory House of Chiefs represents the eight principal subgroups of the [[Batswana]] people, and four other members are elected by the subchiefs of four of the districts. A draft of any National Assembly bill of tribal concern must be referred to the House of Chiefs for advisory opinion. Chiefs and other leaders preside over customary, traditional courts, though all persons have the right to request that their case be considered under the formal British-based legal system.

A possible cultural explanation for Botswana's democracy lies in [[Setswana]] traditions, exemplified by the [[Kgotla]], or village council, in which the powers of traditional leaders are limited by custom and law.

==Current Cabinet==
Botswana's cabinet is headed by the President, who is also head of government.

==Local government==

Local government is administered by nine district councils and five town councils. District commissioners have executive authority and are appointed by the central government and assisted by elected and nominated district councilors and district development committees. There has been ongoing debate about the political, social, and economic marginalization of the [[Bushmen|San]] (indigenous tribal population). The government's policies for remote area dwellers continue to spark controversy and may be revised in response to domestic and donor concerns.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Since independence, [[Botswana]] has had the highest average economic growth rate in the world, averaging about 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Growth in private sector employment has averaged about 10% per annum over the first 30 years of independence. The relatively high quality of the country's statistics means that these figures are likely to be quite accurate. The government has consistently maintained budget surpluses and has extensive [[foreign exchange reserves]].

Botswana's impressive economic record has been built on a foundation of diamond mining, prudent fiscal policies, international financial and technical assistance, and a cautious foreign policy. It is rated the least corrupt country in Africa, according to an international corruption watchdog, [[Transparency International]]. By one estimate, it has the fourth highest [[gross national income]] at [[purchasing power parity]] in Africa, giving it a standard of living around that of [[Mexico]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/GNI_PPP_of_countries.htm GNI PPP table]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trade unions in Botswana|Trade unions]] represent a minority of workers in the Botswana economy. In general they are loosely organized &quot;in-house&quot; unions, although the [[Botswana Federation of Trade Unions]] (BFTU) is consolidating its role as the sole [[national trade union centre]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Overview==
[[Agriculture]] still provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs and accounts for only 3% of GDP. [[subsistence agriculture|Subsistence farming]] and cattle raising predominate. The sector is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. [[Tourism]] is also important to the economy. Substantial [[mineral]] deposits were found in the 1970s and the mining sector grew from 25% of GDP in 1980 to 38% in 1998. Unemployment officially is 21% but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. The Orapa 2000 project doubled the capacity of the country's main [[diamond mine]] from early 2000. This will be the main force behind continued economic expansion. 

Economic growth slowed in 2007-2008, then turned negative in 2009, contracting by 5.2%. This was due in part to a major resession in the industrial sector, which shrank by 30%,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; and contrasts with most other African nations who experienced continued growth through this period.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2003rank.html, see also [[:File:GDP Real Growth.svg]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of Botswana's budget deficits can be traced to relatively high military expenditures (about 4% of GDP in 2004, according to the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]''). Some critics contend this is unnecessary, given the low likelihood of international conflict, but these troops are also used for multilateral operations and assistance efforts.

== Trade ==
Botswana is part of the Southern African Customs Union ([[SACU]]) with South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Namibia. The [[World Bank]] reports that in 2001 (the most recent year for which World Bank data are available), the SACU had a weighted average common external tariff rate of 3.6 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, &quot;There are very few tariff or non-tariff barriers to trade with Botswana, apart from restrictions on licensing for some business operations, which are reserved for [Botswana] companies.&quot; Based on the revised trade factor methodology, Botswana's trade policy score is unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/country.cfm?id=Botswana Botswana and WTO]&lt;/ref&gt;
The main export of Botswana is diamonds. [[Jwaneng]], in Botswana, is the world's largest and richest diamond mine thus the demand of diamonds from Botswana is fairly high. The mine was discovered when termites looking for water brought grains of diamond to the surface. If the great demand of diamonds were to go into rapid decline, then the economy of Botswana would suffer greatly as they are highly dependent on this export. The diamond mine in Jwaneng provides many jobs for the unemployed in Botswana as people are needed to physically extract the diamonds, and to build the roads needed for their transport, for example. A source of foreign exchange is also introduced to the economy and it offers a potential basis for industrial development, and thus stimulates improvements within Botswana's infrastructure.

==Mining==
{{main|Mining in Botswana}}
Two large mining companies, [[Debswana]] (formed by the government and South Africa's [[De Beers]] in equal partnership) and Bamangwato Concessions, Ltd. (BCL, also with substantial government equity participation) operate in the country.

[[File:Jwaneng Open Mine.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Jwaneng diamond mine]] is the richest in the world today.]]Since the early 1980s, the country has been the world's largest producer of gem diamonds. Four large diamond mines have opened since independence. De Beers prospectors discovered diamonds in northern Botswana in the early 1970s. The first mine began production at [[Orapa diamond mine|Orapa]] in 1972, followed by the smaller mine at [[Letlhakane diamond mine|Letlhakane]]. What has become the single-richest diamond mine in the world opened in [[Jwaneng diamond mine|Jwaneng]] in 1982. In 2002, a fourth diamond mine, [[Damtshaa diamond mine|Damtshaa]], began operations.  Botswana produced a total over 30 million carats (6,000&amp;nbsp;kg) of diamonds (about 25% of worldwide production) from the three Debswana mines in 1999, and is the highest producer of diamonds by value in the world. The Orapa 2000 Expansion of the existing Orapa mine was opened in 2000. A fifth diamond mine and the first not operated by Debswana is scheduled to have begun operations in 2008 in [[Lerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=''ABN Newswire''
 |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most (70%) of Botswana's electricity is imported from South Africa's [[Eskom]]. 80% of domestic production is concentrated in one plant, [[Morupule Power Station]] near [[Palapye]], operated by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060217023857/http://www.miningweekly.co.za/min/sector/coal/?show=75117]&lt;/ref&gt; Debswana operates the nearby [[Morupule Colliery]] to supply coal to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miningweekly.co.za/min/sector/coal/?show=75117]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, the entire southern African region was hit hard by massive shortages in power, since the region works to share its power resources through the Southern African Power Pool, with most of the capacity coming from South Africa. Botswana has in turn put in place plans through governmental expansion of the Morupule power station, as well as encouraging private investment in the form of a 4,000 megawatt power station by the Canadian Greenfield company CIC Energy to become a net exporter of power to the regional pool.

BCL, which operates a copper-nickel mine at [[Selebi-Phikwe]], has had a troubled financial history but remains an important employer. The soda ash operation at Sua Pan, opened in 1991 and supported by substantial government investment, has begun making a profit following significant restructuring.

==Tourism==
{{main|Tourism in Botswana}}
[[File:Giraffe standing.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[giraffe]] in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve]][[Tourism]] is an increasingly important industry in Botswana, accounting for almost 12% of GDP. One of the world's unique ecosystems, the [[Okavango Delta]], is located in Botswana. The country offers excellent game viewing and birding both in the Delta and in the Chobe Game Reserve—home to one of the largest herds of free-ranging elephants in the world. Botswana's [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] also offers good game viewing and some of the most remote and unspoiled wilderness in southern Africa.

Tourism plays a large role in the Botswana economy.  A number of national parks and game reserves, with their abundant wildlife and wetlands, are major tourist attractions.  The wildlife, including lions, brown hyenas, cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs and antelope, were described in great detail in the best-selling book &quot;Cry of the Kalahari&quot; by Mark and Delia Owens.

The main [[safari]] destinations for tourism are [[Moremi Game Reserve]] in the [[Okavango Delta]], and [[Chobe National Park]]. Botswana is also participating in community based natural resource management projects by trying to involve villagers in tourism. One example is the village of [[Khwai]] and its Khwai Development Trust. 

Botswana was the setting for the 1980 movie ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'', although the movie was mostly filmed in South Africa.
The seventh season of the ''[[Amazing Race]]'' visited Botswana. Tourism has been stimulated by the [[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency|series of detective novels]] by [[Alexander McCall Smith]] and the American dramatisation that followed them.

==Agriculture==
More than half of Batswana (preferred address of the Botswana people) live in rural areas and are dependent on subsistence crop and livestock farming, together with money sent home by relatives in urban areas. Agriculture meets only a small portion of food needs and contributes just 2.8% to GDP—primarily through beef exports—but it remains a social and cultural touchstone. Cattle raising dominated Botswana's social and economic life before independence. The [[Botswana Meat Commission]] has a monopoly on beef production. The national herd was about 2.5 million in the mid-1990s, though the government-ordered slaughter of the entire herd in Botswana's north-west [[Kgamiland]] District in 1995 has reduced the number by at least 200,000. The slaughter was ordered to prevent the spread of &quot;cattle lung disease&quot; to other parts of the country.

Only about 0.7% of total land area is [[Arable land|arable]]. Crop production is hampered by traditional farming methods, recurrent drought, erosion, and disease. Most of the land under cultivation is in the eastern region. The principal crops for domestic use are [[sorghum]], [[Maize|corn]], and [[millet]]. Sorghum and corn production in 2004 were 32,000 tons and 10,000 tons, respectively. The sorghum and corn harvests comprise less than 10% of the annual requirement of 250,000 tons. In 2004, Botswana’s agricultural imports (primarily cereals) exceeded agricultural exports by $102.5 million. Grain
is often imported from South Africa. Smaller quantities of [[cowpeas]], [[beans]], and other pulses are also grown. The 2004 output of all these crops was about 20,000 tons; in addition, 16,000 tons of vegetables and 10,000 tons of fruit were grown.

Agricultural research has been devoted to soil conservation, grazing experiments, and developing and distributing improved strains of grain. The construction of dams and the drilling of boreholes to tap underground water are continuing government programs. In early 1990, the government changed its official agricultural policy to emphasize the production only of those foodstuffs that can be raised economically. The Arable Lands Development
Program and the Tribal Grazing Land Policy are government programs designed to help farmers in communal areas.

==Private sector development and foreign investment==
Botswana seeks to diversify its economy away from [[mineral]]s, the earnings from which have levelled off. In 1998-99, non-mineral sectors of the economy grew at 8.9%, partially offsetting a slight 4.4% decline in the minerals sector. [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign investment]] and management have been welcomed in Botswana.

External investment in Botswana has grown fitfully. In the early 1990s, two American companies, Owens Corning and H.J. [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], made major investments in production facilities in Botswana. In 1997, the St. Paul Group purchased Botswana Insurance, one of the country's leading short-term insurance providers. An American Business Council (ABC), with over 30 member companies, was inaugurated in 1995.

[[Hyundai]] operated a car assembly plant in Botswana from 1994 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.bw/economy/index.html The Government of Botswana - Economic Snapshot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tourist Resort at Kasane.jpg|thumb|right|Tourist resort at [[Kasane]]]]
Botswana seeks to further diversify its economy away from minerals, which account for a quarter of GDP, down from nearly half of GDP in the early 1990s.  Foreign investment and management are welcomed in Botswana, and as a result, financial and services sectors have increased at an exponential rate in the 2000s to replace mining as the leading industry.  Botswana abolished [[foreign exchange controls]] in 1999, has a low corporate tax rate (15%), no prohibitions on foreign ownership of companies, and a moderate inflation rate (7.6% November 2004).  The Government of Botswana is currently considering additional policies to enhance competitiveness, including a new Foreign Direct Investment Strategy, Competition Policy, Privatisation Master Plan, and National Export Development Strategy.

Botswana is known to have vast coal deposits making it possibly one of the most coal rich countries in the world. Large coal mines, massive coal fired power plants, as well as a coals to liquid plant (through the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]) to produce synthetic automotive fuel have been planned. 

With its proven record of good economic governance, Botswana was ranked as Africa's least corrupt country by [[Transparency International]] in 2004, ahead of many European and Asian countries.  The World Economic Forum rates Botswana as one of the two most economically competitive nations in Africa.  In 2004 Botswana was once again assigned &quot;A&quot; grade credit ratings by [[Moody's]] and [[Standard &amp; Poor's]]. This ranks Botswana as by far the best credit risk in Africa and puts it on par with or above many countries in central Europe, East Asia, and Latin America.

U.S. investment in Botswana remains at relatively low levels, but continues to grow. Major U.S. corporations, such as [[H.J. Heinz]] and [[AON Corporation]], are present through direct investments, while others, such as [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] and [[Remax]], are present via franchise.  The sovereign credit ratings by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's clearly indicate that, despite continued challenges such as small market size, landlocked location, and cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Botswana remains one of the best investment opportunities in the developing world.  Botswana has a 90-member American Business Council that accepts membership from American-affiliated companies.

Due to its history and geography, Botswana has long had deep ties to the economy of South Africa.  The [[Southern Africa Customs Union]] (SACU), comprising Botswana, [[Lesotho]], Swaziland, and South Africa, dates from 1910, and is the world’s oldest customs union. Namibia joined in 1990. Under this arrangement,  South Africa has collected [[Tax|levies]] from customs, sales, and excise duties for all five members, sharing out proceeds based on each countries portion of imports.  The exact formula for sharing revenues and the decision-making authority over duties—held exclusively by the Government of South Africa—became increasingly controversial, and the members renegotiated the arrangement in 2001.  The new structure has now been formally ratified and a SACU Secretariat has been established in [[Windhoek]], Namibia.  Following South Africa's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), Botswana also joined; many of the SACU duties are thus declining, making products from outside the area more competitive in Botswana. Currently the SACU countries and the U.S. are negotiating a free trade agreement. Botswana is currently also negotiating a free trade agreement with [[Mercosur]] and an Economic Partnership Agreement with the [[European Union]] as part of SADC.

[[File:Okavango11.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view over [[Okavango Delta]]]]
Gaborone is host to the headquarters of the fourteen-nation [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), a successor to the [[Southern African Development Coordination Conference]] (SADCC, established in 1980), which focused its efforts on freeing regional economic development from dependence on apartheid South Africa.  SADC embraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in 1994 and has a broad mandate to encourage growth, development, and economic integration in Southern Africa.  SADC's Trade Protocol, which was launched on 1 September 2000, calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by 2008 among the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it will give Botswana companies free access to the far larger regional market.  SADC's failure to distance itself from the [[Robert Mugabe|Mugabe]] government in Zimbabwe has diminished the number of opportunities for cooperation between the U.S. and SADC.

Botswana has successfully carried an Action Programme on the Elimination of [[Child labour in Botswana|Child Labour]], which was adopted in the period 2006-2007. [[Free the Children]] delisted Botswana as a nation harbouring child-labour facilities in 2008.

==Financial Sector==
Botswana has a growing financial sector, and the country's national stock market, the Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE), based in Gaborone, is given the responsibility to operate and regulate the equities and fixed interest securities market. Formally established in 1989, the BSE continues to be pivotal to Botswana’s financial system, and in particular the capital market, as an avenue on which government, quasi-government and the private sector can raise debt and equity capital. Although the BSE has just under 40 companies listed, it plays host to the most pre-eminent companies doing business in Botswana. These companies represent a spectrum of industries and commerce, from Banking and financial services to Wholesaling and Retailing, Tourism and Information Technology.

To date, the BSE is one of Africa’s best performing stock exchanges, averaging 24% aggregate return in the past decade. This has allowed the BSE to be the third largest stock exchange, in terms of market capitalization, in Southern Africa.

Given Botswana's lack of exchange controls, stable currency and exceptionally performing stock market, the financial sector has attracted a host of global investors seeking better returns.

Botswana's currency, the [[Botswana pula|pula]], is fully convertible and is valued against a basket of currencies heavily weighted toward the South African [[Rand (currency)|Rand]].  Profits and direct investment can be repatriated without restriction from Botswana.  The Botswana Government eliminated all exchange controls in 1999.  The Central Bank devalued the Pula by 7.5% in February 2004 in a bid to maintain export competitiveness against the real appreciation of the Pula. There was a further 12% devaluation in May 2005 and the policy of a &quot;[[Crawling peg]]&quot; was adopted.

The recently established Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) is responsible for the oversight of all non-banking financial services entities in the country. As of 2005, about 54 percent of Botswana’s population had access to formal or informal financial services, and 43 percent is banked (with access to at least one formal banking product). The overall access ratio is still low, especially in rural areas, where there are 3.8 branches and 73 ATMs per 100,000 people. Mobile banking services have just started to be offered. In recent years the government and Central Bank have undertaken serious steps to modernize the country’s payment system infrastructure. These efforts included the establishment of a code-line clearing system for the exchange of cheques and electronic funds as well as a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, including SWIFT connection. The stock exchange implemented a Central Securities Depository in 2007. Remittance Flows for Botswana amounted to USD 117 million in 2007, a figure that is higher than the total net value of official development assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/botswana/botswana-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regional Center for Southern Africa (RCSA), which implements the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) Initiative for Southern Africa (ISA), is headquartered in [[Gaborone]] as well.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2007}}

A [[fiber-optic]] telecommunications network has been completed in [[Botswana]] connecting all major population centers.

In addition to the government-owned newspaper and national [[radio]] network, there is an active, independent [[mass media|press]] (six weekly newspapers). Two privately owned radio stations began operations in 1999. At the end of July 2000, the government-owned Botswana Television (BTV) was launched, which is Botswana's first national television station. It began broadcasting with 3 hours of programming on weekdays and 5 on weekends, and offers news ([[Setswana]] and [[English language|English]]), entertainment, and [[sport]]s, with plans eventually to produce 60% of its programming locally. Foreign publications are sold without restriction in Botswana, and there are three commercial [[Internet service provider]]s. Two [[cellular phone]] providers cover most of the country.

A sparsely populated, arid country, '''[[Botswana]]''' has nonetheless managed to incorporate much of its interior into the national economy.  An &quot;inner circle&quot; [[highway]] connecting all major towns and district capitals is completely paved, and the all-weather Trans-Kalahari Highway connects the country (and, through it, [[South Africa]]'s commercially dominant [[Gauteng Province]]) to [[Walvis Bay]] in [[Namibia]].

==Railways==
{{Main|Botswana Railways}}
Botswana possesses 888&amp;nbsp;km of {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge railway, by 2002 figures, serving a number of towns and connecting the country to its neighbours.

=== Railway links to adjacent countries ===
Botswana has rail links with the neighboring countries [[Transport in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] and [[Rail transport in South Africa|South Africa]].  There is no direct connection with [[Transport in Namibia|Namibia]], but one does exist via South Africa, although an electrified railway connecting to Lüderitz, Namibia for coal traffic is/was scheduled to open in 2006.

A new rail link between Botswana and Zambia, bypassing Zimbabwe was mooted in 2005 by [[Botswana Railways]] (BR) general manager Andrew Lunga. The line was envisaged as running south-westwards from Livingstone, crossing the Zambesi, then continuing to a junction with the existing BR tracks at [[Mosetse]].  Lunga's proposal arose following the serious loss of traffic suffered by BR following the opening of the Beitbridge-Bulawayo line, after which annual BR freight tonnage fell from 1.1m per annum to about 150,000.  Zimbabwe's economic problems had worsened the situation, prejudicing free traffic flow.  The suggested line, Lunga pointed out, would provide important alternative routes linking South Africa, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaysafrica.com/newsafrican/botswanaranews.html RailwaysAfrica]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Towns served by rail ===
{{Main|Railway stations in Botswana}}

All passenger services have been suspended in Botswana, with the only remaining service being an international link to Zimbabwe from Francistown, the only railway station that is still in service. Freight trains still operate. The following stations had passenger services running from them until May 2009:

* [[Ramatlhabama]], [[South Africa]] - border with South Africa
* [[Lobatse]]
* [[Gaborone]] - national capital
* [[Palapye]] - junction for coal branch
* [[Serule]] - junction
* [[Francistown]]
* [[Ramokgwebana]] - border with [[Zimbabwe]]
* [[Palapye]] - junction
* [[Morupule]] - branch terminus
* [[Serule]] - junction
* [[Selibe Phikwe]] - branch terminus
* [[Francistown]] - junction
* [[Sowa]] - branch terminus

==Highways==
Botswana possesses 10,217&amp;nbsp;km of [[highway]], of which 5,620&amp;nbsp;km are paved.  Since 1996 estimates, there has been a significant reduction in the total length of unpaved highway in Botswana - between 1996 and 1999 total length of unpaved highway fell from 14,139&amp;nbsp;km to 4,597&amp;nbsp;km.

==Airports==
{{See|List of airports in Botswana}}
In 2004 there were an estimated 85 airports, 10 of which (as of 2005), were paved. The government-owned [[Air Botswana]] operates scheduled flights to [[Francistown]], [[Gaborone]], [[Maun]], and [[Selebi-Phikwe]]. There is international service to [[Johannesburg, South Africa]]; [[Mbabane, Swaziland]]; and [[Harare, Zimbabwe]]. A new international airport near Gaborone was opened in 1984. Air passengers arriving to and departing from Botswana during 2003 totalled about 183,000.

{{Politics of Botswana}}

[[Botswana]] has put a premium on economic and political integration in southern [[Africa]]. It has sought to make [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] a working vehicle for economic development, and it has promoted efforts to make the region [[self-policing]] in terms of preventative diplomacy, conflict resolution, and good governance. It has welcomed post-apartheid [[South Africa]] as a partner in these efforts. Botswana joins the African consensus on most major international matters and is a member of international organizations such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[African Union]]. Botswana is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).

Botswana has a small number of [[Botswana diplomatic missions|diplomatic missions]] abroad.

==Bilateral Relations==

===Guinea-Bissau===
{{see also|Foreign relations of Guinea-Bissau}}

Botswana and [[Guinea-Bissau]] established diplomatic relations on 22 March 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.bw&quot;&gt;[http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20100330&amp;i=Botswana_establishes_relations_with_Samoa_Guinea_Bissau &quot;Botswana establishes relations with Samoa, Guinea Bissau&quot;] 30 March 2010 Link retrieved 01 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namibia===

{{main|Botswana–Namibia relations}}
Botswana–Namibia relations are friendly, with the two neighbouring countries cooperating on economic development. [[Botswana]] gained independence from Britain in September 1966. [[Namibia]] gained independence from South Africa in 1990 following the [[Namibian War of Independence]]. Botswana has a high commission in [[Windhoek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Russia===
{{Infobox Bilateral relations|Botswana–Russia|Botswana|Russia}}
{{main|Botswana–Russia relations}}

Botswana and the [[Soviet Union]] initiated diplomatic relations on March 6, 1970. Despite its pro-Western orientation, Botswana [[Botswana at the 1980 Summer Olympics|participated]] in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. The present-day relations between the two countries are described as friendly and long standing. In March, the two countries also celebrated the 35th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations. According to the minister of Foreign Affairs, Russia was one of the first countries to establish full diplomatic relations with Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswana.mid.ru/articles_relations_e_09.html WE MUST EXPLOIT RUSSIA’S POTENTIAL]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade and economic cooperation between Russia and Botswana are stipulated by the Trade Agreement of 1987 and the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation of 1988. The Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Botswana signed the Agreement on Cultural, Scientific and Educational Cooperation in September 1999. Russia and Botswana have had fruitful cooperation in a variety of fields, particularly in human resource development. And Russia is still offering more scholarship in key sectors such as health, which is currently experiencing a critical shortage of manpower. Botswana also is one of the countries where Russian citizens do not require a visa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswana.mid.ru/relations_e.html Botswana-Russia relations]&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has an embassy in [[Gaborone]], while Botswana covers Russia from its embassy in [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]) and an honorary consulate in [[Moscow]].

===Samoa===

The United States considers Botswana an advocate of and a model for stability in [[Africa]] and has been a major partner in Botswana's development since its independence. The U.S. [[Peace Corps]] returned to Botswana in August 2002 with a focus on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]-related programs after concluding 30 years of more broadly targeted assistance in 1997. Similarly, the [[USAID]] phased out a long-standing bilateral partnership with Botswana in 1996, after successful programs emphasizing education, training, [[entrepreneurship]], environmental management, and [[reproductive health]]. Botswana, however, continues to benefit along with its neighbours in the region from USAID's Initiative for Southern Africa, now based in [[Pretoria]], and USAID's Southern Africa Global Competitiveness Hub, head-quartered in [[Gaborone]]. The United States International Board of Broadcasters (IBB) operates a major [[Voice of America]] (VOA) relay station in Botswana serving most of the African continent.

In 1995, the [[Centres for Disease Control]] (CDC) started the BOTUSA Project in collaboration with the Botswana Ministry of Health in order to generate information to improve [[tuberculosis]] control efforts in Botswana and elsewhere in the face of the TB and HIV/AIDS co-epidemics. Under the 1999 U.S. Government's Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) Initiative, CDC through the BOTUSA Project has undertaken many projects and has assisted many organizations in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Botswana. Botswana is one of the 15 focus countries for PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, and has received more than $230 million since the program began in January 2004 through September 2007. PEPFAR assistance to Botswana, which totalled $76.2 million in FY 2007, is contributing to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care interventions.

The Governments of Botswana and the United States entered into an agreement in July 2000 to establish an International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in [[Gaborone]]. The academy, jointly financed, managed and staffed by the two nations, provides training to [[police]] and government officials from across the Sub-Saharan region. The academy's permanent campus, in [[Otse]] outside of Gaborone, opened March 2003. Over 3,000 law enforcement professionals from Sub-Saharan Africa have received training from ILEA since it began offering classes in 2001.

====Principal U.S. Officials====
* Ambassador—Stephen J. Nolan
* Deputy Chief of Mission—Philip R. Drouin
* Office of Security Cooperation (previously Defence Cooperation)--LTC William M. Wyatt
* Centres for Disease Control—Dr. Margarett Davis
* International Board of Broadcasters—George Miller
* International Law Enforcement Agency—Stan Moran
* Peace Corps—Peggy McClure

==== Diplomatic missions ====
The U.S. Embassy is in Gaborone. OSC (previously ODC)is located at the embassy. CDC is located on Ditlhakore Way in Gaborone. ILEA is located in Otse, about 30 minutes outside of Gaborone. The IBB station is located in [[Selebi-Phikwe]], about 400 kilometres north-east of Gaborone.

===Zambia===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Zimbabwe===
Botswana still struggles to seal its border from thousands of Zimbabweans who flee economic collapse and political persecution. Due to Mugabe's policy toward [[White Africans]], Botswana (along with the [[Czech Republic]]), closed its embassy in [[Harare]].

The country of '''[[Brazil]]''' occupies roughly half of [[South America]], bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Brazil]] covers a total area of {{convert|8514215|km2|abbr=on}} which includes {{convert|8456510|km2|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|55455|km2|abbr=on}} of water. The highest point in [[Brazil]] is [[Pico da Neblina]] at {{convert|2994|m|abbr=on}}. [[Brazil]] is bordered by the countries of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guyana]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]]. Brazil is larger in land mass than the [[Contiguous United States]].

Much of the [[climate]] is tropical, with the south being relatively [[temperate]]. The largest river in Brazil, and one of the longest in the world, is the [[Amazon river|Amazon]]. The [[rainforest]] that covers the [[Amazon Basin]] constitutes almost half of the rainforests on Earth.

==Size and location==

With its expansive territory, Brazil occupies most of the eastern part of the [[South America|South American continent]] and its geographic heartland, as well as various islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The only countries in the world that are larger are [[Russia]], [[Canada]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and the [[United States]] (including [[Alaska]]). The national territory extends {{convert|4395|km|mi|0|spell=us}} from north to south (5°16'20&quot; N to 33°44'32&quot; S latitude) and {{convert|4319|km|mi|0|spell=us}} from east to west (34°47'30&quot; W to 73°59'32&quot; W longitude). It spans three [[time zone]]s, the westernmost of which is one hour ahead of [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] in the United States. The [[Time in Brazil|time zone of the capital (Brasília)]] and of the most populated part of Brazil along the east coast ([[UTC-3]]) is two hours ahead of [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]], except when it is on its own [[daylight saving time]], from October to February. The Atlantic islands are in the easternmost time zone.

Brazil possesses the archipelago of [[Fernando de Noronha]], located {{convert|350|km|mi|0|spell=us}} northeast of its &quot;horn&quot;, and several small islands and atolls in the Atlantic - [[Abrolhos Marine National Park|Abrolhos]], [[Atol das Rocas]], [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks|Penedos de São Pedro e São Paulo]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Trindade]], and [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Martim Vaz]]. In the early 1970s, Brazil claimed a territorial sea extending {{convert|362|km|m|0|spell=us}} from the country's shores, including those of the islands.

On Brazil's east coast, the Atlantic coastline extends {{convert|7367|km|mi|0|spell=us}}. In the west, in clockwise order from the south, Brazil has {{convert|15719|km|mi|0|spell=us}} of borders with Uruguay, [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]]. The only South American countries with which Brazil does not share borders are [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]]. A few short sections are in question, but there are no true major boundary controversies with any of the neighboring countries.

It has within it five eco-systems, the tropical rainforest, the pantanal, the cerrado, the mata atlantica and the pampasn and surrounding areas.

== Geology, geomorphology and drainage ==

In contrast to the [[Andes]], which rose to elevations of nearly {{convert|7000|m|ft|0|spell=us}} in a relatively recent epoch and inverted the Amazon's direction of flow from westward to eastward, Brazil's geological formation is very old. [[Precambrian]] crystalline shields cover 36% of the territory, especially its central area. The principal mountain ranges average elevations just under {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|spell=us}}. The [[Serra do Mar]] Range hugs the Atlantic coast, and the [[Serra do Espinhaço]] Range, the largest in area, extends through the south-central part of the country. The highest mountains are in the Tumucumaque, [[Pacaraima]], and Imeri ranges, among others, which traverse the northern border with the Guianas and Venezuela.

In addition to mountain ranges (about 0.5% of the country is above {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=/}}), Brazil's Central Highlands include a vast central plateau ([[Planalto Central]]). The plateau's uneven terrain has an average elevation of {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|spell=us}}. The rest of the territory is made up primarily of sedimentary basins, the largest of which is drained by the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and its tributaries. Of the total territory, 41% averages less than {{convert|200|m|ft|0|spell=us}} in elevation. The coastal zone is noted for thousands of kilometers of tropical beaches interspersed with [[mangrove]]s, [[lagoon]]s, and [[dune]]s, as well as numerous [[coral reef]]s.

[[Image:Brazil topo.jpg|thumb|250px|Topographic map of Brazil]]

Brazil has one of the world's most extensive [[river system]]s, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Two of these basins—the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] and Tocantins-Araguaia account for more than half the total drainage area. The largest river system in Brazil is the Amazon, which originates in the Andes and receives tributaries from a basin that covers 45.7% of the country, principally the north and west. The main Amazon river system is the Amazonas-Solimões-Ucayali axis (the {{convert|6762|km|mi|0|sing=on|spell=us}}-long Ucayali is a Peruvian tributary), flowing from west to east. Through the Amazon Basin flows one-fifth of the world's fresh water. A total of {{convert|3615|km|mi|0|spell=us}} of the Amazon are in Brazilian territory. Over this distance, the waters decline only about {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|spell=us}}. The major tributaries on the southern side are, from west to east, the Javari, Juruá, Purus (all three of which flow into the western section of the Amazon called the [[Solimões]]), [[Madeira River|Madeira]], [[Tapajós]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]], and [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]]. On the northern side, the largest tributaries are the [[Branco River|Branco]], [[Japurá River|Japurá]], [[Jari River|Jari]], and [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]]. The above-mentioned tributaries carry more water than the Mississippi (its discharge is less than one-tenth that of the Amazon). The Amazon and some of its tributaries, called &quot;white&quot; rivers, bear rich sediments and hydrobiological elements. The black-white and clear rivers—such as the Negro, Tapajós, and Xingu—have clear (greenish) or dark water with few nutrients and little sediment.

The major river system in the Northeast is the [[São Francisco River|Rio São Francisco]], which flows {{convert|1609|km|mi|0|spell=us}} northeast from the south-central region. Its basin covers 7.6% of the national territory. Only {{convert|277|km|mi|0|spell=us}} of the lower river are navigable for oceangoing ships. The [[Paraná River|Paraná]] system covers 14.5% of the country. The Paraná flows south among the [[Río de la Plata Basin]], reaching the Atlantic between Argentina and Uruguay. The headwaters of the Paraguai, the Paraná's major eastern tributary, constitute the [[Pantanal]], the largest contiguous wetlands in the world, covering as much as {{convert|230000|km2|sqmi|-3|spell=us}}.

Below their descent from the highlands, many of the tributaries of the Amazon are navigable. Upstream, they generally have [[rapid]]s or [[waterfall]]s, and boats and barges also must face sandbars, trees, and other obstacles. Nevertheless, the Amazon is navigable by oceangoing vessels as far as {{convert|3885|km|mi|0|spell=us}} upstream, reaching [[Iquitos]] in [[Peru]]. The Amazon river system was the principal means of access until new roads became more important hydroelectric projects are [[Itaipu]], in Paraná, with 12,600 MW; Tucuruí, in [[Pará]], with 7,746 MW; and [[Paulo Afonso]], in [[Bahia]], with 3,986 MW.

=== Natural resources ===
[[Natural resources]] include: [[bauxite]], [[gold]], [[iron]] [[ore]], [[manganese]], [[nickel]], [[phosphates]], [[platinum]], [[tin]], [[uranium]], [[petroleum]], [[hydropower]] and [[timber]].

== Rivers and lakes ==

[[Image:Brasil Bacias hidrograficas.svg|thumb|250px|Main Hydrographic Regions of Brazil]]

According to organs of the Brazilian government there are 12 major hydrographic regions in Brazil. Seven of these are river basins named after their main rivers; the other five are groupings of various river basins in areas which have no dominant river.

*7 Hydrographic Regions named after their dominant rivers:
** [[Amazon Basin|Amazonas]]
** [[Paraguay River|Paraguai]]
** [[Parana River|Paraná]]
** [[Parnaiba River|Parnaíba]]
** [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]]
** [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]]
** [[Uruguay River|Uruguai]]

*5 coastal Hydrographic Regions based on regional groupings of minor river basins (listed from north to south):
** Atlântico Nordeste Ocidental (Western North-east Atlantic)
** Atlântico Nordeste Oriental (Eastern North-east Atlantic)
** Atlântico Leste (Eastern Atlantic)
** Atlântico Sudeste (South-east Atlantic)
** Atlântico Sul (South Atlantic)

The [[Amazon River]] is the widest and second longest river (behind the Nile) in the world. This huge river drains the greater part of the world's rainforests. Another major river, the Paraná, has its source in Brazil. It forms the border of Paraguay and Argentina, then winds its way through Argentina and into the Atlantic Ocean, along the southern coast of Uruguay. The [[HBV hydrology model|HBV]] [[hydrology transport model]] has been used to analyze certain pollutant transport in Brazil's river systems.
The Amazon is full of eroded soil.

== Soils and vegetation ==

[[Image:Amazon.A2002182.1405.1km.jpg|thumb|250px|The Amazon Rainforest]]

Brazil's tropical soils produce 70 million tons of grain crops per year, but this output is attributed more to their extension than their fertility. Despite the earliest Portuguese explorers' reports that the land was exceptionally fertile and that anything planted grew well, the record in terms of sustained [[agriculture|agricultural]] productivity has been generally disappointing. High initial fertility after clearing and burning usually is depleted rapidly, and acidity and aluminum content are often high. Together with the rapid growth of [[weed]]s and pests in cultivated areas, as a result of high temperatures and humidity, this loss of fertility explains the westward movement of the agricultural frontier and slash-and-burn agriculture; it takes less investment in work or money to clear new land than to continue cultivating the same land. Burning also is used traditionally to remove tall, dry, and nutrient-poor grass from pasture at the end of the dry season. Until mechanization and the use of chemical and genetic inputs increased during the agricultural intensification period of the 1970s and 1980s, [[coffee]] planting and farming in general moved constantly onward to new lands in the west and north. This pattern of horizontal or extensive expansion maintained low levels of technology and productivity and placed emphasis on quantity rather than quality of agricultural production.

The largest areas of fertile soils, called terra roxa (red earth), are found in the states of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and [[São Paulo]]. The least fertile areas are in the Amazon, where the dense [[rain forest]] is. Soils in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] are often fertile, but they lack water, unless they are [[irrigation|irrigated]] artificially.

In the 1980s, investments made possible the use of irrigation, especially in the Northeast Region and in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] State, which had shifted from grazing to [[soy]] and [[rice]] production in the 1970s. [[Savanna]] soils also were made usable for soybean farming through acidity correction, [[fertilization]], [[plant breeding]], and in some cases spray irrigation. As agriculture underwent modernization in the 1970s and 1980s, soil fertility became less important for agricultural production than factors related to capital investment, such as infrastructure, mechanization, use of chemical inputs, breeding, and proximity to markets. Consequently, the vigor of frontier expansion weakened.

The variety of climates, soils, and drainage conditions in Brazil is reflected in the range of its vegetation types. The Amazon Basin and the areas of heavy rainfall along the Atlantic coast have tropical rain forest composed of [[broadleaf]] evergreen trees. The rain forest may contain as many as 3,000 [[species]] of [[flora]] and [[fauna]] within a {{convert|2.6|km2|sqmi|0|spell=us|sing=on}} area. The Atlantic Forest is reputed to have even greater biological diversity than the Amazon rain forest, which, despite apparent homogeneity, contains many types of vegetation, from high canopy forest to bamboo groves.

In the semiarid Northeast, [[Caatinga]] , a dry, thick, thorny vegetation, predominates. Most of central Brazil is covered with a woodland savanna, known as the [[Cerrado]] (sparse scrub trees and drought-resistant grasses), which became an area of agricultural development after the mid-1970s. In the [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]] (Sul), needle-leaved [[pinewood]]s (Paraná pine or [[araucaria]]) cover the highlands; grassland similar to the Argentine [[pampa]] covers the sea-level plains. The Mato Grosso [[swampland]]s ([[Pantanal]] Mato-grossense) is a [[Florida]]-sized plain in the western portion of the Center-West (Centro-Oeste). It is covered with tall [[grass]]es, [[Woody plant|bush]]es, and widely dispersed trees similar to those of the cerrado and is partly submerged during the rainy season.

Brazil, which is named after reddish dyewood ([[pau brasil]]), has long been famous for the wealth of its tropical forests. These are not, however, as important to world markets as those of Asia and Africa, which started to reach depletion only in the 1980s. By 1996 more than 90% of the original Atlantic forest had been cleared, primarily for agriculture, with little use made of the wood, except for araucaria pine in Paraná.

The inverse situation existed with regard to clearing for wood in the Amazon rain forest, of which about 15% had been cleared by 1994, and part of the remainder had been disturbed by selective logging. Because the Amazon forest is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of woody species per [[hectare]], there is considerable distance between individual trees of economic value, such as [[mahogany]] and cerejeira. Therefore, this type of forest is not normally cleared for timber extraction but logged through high-grading, or selection of the most valuable trees. Because of vines, felling, and transportation, their removal causes destruction of many other trees, and the litter and new growth create a risk of [[forest fire]]s, which are otherwise rare in [[rain forest]]s. In favorable locations, such as Paragominas, in the northeastern part of [[Pará]] State, a new pattern of timber extraction has emerged: diversification and the production of [[plywood]] have led to the economic use of more than 100 tree species.

Starting in the late 1980s, rapid deforestation and extensive burning in Brazil received considerable international and national attention. [[Satellite image]]s have helped document and quantify deforestation as well as fires, but their use also has generated considerable controversy because of problems of defining original vegetation, cloud cover, and dealing with secondary growth and because fires, as mentioned above, may occur in old pasture rather than signifying new clearing. Public policies intended to promote sustainable management of timber extraction, as well as sustainable use of nontimber forest products (such as rubber, [[Brazil nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[seed]]s, [[vegetable oil|oils]], and [[vine]]s), were being discussed intensely in the mid-1990s. However, implementing the principles of sustainable development, without irreversible damage to the environment, proved to be more challenging than establishing international agreements about them.

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Brazil}}

Although 90% of the country is within the [[tropical zone]], the climate of Brazil varies considerably from the mostly tropical North (the [[equator]] traverses the mouth of the Amazon) to [[temperate zone]]s below the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (23°27' S latitude), which crosses the country at the latitude of the city of [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]]. Brazil has five climatic regions: [[equatorial]], tropical, [[semiarid]], [[tropical|highland tropical]], and [[subtropical]].

Temperatures along the equator are high, averaging above {{convert|25|C|F|0}}, but not reaching the summer extremes of up to {{convert|40|C|F|0}} in the temperate zones. There is little seasonal variation near the equator, although at times it can get cool enough for wearing a jacket, especially in the rain. At the country's other extreme, there are frosts south of the Tropic of Capricorn during the winter (June–August), and there is snow in the mountainous areas, such as [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. Temperatures in the cities of São Paulo, [[Belo Horizonte]], and [[Brasília]] are moderate (usually between {{convert|15|and|30|C|F|0|disp=/}}), despite their relatively low latitude, because of their elevation of approximately {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|spell=us}}. [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], Recife, and Salvador on the coast have warm climates, with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|23|to|27|C|F|1}}, but enjoy constant trade winds. The southern cities of [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Curitiba]] have a subtropical climate similar to that in parts of the United States and Europe, and temperatures can fall below freezing in winter.

Precipitation levels vary widely. Most of Brazil has moderate [[rainfall]] of between {{convert|1000|and|1500|mm|in|1}} a year, with most of the rain falling in the summer (between December and April) south of the Equator. The [[Amazon region]] is notoriously humid, with rainfall generally more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|1}} per year and reaching as high as {{convert|3000|mm|in|1}} in parts of the western Amazon and near Belém. It is less widely known that, despite high annual precipitation, the Amazon rain forest has a three- to five-month dry season, the timing of which varies according to location north or south of the equator.

High and relatively regular levels of precipitation in the Amazon contrast sharply with the dryness of the semiarid Northeast, where rainfall is scarce and there are severe droughts in cycles averaging seven years. The [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] is the driest part of the country. The region also constitutes the hottest part of Brazil, where during the dry season between May and November, temperatures of more than {{convert|38|C|F|0}} have been recorded. However, the [[sertão]], a region of [[desert|semidesert vegetation]] used primarily for low-density ranching, turns green when there is rain. Most of the Center-West has {{convert|1500|to|2000|mm|in|1}} of rain per year, with a pronounced dry season in the middle of the year, while the South and most of the year without a distinct dry season.

[[Image:Brazil States.svg|thumb|250px|right|The Brazilian states.]]

Brazil's 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and the [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]] (Distrito Federal) are divided conventionally into five regions: [[North Region, Brazil|North]] (Norte), Northeast (Nordeste), [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] (Sudeste), [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]] (Sul), and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] (Centro-Oeste) - see fig. 4. In 1996 there were 5,581 [[municipal]]ities (municípios), which have municipal governments. Many municipalities, which are comparable to United States counties, are in turn divided into [[district]]s (distritos), which do not have [[political]] or [[administrative]] [[autonomy]]. In 1995 there were 9,274 districts. All municipal and district seats, regardless of size, are considered officially to be urban. For purely statistical purposes, the municipalities were grouped in 1990 into 559 micro-regions, which in turn constituted 136 meso-regions. This grouping modified the previous micro-regional division established in 1968, a division that was used to present census data for 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.

Each of the five major regions has a distinct [[ecosystem]]. Administrative boundaries do not necessarily coincide with ecological boundaries, however. In addition to differences in [[physical environment]], patterns of [[economic activity]] and population settlement vary widely among the regions. The principal ecological characteristics of each of the five major regions, as well as their principal socioeconomic and demographic features, are summarized below.

=== Centerwest ===
{{Main|Center-West Region, Brazil}}

The Center-West consists of the states of Goiás, [[Mato Grosso]], and [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] (separated from Mato Grosso in 1979), as well as the [[Federal District]], site of [[Brasília]], the national capital. Until 1988 Goiás State included the area that then became the state of Tocantins in the North.

The Center-West has {{convert|1612077|km2|sqmi|0|spell=us}} and covers 18.9% of the national territory. Its main biome is the [[cerrado]], the tropical savanna in which natural grassland is partly covered with twisted shrubs and small trees. The cerrado was used for low-density cattle-raising in the past but is now also used for soybean production. There are [[gallery forest]]s along the rivers and streams and some larger areas of forest, most of which have been cleared for [[farming]] and [[livestock]]. In the north, the cerrado blends into tropical forest. It also includes the [[Pantanal]] [[wetland]]s in the west, known for their wildlife, especially aquatic birds and [[cayman]]s. In the early 1980s, 33.6% of the region had been altered by anthropic activities, with a low of 9.3% in Mato Grosso and a high of 72.9% in Goiás (not including Tocantins). In 1996 the Center-West region had 10.2 million inhabitants, or 6% of Brazil's total population. The average density is low, with concentrations in and around the cities of [[Brasília]], [[Goiânia]], [[Campo Grande]], and [[Cuiabá]]. Living standards are below the national average. In 1994 they were highest in the Federal District, with per capita income of US$7,089 (the highest in the nation), and lowest in Mato Grosso, with US$2,268.

=== Northeast ===
{{Main|Northeast Region, Brazil}}

The nine states that make up the Northeast are [[Alagoas]], [[Bahia]], [[Ceará]], [[Maranhão]], [[Paraíba]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Piauí]], Rio Grande do Norte, and [[Sergipe]]. The [[Fernando de Noronha]] archipelago (formerly the federal territory of [[Fernando de Noronha]], now part of [[Pernambuco]] state) is also included in the Northeast.

The Northeast, with {{convert|1561178|km2|sqmi|0|spell=us}}, covers 18.3% of the national terrest concentration of rural population, and its living standards are the lowest in Brazil. In 1994 Piauí had the lowest per capita income in the region and the country, only US$835, while Sergipe had the highest average income in the region, with US$1,958.

=== North ===
{{Main|North Region, Brazil}}

The equatorial North, also known as the Amazon or [[Amazônia]], includes, from west to east, the states of [[Rondônia]], Acre, [[Amazonas State, Brazil|Amazonas]], [[Roraima]], [[Pará]], [[Amapá]], and, as of 1988, [[Tocantins (state)|Tocantins]] (created from the northern part of Goiás State, which is situated in the Center-West). Rondônia, previously a federal territory, became a state in 1986. The former federal territories of Roraima and Amapá were raised to statehood in 1988.

With {{convert|3869638|km2|sqmi|0|spell=us}}, the North is the country's largest region, covering 45.3% of the national territory. The region's principal [[biome]] is the humid [[tropical forest]], also known as the rain forest, home to some of the planet's richest [[biological diversity]]. The North has served as a source of forest products ranging from &quot;backlands drugs&quot; (such as [[sarsaparilla]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cinnamon]], and [[turtle|turtle butter]]) in the colonial period to rubber and [[Brazil nut]]s in more recent times. In the mid-twentieth century, nonforest products from [[mining]], [[farming]], and livestock-raising became more important, and in the 1980s the [[lumber industry]] boomed. In 1990, 6.6% of the region's territory was considered altered by anthropic (man-made) action, with state levels varying from 0.9% in Amapá to 14.0% in Rondônia.

In 1996 the North had 11.1 million inhabitants, only 7% of the national total. However, its share of Brazil's total had grown rapidly in the 1970s and early 1980s as a result of interregional migration, as well as high rates of natural increase. The largest population concentrations are in eastern Pará State and in Rondônia. The major cities are [[Belém]] and [[Santarém]] in Pará, and [[Manaus]] in Amazonas. Living standards are below the national average. The highest [[per capita income]], US$2,888, in the region in 1994, was in Amazonas, while the lowest, US$901, was in Tocantins.

=== Southeast ===
{{Main|Southeast Region, Brazil}}

The Southeast consists of the four states of [[Espírito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. Its total area of {{convert|927286|km2|sqmi|0|spell=us}} corresponds to 10.9% of the national territory. The region has the largest share of the country's population, 63 million in 1991, or 39% of the national total, primarily as a result of internal migration since the mid-19th century until the 1980s. In addition to a dense urban network, it contains the megacities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which in 1991 had 18.7 million and 11.7 million inhabitants in their metropolitan areas, respectively. The region combines the highest living standards in Brazil with pockets of urban poverty. In 1994 São Paulo boasted an average income of US$4,666, while Minas Gerais reported only US$2,833.

Originally, the principal biome in the Southeast was the Atlantic Forest, but by 1990 less than 10% of the original forest cover remained as a result of clearing for farming, ranching, and charcoal making. Anthropic activity had altered 79.5% of the region, ranging from 75% in Minas Gerais to 91.1% in Espírito Santo. The region has most of Brazil's [[industrialization|industrial production]]. The state of São Paulo alone accounts for half of the country's industries. Agriculture, also very strong, has diversified and now uses modern technology.

=== South ===
{{Main|Southern Region, Brazil}}

The three states in the temperate South: [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina—cover {{convert|577214|km2|sqmi|0|spell=us}}, or 6.8% of the national territory. The population of the South in 1991 was 23.1 million, or 14% of the country's total. The region is almost as densely settled as the Southeast, but the population is more concentrated along the coast. The major cities are [[Curitiba]] and [[Porto Alegre]]. The inhabitants of the South enjoy relatively high living standards. Because of its industry and agriculture, Paraná had the highest average income in 1994, US$3,674, while Santa Catarina, a land of small farmers and small industries, had slightly less, US$3,405.

In addition to the [[Atlantic Forest]] and [[Araucaria moist forests]], much of which were cleared in the post-World War II period, the southernmost portion of Brazil contains the [[Uruguayan savanna]], which extends into [[Argentina]] and Uruguay. In 1982, 83.5% of the region had been altered by anthropic activity, with the highest level (89.7%) in Rio Grande do Sul, and the lowest (66.7%) in Santa Catarina. [[Agriculture]]--much of which, such as [[rice]] production, is carried out by small farmers—has high levels of productivity. There are also some important industries.

==Environmental issues==
{{Main|Environment of Brazil}}

The [[environmentalism|environmental problem]] that attracted most international attention in Brazil in the 1980s was undoubtedly deforestation in the Amazon. Of all [[Latin American]] countries, Brazil still has the largest portion (66%) of its territory covered by forests, but [[clearing]] and [[burning]] in the Amazon proceeded at alarming rates in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the clearing resulted from the activities of ranchers, including large corporate operations, and a smaller portion resulted from [[slash and burn]] techniques used by small farmers. Technical changes involved in the transition from horizontal expansion of agriculture to increasing productivity also accounted for decreasing rates of deforestation.

[[Desertification]], another important environmental problem in Brazil, only received international attention following the [[United Nations]] Conference on the Environment and Development, also known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Desertification means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are severely degraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid [[caatinga]] ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the risk of becoming even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.

In areas where [[agriculture]] is more intense and developed, there are serious problems of [[soil erosion]], [[silt]]ation and [[sedimentation]] of streams and rivers, and pollution with [[pesticide]]s. In parts of the [[savanna]]s, where irrigated [[soybean]] production expanded in the 1980s, the [[water table]] has been affected. Expansion of pastures for [[cattle]] raising has reduced natural [[biodiversity]] in the savannas. Swine effluents constitute a serious environmental problem in Santa Catarina in the South.

In [[urban area]]s, at least in the largest cities, levels of [[air pollution]] and [[congestion]] are typical of, or worse than, those found in cities in [[developed countries]]. At the same time, however, basic environmental problems related to the lack of [[sanitation]], which developed countries solved long ago, persist in Brazil. These problems are sometimes worse in middle-sized and small cities than in large cities, which have more resources to deal with them. Environmental problems of cities and towns finally began to receive greater attention by society and the government in the 1990s.

According to many critics, the [[economic crisis]] in the 1980s worsened environmental degradation in Brazil because it led to [[overexploitation]] of [[natural resources]], stimulated settlement in fragile lands in both rural and urban areas, and weakened environmental protection. At the same time, however, the lower level of economic activity may have reduced pressure on the environment, such as the aforementioned decreased level of investment in large-scale clearing in the Amazon. That pressure could increase if economic growth accelerates, especially if consumption patterns remain unchanged and more sustainable forms of production are not found.

In Brazil public policies regarding the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] are generally advanced, although their implementation and the enforcement of [[environmental law]]s have been far from ideal. Laws regarding [[forest]]s, water, and [[wildlife]] have been in effect since the 1930s. Brazil achieved significant institutional advances in environmental policy design and implementation after the [[Stockholm Conference on the Environment]] in 1972. Specialized environmental agencies were organized at the federal level and in some states, and many [[national park]]s and reserves were established. By 1992 Brazil had established 34 national parks and fifty-six [[biological reserve]]s. In 1981 the National Environment Policy was defined, and the National System for the Environment (Sistema Nacional do Meio Ambiente--[[Sisnama]]) was created, with the National Environmental Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente--[[Conama]]) at its apex, municipal councils at its base, and state-level councils in between. In addition to government authorities, all of these councils include representatives of civil society.

The [[1988 constitution]] incorporates environmental precepts that are advanced compared with those of most other countries. At that time, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] (Câmara dos Deputados) established its permanent Commission for Defense of the Consumer, the Environment, and Minorities. In 1989 the creation of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis--[[Ibama]]) joined together the federal environment secretariat and the federal agencies specializing in [[forestry]], [[rubber]], and [[fisherie]]s. In 1990 the administration of [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] (president, 1990–92) appointed the well-known environmentalist [[José Lutzemberger]] as secretary of the environment and took firm positions on the environment and on [[Indian land]]s. In 1992 Brazil played a key role at the [[Earth Summit]], not only as its host but also as negotiator on sustainable development agreements, including the conventions on climate and biodiversity. The Ministry of Environment was created in late 1992, after President Collor had left office. In August 1993, it became the Ministry of Environment and the [[Legal Amazon]] and took a more pragmatic approach than had the combative Lutzemberger. However, because of turnover in its leadership, a poorly defined mandate, and lack of funds, its role and impact were limited. In 1995 its mandate and name were expanded to include water resources—the Ministry of Environment, Hydraulic Resources, and the Legal Amazon—it began a process of restructuring to meet its mandate of &quot;shared management of the sustainable use of natural resources.&quot; In 1997 the Commission on Policies for Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 began to function under the aegis of the Civil Household. One of its main tasks was to prepare Agenda 21 (a plan for the twenty-first century) for Brazil and to stimulate preparation of state and local agendas.

Institutional development at the official level was accompanied and in part stimulated by the growth, wide diffusion, and growing professional development of [[nongovernmental organization]]s ([[NGO]]s) dedicated to environmental and socio-environmental causes. The hundreds of NGOs throughout Brazil produce documents containing both useful information and passionate criticisms. Among the Brazilian environmental NGOs, the most visible are SOS Atlantic Forest ([[SOS Mata Atlântica]]), the Social-Environmental Institute (Instituto Sócio-Ambiental—ISA), the Pro-Nature Foundation (Fundação Pró-Natureza—Funatura), and the Amazon Working Group (Grupo de Trabalho Amazônico—GTA). The Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and Development and the Brazilian Association of Nongovernmental Organizations (Associacão Brasileira de Organizações Não-Governamentais—ABONG) are national networks, and there are various regional and thematic networks as well. The main international environmental NGOs that have offices or affiliates in Brazil are the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Conservation International (CI), and Nature Conservancy.

Especially after the events of the late 1980s, international organizations and developed countries have allocated significant resources for the environmental sector in Brazil. In 1992 environmental projects worth about US$6.8 million were identified, with US$2.6 in counterpart funds (funds provided by the Brazilian government). More than 70% of the total value was for sanitation, urban pollution control, and other urban environmental projects. Thus, the allocation of resources did not accord with the common belief that funding was influenced unduly by alarmist views on deforestation in the Amazon.

Among the specific environmental projects with international support, the most important was the National Environmental Plan (Plano Nacional do Meio Ambiente—PNMA), which received a US$117 million loan from the World Bank. The National Environmental Fund (Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente—FNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Proteção das Florestas Tropicais do Brasil—PPG-7) was supported by the world's seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rondônia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.

Despite favorable laws, promising institutional arrangements, and external funding, the government has not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it can be attributed to the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.

'''Environment - current issues:'''
[[deforestation]] in Amazon Basin destroys the habitat and endangers the existence of a multitude of plant and animal species indigenous to the area; air and water pollution in [[Rio de Janeiro]], São Paulo, and several other large cities; land degradation and water pollution caused by improper mining activities
&lt;br&gt;''note:''
President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|Cardoso]] in September 1999 signed into force an environmental crime bill which for the first time defines [[pollution]] and deforestation as crimes punishable by stiff fines and jail sentences

'''Environment - international agreements:'''
&lt;br&gt;''party to:''
Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-[[Kyoto Protocol]], Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling
&lt;br&gt;''signed, but not ratified:''
none of selected agreements

==Antipodes==
Parts of the Brazilian Amazon are [[antipodes|antipodal]] to large areas of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. This includes all of the [[Philippines]] apart from the northern end of [[Luzon]], antipodal to southwestern [[Pará]] and northwestern [[Mato Grosso]]; most of [[Borneo]], antipodal to northwestern [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]]; much of [[Sulawesi]], near the Guyanas (with [[Boa Vista, Roraima]] not far from [[Kalumpang, Indonesia|Kalumpang]]); and [[Halmahera]], largely coinciding with the Brazilian state of [[Amapá]]. The northernmost part of the coastal Brazil overlies half of [[Ceram Island]]. 

The small island nation of [[Palau]] is antipodal to southern [[Maranhão]] near [[Balsas, Maranhão|Balsas]], and with Micronesian atolls such as [[Yap]] near [[Remanso]], Bahia, [[Ulithi]] near [[Jaguarari]], Bahia,, and [[Woleai]] near [[Campina Grande]], Paraíba. 

The Japanese [[Okinawa Islands|Okinawa]] and [[Amami Islands]] stretch across the antipodes of [[Santa Catarina State]] in the south of Brazil, while Brazil's southernmost point partially overlaps the Korean island of [[Jejudo|Jeju]]. Numerous smaller western Pacific islands also find their antipodes in Brazil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Brazil}}
'''Politics of Brazil''' takes place in a framework of a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Brazil]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. [[Brazil]] is divided into 26 [[state (administrative division)|state]]s, one [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]] and over 5,500 [[municipality|municipalities]].

==Government of Brazil==
[[File:Senado2006.jpg|thumb|Brazilian senate.]]

The [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 constitution]] grants broad powers to the federal government, made up of [[Executive (government)|Executive]], [[Legislative]], and [[Judiciary|Judicial]] branches. The [[President of Brazil|President]] holds office for four years, with the right to re-election for an additional four-year term, and appoints his or her own cabinet.

===Legislative branch===
{{Main|National Congress of Brazil}}

The bicameral [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] (''Congresso Nacional'') consists of
# the [[Federal Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] (''Senado Federal''), which has 81 seats — three members from each state and the [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]], elected according to the principle of [[Majority rule|majority]] to serve eight-year terms. One-third are elected after a four year period, and two-thirds are elected after the next four-year period; and
# the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Câmara dos Deputados''), which has 513 seats. Federal deputies are elected by [[proportional representation]] to serve four-year terms.

There are no limits on the number of terms one may serve for either chamber. The seats are allotted proportionally to each state's population, but each state is eligible for a minimum of eight seats and a maximum of 70 seats. The result is a system weighted in favor of smaller states that are part of the Brazilian union.

15 political parties are represented in [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]].
Since it is common for politicians to switch parties, the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.(class 5) To avoid that, the [[Supreme Federal Court]] ruled in 2007 that the term belongs to the parties, and not to the representatives.
{{-}}

===Judicial branch===
{{Main|Justice in Brazil}}
Brazilian courts function under [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[adversarial system]]. The Judicial branch is organized in states' and federal systems with different jurisdictions.

The judges of the courts of first instance take office after [[public competitive examination]]. The second instance judges are promoted among the first instance judges. The Justices of the superior courts are appointed by the president for life and approved by the Senate. All the judges and justices must be graduated in law. Brazilian judges must retire at the age of 70.

====States' judicial branch====
The states are divided into [[Comarca|judicial districts]] named ''comarcas'', which are composed of one or more cities. Each ''comarca'' has at least one [[court of first instance]]. There are specialized courts of first instance for [[family litigation]] or [[bankruptcy]] in some cities and states. Judgments from these district courts can be the subject of [[Appeal#Appellate_review|judicial review]] following appeals to the [[court of second instance|courts of second instance]].

Judgments of courts of first instance are usually made by only one judge. The Brazilian judiciary system uses [[jury]] trials only for judging [[homicide|crimes against life]].

In all Brazilian states, there is one court of second instance, named the Justice Tribunal (''Tribunal de Justiça'' in Portuguese). Some states, as [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], used to have also [[Court of Appeals|Courts of Appeals]] (''Tribunal de Alçada'') too, but with different jurisdictions. The highest court of a state is the Justice Tribunal.

Second instance judgments are usually made by three judges, who, in the Justice Tribunals, are named ''desembargadores''.

====Federal judicial branch====
The national territory is divided into five Regions, which are composed of two or more states. Each region is divided in Judiciary Sections (''Seções Judiciárias'' in Portuguese), coterminous with the territory of each state, and subdivided in Judiciary Subsections (''Subseções Judiciárias''), each with a territory that may not correspond to the states' comarcas.

The Judiciary Subsections have federal courts of first instance and each Region has a Federal Regional Tribunal (''Tribunal Regional Federal'') as a court of second instance.

There are special federal court systems for [[labor litigation]]s, called Labor Justice (''Justiça do Trabalho''), for electoral matters, called Electoral Justice (''Justiça Eleitoral''), and for martial criminal cases, called Military Justice (''Justiça Militar''), each of them with its own courts.

====Superior Courts====
There are two national superior courts that grant [[writs]] of [[certiorari]] in civil and criminal cases: the Superior Justice Tribunal (''Superior Tribunal de Justiça'', STJ) and the federal [[supreme court]], called the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]] ({{lang-pt|Supremo Tribunal Federal}}).

The STJ grants a Special Appeal (''Recurso Especial'') when a judgement of a court of second instance offends a federal [[statute]] disposition or when two or more second instance courts make different rulings on the same federal statute. There are parallel courts for [[labor law]], [[electoral law]] and [[military law]].

The STF grants Extraordinary Appeals (''Recurso Extraordinário'') when judgements of second instance courts violate the constitution. The STF is the last instance for the writ of [[habeas corpus]] and for reviews of judgments from the STJ.

The superior courts do not analyze any factual questions in their judgments, but only the application of the law and the constitution. Facts and evidences are judged by the courts of second instance, except in specific cases such as writs of habeas corpus.

==Constitution==
{{Main|Constitution of Brazil}}
Brazil has had seven [[constitution]]s:
* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1824]] – the first Brazilian constitution, enacted by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]]. It was monarchic, hereditary and highly centralized, permitting the vote only to property-holders.
* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1891]] – the republic was proclaimed in 1889, but a new constitution was not promulgated until 1891. This federalist, democratic constitution was heavily influenced by the [[United States|U.S.]] model. However, women and illiterates were not permitted to vote.
* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1934]] – when [[Getúlio Vargas]] came to power in 1930, he canceled the 1891 constitution and did not permit a new one until 1934. The [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] of 1932 forced Vargas to enact a new democratic constitution that permitted women's suffrage. Getúlio Vargas was indirectly elected president by the Constitutional Assembly to a four-year term, beginning in 1933.
* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1937]] – Getúlio Vargas suppressed a Communist uprising in 1935 and two years later (November 10, 1937) used it as a pretext to establish autocratic rule. He instituted a corporatist constitution nicknamed ''the Polish,'' (because it was said to have been inspired by a Polish constitution), written by [[Francisco Campos (lawyer)|Francisco Campos]].
* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1946]] – in October, 1945, with the II World War over, a civil-military coup ousted dictatorial Getúlio Vargas, an Assembly wrote a democratic constitution.
* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1967]] – after the 1964 coup d'État against [[João Goulart]], the military dictatorship passed the ''Institutional Acts'', a supraconstitutional law. This strongly undemocratic constitution simply incorporated these Acts.
* [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1988]] – the progressive redemocratization culminated in the current constitution. Very democratic, it is more expansive than a normal constitution – many statutory acts in other countries are written into this constitution, like Social Security and taxes.

==Political parties and elections==
{{Main|List of political parties in Brazil}}

According to sociologist Marcelo Ridenti, Brazilian politics is divided between internationalistic [[liberalism|liberal]]s and [[Statism|statist]] nationalistics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr&quot;&gt;{{pt}} Barros, Ana Cláudia. [http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI4683023-EI6578,00-PT+ainda+e+esquerda+no+Brasil+analisa+sociologo.html &quot;PT ainda pode ser chamado de esquerda, afirma sociólogo&quot;]. Terra Magazine. September 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The first group consists of politicians which argue that the internationalization of the [[Brazilian economy|economy]] is essential for the development of the country, while the other group rely on [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]], and protection of [[Government-owned corporation|state enterprise]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr&quot; /&gt; According to Ridenti, which cites the [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] administration as an example of the first group and the [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] administration as an example of the second, &quot;we have it cyclically&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr&quot; /&gt;

Lula's [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] tends to the statist nationalism side, although there are [[privatization|privatizing]] forces within his party and government, while Cardoso's [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] tends to favor the international private market side by taking [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr&quot; /&gt; That is especially truth when considering that Lula compares himself with [[Getúlio Vargas]], [[Juscelino Kubitscheck]] and [[João Goulart]], presidents seen as statist nationalistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/eleicoes/2010/noticias/0,,OI4676356-EI15315,00-Lula+Os+Bornhausen+nao+podem+se+disfarcar+de+cordeiros.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2010, 13.8 million Brazilians were affiliated to a [[political party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TSE&quot;&gt;[http://www.tse.jus.br/internet/eleicoes/eleitores_filiados.htm &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; That accounts for 7.3% of the country's population and 10.2% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tse.jus.br/internet/eleicoes/evolucao_eleitorado.htm &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred parties are [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party|PMDB]] (which accounts for 16.6% of affiliated voters), the Workers' Party (10.0% of affiliated voters), and [[Progressive Party (Brazil)|PP]] (9.8% of affiliated voters).&lt;ref name=&quot;TSE&quot; /&gt;

==Political pressure groups and leaders==
The left wing of the Catholic Church, the [[Landless Workers' Movement]], and labor unions pressure the government for more intense reforms on taxation and landed property, while the rightist DEM party is critical of the government's social and economic policies.

==States and municipalities==
Brazil is divided into three types of subnational units: ''states'', ''municipalities'' and the ''Federal District''.

===States===
{{Main|States of Brazil}}
The 26 Brazilian ''states'' are semi-autonomous self-governing entities organized with complete administration branches, relative financial independence and their own set of symbols, similar to those owned by the country itself. Despite their relative autonomy they all have the same model of administration, as set by the Federal Constitution.
or '''Federative Republic made up of a Federal District in the capital city of Brasilia along with 26 states. Similar to the United States each country has its own government''' 

States hold elections every four years and exercise a considerable amount of power. The 1988 constitution allows states to keep their own taxes, and mandates regular allocation of a share of the taxes collected locally by the federal government.

The Executive role is held by the ''Governador'' (Governor) and his appointed ''Secretários'' (Secretaries); the Legislative role is held by the ''Assembléia Legislativa'' (Legislative Assembly); and the Judiciary role, by the ''Tribunal de Justiça'' (Justice Tribunal). The governors and the members of the assemblies are elected, but the members of the Judiciary are appointed by the governor from a list provided by the current members of the State Law Court containing only judges (these are chosen by merit in exams open to anyone with a Law degree). The name chosen by the governor must be approved by the Assembly before inauguration. The 1988 Constitution has granted the states the greatest amount of autonomy since the Old Republic.

Each of the 26 state governors must achieve more than 50 per cent of the vote, including a second round run-off between the top two candidates if necessary. In contrast to the federal level, state legislatures are unicameral, although the deputies are elected through similar means, involving an open-list system in which the state serves as one constituency. State level elections occur at the same time as those for the presidency and Congress. In 2002, candidates from eight different parties won the gubernatorial contest while 28 parties are represented in the country’s state legislatures. The last set of elections took place in 2006.

The most important Brazilian states (in terms of population and economic power) are [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Bahia]], [[Pernambuco]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]].

===Municipalities===
{{Main|Municipalities of Brazil}}
Brazil has no clear distinction between ''towns'' and ''cities'' (in effect, the Portuguese word ''cidade'' means both). The only possible difference is regarding the municipalities that have a court of first instance and those that do not. The former are called ''Sedes de Comarca'' (seats of a ''comarca'', which is the territory under the rule of that court). Other than that, only size and importance differs one from another.

The municipality (''município'') is a territory comprising one urban area, the ''sede'' (seat), from which it takes the name, and several other minor urban or rural areas, the ''distritos'' (districts). The seat of a municipality must be the most populous urban area within it; when another urban area grows too much it usually splits from the original municipality to form another one.

A municipality is relatively autonomous: it enacts its own &quot;constitution&quot;, which is called ''organic law'' (''Lei Orgânica''), and it is allowed to collect taxes and fees, to maintain a municipal police force (albeit with very restricted powers), to pass laws on any matter that do not contradict either the state or the national constitutions, and to create symbols for itself (like a flag, an anthem and a coat-of-arms). However, not all municipalities exercise all of this autonomy. For instance, only a few municipalities keep local police forces, some of them do not collect some taxes (to attract investors or residents) and many of them do not have a flag (although they are all required to have a coat-of-arms).

Municipalities are governed by an elected ''prefeito'' ([[Mayor]]) and a unicameral ''Câmara de Vereadores'' (Councillors' Chamber). In municipalities with more than 200,000 voters, the Mayor must be elected by more than 50% of the valid vote. The executive power is called ''Prefeitura''.

Brazilian municipalities can vary widely in area and population. The municipality of [[Altamira, Brazil|Altamira]], in the State of [[Pará]], with 161,445.9 square kilometres of area, is larger than many countries in the world. Several Brazilian municipalities have over 1,000,000 inhabitants, with São Paulo, at more than 9,000,000, being the most populous.

Until 1974 Brazil had one state-level municipality, the [[State of Guanabara]], now merged with [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|the State of Rio de Janeiro]], which comprised [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|the city of Rio de Janeiro]] solely.

===The Federal District===
{{Main|Brazilian Federal District}}
The Federal District is an anomalous unit of the federation, as it is not organized the same manner as a municipality, does not possess the same autonomy as a state (though usually ranked among them), and is closely related to the central power.

It is considered a single and indivisible entity, constituted by the seat ([[Brasilia]]) and some urban districts (the so-called ''satellite cities''). Satellite cities are ''created'' (in law) and governed directly by the Governor of the Federal District, and possess no true identity.

==History==
Throughout its history, Brazil has struggled to build a [[democracy|democratic]] and egalitarian society because its origins as a [[plantation]] colony and the strong influence of slavery.
&lt;!--Don't enlarge it too much... Leave details to the history series --&gt;

===Empire===
{{Main|Empire of Brazil}}
In 1822 the [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro de Alcântara]], son of Portuguese King, [[John VI of Portugal|D. João VI]], proclaimed the independence. He was the first Emperor (Pedro I) until his resignation in 1831 in favor of his elder son. Due to his young age (five years) a regency was established and the country had its first elections, though [[censitary vote|vote]] was still restricted to a minority of the population.

===Old Republic===
{{Main|History of Brazil (1889–1930)|Café com leite}}
In 1889, Marshal [[Deodoro da Fonseca]] declared the republic, by a [[coup d'état]]. Until 1930, Brazilian republic was formally a democracy, although the power was concentrated in the hands of powerful land owners.

===Vargas years===
{{Main|Getúlio Vargas|Estado Novo (Brazil)}}
In 1930, a bloodless [[coup d'état|coup]] led [[Getúlio Vargas]] to power. For about 15 years, he controlled the country's politics, with a brief three-year constitutional interregnum from 1934 to 1937. A longer, heavier regime, the ([[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]]) had loose ties with European [[fascism]] and spanned the years 1938 to 1945.

===Populist years===
{{Main|History of Brazil (1945–1964)}}
Like most of [[Latin America]], Brazil experienced times of political instability after the Second World War. When Vargas was ousted from the presidency in another bloodless coup d'état, in 1945, a new and modern constitution was passed and the country had its first experience with an effective and widespread democracy. But the mounting tension between populist politicians (like Vargas himself and, later, [[Janio Quadros]]) and the right led to a crisis that ultimately brought up the military coup d'état in 1964, now known to have been supported by the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

===Military dictatorship===
{{Main|History of Brazil (1964–1985)}}
In 1964 a military-led coup d'état deposed the democratically-elected president of Brazil, João Goulart. Between 1964 and 1985, Brazil was governed by the military, with a [[two-party system]], with a pro-government [[National Renewal Alliance Party]] (ARENA) and an opposition [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB). Thousands of politicians (including former president [[Juscelino Kubitschek]]) had their political rights suspended, and military-sanctioned indirect elections were held for most elected positions until political liberalization during the government of [[João Figueiredo]].

===New Republic (1985-1990)===
{{Main|José Sarney|1980s in Brazil}}
In 1985, the military were defeated in an election according to the scheme they had set up—as a consequence of the loss of political support among the elites. The opposition candidate, [[Tancredo Neves]], was elected President, but did not take office before he died of natural causes. Fearing a political vacuum—that might stifle the democratic effort—Neves' supporters urged vice-president, [[José Sarney]] to take the oath and govern the country. Tancredo Neves had said that his election and the demise of military régime would create a &quot;New Republic&quot; and Sarney's term of government is often referred to by this name.

Sarney's government was disastrous in almost every field. The ongoing [[economic recession]] and the soaring [[external debt]] drained the country's assets while ravaging [[inflation]] (which later turned into [[hyperinflation]]) demonetized the currency and prevented any stability. In an attempt to revolutionize the economy and defeat inflation, Sarney carried on an ambitious &quot;heterodox&quot; economic plan ([[Cruzado]]) in 1986, which included price controls, default on the external debts and reduction of salaries. The plan seemed successful for some months, but it soon caused wholesale shortages of consumer goods (especially of easily exportable goods like meat, milk, automobiles, grains, sugar and alcohol) and the appearance of a black market in which such goods were sold for higher prices. Sarney used the popularity ensued by the apparent success of the plan to secure the hugest electoral win in Brazilian history: the party he had just joined, [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB), won 26 out of 27 states and more than 3,000 municipalities. Just after the elections, Sarney's &quot;corrections&quot; to the economy failed to control inflation and the public perception that he had used an artificial control of inflation to win the elections proved to be his undoing: he never recovered his popularity and was plagued by strong criticism from most sectors of society until the end of his term. Despite popular rejection, Sarney managed to extend his term from four to five years and exerted pressure on the Constitutional Assembly that was drafting the new constitution to abort the adoption of [[Parliamentarism]].

===Collor government (1990-1992)===
{{Main|Fernando Collor de Mello}}
In 1989 Fernando Collor de Mello was elected president for the term from 1990-1994. The elections were marked by unanimous condemnation of [[José Sarney]], with all candidates trying to keep distance from him.

Collor made some very bold statements, like saying that the Brazilian industry (of which the Brazilians used to be very proud) was mostly obsolete and polluting or that defaulting the debt was equal to not paying the rent. He also took quite revolutionary measures, like reducing the number of ministries to only 12 and naming [[Zélia Cardoso de Mello]] Minister of Economy (the highest position so far enjoyed by a woman in Brazil) or removing existing barriers to importing of goods.

His inflation control plan was based on an attempt to control prices and a complicated currency conversion process that prevented people from cashing their bank accounts for 18 months.

All of this made him quite unpopular and denied him support in the parliament that he needed since his own party held few seats. At the beginning of his third year in office, he resigned as a result of in a huge corruption scandal. The charges against him would later be dropped, some on mere technicalities, some for actually being irrelevant or false.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Collor desperately tried to resist [[impeachment]] by rallying the support of the youth and of the lower classes, but his call for help was answered by massive popular demonstrations, led mostly by students, demanding his resignation.

===Itamar government (1992-1994)===
{{Main|Itamar Franco}}
In 1992, the vice-president, Itamar Franco, took office as president and managed to evade the most feared consequences of Collor's downfall. He had to face a country with hyper-inflation, high levels of misery and unemployment. Far-left organizations were trying to turn the anti-Collor campaign into a wider revolutionary fight to overthrow the regime. Itamar finally granted full powers to his Minister of Economy, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, so the minister could launch the [[Plano Real]], a new economic plan that seemed to be just the same as the many unsuccessful plans launched by Sarney, Collor and their military predecessor. But the Real was a success, and terminated inflation in a few months.

===FHC government (1995-2003)===
{{Main|Fernando Henrique Cardoso}}
In 1994, Cardoso launched his [[Plano Real]], a successful economic reform that managed to permanently rid the country of the excessive inflation that had plagued it for more than forty years. The plan consisted of replacing the discredited old currency ([[Brazilian cruzeiro|cruzeiro]] and [[Brazilian cruzeiro real|cruzeiro real]]) and pegging its value temporarily to the [[United States dollar]]. Inflation – which had become a fact of Brazilian life – was cut dramatically, a change that the Brazilians took years to get used to. Because of the success of Plano Real, Cardoso was chosen by his party to run for president and, with the strong support of Franco, eventually won, beating [[Luis Inácio Lula da Silva]], who had emerged as the favorite only one year earlier.

Cardoso's term was marked by other major changes in Brazilian politics and economy. Public services and state-owned companies were [[privatization|privatized]] (some for values supposedly too cheap according to his adversaries), the strong [[Brazilian real|real]] made it easy to import goods, forcing Brazilian industry to modernize and compete (which had the side effect of causing many of them to be bought by foreign companies). During his first term, a constitutional amendment was passed to enable a sitting Executive chief to run for re-election, after which he again beat Lula in 1998.

===Lula government (2003-2011)===
[[Image:Brazilian cabinet meeting.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting of the Cabinet of Luiz Inácio &quot;Lula&quot; da Silva in the Oval Room, Palácio do Planalto, 2007]]
{{Main|Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva}}

In 2002, at his fourth attempt, Lula was elected president. In part his victory was derived from the considerable unpopularity of Cardoso's second term, which failed to decrease the economic inequality, and in part from a softening of his and the party's radical stance, including a vice-presidential candidate from the [[Liberal Party (Brazil)|Liberal Party]], acceptance of an [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) accord agreed to by the previous government and a line of discourse friendly to the financial markets.

Despite some achievements in solving part of the country's biggest problems, his term was plagued by multiple corruption scandals that rocked his cabinet, forcing some members to resign their posts.

In 2006 Lula regained part of his popularity and ran for re-election. After almost winning on the first round, he won the run-off against [[Geraldo Alckmin]] from the [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party]] (PSDB), by a margin of 20 million votes.

In 2010, Lula's handpicked successor, [[Dilma Rousseff]], was elected to the Presidency.

The '''economy of Brazil''' is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|seventh largest]] by nominal [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|eighth largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html The World Factbook] CIA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]] has moderately [[free market]]s and an inward-oriented economy. Its economy is the largest in [[Latin America]]n nations and the second largest in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forbes.com/kerenblankfeld/2010/12/13/is-brazils-economy-getting-too-hot/ Is Brazil’s Economy Getting Too Hot?]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil is one of the [[economic growth|fastest-growing]] major economies in the world with an average annual GDP growth rate of over 5 percent. In [[Brazilian real|Brazilian reais]], its GDP was estimated at R$ 3.143 trillion in 2009. The Brazilian economy has been predicted to become one of the five largest economies in the world in the decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagobooth.edu/alumni/clubs/pakistan/docs/next11dream-march%20'07-goldmansachs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is a member of diverse economic organizations, such as [[Mercosul]], [[Union of South American Nations|Unasul]], [[G8+5]], [[G20]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], and the [[Cairns Group]]. Its trade partners number in the hundreds, with 60 percent of [[export]]s mostly of [[manufacture]]d or [[manufacture|semimanufactured]] goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;/&gt; Brazil's main trade partners in 2008 were: [[Mercosul]] and [[Latin America]] (25.9 percent of trade), [[European Union|EU]] (23.4 percent), [[Asia]] (18.9 percent), the [[United States]] (14.0 percent), and others (17.8 percent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desenvolvimento.gov.br/arquivos/dwnl_1236176881.pdf MDIC - Brazil Balance of Trade 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Economic Forum]], Brazil was the top country in upward evolution of [[competitiveness]] in 2009, gaining eight positions among other countries, overcoming Russia for the first time, and partially closing the competitiveness gap with India and China among the [[BRIC]] economies. Important steps taken since the 1990s toward fiscal sustainability, as well as measures taken to liberalize and open the economy, have significantly boosted the country’s competitiveness fundamentals, providing a better environment for private-sector development.&lt;ref name=&quot;weforum.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/GCR09/Report/Part1/Chapter%201.1_The%20Global%20Competitiveness%20Index%202009-2010.pdf Global Competitiveness Report 2009-2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The owner of a sophisticated technological sector, Brazil develops projects that range from [[submarine]]s to [[aircraft]]s and is involved in space research: the country possesses a [[Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara|satellite launching center]] and was the only country in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to integrate the team responsible for the construction of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name=&quot;ISS&quot;&gt;[http://www.earthkam.ucsd.edu/public/iss/Countries.shtml Countries Participating in the ISS] ISS EarthKam&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a pioneer in many fields, including [[ethanol]] production.

Brazil, together with [[Mexico]], has been at the forefront of the Latin American [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]] phenomenon by which, thanks to superior technology and organization, local companies have successfully turned global. These multinationals have made this transition notably by investing massively abroad, in the region and beyond, and thus realizing an increasing portion of their revenues internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;weforum.org&quot;/&gt;

Brazil is also a pioneer in the fields of deep water oil research from where 73 percent of its reserves are extracted.&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;/&gt; According to government statistics, Brazil was the first capitalist country to bring together the ten largest car assembly companies inside its national territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;/&gt;

The annual Brasil Investment Summit &lt;ref&gt;http://www.terrapinn.com/Conference/Brasil-Investment-Summit/&lt;/ref&gt; takes place in [[São Paulo]] and is the largest gathering in Brazil of international investment experts covering opportunities in alternative vehicles, infrastructure, and advanced trading strategies.

==History==
{{Main|Economic history of Brazil}}

When the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s arrived in the 15th century, the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|native tribes of current-day Brazil]], totaling about 2.5 million people, had lived virtually unchanged since the [[Stone Age]]. From [[Portugal]]'s colonisation of [[Brazil]] (1500-1822) until the late 1930s, the market elements of the Brazilian economy relied on the production of [[primary products]] for [[export]]s. Within the [[Portuguese Empire]], Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial [[mercantile]] policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles - [[sugar]], [[gold]] and, from the early 19th century on, [[coffee]]. The economy of Brazil was heavily dependent on African enslaved labour until the late 19th century (about 3 million imported African enslaved individuals in total). Since then, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic growth accompanied by mass immigration from [[Europe]] (mainly from [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Germany]]) until the 1930s. In the Americas, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Canada (in descending order) were the countries that received most immigrants. In Brazil's case, statistics show that 4.5 million people emigrated to the country between 1882 and 1934.

Currently, with a population of 190 million and abundant [[natural resources]], Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of millions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5 million television sets, and 3 million refrigerators. In addition, about 70 million cubic meters of [[petroleum]] were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane gas, and a wide range of hundred petrochemicals. Furthermore, Brazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads and more than 93 Gigawatts of installed electric power capacity.

Its real per capita GDP has surpassed [[United States dollar|US$]] 10,500 in 2008, due to the strong and continued appreciation of the [[Brazilian real|real]] for the first time this decade. Its industrial sector accounts for three fifths of the [[Latin America]]n economy's industrial production.&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;/&gt; The country’s [[Brazilian science and technology|scientific and technological]] development is argued to be attractive to [[foreign direct investment]], which has averaged US$ 30 billion per year the last years, compared to only US$ 2 billion per year last decade,&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/ About Brazil] Brazilian Government&lt;/ref&gt; thus showing a remarkable growth. The agricultural sector, locally called the ''agronegócio'' (agrobusiness), has also been remarkably dynamic: for two decades this sector has kept Brazil amongst the most highly productive countries in areas related to the rural sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;/&gt; The agricultural sector and the mining sector also supported trade surpluses which allowed for massive currency gains (rebound) and external debt paydown. Due to downturn in Western economies Brazil found itself in 2010 trying to halt the appreciation of the real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/brazils-currency-wars-a-real-problem/ Brazil's Currency Wars - A &quot;Real&quot; Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of the economy==
The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 66.8 percent, followed by the industrial sector at 29.7 percent (2007 est.). Agriculture represents 3.5 percent of GDP (2008 est.). Brazilian labor force is estimated at 100.77 million of which 10 percent is occupied in agriculture, 19 percent in the industry sector and 71 percent in the service sector.

{{Main|Agriculture in Brazil}}
A performance that puts agribusiness in a position of distinction in terms of [[Brazil|Brazil’s]] [[trade balance]], in spite of trade barriers and subsidizing policies adopted by the developed countries.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

In the space of fifty five years (1950 to 2005), the population of Brazil grew from 51 million to approximately 187 million inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/disseminacao/online/popclock/popclock.php Popclock] IBGE&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of over 2 percent per year. In order to meet this demand, it was necessary to take the development of cattle and crop raising activities a step further. Since then, an authentic green revolution has taken place, allowing the country to create and expand a complex [[agribusiness]] sector.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt; However, some of this is at the expense of the environment, including the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]].

The importance given to the rural producer takes place in the shape of the agricultural and cattle-raising plan and through another specific program geared towards family [[agriculture]] (Pronaf), which guarantee financing for equipment and cultivation and encourage the use of new [[technology]], as shown by the use of agricultural land zoning. With regards to family agriculture, over 800 thousand rural inhabitants are assisted by credit, research and extension programs. The special line of credit for women and young farmers is an innovation worth mentioning, providing an incentive towards the entrepreneurial spirit.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

With The Land Reform Program, on the other hand, the country's objective is to provide suitable living and working conditions for over one million families who live in areas allotted by the State, an initiative capable of generating two million [[Employment|job]]s. Through partnerships, public policies and international partnerships, the government is working towards the guarantee of an infrastructure for the settlements, following the examples of schools and health outlets. The idea is that access to land represents just the first step towards the implementation of a quality land reform program.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:2006Brazilian exports.PNG|thumb|left|Brazilian exports in 2006.]]
Over 600,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land are divided into approximately five thousand areas of rural [[property]]; an agricultural area currently with three borders: the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-western region]] (savanna), the [[North Region, Brazil|Northern region]] (area of transition) and parts of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern region]] (semi-arid). At the forefront of grain crops, which produce over 110 million tonnes/year, is the soybean, yielding 50 million tonnes.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

In the [[bovine]] cattle-raising sector, the &quot;green ox,&quot; which is raised in pastures, on a [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of hay and [[mineral]] salts, conquered markets in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]], particularly after the &quot;mad cow disease&quot; scare period.

A pioneer and leader in the manufacture of short-fiber timber [[cellulose]], Brazil has also achieved positive results within the packaging sector, in which it is the fifth largest world producer. In the foreign markets, it answers for 25 percent of global exports of raw cane and refined sugar; it is the world leader in soybean exports and is responsible for 80 percent of the planet's orange juice, and since 2003, has had the highest sales figures for beef and chicken, among the countries that deal in this sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGA&quot;&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/ Agriculture] Brazilian Government&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Industry in Brazil}}
[[Brazil]] has the second biggest industrial sector in the [[Americas]]. Accounting for 28.5 percent of [[GDP]], Brazil's diverse industries range from [[automobile]]s, [[steel]] and [[petrochemical]]s to [[computer]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[consumer durable]]s. With increased economic stability provided by the [[Plano Real]], Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from U.S. firms.

Brazil has a diverse and relatively sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16 percent of the GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazil's financial services industry provides local [[businesses]] with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. The [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] stock exchanges are undergoing a consolidation and the previously monopolistic reinsurance sector is being opened up to third party companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u113719.shtml|title=Government breaks reinsurance monopoly, discards privatization (in Portuguese)|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2005|alt=As of}} 31 December 2007, there were an estimated 21,304,000 broadband lines in Brazil. Over 75 percent of the broadband lines were via [[DSL]] and 10 percent via cable modems.

Proven [[mineral resources]] are extensive. Large iron and manganese reserves are important sources of industrial raw materials and export earnings. Deposits of nickel, tin, chromite, uranium, bauxite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten, zinc, gold, and other minerals are exploited. High-quality cooking-grade coal required in the steel industry is in short supply.

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy policy of Brazil|Renewable energy in Brazil}}
The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported [[petroleum|oil]]. Imports previously accounted for more than 70 percent of the country's oil needs but Brazil became energy independent in 2006. Brazil is one of the world's leading producers of [[hydroelectric power]], with a current capacity of about 260,000 megawatts. Existing [[hydroelectric power]] provides 90 percent of the nation's electricity. Two large hydroelectric projects, the 19,900 megawatt [[Itaipu Dam]] on the [[Paraná River]] (the world's largest dam) and the Tucurui Dam in [[Pará]] in [[North Region, Brazil|northern Brazil]], are in operation. Brazil's first commercial [[nuclear reactor]], [[Angra I]], located near [[Rio de Janeiro]], has been in operation for more than 10 years. [[Angra II]] was completed in 2002 and is in operation too. An [[Angra III]] has its planned inauguration scheduled for 2014. The three reactors would have combined capacity of 9,000 megawatts when completed. The government also plans to build 19 more nuclear plants by the year 2020.

{{quote|&quot;In Brazil a labor-union leader has presided over an amazing period of social and economic progress. It is also one of the few countries that have successfully managed to reduce economic inequality at a time when everywhere else inequities are deepening. Successive Brazilian governments, of rival political parties, have succeeded in improving education, health and the living standards of millions of impoverished citizens who have now joined a growing middle class. Brazil has an energy policy that has spawned the world's most vibrant biofuels industry. In 1995, 15 percent of Brazilian school-age children did not go to school. In 2005, this fell to 3 percent, and today Brazil has practically achieved universal basic education.&quot;| [[Moisés Naím]], ''[[Newsweek]]'', June 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/201752 The Havana Obsession: Why All Eyes are on a Bankrupt Island] by Moisés Naím, ''Newsweek'', June 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sustainable growth ===
After being discovered by Portugal in 1500, it was only in 1808 that [[Brazil]] obtained a permit from the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial government]] to set up its first factories and manufacturers. In the 21st century, Brazil reached the status of 8th largest economy in the world. Originally, the export list was basic raw and primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold. Today, 84 percent of exports consists of manufactured and semi-manufactured products.

The period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875 and 1975.

In the last [[decade]], domestic production increased by 32.3 percent and [[agribusiness]] (agriculture and cattle-raising), which grew by 47 percent or 3.6 percent per year, was the most dynamic sector – even after having weathered international crises that demanded constant adjustments to the Brazilian economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Sustainable growth] Brazilian Government&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian government also launched a program for economic development acceleration called [[Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento]], aiming to spur growth.

Brazil's transparency ranking status in the international world is 75th according to [[Transparency International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table Transparency by country 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; It is equal with Colombia, Peru and Suriname.

=== Control and reform ===
Among measures recently adopted in order to [[Balance (accounting)|balance]] the economy, Brazil carried out reforms to its [[Social security]] (state and retirement pensions) and Tax systems. These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of Fiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the Executive Branches at [[Federal republic|federal]], [[State (administrative division)|state]] and [[municipal]] levels. At the same time, investments were made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to encourage [[export]]s, [[industry]] and [[trade]], thus creating &quot;windows of opportunity&quot; for local and international investors and producers.

With these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it doesn't import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic [[debt]] through exchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by 20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector or [[inflation]] (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a [[liquidity crisis]]. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive balance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments, services and overseas payment. Thus, respected economists say that the country won't be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brazil.melhores.com.br/ Brazil and economic crisis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Control and reform Brazilian Government]&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the productive sector has been simplified at all levels; active and independent, [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]] and the Judiciary Branch carry out the evaluation of rules and regulations. Among the main measures taken to stimulate the economy are the reduction of up to 30 percent on [[Manufactured]] Products Tax (IPI), and the investment of $8 billion on road cargo transportation fleets, thus improving distribution logistics. Further resources guarantee the propagation of business and information telecenters.

The Policy for [[Industry]], [[Technology]] and [[Foreign Trade]], at the forefront of this sector, for its part, invests $19.5 billion in specific sectors, following the example of the software and semiconductor, pharmaceutical and medicine product, and capital goods sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Consistent policies] Brazilian Government&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mergers &amp; Acquisitions ===

Between 1993 and 2010, 7.012 [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers &amp; acquisitions]] with a total known value of $707 billion USD with the involvement of Brazilian firms have been announced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_Brazil&lt;/ref&gt; The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with $115 bn. of transactions. The largest transaction with involvement of Brazilian companies has been: [[Vale (mining company)|Cia Vale do Rio Doce]] acquired [[Vale Inco|Inco]] in a tender offer valued at $18.9 billions.

'''Brazil''' has both modern technologies in the center-south portion, counting with [[3G]] [[HSDPA]], [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line 2 Plus|VDSL2+]], [[ISDB|Digital Tv]]. Other areas of the country, particularly the north and north-west regions, lack even basic analogue land line phones. This is a problem that the governnment is trying to solve by linking the liberation of new technologies (such as [[WiMax]] or [[Power line communication|PLC]]) only tied with compromises on extension of the service to less populated regions.

===Submarine Cables===

Several [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] link Brazil to the world:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teleco.com.br/tutoriais/tutorialcsub/pagina_2.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Americas II''' cable entered operations on September 2000, connecting Brazil (Fortaleza) to United States. 
*'''ATLANTIS-2''', with around 12 thousand kilometers in extension, operating since 2000, it connects Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Natal) to Europe, Africa and South America. This is the only cable that connects South America to Europe.
*'''EMERGIA – SAM 1''' cable connects all three [[Americas]], surrounding it with a total extension of more than 25 thousand kilometers.
*'''GLOBAL CROSSING - SAC''' Connects all Americas, surrounding them with a total extension of more than 15 thousand kilometers.
*'''GLOBENET/360 NETWORK''' Another link from North America to South America.
*'''UNISUR''' Interconnects Brazil, [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]].

All these cables have a [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] Going from 20[[Gbps#Gigabit_per_second_2|Gbps]] to 80Gbps, and some have a projected final capacity of more than 1Tbps.

==Television and Radio==
Under the Brazilian constitution, television and radio are not treated as telecommunication ways to avoid creating problems with a series of regulamentations that reduce and control how international businesses and persons participate on it. It is worth mentioning that Brazil has the 4th biggest media conglomerate in the world,  [[Rede Globo]].

==Internet==
{{main|Internet in Brazil}}

Internet has become quite popular in Brazil, with steadily growing numbers in adhesion and disponibility, with numbers that positions Brazil at the 6th spot on number of users.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viuisso.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/onu_internet_br.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;
Many technologies are actually in use to bring Broadband Internet to consumers, with ADSL and its variants being the most used, and 3G Technologies.

That means that only 5.5% of the roads are paved and that 94.5% are unpaved. The most important highway of the country is the [[BR-101]], which crosses 12 states.

The country has a low rate of car ownership of 140 per 1000 population, however in comparison to the other developing economies of the [[BRIC]] group Brazil exceeds [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;transtats&quot;/&gt;

Most international flights must go to [[Guarulhos International Airport]] in São Paulo or [[Galeão International Airport]] in Rio de Janeiro. Belo Horizonte is the main international airport outside Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. A few go to Brasilia, Recife, Natal, and just recently Fortaleza has accepted international flights.  With South American integration, more airports can be expected to open to international flights.

The '''Brazilian Armed Forces''' ({{lang-pt|Forças Armadas Brasileiras}}) is the unified [[military]] organization comprising the [[Brazilian Army]] (including the [[Brazilian Army Aviation Command|Brazilian Army Aviation]]), the [[Brazilian Navy]] (including the [[Brazilian Marine Corps]] and [[Brazilian Naval Aviation]]) and the [[Brazilian Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;According to article 144 of the [[1988 Brazilian Constitution]], the para-military [[Military Police (Brazil)|Military Police]] alongside the [[Military Firefighters Corps]] are constitutionally considered an auxiliary and potential reserve to the [[brazilian army|Army]], though subordinate to the state governors. They can, however, be compelled to federal service under a statute similar to [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]][https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brazil's armed forces are the largest in Latin America, with 371,199 active-duty troops and officers. With no serious external or internal threats, the armed forces are searching for a new role. They are expanding their presence in the Amazon under the Northern Corridor (Calha Norte) program. In 1994 Brazilian troops joined [[United Nations]] (UN) peacekeeping forces in five countries. Brazilian soldiers have been in Haiti since 2004 leading the United Nations Stabilization Mission (MINUSTAH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/news-in-english/2010/01/14/materia.2010-01-14.1625659789/view Brazilian troops in Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Brazilian military, especially the army, has become more involved in civic-action programs, education, health care, and constructing roads, bridges, and railroads across the nation. Although the [[Brazilian Constitution|1988 constitution]] preserves the external and internal roles of the armed forces, it places the military under presidential authority. Thus, the new charter changed the manner in which the military could exercise its moderating power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/intro.htm Information - Brazilian Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Armed Forces of Brazil are divided into 3 branches:&lt;ref name=contituicao&gt;{{cite web | title = Brazilian Federal Constitution | publisher = Brazilian Government (official text) | url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-17 }} See also: [http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html &quot;Brazilian Federal Constitution in English&quot;], text translated to English (unofficial).

*[[Brazilian Army]]

*[[Brazilian Navy]]

*[[Brazilian Air Force]]

The [[Military Police (Brazil)|Military Police]] (state police) alongside the [[Military Firefighters Corps]] are described as an ancillary and reserve force of the Army.&lt;ref name=contituicao/&gt; All military branches are part of the [[Ministry of Defence (Brazil)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Defence Structure [http://www.defesa.gov.br/estrutura/index.php &quot;Defence&quot;] ''Ministério da Defesa''. Retrieved June 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazilian Navy]] which is the oldest of the Brazilian Armed Forces, includes the [[Brazilian Marine Corps]] and the [[Brazilian Naval Aviation]]. Brazil has the most powerful military of South America, and so are each of its military branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 9&quot;&gt;http://www.senado.gov.br/JORNAL/arquivos_jornal/arquivosPdf/080331.pdf (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service obligation and manpower===
21–45 years of age for compulsory military service; conscript service obligation - 9 to 12 months; 17–45 years of age for voluntary service. An increasing percentage of the ranks are &quot;long-service&quot; volunteer professionals; women were allowed to serve in the armed forces beginning in early 1980s when the Brazilian Army became the first army in South America to accept women into career ranks; women serve in Navy and Air Force only in Women's Reserve Corps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html Military service age and obligation in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, rare they are the countries that do not congregate its Armed Forces under an only agency of defense, subordinate to the Head of the Executive. In Brazil, until the year of 1999, the three Armed Forces were remained in independent ministries. However, the quarrel on the creation of a Ministry of the Defense, integrating the Navy, the Army and the Aeronautics is old. The Constitution of 1946 already cited the creation of an only Ministry, that resulted in the institution of the E.M.F.A, to the time called General staff. Ex-President of the Republic [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]], defended the thesis of the creation of a Ministry of the Defense. It signed Decree 200, of 25 of February 1967, that the Ministry of the Armed Forces foresaw the promotion of studies to elaborate the law project creating. However, the proposal was abandoned. During the Constitutional conventional of 1988, the subject came back to the quarrel and one more time it was filed. Finally in 1992, President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], then candidate to the Presidency, declared that in its plan of government the quarrel for creation of the Ministry of Defense was foreseen. 

The President of the Republic intended to still create the Ministry in the first mandate. The idea was to optimize the system of national defense, to legalize one politics of sustainable defense and to integrate the three Forces, rationalizing its activities. But only on 10 June 1999, the Ministry of the Defense was officially servant, the General staff of the Armed Forces extinct and the [[Aeronautic]]s and Army, Navy department had been transformed into Commands. During the years of 1995/96 the EMFA, responsible for the studies on the Ministry of Defense, evidenced that, amongst 179 countries, only 23 did not have integrated Armed Forces. Of these 23, only three, amongst them Brazil, had dimensions politics to justify its creation, as for example, territorial extension and trained and structuralized Armed Forces. The Ministries of Defense of [[Germany]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Spain]], [[U.S.A.]], [[France]], [[the United Kingdom]], [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]] had been chosen for deepened analysis because they had some type of identification with Brazil, as territorial extension, population, cash of the Armed Forces, amongst others. 

To give continuity to the creation studies, President Fernando Henrique created the Inter-ministerial Work group that defined the lines of direction for implantation of the Ministry of Defense. Reelected, he nominated senator Élcio Álvares, Extraordinary minister of the Defense, on 1 January 1999. The [[Senate of Brazil|senator]] was the responsible one for the implementation of the agency. The three services are separate from each other, except in three areas: the Armed Forces General Staff (Estado-Maior das Forças Armadas-EMFA), the National Defense Council (Conselho de Defesa Nacional-CDN), and the Armed Forces High Command (Alto Comando das Forças Armadas-ACFA). The EMFA, which is involved in planning and coordination, interprets interservice views about policy and comes the closest to functioning as a ministry of defense. It is headed by a four-star general, and the chair rotates among the services. The ACFA is involved with more immediate, day-to-day problems. It is composed of the ministers of the three services, their chiefs of staff, and the EMFA chief. 

According to Article 91 of the constitution, the CDN is &quot;the consultative body of the president of the republic in matters related to national sovereignty and the defense of the democratic state.&quot; The members of the CDN are the president, the vice president, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the president of the Senate, the minister of justice, military ministers, the minister of foreign affairs, and the minister of planning. The CDN has authority to &quot;express an opinion in instances of declaration of war and the celebration of peace&quot; and to &quot;express an opinion on the decreeing of a [[state of emergency]], [[state of siege]], or [[federal intervention]].&quot; In addition, the CDN is authorized to &quot;propose the criteria and conditions for the use of areas that are vital to the security of the national territory and express an opinion on their continued use, especially in the strip along the borders, and on matters related to the conservation and exploitation of natural resources of any kind.&quot; The CDN also may &quot;study, propose, and monitor the progress of initiatives necessary to guarantee national independence and the defense of the democratic state.&quot; 

Interestingly, the highest level consultative body available to the president is the [[Council of the Republic]] (Conselho da República). This body does not include any military minister or officer, although the president may call on a military minister to participate if the matter is related to the respective ministry's agenda. According to Article 89 of the constitution, the Council of the Republic has authority to make declarations of federal intervention, a state of emergency, and a state of siege (all security-related issues).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/mod.htm About Ministry of Defense of Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;

As in most South American nations, the Brazilian Army has been the most influential of the services because of its size, deployment, and historical development. Not only did senior army generals occupy the presidency from 1964 until 1985, but most of the officers who held cabinet posts during that time were from the army. In 1997 the army totaled 200,000 members. Brazil's army has strict up-or-out retirement rules, which were developed in the mid-1960s by President [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]]. The internal command structure determines all promotions through the rank of colonel. The president is involved in the promotions to general and chooses one candidate from a list of three names presented to him by the High Command. Once passed over, the colonel must retire. All colonels must retire at age fifty-nine; and all four-star generals must retire at age sixty-six, or after 12 years as general. 

Despite the up-or-out system, under President [[José Sarney]] the army became top-heavy as generals began to occupy many positions that previously had been reserved for colonels. In 1991 there were 15 four-star, forty three-star, and 110 two-star generals. The figure for four-star generals did not include four who were ministers in the Superior Military Court (Superior Tribunal Militar-STM). Thus, in the mid-1990s the army sought to reduce the number of active-duty generals. Considering the short conscript tour (usually nine to ten months), the army has a high number of conscripts: 125,000. Because of the need for literate and skilled young men to handle modern weapons, the army has served as a training ground for a large reserve force. Its highly professional officer corps serves as a nucleus around which the trained service would be mobilized if required. 

The noncommissioned officer (NCO) corps is not well developed. NCOs have virtually no autonomy or authority. Emphasis on training and professional development is for officers only. The NCOs account for slightly more than one-third of the total army strength. About half of the NCOs are sergeants, who serve as command links between officers and ranks. Some also serve as middle-level technicians. In the early 1990s, the army began to undergo a generational change. The generals of the early 1990s had been junior officers in the early 1960s and had witnessed the military coup in 1964. Their worldview was shaped and influenced by the [[anticommunism]] of that time. These generals were being replaced by colonels who had entered the army in the early 1970s and whose view of the world had been shaped less by [[ideology]] and more by [[pragmatism]]. The [[United States]], particularly through its counterinsurgency doctrines of the early 1960s, was more influential with the older group of [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s. 

The Army General Staff (Estado-Maior do Exército-EME) directs training and operations. The EME has expanded from four sections in 1968 to 15 sections in 1994. It is headed by the EME chief, except in the event of a war. From 1946 through 1985, the army was divided into four numbered armies: the First Army was centered in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the Second Army in [[São Paulo]], the Third Army in [[Porto Alegre]], and the Fourth Army in [[Recife]]. Historically, the First Army was the most politically significant because of Rio de Janeiro's position as the nation's capital through the 1950s. The Third Army was also important because of its shared border with [[Argentina]] (Brazil's traditional rival in Latin America) and [[Uruguay]]. In 1964, for example, close to two-thirds of the Brazilian troops were in the Third Army, and somewhat fewer than one-third were in the First Army. The rest were sprinkled throughout the Second and Fourth Armies. The Planalto Military Command (Comando Militar do Planalto-CMP), comprising the [[Brazilian Federal District]] and [[Goiás]] State, and the [[Amazon Military Command]] (Comando Militar da Amazônia-CMA) supplemented the four armies. 

On January 1, 1986, the army was restructured from four numbered armies and two military commands into seven military commands. The major addition was the Western Military Command (Comando Militar do Oeste-CMO), whose territory encompasses the states of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] (previously under the Second Army territory), and [[Rondônia]] (previously under the CMA). Each of the seven military commands has its [[headquarter]]s in a major city: Eastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Leste-CML), Rio de Janeiro; Southeastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Sudeste-CMSE), São Paulo; Southern Military Command (Comando Militar do Sul-CMS), [[Porto Alegre]]; Northeastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Nordeste-CMN), [[Recife]]; CMO, [[Campo Grande]]; CMP, Brasília; and CMA, [[Manaus]]. The CMP and CMO are led by major generals (three-star); the other five are headed by full generals (four-star). The army is divided further into 11 military regions. The CMSE is made up of only one state, [[São Paulo]], and is in charge of protecting the industrial base of the country. 

The changes were instituted as part of a modernisation campaign to make the army better prepared for rapid mobilisation. The reorganization reflected Brazil's geopolitical drive to &quot;occupy the [[frontier]]&quot; and the growing importance of Brasília, the Amazon, and western Brazil. In 1997 there were major units around [[Brasília]], four jungle brigades, and five jungle battalions extending from [[Amapá]] to [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]. A tour with jungle units is a coveted assignment and is considered career-enhancing. The move to occupy the Amazon and the short-term political implications of the army's reorganisation should not be overstated. The army's geographic organization and distribution have continued to reflect a concern with internal rather than external defense. In what is perhaps an anachronism, the CML in Rio de Janeiro continues to have some of the best troop units and the most modern equipment. Command of the CML is still a coveted assignment, and the Military Village (Vila Militar), Rio de Janeiro's garrison or military community, is still considered one of the most important centers of military influence in the entire country. Principal army schools are located there or nearby. The CML is also important in countering the trafficking of drugs and armaments. 

In a significant political development, the army established a formal High Command in 1964. Before that time, a clique of generals residing in Rio de Janeiro controlled major decisions of the army. Throughout the authoritarian period, tensions often existed between the High Command and the five generals who served as president. This tension was such that President [[Geisel]] dismissed Minister of Army Sylvio Frota in 1977. Since the January 1986 restructuring, the High Command has been composed of the seven regional commanders, the chief of staff, and the minister of army. The High Command meets to discuss all issues, including those of a political nature, and is responsible for drawing up the list of generals from which the president chooses those who will be promoted to four stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/army.htm Brazilian Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazilian Navy==
{{Main|Brazilian Navy}}

The navy traces its heritage to Admiral Cochrane's mercenary fleet and to the tiny Portuguese ships and crews that protected the earliest coastal colonies from seaborne marauders. The navy is the most aristocratic and conservative of the services and draws a larger share of its officers from the upper middle class and upper class. Although it is involved in &quot;brown-water&quot; (riverine and coastal) operations, the navy's primary goal has been to become an effective &quot;blue-water&quot; navy, able to project power on the high seas. Given its &quot;blue-water&quot; bias, the navy is even less inclined to become involved in counterdrug operations than the army or air force. 

The total naval strength of 64,700 in 1997 included Naval Aviation (Aviação Naval) with 1,300 members, the Marines (Corpo de Fuzileiros Navais-CFN) with 14,600 members, and only 2,000 conscripts. Naval operations are directed from the Ministry of Navy in Brasília through the Navy General Staff (Estado-Maior da Armada-EMA), six naval districts (five oceanic and one riverine), and two naval commands-Brasília Naval Command (Comando Naval de Brasília-CNB) and Manaus Naval Command (Comando Naval de [[Manaus]]-CNM). 

The 1st Naval District is located at the country's main naval base in Rio de Janeiro; the 2nd Naval District is in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]; the 3rd Naval District is located in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]]; the 4th Naval District is located in [[Belém]]; and the 5th Naval District is located in [[Porto Alegre]]. The 6th Riverine District has its headquarters in [[Ladário]], near [[Corumbá]] on the [[Paraguay River]]. 

Until the 1980s, the flagship of the ocean-going navy was the aircraft carrier Minas Gerais (the ex-[[United Kingdom|British]] H.M.S. Vengeance), which has been in service since 1945. Purchased from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1956, the Minas Gerais was reconstructed in the [[Netherlands]] in 1960 and refitted extensively in Brazil in the late 1970s, and again in 1993. In 1994 Mário César Flores, a former minister of navy, declared in an interview that the navy would be hard-pressed to defend the Minas Gerais in a conflict. 

While the [[Minas Gerais]] was not considered likely to be replaced until the next century, it was nonetheless decommissioned in 2001 following the purchase of the French Aircraft Carrier Foch. The Foch, upon entering service with the Brazilian Navy, was renamed the [[São Paulo]]. It operates A-4KU. As of July 2002, the fate of the Minas Gerais was still unknown, with China having reportedly made a surprise bid for its purchase. 

The navy's priority re-equipment plans for the 1990s included the receipt of new Inhaúma-class corvettes, the construction of Tupi-class submarines, the refurbishing of the Niterói-class frigates, the acquisition of nine new Super Lynx and up to six former [[United States Navy]] Sikorsky SH-3G/H Sea King helicopters, the construction of the conventional SNAC-1 [[submarine]] [[prototype]], and the development of nuclear-propulsion technology. In addition, the navy contracted in late 1994 to acquire four Type 22 British Royal Navy frigates and three River-class minesweepers for delivery in the 1995-97 period. 

After years of intense rivalry between the navy and the air force for the control of [[naval aviation]], President Castelo Branco decreed in 1965 that only the air force would be allowed to operate fixed-wing aircraft and that the navy would be responsible for [[helicopter]]s. According to many critics, such an unusual division of labor caused serious command and control problems. The complement of aircraft carried by the Minas Gerais included at one point six Grumman S-2E antisubmarine planes, in addition to several SH-3D Sea King helicopters and Aérospatiale Super Puma and HB-350 Esquilo helicopters. 

In accordance with the [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]] compromise, the S-2E aircraft were flown by air force pilots and the helicopters by navy pilots. A crew of the Minas Gerais with full air complement consisted of 1,300 officers and enlisted personnel. As of late 2002, the Navy had reportedly become responsible for flying all aircraft with the rivalry having subsided between the two branches of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/navy.htm Brazilian Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian Air Force (FAB) is the biggest air force in South America. It operates more than 800 aircraft and has more than 50,000 [[personnel]]. The FAB is subdivided into four operational commands: 

I FAE (I Força Aérea) Advanced fixed and rotary wings instruction; II FAE (II Força Aérea)
Maritime patrol, SAR, helicopters transport roles and Navy support; III FAE (III Força Aérea)
Fighter command, it has all first-line combat assets under its control - fighter, attack and reconnaissance aircraft; V FAE (V Força Aérea) - responsible for transport missions. 

The Aeronautic Ministry was created on January 20, 1941, and absorbed the former Army and Navy aviation under its command. In 1944 the Brazilian Air Force joined Allied forces in Italy and operated there for about seven months, this was the FAB baptism in a real conflict. In 1999 after a creation of the [[Ministry of Defence (Brazil)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD), the Aeronautic Ministry changed its designation to Aeronautic Command, but no big changes happened to the air force structure, it kept almost the same organization it had before.

The biggest, and most important, program of the FAB in the last years is the SIPAM (Sistema de Proteção da Amazônia - Amazonian Protection System), the operational part of the SIPAM is known by SIVAM (Sistema de Vigilância da Amazônia - Amazon Vigilance System). The SIVAM is a huge network of radars, sensors and personnel integrated to guard and protect the [[Amazon Rainforest]] and its resources. In 2002 the Embraer R-99A AEW&amp;C equipped with the Ericsson Erieye Airborne Radar and the R-99B SR (Electronic Intelligence Gathering version) entered service. The R-99 fleet is one of the principal components of the system, the aircraft are based at Anápolis AB near Brasília and fly 24 hours a day over the Amazonian region. 

The backbone of the Brazilian combat aviation made up of three types, the [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E/F]], the Embraer/Aermacchi [[AMX International AMX|A-1A/B (AMX)]] and the Embraer A/T-29 [[Super Tucano]]. The F-5s are under a modernisation program called F-5BR program, the aircraft official designation is F-5M. The upgrade is being carried out by Embraer and Elbit; it includes a new avionics suite, a full glass cockpit with three MFDs, HOTAS configuration and a new multimode radar, the [[Italy|Italian]] Grifo F. The first F-5EM was handed over on September 21, 2005, and it is scheduled at a rate of two aircraft being delivered each month from that date onwards. 

The A-1s are the main attack/ bomber aircraft of the FAB. There are three squadrons operating the A-1, one of them equipped with the RA-1 variant having a reconnaissance function as its primary role, but retaining all attack capabilities of the A-1. The RA-1s are equipped with RAFAEL's RecceLite reconnaissance system. Like the F-5, the A-1 is under a MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) program as well, this upgrade giving a high commonality between the avionics of the A-1M (MLU aircraft designation), the F-5M and the newly introduced Embraer A/T-29. 

With the Mirage III withdrawn, the air defence of Brasília and region is done temporarily by a mix of F-5s from 1st GAv and 1st/14th GAv until 10 Mirage 2000Cs and two Mirage 2000B bought from [[French Air Force]] surplus stocks arrive at [[Anápolis]]. The Mirage 2000s are meant to be in service until at least 2015, when the Brazilian Air Force foresee the (postponed) F-X entering in service. 

To replace the Embraer P-95 Bandeirulha in the maritime patrol duties, 12 Lockheed P-3A Orions have been bought from [[US Navy]] surplus and eight (with an option for a ninth) of them are being upgraded by EADS CASA in [[Spain]], the remainder are to be used as spare parts source. On the same day of contract signature for the P-3BR work, 29 April 2005, EADS CASA was also awarded a contract to supply 12 C-295M medium transport aircraft. Deliveries started in 2006 with the first aircraft arriving in October 2006. The first three C-295s, designated C-105A Amazonas in Brazilian service, were commissioned into service in a formal ceremony at Base Aérea de [[Manaus]] on March 31, 2007. The C-105 replaces the FAB's C-115 Buffalo fleet and will supplement the C-130 Hercules. 

The main heavy transport aircraft is the Lockheed C-130H Hercules and it will not change soon. The &quot;Herks&quot; are receiving major upgrades, receiving a full glass cockpit besides many other modifications. The first upgraded C-130 entering operational service recently. There are four Boeing KC-137 used as transport and tankers roles. In 2005 FAB received one [[Airbus]] ACJ, callsign &quot;Air Force One&quot; and dubbed as &quot;Santos Dumont.&quot; The ACJ is now the main presidential transport and it is assisted by two [[Boeing 737-200]] and one AS-332 Super Puma, with the KC-137 still serving as presidential transport in case of necessity. The basic pilot training is concentrated in [[Pirassununga]] (AFA - Academia da Força Aérea) and uses the Neiva T-25 and the well known Embraer T-27 Tucano for basic instruction. Advanced training is done at Natal AB in the AT-29 Super Tucano, which replaced the Embraer AT-26 Xavante in the conversion training course.

Since the early 20th century, the armed forces have pursued the goal of weapons self-sufficiency. Their intention was never to develop a large [[arsenal]] but to have the technical capability to produce the arms needed for Brazil's military. During [[World War I]], the large navy was cut off from resupply of big gun shells and became a paper navy, thus reinforcing the drive for self-sufficiency. The [[Industry in Brazil|rapid industrialization]] that took place after 1930 provided the infrastructure necessary for developing an arms industry. After [[World War II]], Brazil developed a steel mill at [[Volta Redonda]], in Rio de Janeiro State, and quickly became the largest steel producer in [[Latin America]]. In 1954 Brazil began manufacturing its first [[automatic pistol]]s. The earliest armored personnel carriers (APCs) produced by Brazil, in the 1960s, benefited directly from some of the technology developed by Brazil's dynamic automotive industry. Brazil's push for nationalization of the computer-related industry in the 1970s also began with the navy, which could not decipher the &quot;[[black box]]&quot; computerized range-finding and firing mechanisms on the British frigates they had purchased, and did not want to be dependent on imported maintenance. 

In the 1950s, Brazil set up the precursor to the Aerospace Technical Center (Centro Técnico Aeroespacial-CTA). Located in [[São José dos Campos]], the CTA became the focal point for the arms industry. The CTA has trained a generation of engineers through its technical institute, the Aeronautical Technology Institute ([[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica]]-ITA). In 1986 it was estimated that 60% of 800 Embraer engineers had graduated from the ITA. Brazil's three largest arms firms were established in the 1960s. Avibrás Aerospace Industry (Avibrás Indústria Aeroespacial S.A.-[[Avibrás]]) was established in 1961; [[Engesa]], in 1963; and Embraer, in 1969. It was only in the subsequent period, from 1977 through 1988, that the three firms began to export arms on a large scale. In addition an estimated 350 firms are involved directly or indirectly in the arms production process in Brazil. 

By 1980 Brazil had become a net exporter of arms. On the demand side, the rapid success resulted from a growing need in the developing world for armaments. On the supply side, Brazil's arms exports were designed for developing world markets and were noted for their high quality, easy maintenance, good performance in adverse conditions, and low cost. The product line was broad and came to include [[ammunition]], [[grenades]], [[Land mine|mines]], armored personnel vehicles, [[patrol boat]]s, navy patrol planes, turboprop trainers, [[tank]]s, and subsonic jet fighters. In the early 1980s, Brazil emerged as one of the leading armaments exporters in the developing world. From 1985 to 1989, it was the 11th largest exporter of arms. Brazil exported arms to at least forty-two countries, in all regions of the world. By far the largest regional market was the [[Middle East]], to which Brazil sold approximately 50% of its arms from 1977 through 1988. According to an estimate by the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI), 40% of all Brazilian arms transfers from 1985 to 1989 went to [[Iraq]]. 

Brazil's arms industry nearly collapsed after 1988, as a result of the termination of the [[Iran-Iraq War]] (1980–88), a reduction in world demand for armaments, and the decline in state support for the industry. In early 1990, the two major manufacturers, Engesa and Avibrás, filed for bankruptcy. By late 1994, it appeared that Brazil's arms industry would not disappear completely. It was unlikely, however, that it would return to the robust form of the mid-1980s. Avibrás had paid off a substantial portion of its debt and was seeking ways to convert much of its production to civilian products. Engesa had been dismembered; some of its companies were sold to private interests, and its ordnance-related companies were taken over by the state and integrated with Imbel. Embraer was privatized in December 1994, and despite significant financial difficulties, it rolled out the new jet commuter plane prototype EMB-145 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/industry.htm Military Industry in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Brazil has begun to emerge as a major world power and a potential superpower; thus Brazil has begun to develop as a major military power. In 2008 the Brazilian minister of defense has formulated the &quot;Estratégia Nacional de Defesa&quot; (National Defense Strategy), that claims to build a strong national industry and make strategic partnerships with allied nations to develop technology together.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defesa.gov.br/eventos_temporarios/2009/estrategia/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 7156, Brazil has signed a strategic partnership with [[France]] and [[Russia]] to trade military technology. Brazil has also begun negotiations with France to have Brazil build 120 [[Rafale]] aircraft locally by Embraer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/feature/107881/brazil-to-buy-36-rafales-as-france-extends-security-partnership.html |title=Brazil to Buy 36 Rafales As France Extends Security Partnership |publisher=Defense-aerospace.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008 the Brazilian company Embraer showcased the Brazilian [[military transport aircraft]], [[Embraer KC-390]], and some countries already have shown interest in the aircraft, with France even placing orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeropress.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=599]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=notícias |url=http://noticias.br.msn.com/artigo.aspx?cp-documentid=21570434 |title=Brasil negocia com França compra de 36 jatos Rafale - MSN Notícias |publisher=Noticias.br.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009 Brazil purchased 4 [[Scorpène]] submarines for US$ 9.9 billion with a massive technology transfer agreement. In a second agreement, France will provide technical assistance to Brazil so that Brazil can design and produce indigenous nuclear powered submarines, to be completely built in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval.com.br/blog/?p=17332 |title=Novos submarinos da MB: Senado aprova o empréstimo de 4,32 bilhões de euros &amp;#124; Poder Naval |publisher=Naval.com.br |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian government has announced that a [[Helibras]] factory in the city of [[Itajubá]], [[Minas Gerais]], will initially produce 50 units of the [[Eurocopter EC 725|EC 725]] and up to 1,300 new helicopters for the Brazilian military. Helibras will now also produce Eurocopter's full line of products, with the first units to be operational in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Farias |first=Ivy |title=Brasil produzirá em Minas Gerais helicópteros para as Forças Armadas |date=September 8, 2008 |publisher=[[Agência Brasil]] |url=http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/noticias/2008/09/08/materia.2008-09-08.2525261585/view}} Retrieved on July 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Defense of Brazil, in 2009 also asked the Brazilian Navy to develop a plan for the next 30 years. To carry out the plans of power projection that Brazil wants to run, the expenditure will cost more than US$ 138 billion, within the Navy alone. The program is called PEAMB.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mar.mil.br/peamb.html&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy is to buy or build 2 [[aircraft carriers]] (40,000 tonnes), 4 [[Landing Helicopter Dock|LHD]] (20,000 tonnes), 30 escort ships, 15 submarines, 5 [[nuclear submarines]] and 62 (patrol ships).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval.com.br/blog/?p=17940 |title=A nova geopolítica na América do Sul e o PEAMB &amp;#124; Poder Naval |publisher=Naval.com.br |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the minister of defense, [[Nelson Jobim]], said that Brazil will expend about 0.7% (US$ 13 billion) of the [[GDP]] per year to modernize the forces in addition to the 2.6% yearly defense budget. He stated, &quot;We are raising a study to make the financial schedule of the entire project. It will be a 20 year plan, including modernization and expansion of the elements for defense of the Brazilian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u635420.shtml |title=Folha Online - Brasil - Jobim questiona promessa francesa de transferência integral de tecnologia para caças - 08/10/2009 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2010-01-17 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Troop relocation===
Brazil has the need to patrol its 16,880 kilometers (10,488 miles) of land borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; Since the 1990s Brazil has been relocating its forces in accordance to this [[national security]] requirement.

Between 1992 and 2008, the ''1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''16th Jungle Infantry Brigades'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fazenda.gov.br/resenhaeletronica/MostraMateria.asp?page=&amp;cod=372337 |title=Entrevista - Enzo Martins Peri |publisher=Resenha Eletr�nica |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fab.mil.br/portal/operacoes_aereas/solimoes/ft.htm |title=:: Operação TIMBÓ IV :: |publisher=Fab.mil.br |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Infantry Battalion'', the ''19th Logistics Battalion'', and the ''22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Army Police Platoon'' were transferred by the [[Brazilian Army|Army]] from the states of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] to the [[Brazilian Amazon|Amazon]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://odia.terra.com.br/economia/htm/uniao_cortara_tropa_do_rio_168086.asp O DIA Online - União cortará tropa do Rio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the [[Argentina–Brazil relations#Democratization (1985)|friendship policy with Argentina]].

However, despite those efforts, the presence of the Armed Forces on the border regions of the [[Brazilian Amazon]] continues to be sparse and disperse, given the fact that the Army has just 28 border detachments in that area, a total of 1,600 soldiers, or 1 men for every {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} of borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; More redeployments are expected since the states of Rio de Janeiro, [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Espírito Santo]] still concentrate over 49,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; In May 2008, the Navy announced new plans to reposition its forces throughout [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

==Earth observation==
[[File:Inpe (Cuiaba).jpg|thumb|right|Earthly station's satellite dish of the [[National Institute for Space Research]], in [[Cuiabá]].]]
The Brazilian [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] sustains about 40% of the world's remaining tropical rainforests and plays vital roles in maintaining biodiversity, regional hydrology and climate, and terrestrial carbon storage. Recent studies suggest that deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon could increase sharply in the future as a result of over US$ 40 billion in planned investments in highway paving and major new infrastructure projects in the region. 

These studies have been challenged by several Brazilian ministries, which assert that recent improvements in [[environmental law]]s, enforcement and public attitudes have fundamentally reduced the threat posed to forests by such projects. 

Among tropical nations, Brazil probably has the world's best monitoring of deforestation activity. Estimates are produced by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) for the entire Brazilian [[Legal Amazon]] by visually interpreting satellite imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The relevance of the CBERS program does not limit itself only to applications of the satellite-generated images. The program also takes part in the Space Activities National Program (PNAE) which objective is to lead the country toward the autonomy of this technology so vital to our development. 

The INPE participation in this complex project accelerates the capability of the country in important space technologies, besides contributing to increase and modernize the national industry in the space sector and the infrastructure (laboratories and centers) dedicated to space projects. There has been participation of the national industry in all satellite subsystems on charge of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/brazil/earth.htm Earth observation in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Brazil}}
The [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations]] is responsible for managing the '''foreign relations of Brazil.''' [[Brazil]] is a significant [[political]] and [[economic]] power in [[Latin America]] and a key player on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/south-america/brazil?profile=intRelations&amp;pg=4 Country Profile: Brazil] UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Retrieved on 2009-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's [[foreign policy]] reflects its role as a [[regional power]] and a potential [[world power]] and is designed to help protect the country's [[national interests]], [[national security]], [[ideology|ideological goals]], and [[prosperity|economic prosperity]].

Between [[World War II]] and 1990, both [[democratic]] and [[military government|military]] governments sought to expand Brazil's influence in the world by pursuing a state-led [[industrial policy]] and an independent [[foreign policy]]. Brazilian foreign policy has recently aimed to strengthen ties with other [[South America]]n countries, engage in multilateral diplomacy through the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]], and act at times as a countervailing force to [[United States|U.S.]] political and economic influence in Latin America.

==Foreign policy==
{{Update|type=section|date=June 2010}}
[[Image:1325RP0207.jpg|thumb|[[Prime Minister of India]] [[Manmohan Singh]] receiving state honors during his visit to Brazil in 2006.]]
Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a [[regional power]] in [[Latin America]], a leader among [[developing countries]], and an emerging [[world power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/news/docs/RL33456.pdf U.S. Congressional Report on Brazil] [[United States Congress]]. Retrieved on 2009-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of [[multilateralism]], peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Georges D. Landau, &quot;The Decision-making Process in Foreign Policy: The Case of Brazil,&quot; Center for Strategic and International Studies: Washington DC: March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil engages in multilateral [[diplomacy]] through the Organization of American States and the United Nations, and has increased ties with developing countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. Brazil is currently commanding a multinational U.N. stabilization force in Haiti, the [[MINUSTAH]]. Instead of pursuing unilateral prerogatives, Brazilian foreign policy has tended to emphasize regional integration, first through the [[Mercosur|Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosul)]] and now the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Brazil is also committed to cooperation with other Portuguese-speaking nations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brasilemb.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=144&amp;Itemid=133&lt;/ref&gt; through joint-collaborations with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world, in several domains which include military cooperation, financial aid, and cultural exchange. This is done in the framework of [[CPLP]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cplp.org/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; for instance. Lula da Silva's recent visit to [[Africa]] included State visits to three Portuguese-speaking African nations ([[Angola]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], and [[Mozambique]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3234519.stm | work=BBC News | title=Brazil's president visits Angola | date=2003-11-03 | accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Brazil is also strongly committed in the development and restoration of peace in [[East Timor]], where it has a very powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/luso/2006/00000013/00000002/art00002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brazil.org.uk/press/pressreleases_files/20070622.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's political, business, and military ventures are complemented by the country's [[trade policy]]. In Brazil, the [[Ministry of Foreign Relations of Brazil|Ministry of Foreign Relations]] continues to dominate trade policy, causing the country's commercial interests to be (at times) subsumed by a larger foreign policy goal, namely, enhancing Brazil's influence in Latin America and the world.&lt;ref&gt;CRS Report RL33258, Brazilian Trade Policy and the United States, by J.F. Hornbeck&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while concluding meaningful trade agreements with [[developed countries]] (such as the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]]) would probably be beneficial to Brazil's long-term economic self-interest, the Brazilian government has instead prioritized its leadership role within Mercosul and expanded trade ties with countries in Africa, Asia and the [[Middle East]].

In November 2009, Brazil entered into an agreement with three other large [[developing countries]] - [[South Africa]], [[India]] and [[China]] - to act as a bloc in negotiations at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen climate summit]], including a possible united walk-out if their common minimum position was not met by the [[developed nations]]. The four have since continued to work together, under the name [[BASIC countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Lula da Silva administration===
The Brazilian foreign policy under the [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] administration had been focused on the following directives: to contribute toward the search for greater equilibrium and attenuate [[unilateralism]]; to strengthen [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] relations in order to increase the country's weight in political and economic negotiations on an international level; to deepen relations so as to benefit from greater economical, financial, technological and cultural interchange; to avoid agreements that could jeopardize development in the long term.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESP&quot;&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/8/0/4/5/pages180452/p180452-1.php Lula da Silva’s Foreign Policy: The Autonomy through Diversification Strategy] Vigevani, Tullo; Cepaluni, Gabriel. Retrieved on 2009-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

These directives implied precise emphasis on: the search for political coordination with [[Newly industrialized country|emerging]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], namely [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Russia]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]]; creation of the [[Union of South American Nations]] and its derivative bodies, such as the South American Security Council; strengthening of [[Mercosul]]; projection at the [[Doha Development Round|Doha Round]] and [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]; maintenance of relations with [[developed country|developed countries]], including the [[United States of America|United States]]; undertaking and narrowing of relations with [[Africa]]n countries; campaign for the [[reform of the United Nations Security Council]] and for a permanent seat for Brazil; and defense of social objectives allowing for a greater equilibrium between the States and populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESP&quot;/&gt;

==United Nations politics==
{{main|Brazil and the United Nations}}

Brazil is a charter member of the [[United Nations]] and participates in many of its specialized agencies. It has contributed troops to UN peacekeeping efforts in the [[Middle East]], the former [[Belgian Congo]], [[Cyprus]], [[Mozambique]], [[Angola]], and more recently [[East Timor]] and [[Haiti]]. Brazil has been a member of the [[UN Security Council]] nine times, most recently 2004-2005.

Brazil is currently seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. It is a member of the [[G4 nations|G4]], an organization of Brazil, [[Germany]], [[Japan]], and [[India]], all nations who are currently seeking permanent representation. According to their plan the [[UN Security Council]] would be expanded beyond the current 15 members to include 25 members. This would be the first time that permanent status has been extended to a [[South American]] nation and supporters of the G4 plan suggest that this will lead to greater representation of developing nations rather than the current major participants.

After democratization, a strong integration and partnership began between the two countries. In 1985 they signed the basis for the [[MERCOSUL]], a Regional Trade Agreement. In the field of science, the two regional giants had been rivals since the 1950s when both governments launched parallel nuclear and space programs, however, several agreements were signed since then such as the creation of the [[Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials]] (ABACC) to verify both countries' pledges to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. National spaces agencies [[CONAE]] and the [[Brazilian Space Agency|AEB]] had also began working together since the 1990s. Brazil's decision to prevent a Royal Navy ship docking in Rio de Janeiro was seen as backing Argentina over the Falklands dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/8251700/Britains-isolation-on-Falklands-grows-with-anti-colonial-Brazil-snub.html Britain's isolation on Falklands grows with 'anti-colonial' Brazil snub]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on the military side there has been greater rapprochement. In accordance with the friendship policy, both armies dissolved or moved major units previously located at their common border (for example, [[Argentine Army|Argentine]]'s 7th Jungle and 3rd Motorized Infantry Brigades). Brazilian soldiers are embedded in the Argentine [[peacekeeping]] contingent at [[UNFICYP]] in [[Cyprus]] and they are working together at [[MINUSTAH]] in [[Haiti]] and, as another example of collaboration, [[Argentine Navy]] aircraft routinely operate from the [[Brazilian Navy]] carrier [[NAe São Paulo]].
