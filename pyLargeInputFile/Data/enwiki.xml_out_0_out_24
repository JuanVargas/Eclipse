nal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each of the city's rings. The walls were constructed of red, white and black rock quarried from the moats, and were covered with [[brass]], [[tin]] and the precious metal [[orichalcum]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Critias 116bc&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules as far as Egypt and the European continent as far as [[Tyrrhenia]], and subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.

{{quote|But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of your warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down.&lt;ref&gt;''Timaeus'' 25c–d, Bury translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Logographer (history)|logographer]] [[Hellanicus of Mytilene|Hellanicus of Lesbos]] wrote an earlier work titled ''Atlantis'', of which only a few fragments survive. Hellanicus' work appears to have been a genealogical one concerning the daughters of Atlas&lt;ref name=&quot;Luce&quot;&gt;{{cite book|year=1978|title=Atlantis, Fact or Fiction?|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-10482-3|author=John V Luce|authorlink=John V. Luce|chapter=The Literary Perspective|editor=Edwin S. Ramage|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Ἀτλαντὶς in Greek means &quot;of Atlas&quot;), but some authors have suggested a possible connection with Plato's island. [[John V. Luce]] notes that when he writes about the genealogy of Atlantis's kings Plato writes in the same style as Hellanicus and suggests a similarity between a fragment of Hellanicus's work and an account in the ''Critias''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luce&quot; /&gt; Robert Castleden suggests Plato may have borrowed his title from Hellanicus, and that Hellanicus may have based his work on an earlier work on Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 2001 p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Ancient===

Some ancient writers viewed Atlantis as fiction while others believed it was real.&lt;ref&gt;Nesselrath (2005), pp. 161–171.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Crantor]], a student of Plato's student [[Xenocrates]], is often cited as an example of a writer who thought the story to be historical fact. His work, a commentary on Plato's ''Timaeus'', is lost, but [[Proclus]], a Neoplatonist of the fifth century AD, reports on it.&lt;ref&gt;Timaeus 24a: {{Polytonic|τὰ γράμματα λαβόντες}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in question has been represented in the modern literature either as claiming that Crantor actually visited Egypt, had conversations with priests, and saw hieroglyphs confirming the story or as claiming that he learned about them from other visitors to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Proclus wrote

{{quote|As for the whole of this account of the Atlanteans, some say that it is unadorned history, such as Crantor, the first commentator on Plato. Crantor also says that Plato's contemporaries used to criticize him jokingly for not being the inventor of his Republic but copying the institutions of the Egyptians. Plato took these critics seriously enough to assign to the Egyptians this story about the Athenians and Atlanteans, so as to make them say that the Athenians really once lived according to that system.}}

The next sentence is often translated &quot;Crantor adds, that this is testified by the prophets of the Egyptians, who assert that these particulars [which are narrated by Plato] are written on pillars which are still preserved.&quot; But in the original, the sentence starts not with the name Crantor but with the ambiguous ''He'', and whether this referred to Crantor or to Plato is the subject of considerable debate. Proponents of both Atlantis as a myth and Atlantis as history have argued that the word refers to Crantor.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 2001, p,168&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Cameron, however, argues that it should be interpreted as referring to Plato, and that when Proclus writes that &quot;we must bear in mind concerning this whole feat of the Athenians, that it is neither a mere myth nor unadorned history, although some take it as history and others as myth&quot;, he is treating &quot;Crantor's view as mere personal opinion, nothing more; in fact he first quotes and then dismisses it as representing one of the two unacceptable extremes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cameron 1983&quot;&gt;Cameron 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron also points out that whether ''he'' refers to Plato or to Crantor, the statement does not support conclusions such as Otto Muck's &quot;Crantor came to Sais and saw there in the temple of Neith the column, completely covered with hieroglyphs, on which the history of Atlantis was recorded. Scholars translated it for him, and he testified that their account fully agreed with Plato's account of Atlantis&quot; or J. V. Luce's suggestion that Crantor sent &quot;a special enquiry to Egypt&quot; and that he may simply be referring to Plato's own claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cameron 1983&quot;/&gt;

Another passage from Proclus' commentary on the ''Timaeus'' gives a description of the geography of Atlantis: &lt;blockquote&gt;That an island of such nature and size once existed is evident from what is said by certain authors who investigated the things around the outer sea. For according to them, there were seven islands in that sea in their time, sacred to [[Persephone]], and also three others of enormous size, one of which was sacred to Pluto, another to Ammon, and another one between them to Poseidon, the extent of which was a thousand stadia [200&amp;nbsp;km]; and the inhabitants of it—they add—preserved the remembrance from their ancestors of the immeasurably large island of Atlantis which had really existed there and which for many ages had reigned over all islands in the Atlantic sea and which itself had like-wise been sacred to Poseidon. Now these things Marcellus has written in his ''Aethiopica''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''Commentary on Plato's Timaeus'', p. 117.10–30 (=''FGrHist'' 671 F 1), trans. Taylor, Nesselrath.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Marcellus remains unidentified.

Other ancient historians and philosophers believing in the existence of Atlantis were [[Strabo]] and [[Posidonius]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 2.3.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's account of Atlantis may have also inspired [[parody|parodic]] imitation: writing only a few decades after the ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', the historian [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]] wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as [[Meropis]]. This description was included in Book 8 of his voluminous ''Philippica'', which contains a dialogue between King [[Midas]] and [[Silenus]], a companion of [[Dionysus]]. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis (Cos?): ''Eusebes'' ({{Polytonic|Εὐσεβής}}, &quot;Pious-town&quot;) and ''Machimos'' ({{Polytonic|Μάχιμος}}, &quot;Fighting-town&quot;). He also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer [[Hyperborea]], but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth. Heinz-Günther Nesselrath has argued that these and other details of Silenus' story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the Atlantis story, for the purpose of exposing Plato's ideas to ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;Nesselrath 1998, pp. 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoticus, a [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher of the 3rd century AD, wrote an epic poem based on Plato's account of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], ''Life of Plotinus'', 7=35.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 4th century historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], relying on a lost work by [[Timagenes]], a historian writing in the 1st century BC, writes that the [[Druids]] of [[Gaul]] said that part of the inhabitants of Gaul had migrated there from distant islands. Some have understood Ammianus's testimony as a claim that at the time of Atlantis's actual sinking into the sea, its inhabitants fled to western Europe; but Ammianus in fact says that “the Drasidae (Druids) recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the [[Rhine]]&quot; (''Res Gestae'' 15.9), an indication that the immigrants came to Gaul from the north (Britain, the Netherlands or Germany), not from a theorized location in the Atlantic Ocean to the south-west.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick-Matthews, Keith. ''[http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/cult_archaeology/lost_continents.html Lost Continents: Atlantis].''&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Celts that dwelled along the ocean were reported to venerate twin gods ([[Dioscori]]) that appeared to them coming from that ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html] [[Bibliotheca historica]] - [[Diodorus Siculus]] 4.56.4: ''&quot;And the writers even offer proofs of these things, pointing out that the Celts who dwell along the ocean venerate the Dioscori above any of the gods, since they have a tradition handed down from ancient times that these gods appeared among them coming from the ocean. Moreover, the country which skirts the ocean bears, they say, not a few names which are derived from the Argonauts and the Dioscori.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish and Christian===

The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] in the early 1st century AD wrote about the destruction of Atlantis in his ''On the Eternity of the World'', xxvi. 141:

{{quote|...And the island of Atalantes which was greater than Africa and Asia, as Plato says in the Timaeus, in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inundation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book35.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars believe [[Clement of Rome]] cryptically referenced Atlantis in his [[First Epistle of Clement]], 20: 8:

{{quote|...The ocean which is impassable for men, and the worlds beyond it, are
directed by the same ordinances of the Master.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-lightfoot.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On this passage the theologian [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] (''Apostolic Fathers'', 1885, II, p. 84) noted: &quot;Clement may possibly be referring to some known, but hardly accessible land, lying without the pillars of Hercules. But more probably he contemplated some unknown land in the far west beyond the ocean, like the fabled Atlantis of Plato...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, translator, ''The Apostolic Fathers'', II, 1885, P. 84, Edited &amp; Revised by Michael W. Holmes, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other early Christian writers wrote about Atlantis, though they had mixed views on whether it once existed or was an untrustworthy myth of pagan origin.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp, ''Lost Continents'', 1954, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] believed Atlantis was once real and wrote that in the Atlantic Ocean once existed &quot;(the isle) that was equal in size to Libya or Asia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0401.htm&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Plato's geographical description of Atlantis. The early Christian apologist writer [[Arnobius]] also believed Atlantis once existed but blamed its destruction on pagans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.xii.iii.i.v.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] in the 6th century AD wrote of Atlantis in his [[Christian Topography]] in attempt to prove his theory the world was flat and surrounded by water:

{{quote|...In like manner the philosopher Timaeus also describes this Earth as surrounded by the Ocean, and the Ocean as surrounded by the more remote earth. For he supposes that there is to westward an island, Atlantis, lying out in the Ocean, in the direction of Gadeira (Cadiz), of an enormous magnitude, and relates that the ten kings having procured mercenaries from the nations in this island came from the earth far away, and conquered Europe and Asia, but were afterwards conquered by the Athenians, while that island itself was submerged by God under the sea. Both Plato and Aristotle praise this philosopher, and Proclus has written a commentary on him. He himself expresses views similar to our own with some modifications, transferring the scene of the events from the east to the west.  Moreover he mentions those ten generations as well as that earth which lies beyond the Ocean.  And in a word it is evident that all of them borrow from Moses, and publish his statements as their own.&lt;ref&gt;www.tertullian.org/fathers/cosmas_12_book12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] treatise on computational [[astronomy]] dated to AD 1378/79, alludes to the Atlantis myth in a discussion concerning the determination of zero points for the calculation of longitude:

{{quote|Some say that they [the inhabited regions] begin at the beginning of the western ocean [the Atlantic] and beyond. For in the earliest times [literally: the first days] there was an island in the middle of the ocean. There were scholars there, who isolated themselves in [the pursuit of] philosophy. In their day, that was the [beginning for measuring] the longitude[s] of the inhabited world. Today, it has become [covered by the?] sea, and it is ten degrees into the sea; and they reckon the beginning of longitude from the beginning of the western sea.&lt;ref&gt;Selin, Helaine 2000, ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands, pg 574. ISBN 0-7923-6363-9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Atlantis map 1882 crop.jpg|thumb|375px|A map showing the supposed extent of the Atlantean Empire. From [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]]'s ''Atlantis: the Antediluvian World'', 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]|year=1882|publisher=Harper|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/atl/ataw/ataw402.htm|author=[[Ignatius L.

===Modern===
[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon's]] 1627 essay ''[[New Atlantis|The New Atlantis]]'' describes a utopian society that he called Bensalem, located off the western coast of America. A character in the narrative gives a history of Atlantis that is similar to Plato's and places Atlantis in America. It is not clear whether Bacon means [[North America|North]] or [[South America]]. The Swedish scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck]] published ''[[Atland]]'' in several volumes, starting in 1679. This attempted to prove that Sweden was Atlantis, the cradle of civilization, and Swedish the original language of Adam from which [[Latin]] and [[Hebrew]] had evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Auroux, Sylvain, ed. (2006). ''History of the Language Sciences: An International Handbook on the Evolution of Language Sciences''. Walter de Gruyter, ISBN 3110167352, pp. 1125-1126.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin parallel title is ''Atlantica'' and the subtitle of both is ''Manheim'', that is, ''home of mankind''.  According to Rudbeck, ''Atland'' means ''fatherland'', and it was the original name of Atlantis.  [[Isaac Newton]]'s 1728 ''The Chronology of the Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' studies a variety of mythological links to Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1728). ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15784/15784-h/15784-h.htm The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle and late 19th century, several renowned [[Mesoamerica]]n scholars, starting with [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], and including [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] proposed that Atlantis was somehow related to [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Aztec]] culture. The 1882 publication of ''[[Atlantis: the Antediluvian World]]'' by [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] stimulated much popular interest in Atlantis. Donnelly attempted to establish that all known [[ancient civilization]]s were descended from Atlantis, which he saw as a technologically sophisticated culture, saying that Atlanteans invented gunpowder and the compass thousands of years before the rest of the world invented written language.

[[File:Ignatius-Donnelly.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ignatius L. Donnelly]], American [[congressman]], and writer on Atlantis.]]

During the late 19th century, ideas about the legendary nature of Atlantis were combined with stories of other [[Lost Lands|lost continent]]s such as [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].  The esoteric text [[Oera Linda]], published in 1872, mentions it under the name Atland (the name used by Olaus Rudbeck). The book claims that it was submerged in 2193 BC, the same year that 19th century almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology, gave for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensma&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

Furthermore, she expressed the belief that it was [[Homer]] before Plato who first wrote of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''It was not he [Plato] who invented it, since Homer, who preceded him by many centuries, also speaks of the Atlantes and of their island in his [[Odyssey]].'' Secret Doctrine, vol 2. pt3, ch6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theosophy|Theosophists]] believe the [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|civilization of Atlantis]] reached its peak between 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago but destroyed itself through internal warfare brought about by the inhabitants' dangerous use of magical powers. [[William Scott-Elliot]] in ''The Story of Atlantis'' (1896) elaborated on Blavatsky's account, claiming that Atlantis eventually split into two linked islands, one called Daitya, and the other Ruta, which was later reduced to a final remnant called Poseidonis.&lt;ref&gt;William Scott Elliot, ''The Story of Atlantis'', Theosophical Publishing Society, 1896, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Scott-Elliot's information came from the clairvoyant [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. [[Rudolf Steiner]] wrote of the cultural evolution of Atlantis&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner, Rudolf]] (1922), [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/30718 An Outline of Occult Science]&lt;/ref&gt; in much the same vein. [[Edgar Cayce]] first mentioned Atlantis in 1923,&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Lytle, 1972, ''Edgar Cayce’s Story of the Origin and Destiny of Man'', Berkeley Books, New York, pg 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and later suggested that it was originally a continent-sized region extending from the [[Azores]] to the [[Bahamas]], holding an ancient, highly evolved civilization which had ships and aircraft powered by a mysterious form of energy crystal. He also predicted that parts of Atlantis would rise in 1968 or 1969. The [[Bimini Road]], a submerged rock formation of large rectangular stones just off [[Bimini|North Bimini Island]] in the Bahamas, was claimed by [[Robert Ferro]] and Michael Grumley&lt;ref&gt;Ferro and Grumley, ''Atlantis: the Autobiography of a Search'' (New York: Doubleday) 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; to be evidence of the lost civilization.
Edgar Cayce and others have often described Atlantis using techniques associated with [[Psychic archaeology]].

&lt;!-- unsupported:It has been claimed that before the time of [[Eratosthenes]] about 250 BC, Greek writers located the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on the [[Strait of Sicily]], but there is little evidence for this. --&gt;
According to Herodotus (c. 430 BC), a Phoenician expedition had circumnavigated [[Africa]] at the behest of [[Necho II|Pharaoh Necho]], sailing south down the [[Red Sea]] and Indian Ocean and northwards in the Atlantic, re-entering the [[Mediterranean Sea]] through the Pillars of Hercules. His description of northwest Africa makes it very clear that he located the Pillars of Hercules precisely where they are located today. Nevertheless, a supposed belief that they had been placed at the Strait of Sicily prior to Eratosthenes has been cited in some [[Location hypotheses of Atlantis|Atlantis theories]].

[[File:Cayce 1910.jpg|thumb|American psychic [[Edgar Cayce]], 1910]]

====In Nazi mysticism====
The concept of Atlantis attracted [[Nazi mysticism|Nazi theorists]]. In 1938, [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] organized a [[1939 German expedition to Tibet|German expedition to Tibet]] in 1939 to search for Aryan Atlanteans{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, although this suggestion has been criticised as inaccurate&lt;ref&gt;Fortean Times, October 2003, Christopher Hale, Page 31&lt;/ref&gt; and that the expedition was looking for the origins of the 'Europid' race or that it was a more general biological expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Fortean Times, October 2003, Christopher Hale, Page 38&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Julius Evola]], writing in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;Evola, ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'', 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; the Atlanteans were [[Hyperboreans]]—Nordic supermen who originated on the [[North pole]] (see [[Thule]]). Similarly, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', 1930) spoke of a &quot;Nordic-Atlantean&quot; or &quot;Aryan-Nordic&quot; [[master race]].

====Recent times====
As [[continental drift]] became more widely accepted during the 1960s, and the increased understanding of [[plate tectonics]] demonstrated the impossibility of a lost continent in the geologically recent past,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greece Before History: An Archaeological Companion and Guide |last=Runnels |first=Curtis |coauthors=Murray, Priscilla |year=2004 |publisher=Stanford UP |location=Stanford |isbn=0-8047-4036-4 |page=130 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rg4rTjo0OCQC&amp;pg=PA130 |accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most “Lost Continent” theories of Atlantis began to wane in popularity.

Plato scholar Dr. [[Julia Annas]], [[Regents Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Arizona]], had this to say on the matter:

{{quote|The continuing industry of discovering Atlantis illustrates the dangers of reading Plato. For he is clearly using what has become a standard device of fiction—stressing the historicity of an event (and the discovery of hitherto unknown authorities) as an indication that what follows is fiction. ''The idea is that we should use the story to examine our ideas of government and power''. We have missed the point if instead of thinking about these issues we go off exploring the sea bed. The continuing misunderstanding of Plato as historian here enables us to see why his distrust of imaginative writing is sometimes justified.&lt;ref&gt;J. Annas, ''Plato: A Very Short Introduction'' (OUP 2003), p.42 ''(emphasis not in the original)''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Kenneth Feder]] points out that Critias's story in the ''Timaeus'' provides a major clue. In the dialogue, Critias says, referring to Socrates' hypothetical society:

{{quote|And when you were speaking yesterday about your city and citizens, the tale which I have just been repeating to you came into my mind, and I remarked with astonishment how, by some mysterious coincidence, you agreed in almost every particular with the narrative of Solon. ...&lt;ref&gt;''Timaeus'' 25e, Jowett translation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Feder quotes A. E. Taylor, who wrote, &quot;We could not be told much more plainly that the whole narrative of Solon's conversation with the priests and his intention of writing the poem about Atlantis are an invention of Plato's fancy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Kenneth L., ''Frauds, Myths and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology'', Mayfield Publishing, 1999, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Location hypotheses of Atlantis}}
Since Donnelly's day, there have been dozens of locations proposed for Atlantis, to the point where the name has become a generic concept, divorced from the specifics of Plato's account. This is reflected in the fact that many proposed sites are not within the Atlantic at all. Few today are scholarly or archaeological hypotheses, while others have been made by [[psychic]] or other [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] means. Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant time period), but none has been demonstrated to be a true historical Atlantis.

[[File:Santorini Landsat.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Satellite image of the islands of [[Santorini]]. This location is one of many sites purported to have been the location of Atlantis]]

===In or near the Mediterranean Sea===
Most of the historically proposed locations are in or near the Mediterranean Sea: islands such as [[Sardinia]], [[Crete]] and [[Santorini]], [[Sicily]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Malta]]; land-based cities or states such as [[Troy]], [[Tartessos]], and Tantalus (in the province of [[Manisa]]), [[Turkey]]; [[Israel]]-[[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] or [[Canaan]];{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and northwestern [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asalas.org/doku.php |title=Plato's Atlantis in South Morocco? |publisher=Asalas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlantis-bakhu.com/ Atlantis-Bakhu&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thera eruption]], dated to the 17th or 16th century BC, caused a large [[tsunami]] that experts hypothesize devastated the [[Minoan civilization]] on the nearby island of Crete, further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6568053.stm The wave that destroyed Atlantis] Harvey Lilley, BBC News Online, 2007-04-20. Retrieved 2007-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt; A. G. Galanopoulos argued that Plato's dating of 9,000 years before Solon's time was the result of an error in translation, probably from Egyptian into Greek, which produced &quot;thousands&quot; instead of &quot;hundreds&quot;. Such an error would also rescale Plato's Atlantis to the size of Crete, while leaving the city the size of the crater on Thera; 900 years before Solon would be the 15th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Galanopoulos, Angelos Geōrgiou, and Edward Bacon, ''Atlantis: The Truth Behind the Legend'', Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of the [[Black Sea]] the following locations have been proposed: [[Bosporus]] and [[Ancomah]] (a legendary place near [[Trabzon]]).

===In the Atlantic Ocean and Europe===
In 2011, a U.S.-led research team claimed to have found evidence of the city in mud flats of [[Andalusia]], in southern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Zach|title=Lost city of Atlantis, swamped by tsunami, may be found|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/us_tsunami_atlantis|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team identified its possible location within the swamps of the [[Doñana National Park]], north of Cadiz, and speculated that Atlantis had been destroyed by a [[tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/14/lost-no-longer-researchers-claim-to-have-found-atlantis-off-mainland-spain/ |author=Zoe Fox| title=Science Lost No Longer?

The location of Atlantis in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] has certain appeal given the closely related names. Popular culture often places Atlantis there, perpetuating the original Platonic setting. Several hypotheses place the sunken island in northern [[Europe]], including [[Doggerland]] in the [[North Sea]], and [[Sweden]] (by [[Olof Rudbeck]] in ''[[Atland]]'', 1672–1702). Some have proposed the [[Celtic Sea#Seabed|Celtic Shelf]] as a possible locations, and that there is a link to [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lovgren |first=Stefan |title=Atlantis &quot;Evidence&quot; Found in Spain and Ireland |publisher=[[National Geographic]] |date=2004-08-19 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/08/0819_040819_atlantis.html |accessdate=2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira Islands]] have also been identified as a possible location{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}, west of the Straits of Gibraltar but in proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. Various islands or island groups in the Atlantic were also identified as possible locations, notably the [[Azores]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. However detailed geological studies of the Canary Islands, the Azores, Madeira, and the ocean bottom surrounding them found a complete lack of any evidence for the catastrophic subsidence of these islands at any time during their existence and a complete lack of any evidence that the ocean bottom surrounding them was ever dry land at any time in the recent past. The submerged island of [[Spartel]] near the Strait of Gibraltar has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick Gibbs |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/kuhne/ |title=A location for &quot;Atlantis&quot;?

[[File:Memoirs of Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of the first English edition of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s autobiography, 1793]]
An '''autobiography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], αὐτός-''autos'' self +  βίος-''bios'' life + γράφειν-''graphein'' to write) is a book about the life of a person, written by that person.

==Origin of the term==
The word '''''autobiography''''' was first used deprecatingly by [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]] in 1797 in the [[English language|English]] [[Periodical publication|periodical]] the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', when he suggested the word as a hybrid but condemned it as 'pedantic'; but its next recorded use was in its present sense by [[Robert Southey]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt;  The form of autobiography however goes back to antiquity. Biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints; an autobiography, however, may be based entirely on the writer's memory. Closely associated with autobiography (and sometimes difficult to precisely distinguish from it) is the form of [[memoir]].

''See also: [[List of autobiographies]] and [[:Category:Autobiographies]] for examples.''

==Autobiography through the ages==
===The classical period: Apologia, oration, confession===
In antiquity such works  were typically entitled ''[[wikt:apology|apologia]],'' implying as an example of  much self-justification as self-documentation. [[John Henry Newman]]'s autobiography (first published in 1864) is entitled ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in reference to this tradition.

The [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Libanius]] (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (''Oration I'' begun in 374) as one of his [[Public speaking|orations]], not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could be read aloud in privacy.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430) applied the title ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' to his autobiographical work, and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used the same title in the 18th century,  initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and beyond.

In the spirit of Augustine's ''Confessions'' is the 11th-century ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' of [[Peter Abelard]], outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.

===Early autobiographies===
[[File:Baburnama.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''[[Baburnama]]''.]]

In the 15th century, a Spanish noble woman named [[Leonor López de Córdoba]] wrote her ''Memorias'', which are considered to be the first autobiography in [[Spanish language|Castillian]].

[[Babur|Zāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur]],who founded the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] of [[South Asia]] kept a journal ''[[Baburnama|Bāburnāma]]'' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]/{{lang-fa|بابر نامہ}}; literally: ''&quot;Book of Babur&quot;'' or ''&quot;Letters of Babur&quot;'') which was written between 1493 and 1529.

One of the first great autobiographies of the [[Renaissance]] is that of the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply ''Vita'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Life''). He declares at the start: &quot;No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto Cellini, tr. George Bull, ''The Autobiography'', London 1966 p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.

Another autobiography of the period is ''De vita propria'', by the Italian physician and astrologer [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1574).

The earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century ''Booke of [[Margery Kempe]]'', describing among other things her pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] and visit to [[Rome]]. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.

Notable English autobiographies of the seventeenth century include those of [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1643, published 1764) and [[John Bunyan]] (''Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners'', 1666).

===Memoirs===
{{Main|Memoir}}
A memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the &quot;life and times&quot; of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of [[Leonor López de Córdoba]] (1362–1420) who wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir [[Edmund Ludlow]] and Sir [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|John Reresby]]. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of [[Jean François Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz|Cardinal de Retz]] (1614–1679) and the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]] 2001/2010.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Notable 18th-century autobiographies in English include those of [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Following the trend of [[Romanticism]], which greatly emphasised the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. An English example is [[William Hazlitt]]'s ''Liber Amoris'' (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.

With the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], but also politicians (e.g. [[Henry Brooks Adams]]), philosophers (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]), churchmen such as [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], and entertainers such as [[P. T. Barnum]]. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of &quot;Cellinian&quot; autobiography.
&lt;!--work in progress—to be developed --&gt;

==Nature of autobiography==
Autobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.&lt;ref&gt;Berghegger, Scott. (2005). &quot;Sublime Inauthenticity: How critical is truth in autobiography?&quot; Student Pulse. http://studentpulse.com/articles/31/sublime-inauthenticity-how-critical-is-truth-in-autobiography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions of the autobiography form==
===Autobiographies as critiques of totalitarianism===
Victims and opponents of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes have been able to present striking critiques of these regimes through autobiographical accounts of their oppression. Among the more renowned of such works are the writings of [[Primo Levi]], one of many personal accounts of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]]. Similarly, there are many works detailing atrocities and malevolence of [[Communism|Communist]] regimes (e.g., [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]]'s  ''Hope against Hope'').

===Sensationalist and celebrity &quot;autobiographies&quot;===
From the 17th century onwards, &quot;scandalous memoirs&quot; by supposed [[libertine]]s, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically [[pseudonym]]ous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by [[ghostwriter]]s.

So-called &quot;autobiographies&quot; of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a [[ghostwriter]], are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as [[Tyler J]], admit to not having read their &quot;autobiographies&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Autobiographies of the non-famous===
Until recent years, few people without some genuine claim to fame wrote or published autobiographies for the general public.  With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as ''[[Angela’s Ashes]]'' and ''[[The Color of Water]]'', however, more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.

===Fake autobiographies===
This trend has also encouraged [[Fake memoirs|fake autobiographies]], particularly those associated with '' '[[misery lit]]'',' where the writer has allegedly suffered from being a part of a [[dysfunctional family]], or from social problems, or [[political repression]].

===Fictional autobiography===
The term &quot;fictional autobiography&quot; has been coined to define novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own biography, of which [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'', is an early example. [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' is another such classic, and [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., [[Robert Nye]]'s ''Memoirs of [[Lord Byron]]''.

'''Arcadius''' ({{lang-la|[[Flavius]] Arcadius Augustus}}; {{lang-el|{{Polytonic|Ἀρκάδιος}}}}; 377/378 – 1 May 408) was the [[Byzantine Emperor|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Emperor]] from 395 to his death. He was the eldest son of [[Theodosius I]] and his first wife [[Aelia Flaccilla]], and brother of the western emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. A weak ruler, his reign was dominated by a series of powerful ministers and by his wife, [[Aelia Eudoxia]].

==History==
Arcadius was born in [[Hispania]], the elder son of [[Theodosius I]] and [[Aelia Flaccilla]], and brother of [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], who would become a [[Western Roman Emperor]]. His father declared him an [[Augustus]] and co-ruler for the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern half of the Empire]] in January, 383. His younger brother was also declared Augustus in 393, for the Western half.

As emperors, Honorius was under the control of the Romanized Vandal ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho|Flavius Stilicho]] while Arcadius was dominated by one of his ministers, [[Rufinus (consul)|Rufinus]]. Stilicho is alleged by some to have wanted control of both emperors, and is supposed to have had Rufinus assassinated by Gothic mercenaries in 395; though definite proof of Stilicho's involvement in the assassination is lacking, the intense competition and political jealousies engendered by the two figures compose the main thread of the first part of Arcadius' reign. Arcadius' new advisor, the eunuch [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius]], simply took Rufinus' place as the power behind the Eastern imperial throne.

Arcadius was also dominated by his wife [[Aelia Eudoxia]], who convinced her husband to dismiss Eutropius, who was holding the consulate, at the height of his power, in 399. That same year, on the 13th July, Arcadius issued an edict ordering that [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|all remaining non-Christian temples should be immediately demolished]].

Eudoxia's influence was strongly opposed by [[John Chrysostom]], the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], who felt that she had used her family's wealth to gain control over the emperor.  Eudoxia used her influence to have Chrysostom deposed in 404, but she died later that year. Eudoxia gave to Arcadius four children: three daughters, [[Pulcheria]], Arcadia and Marina, and one son, Theodosius, the future Emperor [[Theodosius II]].

Arcadius was dominated for the rest of his rule by [[Anthemius (praetorian prefect)|Anthemius]], the [[Praetorian prefect|Praetorian Prefect]], who made peace with Stilicho in the West.  Arcadius himself was more concerned with appearing to be a pious [[Christianity|Christian]] than he was with political or military matters, and he died, only nominally in control of his empire, in 408.

==Character and works==
In this reign of a weak emperor dominated by court politics, a major theme was the ambivalence felt by prominent individuals and the court parties that formed and regrouped round them towards [[barbarian]]s, which in Constantinople at this period meant [[Goths]]. In the well-documented episode that revolved around [[Gainas]], a number of Gothic ''foederati'' stationed in the capital were massacred, the survivors fleeing under the command of Gainas to [[Thrace]], where they were tracked down by imperial troops and slaughtered and Gainas dispatched.  The episode has been traditionally interpreted as a paroxysm of anti-barbarian reaction that served to stabilise the East. The main source for the affair is a mythology ''à clef'' by [[Synesius]] of Cyrene, ''Aegyptus sive de providentia'', (400)&lt;ref&gt;The date 400 is argued for by Cameron and Long 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; an Egyptianising allegory that embodies a covert account of the events, the exact interpretation of which continues to baffle scholars. Synesius' ''De regno'', which claims to be addressed to Arcadius himself, contains a tirade against Goths.

A new [[forum of Arcadius|forum]] was built in the name of Arcadius, on the seventh hill of Constantinople, the ''Xērolophos'', in which a [[column of Arcadius|column]] was begun to commemorate his 'victory' over Gainas (although the column was only completed after Arcadius' death by [[Theodosius II]]).

The [[Pentelic marble]] portrait head of Arcadius (''illustration'') was discovered in Istanbul close to the Forum Tauri, in June 1949, in excavating foundations for new buildings of the University at [[Beyazit]].&lt;ref&gt;Nezih Firatli, &quot;A Late Antique Imperial Portrait Recently Discovered at Istanbul&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''55'''.1 (January 1951), pp. 67–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The neck was designed to be inserted in a torso, but no statue, base or inscription was found. The [[diadem]] is a fillet with rows of pearls along its edges and a rectangular stone set about with pearls over the young emperor's forehead.

'''Arab people''' also known as &quot;Arabs&quot; ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;عرب&lt;/big&gt;}}, ''ʿarab'') are an [[ethnic group]] or [[panethnicity]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hgm2011.org/ghazi_tadmouri_-_abstract.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://histclo.com/country/cou-mea.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=40Zv8DC4g38C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=arabs+panethnicity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h7x2ODT1_I&amp;sig=kGTXpQAttO1BebQcOq2ZmOQXqv4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V4ZpTfCzK8mxhAeR-IihDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_latin_american_geography/summary/v007/7.2.miyares.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=iAPLHidx8MkC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;lpg=PA405#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; primarily living in the [[Arab world]] which is located in [[West Asia]] and [[North Africa]]. They are [[identity (social science)|identified]] as such on one or more of [[genealogy|genealogical]], [[natural language|linguistic]], or [[culture|cultural]] grounds.&lt;ref name=Deng&gt;Francis Mading Deng [http://books.google.com/books?id=iAPLHidx8MkC&amp;pg=PA405 War of visions: conflict of identities in the Sudan], Brookings Institution Press, 1995, ISBN 0-8157-1793-8 p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; with tribal affiliations, and intra-tribal relationships playing an important part of Arab identity in tracing descent of a national from an [[Arab League|Arab state]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas S. Hopkins, Saad Eddin Ibrahim eds., ''Arab society: class, gender, power, and development'', American University in Cairo Press, 1997, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Further|[[Etymology of the word Arab]]}}

The earliest documented use of the word &quot;Arab&quot; as defining a group of people dates from the 9th century BC in [[Assyria]]n records which describe the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name=Retsop105&gt;Jan Retsö [http://books.google.com/books?id=pUepRuQO8ZkC&amp;pg=PA105 The Arabs in antiquity: their history from the Assyrians to the Umayyads], Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-7007-1679-3, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular Arab account holds that the word 'Arab' came from an eponymous father called [[Yarab]], who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic. [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī|Al-Hamdani]] had another view; he states that Arabs were called Gh'''Arab''' (West in Semitic) by Mesopotamians because Arabs resided in Western Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into Arab. Yet another view is held by [[Al-Masudi]] that the word Arabs was initially applied to the [[Ishmaelites]] of the &quot;'Arabah''&quot; valley.

The root of the word has many meanings in Semitic languages including &quot;west/sunset,&quot; &quot;desert,&quot; &quot;mingle,&quot; &quot;merchant,&quot; &quot;raven&quot; and are &quot;comprehensible&quot; with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathetical]] from {{transl|sem|ʿ-B-R}} &quot;moving around&quot; (Arabic {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ-B-R}} &quot;traverse&quot;), and hence, it is alleged, &quot;nomadic.&quot;

==Identity==
Arab identity is defined independently of [[religion|religious]] identity, and pre-dates the rise of [[Islam]], with historically attested [[Arab Christian]] kingdoms and [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Arab Jewish tribes]]. Today, however, most Arabs are Muslim, with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christianity]]. Muslim but non-Arab people, who are about 80% of the world's [[Muslim population]], do not form part of the [[Arab World]], but instead comprise what is the geographically larger, and more diverse, [[Muslim World]].

[[Arabic]], the main unifying feature among Arabs, is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] originating in [[Arabia]]. From there it spread to a variety of distinct peoples across most of [[West Asia]] and [[North Africa]],&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Arab |title=Arab |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=1945-03-22 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in their [[acculturation]] and eventual denomination as Arabs. [[Arabization]], a culturo-linguistic shift, was often, though not always, in conjunction with [[Islamization]], a religious shift.

With the rise of [[Islam]] in the 7th century, and as the language of the [[Qur'an]], Arabic became the [[lingua franca]] of the wider [[Mediterranean]] region. It was in this period that Arabic language and culture was widely disseminated with the early [[Spread of Islam|Islamic expansion]], both [[Muslim conquests|through conquest]] and [[Acculturation|cultural contact]].&lt;ref name=IslamAr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa032300a.htm |title=Islam and the Arabic language |publisher=Islam.about.com |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arabic culture]] and language, however, began a more limited diffusion before the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic age]], first spreading in West Asia beginning in the 2nd century, as [[Arab Christians]] such as the [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Banu Judham]] began migrating north from Arabia into the [[Syrian Desert]], [[Iraq]] and the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name=BanuJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch1s1.html |title=Banu Judham migration |publisher=Witness-pioneer.org |date=2002-09-16 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ghassan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~andyf/hist_arab.html#Linguistic%20Situation%20in%20Pre-Islamic%20Middle%20East |title=Ghassanids Arabic linguistic influence in Syria |publisher=Personal.umich.edu |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabs are generally [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]], or [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] Muslims, but currently, 7.1% to 10% of Arabs are [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Arab Christians]].&lt;ref name=Pacini&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Philippe Fargues |title=Christian Communities in the Middle East|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-829388-7 |editor= Andrea Pacini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, defining who is an Arab is done on the grounds of one or more of the following three criteria:
[[File:Arabic speaking world.svg|thumb|Distribution of Arabic as sole official language (green) and one of several official or national languages (blue).]]
*[[Genealogy|Genealogical]]: someone who can trace his or her ancestry to the [[tribes of Arabia]] – the original inhabitants of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] – and the [[Syrian Desert]]. This definition was the definition used in [[medieval]] times, for example by [[Ibn Khaldun]], but has decreased in importance over time, as a portion of those of Arab ancestry lost their links with their ancestors motherland, yet in the modern time DNA tests provided reliable results. It is noticed that the frequency of the &quot;Arab marker&quot; Haplogroup J1 collapses suddenly at the borders of Arabic speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;(Regueiro et al.) 2006; found agreement by (Battaglia et al.) 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Language|Linguistic]]: someone whose [[first language]], and by extension cultural expression, is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], including any of [[Varieties of Arabic|its varieties]]. This definition covers more than 300 million people. Certain groups that fulfill this criterion reject this definition on the basis of non-Arab ancestry; such an example may be seen in the way that [[Egyptian identity|Egyptians identified themselves in the early 20th century]].&lt;ref name=Jankowskip244&gt;Jankowski, James. &quot;Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism&quot; in Rashid Kakhlidi, ed., Origins of Arab Nationalism, pp. 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawishp99&gt;Quoted in Dawisha, Adeed. [http://books.google.com/books?id=PjhqEusGs0UC&amp;pg=PA99 Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century. Princeton University Press. 2003, ISBN 0-691-12272-5, p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Political geography|Political]]: in the modern [[nationalism|nationalist]] era, any person who is a [[citizen]] of a country where [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is either the [[national language]] or one of the [[official languages]], and/or a citizen of a country which may simply be a member of the [[Arab League]] (thereby having Arabic as an official government language, even if not used by the majority of the population). This definition would cover over 300 million people. It may be the most contested definition, as it is the most simplistic one. It would exclude the entire [[Arab diaspora]] outside of the Arab world and include people who do not identify themselves as Arabs.

The relative importance of these three factors is estimated differently by different groups and frequently disputed. Some combine aspects of each definition, as done by [[Habib Hassan Touma]],&lt;ref name=Toumapxviii&gt;1996, p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt; who defines an ''Arab'' &quot;in the modern sense of the word&quot;, as &quot;one who is a national of an Arab state, has command of the Arabic language, and possesses a fundamental knowledge of Arab tradition, that is, of the manners, customs, and political and social systems of the culture.&quot; Most people who consider themselves Arab do so based on the overlap of the political and linguistic definitions.
Few people consider themselves Arab based on the political definition without also having Arabic as a language. Thus few [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] and [[Berber people|Berbers]] identify as Arab, although for instance some Berbers also consider themselves Arab.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest and Micaud, Charles, Eds. Arabs and Berbers: from tribe to nation in North Africa. Lexington: Lexington Books, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious minorities within Western Asia and North Africa who speak Arabic or any of its varieties as their primary community language.

The [[Arab League]], a regional organization of [[countries]] intended to encompass the Arab world, defines an Arab as:
{{cquote|An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic-speaking country, and who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic-speaking peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Fletcher Reynolds, ''Arab folklore'': a handbook, (Greenwood Press: 2007), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The relation of ''{{transl|ar|ʿarab}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' is complicated further by the notion of &quot;lost Arabs&quot; ''{{transl|ar|al-ʿArab al-ba'ida}}'' mentioned in the Qur'an as punished for their disbelief. All contemporary Arabs were considered as descended from two ancestors, [[Qahtan]] and [[Adnan]].

Versteegh (1997) is uncertain whether to ascribe this distinction to the memory of a real difference of origin of the two groups, but it is certain that the difference was strongly felt in early Islamic times. Even in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] there was enmity between the Qays of the northern and the Kalb of the southern group. The so-called [[Himyarite language]] described by [[Al-Hamdani]] (died 946) appears to be a special case of language contact between the two groups, an originally north Arabic dialect spoken in the south, and influenced by [[Old South Arabian]].

During the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Arabs forged an [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] (under the [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]]s, and later the [[Abbasid]]s) whose borders touched southern [[France]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Asia Minor]] in the north, and the [[Sudan]] in the south. This was one of the [[List of empires|largest land empires in history]]. In much of this area, the Arabs spread [[Islam]] and the Arabic culture, Science, and Language (the language of the [[Qur'an]]) through [[Religious conversion|conversion]] and [[cultural assimilation]].

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation Arab migrants in the world, of which 5.8 reside in Arab countries. Arab expatriates contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009 Arab countries received a total of 35.1 billion USD in [[remittance]] in-flows and remittances sent to [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf Intra-Regional Labour Mobility in the Arab World], International Organization for Migration (IOM) Cairo&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Asia and Caucasus'''

{{See|Arabs in the Caucasus|Emirate of Tbilisi|Emirate of Armenia|History of Arabs in Afghanistan}}
In 1728, a Russian officer described a group of Sunni Arab nomads who populated the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] shores of [[Mughan plain|Mughan]] (in present-day [[Azerbaijan]]) and spoke a mixed Turkic-Arabic language.&lt;ref name=Genko&gt;Genko, A. ''The Arabic Language and Caucasian Studies''. USSR Academy of Sciences Publ. Moscow-Leningrad. 8–109&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that these groups migrated to the [[Caucasus]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;zelkina&quot;&gt;Zelkina, Anna.

Today in Azerbaijan alone, there are nearly 30 settlements still holding the name ''Arab'' (for example, [[Ərəbqədim|Arabgadim]], [[Ərəbocağı|Arabojaghy]], [[Ərəbyengicə|Arab-Yengija]], etc.).

From the time of the Arab conquest of the [[Caucasus]], continuous small-scale Arab migration from various parts of the Arab world was observed in [[Dagestan]] influencing and shaping the culture of the local peoples. Up until the mid-20th century, there were still individuals in Dagestan who claimed Arabic to be their native language, with the majority of them living in the village of Darvag to the north-west of [[Derbent]]. The latest of these accounts dates to the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;zelkina&quot;/&gt; Most Arab communities in southern Dagestan underwent linguistic Turkicisation, thus nowadays Darvag is a majority-Azeri village.&lt;ref name=Sefer&gt;Seferbekov, Ruslan.

According to the ''History of Ibn Khaldun'', the Arabs that were once in Central Asia have been either killed or have fled the Tatar invasion of the region, leaving only the locals .&lt;ref name=Khaldun&gt;History of Ibn Khaldun&lt;/ref&gt; However, today many people in Central Asia identify as Arabs. Most [[Central Asian Arabic|Arabs of Central Asia]] are fully integrated into local populations, and sometimes call themselves the same as locals (for example, [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], [[Uzbeks]]) but they use special titles to show their Arabic origin such as [[Sayyid]], [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] or [[Siddiqui]].&lt;ref name=Owensp184&gt;Arabic As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-Islamic===
{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia}}

'''Semitic Origin'''

There is a consensus that the Semitic peoples originated from [[Arabian peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Babylonians and Assyrians, George Stephen Goodspeed‏. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; deriving{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} the entire population of [[Mesopotamia]] from population movements out of ''[[Arabian peninsula|Jazirat al-Arab]]'' (&quot;island of the Arabs&quot;) – an area between the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], with [[Hadramawt]] its southern perimeter, extending northward up to the area just east of the [[Dead Sea]] ([[Jordan]]).&lt;ref name=Craggp13&gt;Cragg, 1991, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[Semitic]] peoples from the [[Ancient Near East]], such as the [[Arameans]], [[Akkadians]] and [[Canaanites]], built civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]]; genetically, they often interlapped and mixed.&lt;ref name=Semitic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769 |title=Journal of Semitic Studies Volume 52, Number 1 |publisher=Pnas.org |date=2000-06-06 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly, however, they lost their political domination of the [[Near East]] due to internal turmoil and attacks by non-Semitic peoples. Although the Semites eventually lost political control of Western Asia to the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Aramaic language]] remained the [[lingua franca]] of Mesopotamia and the Levant. Aramaic itself was replaced by Greek as Western Asia's prestige language following the conquest of [[Alexander III of Macedon]].

'''Early History'''

The first written attestation of the ethnonym &quot;Arab&quot; occurs in an [[Assyria]]n inscription of 853 BCE, where [[Shalmaneser III]] lists a King [[Gindibu]] of ''mâtu arbâi'' (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the [[Battle of Karkar]]. Some of the names given in these texts are [[Aramaic]], while others are the first attestations of [[Ancient North Arabian|Proto-Arabic]] dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated &quot;Arab&quot;: ''Arabi, Arubu, Aribi'' and ''Urbi''. Many of the [[Qedarite]] queens were also described as queens of the ''aribi''. The [[Hebrew Bible]] occasionally refers to ''Arvi'' peoples (or variants thereof), translated as &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Arabian.&quot; The scope of the term at that early stage is unclear, but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling [[Semitic]] tribes in the [[Syrian Desert]] and [[Arabia]].

[[File:Peasant Family of Ramallah 1900-1910.jpg|thumb|Arab family of [[Ramallah]], early 1900s]]

Medieval Arab [[genealogist]]s divided Arabs into three groups:
*&quot;Ancient Arabs&quot;, tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as [['Ad]] and [[Thamud]], often mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] as examples of God's power to destroy wicked peoples.
*&quot;Pure Arabs&quot; of South Arabia, descending from [[Qahtan]]. The [[Qahtanite]]s (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated the land of [[Yemen]] following the destruction of the [[Ma'rib Dam]] (''sadd Ma'rib'').
*The &quot;Arabized Arabs&quot; (''musta`ribah'') of center and North Arabia, descending from [[Ishmael]] son of [[Abraham]]. The Book of [[Jubilees]] claims that the sons of [[Ishmael]] intermingled with the 6 sons of [[Keturah]] from [[Abraham]] and their descendants were called [[Arabs]] and [[Ishmaelites]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Book of [[Jubilees]] 20:13 ''And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of [[Keturah]] and their sons, went together and dwelt from [[Desert of Paran|Paran]] to the entering in of [[Babylon]] in all the land which is towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called [[Arabs]], and [[Ishmaelites]].''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddima]]'' distinguishes between sedentary Muslims who used to be [[nomad]]ic Arabs and the Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term &quot;formerly-nomadic&quot; Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in, as in [[Egyptians]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Yemen]]is.&lt;ref name=Levity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/islam20.html |title=Levity.com, Islam |publisher=Levity.com |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians of Italy and the Crusaders preferred the term [[Saracens]] for all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.&lt;ref name=Lionheart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm |title=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com |publisher=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians of Iberia used the term [[Moors|Moor]] to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.
Muslims of [[Medina]] referred to the [[nomadic]] tribes of the deserts as the A'raab, and considered themselves sedentary, but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term &quot;A'raab' mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria.

The [[Qur'an]] does not use the word ''{{transl|ar|ʿarab}}'', only the [[nisba]] adjective ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}''. The Qur'an calls itself ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}'', &quot;Arabic&quot;, and ''{{transl|ar|Mubin}}'', &quot;clear&quot;. The two qualities are connected for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2–3, &quot;By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand&quot;. The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the ''{{transl|ar|al-ʿarabiyya}}'', the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[I`rab|{{transl|ar|ʾiʿrāb}}]]'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ayat [[At-Tawba|9]].97, ''{{transl|ar|alʾaʿrābu ʾašaddu kufrān wa nifāqān}}'' &quot;the Bedouin are the worst in [[kufr|disbelief]] and hypocrisy&quot;.

Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}'' referred to the language, and ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the [[Islamic conquest]] of the 8th century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{transl|ar|kalam al-ʿArab}}, &quot;language of the Arabs&quot;, denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.

'''Classical Kingdoms'''
{{main|Palmyra|Nabateans}}
[[File:Al Khazneh.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the Nabateans]]
Proto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]ic south Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]'' script, including the 8th century BCE [[Al-Hasa|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE [[Lihyanite]] texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout Arabia and the [[Sinai]] (not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]).

The [[Nabataeans]] were nomadic newcomers&lt;ref name=Biblical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalisraeltours.com/Arch/ArchaeologyJordan.htm |title=Biblical Israel Tours |publisher=Biblical Israel Tours |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2009}} who moved into territory vacated by the [[Edomites]] – Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean Alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw (near [[Sulayyil]]) reveal a dialect which is no longer considered &quot;proto-Arabic&quot;, but pre-classical Arabic. Five [[Syriac language|Syriac]] inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at [[Sumatar Harabesi]], one of which has been dated to the 2nd century CE.

'''Late Kingdoms'''
{{See|Lakhmids|Ghassanids|Kindites}}

The [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Kindites]] were the last major migration of non-Muslims out of Yemen to the north.
*The [[Ghassanids]] revived the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. They mainly settled in the [[Hauran]] region and spread to modern [[Lebanon]], Palestine and East Jordan. The Ghassanids held Syria until the expansion of [[Islam]].

Greeks and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen &quot;[[Arabia Felix]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Diony&gt;[http://www.infilled.net/Infilled.net/reference/World%20map%20according%20to%20Dionysius,%20124%20A.D/Reconstruction%20of%20the%20world%20map%20according%20to%20Dionysius,%20124%20A.D..gif Reconstruction of the World Map according to Dionysus]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the [[Roman Empire]] &quot;[[Arabia Petraea]]&quot; after the city of [[Petra]], and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east [[Arabia Magna]].
*The [[Lakhmids]] as a dynasty inherited their power from the [[Tanukh]]ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital [[Al-Hira]] they ended up allying with the [[Sassanid]] against the [[Ghassanids]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the [[Kindites]] with the Lakhmids eventually destroying [[Kindah|Kinda]] in 540 after the fall of their main ally [[Himyar]]. The Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under thir direct control.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bailey [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&amp;pg=PR59 The Cambridge history of Iran : The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods], Volume 1'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, ISBN 0-521-20092-X p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Kindites]] migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais [[Rabi'a]]{{dn}} tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arbia from &quot;Qaryah Dhat Kahl&quot; (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw) in Central Arabia. They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, till they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir]], and his son [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|'Amr]]

In 661 [[Caliphate]] turned to the hands of the [[Umayyad]] dynasty, [[Damascus]] was established as the [[Muslim]] capital. They were proud of their Arab ancestry and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at [[Ramla]], [[ar-Raqqah]], [[Basra]], [[Kufa]], [[Mosul]] and [[Samarra]], all of which developed into major cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunde&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lunde |first=Paul |title=Islam |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |pages= 50–52 |location=New York |isbn=0-7894-8797-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686.&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Saunders, ''A history of medieval Islam'', Routledge, 1965, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the [[Arabization]] of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph [[Umar II]] strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the situation, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the [[Abbasid]]s came to power and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].

Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Prior to the Arab conquest, North Africa was inhibited by various people including [[Punics]], Vandals and Greeks. It was not until the 11th century that the Maghreb saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin [[Banu Hilal]] tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the [[Fatimids]] to punish the Berber [[Zirids]] for abandoning [[Shia Islam|Shiism]], they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring [[Hammadid]]s. Their influx was a major factor in the Arabization of the Maghreb, Although Berbers would rule the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the [[Almoravids]], the [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], etc.), the arrival of these tribes would eventually help to Arabize much of it ethnically in addition to the linguistic and political impact on the none-Arabs there. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in [[1031]] AD, [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] was divided into small kingdoms.

'''Abbassid Era''' (750-1513)
{{main|Abbasid Caliphate}}

Abbasids let a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the [[Battle of the Zab]] effectively ending their rule in all part of the Empire except [[Al-Andalus]]. The Abbasids descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[Abbas]], but unlike the Ummayads, they had the support of non-Arab subjects of the Umayyads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunde&quot;/&gt; where Umayyads treated non-Arabs in contempt. Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when [[Wilayah|Wilayas]] begain to fracture, afterwards in the 1190s there was a revival for their power which was put to end by the Mongols who conquered Baghdad and killed the Caliph, members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which fractured from the Abbasid rule two years earlier, the Mamluk generals were taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.

====Ottoman Caliphate====
Arabs were ruled by Ottoman sultans from 1513 to 1922. Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate when they choose to bear the title of [[Caliph]]. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Jew]]s from Arab countries – mainly [[Mizrahi Jews]] and [[Yemenite Jews]] – are today usually not categorised as Arab.

Prior to the emergence of the term ''Mizrahi'', the term &quot;[[Arab Jews]]&quot; was sometimes used to describe Jews of the [[Arab world]]. The term is rarely used today. The few remaining Jews in the Arab countries reside mostly in [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]. From the late 1940s to the early 1960s, following the creation of the state of Israel, most of these Jews fled their countries of birth and are now mostly concentrated in Israel. Some immigrated to [[France]], where they form the largest Jewish community, outnumbering [[Ashkenazi Jews|European Jews]], but relatively few to the [[United States]].

The [[Islam]]ic [[Golden Age]] was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to the newly founded city [[Baghdad]]. The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as &quot;The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs&quot; stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the [[Muslim world]] became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the &quot;[[House of Wisdom]]&quot; (Arabic: بيت الحكمة) in Baghdad. Rival Muslim dynasties such as the [[Fatimid]]s of [[Egypt]] and the [[Umayyad]]s of [[al-Andalus]] were also major intellectual centres with cities such as [[Cairo]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] rivaling [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot;&gt;Vartan Gregorian, &quot;Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith&quot;, Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26–38 ISBN 0-8157-3283-X&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armadillos''' are New World [[placenta]]l [[mammal]]s, known for having a leathery [[armour (zoology)|armor]] shell. '''Dasypodidae''' is the only surviving [[family (biology)|family]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Cingulata''', part of the superorder [[Xenarthra]] along with the [[anteater]]s and [[sloth]]s. The word ''armadillo'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;little armored one&quot;.  The Aztec called them ''azotochtli'', [[Nahuatl]] for “turtle-rabbit.”&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=9XOc2_u7z6cC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=armadillo+turtle+rabbit+encyclopedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lRy8f_iBwd&amp;sig=krLXBrz8xpx1e4JWn1eZsQ4Oi9Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=siKnTcp5kZe3B_betYUB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately ten [[extant taxon|extant]] [[genus|genera]] and around 20 extant [[species]] of armadillo, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armor. Their average length is about {{convert|75|cm|in}}, including tail; the [[Giant Armadillo]] grows up to {{convert|150|cm|in}} and weighs up to {{convert|59|kg|lb}}, while the [[Pink Fairy Armadillo]]s are diminutive species with an overall length of {{convert|12|to|15|cm|in|sigfig=1}}. All species are native to the [[Americas]], where they inhabit a variety of environments.

In the [[United States]], the sole resident armadillo is the [[Nine-banded Armadillo]] ''(Dasypus novemcinctus)'', which is most common in the central southernmost states, particularly [[Texas]]. Their range is as far east as [[South Carolina]] and [[Florida]] and as far north as [[Nebraska]]; they have been consistently expanding their range over the last century due to a lack of natural predators and have been found as far north as southern [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.msu.edu/~nixonjos/armadillo/expansion.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and anatomy==
[[Image:Armadillo model at Lubbock Lake Landmark IMG_1586.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Armadillo model at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]

Armadillos are prolific diggers with sharp claws. Many species use their sharp claws to dig for food, such as [[grub]]s, and to dig dens. The Nine-banded Armadillo prefers to build [[burrow]]s in moist [[soil]] near the creeks, streams, and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] around which it lives and feeds. The diet of different armadillo species varies, but consists mainly of [[insect]]s, grubs, and other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species, however, feed almost entirely on ants and termites.

In common with other xenarthrans, armadillos in general have low [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]s (33–36 °[[Celsius|C]]) and [[basal metabolic rate]]s (from 40–60% of that expected in a placental mammal of their mass). This is particularly true of types that specialize on using termites as their primary food source (for example, ''[[Priodontes]]'' and ''[[Tolypeutes]]'').&lt;ref name = &quot;McNab&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Armadillos have poor vision, but large eyes.

The armor is formed by plates of dermal bone covered in relatively small, overlapping epidermal scales called &quot;[[scute]]s&quot;, composed of bone with a covering of horn. In most species, there are rigid shields over the shoulders and hips, with a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks. Additional armor covers the top of the head, the upper parts of the limbs, and the tail. The underside of the animal is never armored, and is simply covered with soft skin and fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D. |author=Dickman, Christopher R. |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=781–783 |isbn=0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This armor-like skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillos, although most escape predators by fleeing (often into thorny patches, from which their armor protects them) or digging to safety. Only the [[South America]]n three-banded armadillos (''Tolypeutes'') rely heavily on their armor for protection. When threatened by a [[predator]], ''Tolypeutes'' species frequently roll up into a ball. Other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates. The North American Nine-banded Armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised, and consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/armadillo.html |title=How high can a nine-banded armadillo jump? (Everyday Mysteries: Fun Science Facts from the Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armadillos have short legs but can move quite quickly, and have the ability to remain underwater for as long as six minutes. Because of the density of its armor, an armadillo will sink in water unless it inflates its stomach and intestines with air, which often doubles its size and allows it to swim across narrow bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flex.net/~lonestar/armadillo.htm Armadillos - Nine-Banded Armadillo - Texas Wildlife&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Armadillos use their claws for digging and finding food, as well as for making their homes in burrows. They dig their burrows with their claws, only making a single corridor where they fit themselves. They have five clawed toes on the hindfeet, and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on the forefeet. Armadillos have a large number of cheek teeth, which are not divided into [[premolar]]s and [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, but usually have [[incisor]]s or [[canine (tooth)|canine]]s. The [[dentition]] of the nine-banded armadillo is P 7/7, M 1/1 = 32.&lt;ref name=Freeman&amp;Genoways&gt;{{citation |date=December 1998 |author=Freeman, Patricia W., &amp; Genoways, Hugh H |title=Recent Northern Records of the Nine-banded Armadillo (Dasypodidae) in Nebraska |journal=The Southwestern Naturalist |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=491–504 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=museummammalogy |accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gestation]] lasts anywhere from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits [[delayed implantation]], so that the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of the genus ''Dasypus'' give birth to four [[monozygotic]] young (that is, identical quadruplets), but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight. The young are born with soft leathery skin, which hardens within a few weeks, and reach sexual maturity in 3–12 months, depending on the species. Armadillos are solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot; /&gt;

==Armadillos and humans==
===In science===
Armadillos are often used in the study of [[leprosy]], since they, along with [[mangabey]] [[monkey]]s, [[rabbit]]s and [[Mouse|mice]] (on their footpads), are among the few known non-human animal species that can contract the disease systemically. They are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature, which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium, ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''. (The leprosy bacterium is difficult to culture and armadillos have a body temperature of 34 °C, similar to human skin.)  Humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat, and are a presumed [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] and [[natural reservoir]] for the disease in Texas and Louisiana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Truman |first=Richard W. |title=Probable Zoonotic Leprosy in the Southern United States |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=364 |year=2011 |month=April |page=1626-1633 |publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010536 |accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century, leprosy was unknown in the New World.  Given that armadillos are native to the New World, at some point they acquired the disease from humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armadillos Can Transmit Leprosy to Humans, Federal Studies Confirm |author=Gardiner Harris |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/health/28leprosy.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=27 April 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman 2011&quot; /&gt;

The [[Nine-banded Armadillo]] also serves science through its unusual [[reproduction|reproductive]] system, in which four [[genetics|genetically]] identical [[Multiple birth|quadruplets]] are born in each litter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ufl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/UW082 |title=The Nine-banded Armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) |publisher=Edis.ifas.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;valdosta&quot;&gt;{{citation |date=May–June 1998 |author=Loughry, W.J; Prodohl, Paulo A; McDonough, Colleen M; &amp; [[John Avise|Avise, John C]]|title=Polyembryony in Armadillos |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=86 |pages=274–279 |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/~jloughry/Reprints/AmSci.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamlett1933&quot;&gt;{{citation |date=September 1933 |author=Hamlett, G.W.D |title=Polyembryony in the Armadillo: Genetic or Physiological? |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=348–358 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0033-5770(193309)8%3A3%3C348%3APITAGO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because they are always genetically identical, the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific, behavioral or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects. This is the only reliable manifestation of [[polyembryony]] in the class [[mammalia]], and only exists within the genus ''[[Dasypus]]'' and not in all armadillos, as is commonly believed. Other species which display this trait include parasitoid wasps, certain flatworms and various aquatic invertebrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;valdosta&quot; /&gt;

Armadillos (mainly ''Dasypus'') make common roadkill due to their habit of jumping to about [[fender (vehicle)|fender]] height when startled (such as by an oncoming car). Wildlife enthusiasts are using the northward march of the armadillo as an opportunity to educate others about the animals, which can be a burrowing nuisance to property owners and managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ufl&quot; /&gt;

The Armadillo is a [[natural reservoir]] for [[Chagas Disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3128127  Yaeger RG. 1988. The prevalence of ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' infection in armadillos collected at a site near New Orleans, Louisiana. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 38(2):323-6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Note.
If you intend to insert something to the effect: Arabs view this term as [[oxymoronic]], as they themselves are [[semites]] - Please read the section [[#Usage]] first.
--&gt;
'''[[Antisemitism]] in the [[Arab world]]''' refers to discrimination against [[Jew]]s in Arab countries. While [[Arab]]s are also a [[Semitic]] people, the modern meaning of the English term &quot;antisemitism&quot; refers primarily to discrimination against Jews (see [[Antisemitism#Etymology and usage|Antisemitism: Etymology and usage]]).

Arab antisemitism is believed to have expanded since the 19th century. Jews, like other minority groups within the [[Muslim world]], were subject to various restrictions long before that (see [[Dhimmi]]). However, despite its restrictive nature, dhimmi status also afforded the &quot;[[People of the Book]]&quot; relative security against persecution and welfare most of the time—a protection that was missing for non-Christians in most of Europe until the institutionalization of equality under a secular idea of citizenship after the [[French Revolution]]—and allowed them to enjoy their respective religious laws and ways of life.

Antisemitism in the Arab world has increased greatly in modern times, for many reasons: the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire and traditional Islamic society; European influence, brought about by Western [[imperialism]] and [[Christian Arabs]];&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi propaganda]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Yadlin&quot;&gt;Yadlin, Rifka. &quot;Antisemitism.&quot; ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. [[Avraham Sela]]. New York: Continuum, 2002. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of Arab nationalism. In addition, there was resentment of disproportionate influence Jews had gained under [[colonialism]], and of the [[Zionist movement]]. The rise of [[political Islam]] during the 1980s and afterwards provided a new mutation of [[Islamic anti-semitism|Islamic anti-Semitism]], which gave the hatred of Jews a religious component.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yadlin&quot; /&gt;

For most of the past fourteen hundred years, according to [[Bernard Lewis]], Arabs have not been antisemitic as the word is used in the West. In his view this is because, for the most part, Arabs are not [[Christians]] brought up on stories of [[Jewish deicide]]. In Islam, such stories are rejected by the [[Qur'an]] as a blasphemous absurdity. Since Muslims do not consider themselves as the &quot;true Israel&quot;, they do not feel threatened by the survival of Jews. Because Islam did not retain the [[Old Testament]], no clash of interpretations between the two faiths can therefore arise. There is, says Lewis, no Muslim theological dispute between their religious institutions and the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), pg. 117-8&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were antisemitic incidents in the early twentieth century, antisemitism has certainly been heightened by the Arab-Israeli conflict. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Palestinian exodus, the creation of the state of Israel, [[Israel]]i victories during the wars of [[Suez Crisis#Invasion|1956]] and [[Six day war|1967]] served a severe shock to the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), pg. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The situation of the Middle Eastern Jews worsened and almost all [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands|fled or were expelled from their native countries]]. By the 1980s, according to Bernard Lewis, the volume of antisemitic literature published in the Arab world, and the authority of its sponsors, seemed to suggest that classical antisemitism had become an essential part of Arab intellectual life, considerably more than in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century France, and to a degree that has been compared to [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernard Lewis 1986, p. 256&quot;&gt;Lewis, Bernard. ''Semites and Antisemites'', New York/London: Norton, 1986, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2008 report on contemporary Arab-Muslim antisemitism, the Israeli [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]] dates the beginning of this phenomenon to the spread of classic European Christian antisemitism into the Arab world starting in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;itic&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/a_s_170408e.pdf Contemporary Arab-Muslim anti-Semitism, its Significance and Implications]&quot;, [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Israel Intelligence Heritage &amp; Commemoration Center (IICC)]], April 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval times==

Jews, along with [[Christianity|Christian]]s and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], typically had the legal status of [[dhimmi]] (protected minority) in the [[Muslim history|lands conquered by Muslim Arabs]], generally applied to non-Muslim minorities. Jews were generally seen as a religious group (not a separate race), thus being a part of the &quot;Arab family&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhimmi were subjected to a number of restrictions, the application and severity of which varied with time and place. Restrictions included residency in [[Racial segregation|segregated]] quarters, obligation to wear distinctive clothing, public subservience to Muslims, prohibitions against proselytizing and against marrying Muslim women, and limited access to the legal system (the testimony of a Jew did not count if contradicted by that of a Muslim). Dhimmis had to pay a special poll tax (the &quot;[[jizya]]&quot;), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the [[Zakat]] alms tax required of Muslims. In return, dhimmis were granted limited rights including a degree of tolerance, community autonomy in personal matters, and protection from being killed outright. Jewish communities, like Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi-autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers.

By medieval standards, conditions for Jews under Islam was generally more formalized and better than those of Jews in Christian lands, in part due to the sharing of minority status with Christians in these lands. There is evidence for this claim in that the status of Jews in lands with no Christian minority was usually worse than their status in lands with one. For example, there were numerous incidents of [[list of events named massacres|massacres]] and [[ethnic cleansing]] of Jews in North Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Morocco]], [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]] where eventually Jews were forced to live in [[mellah|ghettos]].&lt;ref&gt;Roumani, Maurice. ''The Case of the Jews from Arab Countries: A Neglected Issue'', 1977, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in the Middle Ages in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Jews_in_Arab_lands_(gen).html The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; At certain times in Yemen, Morocco and [[Baghdad]], Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or, ''The Dhimmi'', 1985, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted at other times, was summarised by G.E. Von Grunebaum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p.369.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views in Modernity==
Some{{Who|date=May 2011}} scholars hold that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalism, and was imported into the Arab world primarily by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it &quot;Islamized&quot;), Mark Cohen states.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies, p.208&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bernard Lewis]]:
{{quote|The volume of anti-Semitic books and articles published, the size and number of editions and impressions, the eminence and authority of those who write, publish and sponsor them, their place in school and college curricula, their role in the mass media, would all seem to suggest that classical anti-Semitism is an essential part of Arab intellectual life at the present time-almost as much as happened in Nazi Germany, and considerably more than in late nineteenth and early twentieth century France.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernard Lewis 1986, p. 256&quot; /&gt;}}

===Nineteenth century===
The [[Damascus affair]] was an accusation of [[ritual murder]] and a [[blood libel against Jews]] in [[Damascus]] in 1840. On February 5, 1840, [[Franciscan]] [[Capuchin friar]] Father Thomas and his Greek servant were reported missing, never to be seen again. The [[Turkey|Turkish]] governor and the French consul [[Ratti-Menton]] believed accusations of ritual murder and blood libel, as the alleged murder occurred before the Jewish [[Passover]]. An investigation was staged, and Solomon Negrin, a Jewish barber, [[Forced confession|confessed under torture]] and accused other Jews. Two other Jews died under torture, and one (Moses Abulafia) converted to [[Islam]] to escape torture. More arrests and atrocities followed, culminating in 63 Jewish children being held [[hostage]] and mob attacks on Jewish communities throughout the Middle East. International outrage led to [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in Egypt ordering an investigation. Negotiations in [[Alexandria]] eventually secured the unconditional release and recognition of innocence of the nine prisoners still remaining alive (out of thirteen). Later in [[Constantinople]], [[Moses Montefiore]] (leader of the British Jewish community) persuaded Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] to issue a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (edict) intended to halt the spread of blood libel accusations in the [[Ottoman Empire]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;... and for the love we bear to our subjects, we cannot permit the Jewish nation, whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident, to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth...&quot;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, pogroms spread through the Middle East and North Africa: Aleppo (1850, 1875), Damascus (1840, 1848, 1890), Beirut (1862, 1874), Dayr al-Qamar (1847), Jaffa (1876), Jerusalem (1847, 1870 and 1895), Cairo (1844, 1890, 1901–02), Mansura (1877), Alexandria (1870, 1882, 1901–07), Port Said (1903, 1908), and Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1891).&lt;ref&gt;Yossef Bodansky. &quot;Islamic Anti-Semitism as a Political Instrument&quot; Co-Produced by The Ariel Center for Policy Research and The Freeman Center for Strategic Studies, 1999. ISBN 0967139104, ISBN 978-0967139104, see also The Encyclopedia of world history By Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer
page 527 published 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus affair]] of the late nineteenth century had consequences in the Arab world. Passionate outbursts of antisemitism in France were echoed in areas of French influence, especially [[Maronite]] [[Lebanon]]. The Muslim Arab press, however, was sympathetic to the falsely accused Captain Dreyfus, and criticized the persecution of Jews in France.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth in the twentieth century===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PoteozAmman.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Middle row left is the Antisemitic [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], first published in 1903 in Russia, also known as a literary fraud.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Photo credit: Nir Nussbaum]] --&gt;

Antisemitism in the [[Arab world]] increased in the twentieth century, as anti-Semitic propaganda and [[blood libel]]s were imported from Europe and as resentment against [[Zionism|Zionist]] efforts in [[British Mandate of Palestine]] spread. British troops stationed in Palestine arrived fresh from deployment in the [[Russian civil war]], fighting alongside the genocidal antisemitic [[White Movement]]. The British forces are credited with introducing the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] to Palestine.   In March 1921, Musa Khazem El Husseini, Mayor of Jerusalem, told [[Winston Churchill]] &quot;The Jews have been amongst the most active advocates of destruction in many lands... It is well known that the disintegration of Russia was wholly or in great part brought about by the Jews, and a large proportion of the defeat of Germany and Austria must also be put at their door.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Morris, Benny, ''Righteous Victims'', Knopf, 1999, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthias Küntzel]] has suggested that the decisive transfer of [[antisemitism|Jewish conspiracy theory]] took place between 1937 and 1945 under the impact of Nazi propaganda targeted at the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Küntzel, Matthias, &quot;National Socialism and Anti-Semitism in the Arab World&quot;, ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 17:1-2 (Spring 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kuntzel, the Nazi Arabic radio service had a staff of 80 and broadcast everyday in Arabic, stressing the similarities between Islam and Nazism and supported by the activities of the [[Mufti of Jerusalem]], [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]] (who broadcast pro-Nazi propaganda from Berlin).  The Nazi regime also provided funding to the Egyptian [[Moslem Brotherhood]], which began calling for boycotts of Jewish businesses in 1936.
Bernard Lewis also describes Nazi influence in the Arab world, including its impact on [[Michel Aflaq]], founder of the [[Ba'ath]] movement (which later dominated Syria and Iraq).&lt;blockquote&gt; After the promulgation of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], Hitler received telegrams of congratulation from all over the Arab and Muslim world, especially from Morocco and Palestine, where the Nazi propaganda had been most active... ... Before long political parties of the Nazi and Fascist type began to appear, complete with paramilitary youth organizations, colored shirts, strict discipline and more or less charismatic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. ''Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice''. New York: W.W. Norton, 1999. ISBN 978-0-393-31839-5, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

While anti-Semitism was certainly heightened by the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], there were [[pogrom]]s against Jews prior to the foundation of [[Israel]], including [[Nazism|Nazi]]-inspired pogroms in [[Algeria]] in the 1930s, and attacks on the Jews in [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] in the 1940s (see [[Farhud]]). George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the [[Arab world]] to several factors, including: the breakdown of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and traditional [[Islamic]] society; domination by Western [[colonialism|colonial powers]] under which Jews gained a disproportionately large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment over Jewish [[nationalism]] and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular [[regime]]s to [[scapegoat]] local Jews for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen, George E. [http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm &quot;The Other Refugees: Jews of the Arab World&quot;], ([[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the [[Palestinian exodus]], the creation of the state of [[Israel]], and the independence of Arab countries from European control, conditions for Jews in the Arab world deteriorated.  Over the next few decades, almost all would flee the Arab world, some willingly, and some under threat (see [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]). In 1945 there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]] (which was once around 3% Jewish), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.

===Modern examples===
====Arab League====
On December 2, 1945, the newly formed [[Arab League]] Council declared a formal boycott against Jewish products. &quot;Jewish products and manufactured goods shall be considered undesirable to the Arab countries.&quot; All Arab &quot;institutions, organizations, merchants, commission agents and individuals&quot; were called upon &quot;to refuse to deal in, distribute, or consume Zionist products or manufactured goods.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Bard, Mitchell.[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Arab_boycott.html &quot;The Arab Boycott&quot;] ([[JVL]])&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott began to wane only in the 1970s.

====Israeli Arabs====
During a speech in 2007, Israeli-Arab [[Raed Salah]], the leader of the northern branch of the [[Islamic Movement in Israel]], accused Jews of [[blood libel|using children's blood to bake bread]]. &quot;We have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children's blood,&quot; he said. &quot;Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the [Jewish] holy bread.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/islamic-movement-head-charged-with-incitement-to-racism-violence-1.238209 Islamic Movement head charged with incitement to racism, violence]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Arab parliamentarian [[Ahmad Tibi]] declared, &quot;Whoever sells his house to Jews, has sold his soul to Satan and has done a despicable act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic world report'', Volume 7, p. 13, [[Ignatius Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt====
Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leader [[Mohammed Mahdi Akef]] has denounced what he called &quot;the myth of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]&quot; in defending Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s [[Holocaust denial|denial]] of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4554986.stm &quot;Egyptian Islamists deny Holocaust&quot;], ''BBC News Online'', December 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egypt]]ian government-run newspaper, ''Al-Akhbar'', on April 29, 2002 published an editorial denying the Holocaust as a fraud. The next paragraph decries the failure of the Holocaust to eliminate all of the Jews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the fraud of the Holocaust… Many French studies have proven that this is no more than a fabrication, a lie, and a fraud!! That is, it is a 'scenario' the plot of which was carefully tailored, using several faked photos completely unconnected to the truth. Yes, it is a film, no more and no less. [[Hitler]] himself, whom they accuse of [[Nazism]], is in my eyes no more than a modest 'pupil' in the world of murder and bloodshed. He is completely innocent of the charge of frying them in the hell of his false Holocaust!!

The entire matter, as many French and British scientists and researchers have proven, is nothing more than a huge Israeli plot aimed at extorting the German government in particular and the European countries in general. But I, personally and in light of this imaginary tale, complain to Hitler, even saying to him from the bottom of my heart, 'If only you had done it, brother, if only it had really happened, so that the world could sigh in relief [without] their evil and sin.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=sd&amp;ID=SP37502 Columnist for Egyptian Government Daily to Hitler:'If Only You Had Done It, Brother'] (MEMRI bulletin No.375. May 3, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cartoons appearing in the daily ''[[Al-Wafd (newspaper)|Al-Wafd]]'' in 2003 depict Jews as Satanic figures with hooked noses and equates them with [[Nazi]]s. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In an article in October 2000 columnist Adel Hammoda alleged in the state-owned Egyptian newspaper ''[[al-Ahram]]'' that Jews made Matza from the blood of (non-Jewish) children.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Ahram'' (Egypt), October 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammed Salmawy, editor of ''Al-Ahram Hebdo'', &quot;defended the use of old European myths like the [[blood libel against Jews|blood libel]]&quot; in his newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Kate (August 10, 2003).

====Jordan====
[[Jordan]] does not allow entry to Jews with visible signs of Judaism or even with personal religious items in their possession. The Jordanian ambassador to Israel replied to a complaint by a religious Jew denied entry that security concerns required that travelers entering the Hashemite Kingdom not do so with prayer shawls ([[Tallit]]) and phylacteries ([[Tefillin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan denies entry to Israeli with Jewish prayer items | location = Tel Aviv |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1099272.html |date= July 10, 2009|work= HaAretz |accessdate=&lt;!----July 23, 2009----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanian authorities state that the policy is in order to ensure the Jewish tourists safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israeli tourists asked to hand over Jewish paraphernalia |url=http://www.eturbonews.com/4337/israeli-tourists-asked-hand-over-jewish-paraphernalia |date= August 13, 2008|work= |publisher= eTurboNews |accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, six [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] were deported after attempting entry into Jordan in order to visit the tomb of Aaron / Sheikh Harun on [[Mount Hor]], near [[Petra]], because of an alert from the Ministry of Tourism. The group had taken a [[ferry]] from [[Sinai]], Egypt because they understood that Jordanian authourities were making it hard for visible Jews to enter from Israel. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] is aware of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Mendel, Arieh | title=חסידי ברסלב גורשו מירדן: &quot;הם מאוד מאוכזבים&quot; |url=http://www.haredim.co.il/ViewArticle.aspx?catID=1&amp;itmID=970 |date= July 21, 2009|work= |publisher= HaAretz|accessdate=&lt;!----July 24, 2009----&gt;}}{{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saudi Arabia====
A Saudi government website initially stated that Jews would not be granted tourist visas to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sauditourism.gov.sa/sct/indexlist.php?catid=39&amp;maincat=Travel_Tips |title=Visa requirements |publisher=[[Saudi Commission for Tourism &amp; Antiquities|Supreme Commission for Tourism]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040206173019/http://www.sauditourism.gov.sa/sct/indexlist.php?catid=39&amp;maincat=Travel_Tips |archivedate=2004-02-06 |quote=Visas will not be issued for the following groups of people:

* Those who don't abide by the Saudi traditions concerning appearance and behaviors.  Those under the influence of alcohol will not be permitted into the Kingdom.
* There are certain regulations for pilgrims and you should contact the consulate for more information.
* Jewish People}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ny09_weiner/022604Saudi.html Official Saudi Arabia Tourism Website: No Jews Allowed. &quot;Jewish People&quot; May Not Receive Travel Visas Required To Travel Into The Kingdom] by Congressman Anthony D. Weiner (D-Queens &amp; Brooklyn) February 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3493448.stm &quot;Jews barred in Saudi tourist drive&quot;], ''BBC News Online'', February 27, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
It has since removed this statement, and apologized for posting &quot;erroneous information&quot;. Members of religions other than Islam, including Jews, are not permitted to practice their religion publicly in Saudi Arabia; according to the U.S. State Department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/countriesconcerns/Countries/Saudi_Arabia.html United States Commission on International Religious Freedom. Countries of Particular Concern. Saudi Arabia]&lt;/ref&gt; religious freedom &quot;does not exist&quot; in Saudi Arabia. Islam is the official religion of Saudi Arabia, and the tenets of that religion are enforced by law.

Saudi Arabian media often attacks Jews in books, news articles, at their Mosques&lt;ref&gt;[http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Area=sr&amp;ID=SR01002&amp;Page=archives 'Friday Sermons in Saudi Mosques: Review and Analysis', September 26, 2002 (MEMRI)]&lt;/ref&gt; and with what some describe as [[antisemitic]] satire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/Search.asp?ACT=S9&amp;P1=1438 'Antisemitic Satire on a Saudi TV Channel (MBC)', April 19, 2007 '''(VIDEO)''' (memritv.org)]&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabian government officials and state religious leaders often promote the idea that Jews are conspiring to take over the entire world; as proof of their claims they publish and frequently cite ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' as factual.&lt;ref name=CMIP-KSA2001&gt;[http://www.edume.org/reports/10/38.htm CMIP report: The Jews in World History according to the Saudi textbooks]. ''The Danger of World Jewry'', by Abdullah al-Tall, pp. 140&amp;ndash;141 (Arabic). ''Hadith and Islamic Culture'', Grade 10, (2001) pp. 103&amp;ndash;104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/pdfdocs/KSAtextbooks06.pdf}} 2006 Saudi Arabia's Curriculum of Intolerance, Report by Center for Religious Freedom of Freedom House. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One Saudi Arabian government newspaper suggested that hatred of all Jews is justifiable.  &quot;Why are they (the Jews) hated by all the people which hosted them, such as Iraq and Egypt thousands years ago, and Germany, Spain, France and the UK, up to the days they gained of power over the capital and the press, in order to rewrite the history?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turki 'Abdallah as-Sudayri (April 15, 2002). &quot;All of History is against them&quot;. ''Al-Riyadh'', (Saudi government daily).&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi textbooks vilify Jews (and Christians and non-Wahabi Muslims): according to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Saudi textbooks claimed by them to have been sanitized of anti-Semitism still call Jews apes (and Christians swine); demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in Jihad to vanquish Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Nina (May 21, 2006). [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/19/AR2006051901769.html &quot;This is a Saudi textbook. (After the intolerance was removed.)&quot;], ''The Washington Post'', p. B01.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syria====
Former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[David Duke]] visited Syria in November 2005 and made a speech which was broadcast live on Syrian television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/mp3/dukedamascus6.WMV David Duke website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Syrian Defense Minister [[Mustafa Tlass]] published a book called ''The Matzah of Zion'', which claimed that Jews had killed Christian children in Damascus to make Matzas (see [[Damascus affair]]). His book inspired the Egyptian TV series ''[[Horseman Without a Horse]]'' (see below) and a spinoff, ''The Diaspora'', which led to [[Hezbollah]]'s al-Manar being banned in Europe for broadcasting it.

====Tunisia====
For a personal account of the discrimination and physical attacks experienced by Jews in Tunisia see the Jewish-Arab anti-colonialist writer [[Albert Memmi]]'s account:&lt;ref&gt;Memmi, Albert.[http://www.jimena.org/faq/memmi.htm &quot;Who is an Arab Jew?&quot;], February 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At each crisis, with every incident of the slightest importance, the mob would go wild, setting fire to Jewish shops. This even happened during the Yom Kippur War. Tunisia's President, Habib Bourguiba, has in all probability never been hostile to the Jews, but there was always that notorious &quot;delay&quot;, which meant that the police arrived on the scene only after the shops had been pillaged and burnt. Is it any wonder that the exodus to France and Israel continued and even increased?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Palestinian territories====
{{main|Racism in the Palestinian territories}}
The [[Hamas]], an offshoot of the Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]], has a foundational statement of principles, or &quot;covenant&quot; which claims that the French revolution, the Russian revolution, colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists.  It also claims the [[Freemason]]s and [[Rotary club]]s are Zionist fronts and refers to the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm Hamas Covenant 1988 articles 22 and 32.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Claims that Jews and Freemasons were behind the French Revolution originated in Germany in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cohn|Cohn, Norman]]. ''[[Warrant for Genocide]], The Myth of the Jewish World Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudar Zahran, a Palestinian, writing for the [[Hudson Institute]] says that &quot;the Palestinians have been used as fuel for the new form of anti-Semitism; this has hurt the Palestinians and exposed them to unprecedented and purposely media-ignored abuse by Arab governments, including some of those who claim love for the Palestinians, yet in fact only bear hatred to Jews. This has resulted in Palestinian cries for justice, equality, freedom and even basic human rights being ignored while the world getting consumed with delegitimizing Israel from either ignorance or malice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson-ny.org/1979/anti-semitism-20 Anti-semitism 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahmoud Abbas]], leader of the [[PLO]], published a Ph.D. thesis (at Moscow University) in 1982, called ''The Secret Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Brynn. [http://hnn.us/articles/1414.html Was Abu Mazen a Holocaust Denier?], History News Network.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yehoshua, Yael (April 29, 2003). [http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Area=sr&amp;ID=SR01503 Abu Mazen: A Political Profile. Zionism and Holocaust Denial] ([[MEMRI]])&lt;/ref&gt;
His doctoral thesis later became a book, [[The Other Side: the Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism]], which, following his appointment as Palestinian Prime Minister in 2003, was heavily criticized as an example of [[Holocaust denial]]. In his book, Abbas wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;It seems that the interest of the Zionist movement, however, is to inflate this figure [of Holocaust deaths] so that their gains will be greater. This led them to emphasize this figure [six million] in order to gain the solidarity of international public opinion with Zionism.  Many scholars have debated the figure of six million and reached stunning conclusions—fixing the number of Jewish victims at only a few hundred thousand.&quot;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Arab newspapers====
Many [[Arab]] newspapers, such as ''[[Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah]]'', the Palestinian Authority's official newspaper, often write that &quot;the Jews&quot; control all the world's governments, and that &quot;the Jews&quot; plan [[genocide]] on all the Arabs in the [[West Bank]]. Others write less sensational stories, and state that Jews have too much of an influence in the United States government. Often the leaders of other nations are said to be controlled by Jews. Articles in many official Arab government newspapers claim that ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', reflects actual facts, and thus points to an international Jewish conspiracy to [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Protocols of the Elders of Zion|take over the world]].

:&quot;[[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu's]] Plan completely matches the foundations of the greater [[Zionism|Zionist]] plan which is organized according to specific stages that were determined when ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' was composed and when [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]] along with [[Chaim Weizmann|Weizmann]] traveled around the world in order to determine the appropriate location for the implementation of this conspiracy,&quot; (official Palestinian Authority newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah, November 30, 1997).

:&quot;The Jews seek to conquer the world...We must expose the Zionist-Colonialist plot and its goals, which destroy not only our people but the entire world&quot; (PA Minister of Agriculture, [[Abdel Jawad Saleh]], quoted in ''[[Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah]]'', November 6, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library: [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/pastatements.html Palestinian Authority Anti-Semitism Since the Hebron Accord]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebanon====
[[Hizbullah]]'s [[Al-Manar]] TV channel has often been accused of airing antisemitic broadcasts, blaming the Jews for a Zionist [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] against the Arab world, and often airing excerpts from the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'',&lt;ref&gt;Sciolino, Elaine.  [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E7DE1031F93AA35751C1A9629C8B63 &quot; A New French Headache: When Is Hate on TV Illegal?&quot;] ''[[The New York Times]]''. 9 December 2004. 16 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/special_reports/protocols/protocols_recycled.asp &quot;Anti-Semitic Series Airs on Arab Television.&quot;] ''[[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]].'' 9 January 2004. 16 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiesenthal.com/siteapps/advocacy/ActionItem.aspx?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&amp;b=297065 &quot;Urge President Chirac to Block Hezbollah's Antisemitic and Hate TV.&quot;] ''[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]''.  21 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' describes as a &quot;fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century.&quot;

Al-Manar recently aired a drama series, called ''The Diaspora'', which is based on historical anti-Semitic allegations. BBC reporters who watched the series said that: &lt;blockquote&gt; Correspondents who have viewed ''The Diaspora'' note that it quotes extensively from the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', a notorious 19th-century publication used by the Nazis among others to fuel race hatred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3581514.stm &quot;France offers 'hate TV' reprieve&quot;], ''BBC News Online'', August 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another incident, an Al-Manar commentator recently referred to &quot;Zionist attempts to transmit [[AIDS]] to Arab countries&quot;.  Al-Manar officials deny broadcasting anti-Semitic incitement and state that their position is anti-Israeli, not anti-Semitic. However, Hezbollah has directed strong rhetoric both against Israel and Jews, and it has cooperated in publishing and distributing outright anti-Semitic literature. The government of Lebanon has not criticized continued broadcast of anti-Semitic material on television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136073.htm 2009 Human Rights Report: Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to protests by the [[CRIF]] umbrella group of French Jews regarding allegations of anti-Semitic content, French Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] called for a ban on Al-Manar broadcasting in France on December 2, 2004; just two weeks after al-Manar was authorised to continue broadcasting in Europe by France's media watchdog agency.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Sebastian (December 3, 2004) .[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4064317.stm &quot;French seek 'anti-Semitic' TV ban&quot;], ''BBC News Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 13, 2004, France's highest administrative court banned Hizbullah's Al-Manar TV station on the grounds that it consistently incites racial hatred and antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4093579.stm &quot;France pulls plug on Arab network&quot;], ''BBC News Online'', December 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Horseman Without a Horse&quot;====
In 2001-2002, [[Arab Radio and Television Network|Arab Radio and Television]] produced a 30-part television miniseries entitled &quot;Horseman Without a Horse&quot;, which contains dramatizations of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Area=sd&amp;ID=SP30901 &quot;MEMRI: Special Dispatch Series  No. 309.&quot;] ''[[MEMRI|MEMRI: The Middle East Media Research Institute]]''. December 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States and Israel criticized Egypt for airing the program, which includes racist falsehoods that have a history of being used &quot;as a pretext for persecuting Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2386767.stm &quot;Egypt criticised for 'anti-Semitic' film&quot;], ''BBC News Online'', November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some dispute over whether this article should document both the meaning of this term as used in popular fiction as well as its technical meaning in the field of architecture, or solely the architectural use. Refer to the discussion page for the various arguments. &amp;ndash; Struthious Bandersnatch

--&gt;
'''Arcology''', a [[portmanteau]] of the words &quot;[[architecture]]&quot; and &quot;[[ecology]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;MatterSpirit&quot;&gt;{{Citation

These largely hypothetical structures would contain a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities and minimize individual human environmental impact. They are often portrayed as self-contained or [[Autarky|economically self-sufficient]].

The concept has been primarily popularized, and the term itself coined, by architect [[Paolo Soleri]], and appears commonly in [[science fiction]].

==Development==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
{{original research section|date=May 2010}}
An arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is supposed to sustainably supply all or most of the resources for a comfortable life: power, climate control, food production, air and water purification, sewage treatment, etc..  It is supposed to supply these items for a large population. An arcology would need no connections to municipal or urban infrastructure in order to operate.

Arcologies were proposed to reduce human impacts on natural resources. Arcology designs often apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects in order to achieve economies that are difficult to achieve in other ways. 
Frank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Frank Lloyd, &quot;An Organic Architecture&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; called Broadacre city. His plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics said that Wright's solution failed to account for population growth, and assumed a more rigid democracy than the U.S. actually has.

Paolo Soleri proposed later solutions, and coined the term 'arcology'.&lt;ref&gt;Soleri, Paolo, &quot;Arcology: The City in the Image of Man&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, and economize on transportation and other energy uses. Soleri's plans aren't just &quot;human beehives.&quot;  Like Wright, Soleri proposed important changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce. Soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication, land reclamation, and proposed to eliminate most private transportation.  He favored greater use of shared social resources like public libraries.

==Similar real-world projects==
The largest arcology project under current development is [[Masdar City]] near [[Abu Dhabi]], in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It is projected to house between 45,000 and 50,000 inhabitants on 6 square kilometers, and to have a [[sustainable]], [[zero-carbon]], [[zero waste]] ecology.

[[Arcosanti]] is an experimental town under construction in central [[Arizona]]. Designed by Paolo Soleri, its primary purpose is to demonstrate principles of arcology.

Many cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept, like [[Tokyo]], and  [[Dongtan]] near [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1635188,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=British to help China build 'eco-cities' | first=Frank | last=Kane | date=November 6, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dongtan project may have collapsed, and it failed to open for the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai World Expo]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/23/greenwash-dongtan-ecocity Series: GreenwashPrevious | Next | Index  Greenwash: The dream of the first eco-city was built on a fiction | Environment | The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain urban projects reflect arcological principles. Pedestrian connection systems often provide a wide range of goods and services in a single structure.  Some examples include the [[+15]] system in downtown [[Calgary]], or the [[Minneapolis Skyway System]]. They include supermarkets, malls and entertainment complexes. The +15 is the world's most extensive skywalk, 16&amp;nbsp;km (10 miles). Minneapolis has the longest single path, eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km).
[[Seward's Success, Alaska]] was never built, but would have been a small city just outside of [[Anchorage]].
[[Co-op City]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]] is another example, with many services on-site.

The [[Las Vegas Strip]] has many arcological features to protect people from the 45C (110F) heat. Many major casinos are connected by tunnels, footbridges, and monorails. It is possible to travel from [[Mandalay Bay]] at the south end of the Strip to the [[Las Vegas Convention Center]], three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) to the north, without using streets. In many cases, it is possible to travel between several different casinos without ever going outdoors.

[[McMurdo Station]] of the [[United States Antarctic Program]] and other scientific research stations on the [[continent]] of [[Antarctica]] resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically-advanced, self-sufficient human community. Although not self-sufficient (the U.S. Military &quot;[[Operation Deep Freeze]]&quot; resupply effort delivers 8 million gallons of fuel and 11 million pounds of supplies and equipment yearly&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Marvels: Sub-Zero''. The History Channel.&lt;/ref&gt;) the base has a very insular character, necessary to protect its population from a harsh environment.  It is also isolated from conventional support networks, and must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem due to an [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty|international treaty]].  The base generates electricity with its own power plant, and grows fruits and vegetables in a hydroponic green &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antarctichydroponics.com/ Antarctic Hydroponics web site]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  house, when resupply is nonexistent. The base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff that visit each year.

[[Crystal Island]] is a proposed arcology in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].  As of 2009, construction has been postponed indefinitely due to the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global economic crisis]].

In 2008, the design firm Timelinks proposed a 2.3 square kilometer, 1 million inhabitant carbon-neutral super-structure to be built in [[Dubai, UAE]].  It would have many  arcological concepts (see [http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/08/25/ziggurat-dubai-carbon-neutral-pyramid-will-house-1-million/ Inhabitat » ZIGGURAT: Dubai Carbon Neutral Pyramid will House 1 Million] by  Evelyn Lee).

==Cultural References==
Arcologies would be dramatic, unusual structures that support a different way of life.  They are naturally interesting to writers of speculative fiction.  The first mention of an arcological structure might be in [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', published in 1899. A more in-depth description of arcology's design principles can be found in &quot;The Last Redoubt&quot; from ''[[The Night Land]]'' by [[William Hope Hodgson]], first published in 1912. In it Hodgson envisions structures complete with a full artificial ecology, agriculture, and public transport by mobile roadways.

An arcology is also depicted in the 1968 futuristic novel &quot;The World Inside&quot;, by [[Robert Silverberg]], where in the year 2381 the human race lives in 1000 stories high towers, providing all necessary to the society( nutrition, energy, entertainment, jobs, etc.). these buildings seem like a mutation between a building and a living organism nourishing and sheltering this futuristic dystopian society.

[[J. G. Ballard|J.G. Ballard]] wrote a dystopian take on a self contained building which is much like an arcology in his 1975 novel ''[[High Rise]]''.

Another depiction can be found in William Gibson's 1986 novel ''[[Count Zero]]''. The structure &quot;Fiddler's Green&quot; from [[George A. Romero|George A. Romero's]] 2005 film ''[[Land of the Dead]]'' might be an arcology.

[[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s novel ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]'' features an arcology.  

Arcologies also appear in [[video game]]s, such as ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', ''[[Escape Velocity Nova]]'', ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'', ''[[Call to Power II]]'', ''[[Shadowrun]]'', and ''[[Mass Effect]]''.

==In popular culture==
===Novels and comics===
*[[H.G. Wells]]'s 1899 tale &quot;[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]&quot; describes a rudimentary version of pre-Soleri arcology, having developed from the evolution of transportation. They are hotel-like and dominate the surrounding landscape, having replaced all towns and cities though preserving their names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=764 Town In One Building by H.G. Wells from When the Sleeper Wakes]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[William Hope Hodgson]]'s 1912 novel ''[[The Night Land]]'' features the first example of what we now would call an arcology, though the future Earthlings depicted &amp;mdash; millions of years into the future, in fact &amp;mdash; have different reasons for building their metallic pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Hodgson |given=William Hope |year=1912 |title=The Night Land |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10662}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s collaboration ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]'' (1982), much of the action is set in and around Todos Santos, an arcology built in a burnt-out section of [[Los Angeles]] that has evolved a separate culture from the city around it. Niven also occasionally refers to arcologies in his [[Known Space]] series, particularly in the stories involving Gil Hamilton.
*In the [[Joe Haldeman]] novel [[The Forever War]] much of the action between William Mandella's first and second deployment occurs in an arcology.
*In the novel ''[[The World Inside]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]], everyone lives in 'Urban Monads': self-contained three kilometer high hyperstructures.
*In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Isaac Asimov's Robot Series|Robot Series]], Earth's population lives in large hyperstructures simply called Cities. In Asimov's ''Empire'' and the ''The Foundation'' series, the capital planet [[Trantor]] of the galactic empire is a completely built-up planet, covered in its entirety with tall buildings and subterranean structures.
*All the remaining cities of the Earth are hyperstructures in [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s [[The Night's Dawn Trilogy|Night's Dawn]] trilogy.
*In the [[Judge Dredd]] comic stories, originally published in [[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD comic]], the [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] of [[Mega-City One]] consists of many hundreds, if not thousands, of [[City Block (Judge Dredd)|City Block]]s, in which a citizen can be born, grow, live, and die without ever leaving.
*[[William Gibson]]'s [[The Sprawl trilogy|Sprawl trilogy]] features various Arcologies, namely the &quot;projects.&quot; It is a megastructure that has been constructed with electricity, heat, oxygen, and food that it produced. They are also featured in the Bridge Trilogy.
*[[David Wingrove]]'s [[Chung Kuo]] series depicts a dystopian future Earth in which almost the entire population lives within several hyperstructures that are thousands of feet tall and span entire continents.
* [[J.G. Ballard]]'s 1975 novel ''High Rise'' featured a luxury arcology in which disparity between social classes among the residents eventually led to widespread anarchy and a reversion to primitive archetypes.
* In [[Samuel Youd]]'s 1967-68 trilogy of novels [[The Tripods]], an alien race known as &quot;The Masters&quot; live in three huge domed arcologies built on Earth to use as a base from which to colonise the planet. The structures are made from a golden material, and are capped with a crystal that replicates the atmospheric conditions of The Masters' home planet.
* In [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s [[Vorkosigan Saga]] novels, the inhabitants of the planet [[Komarr]] live in arcologies, as the surface of the planet is inhospitable.
* The [[James Blish]] and Normal L. Knight collaboration ''A Torrent of Faces'', set in the future where a trillion people inhabit the earth, features several semi-enclosed 'cities' - massive buildings big enough to house, entertain and feed hundreds of millions of people, and therefore may be considered arcologies. The city/building of London apparently extends as far as the Cornish coast.
* In the manga and anime world of ''[[BLAME!]]'' the plot takes place only in a gigantic megastructure/arcology simply called the City, which is still being expanded by its automatic systems.
* [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel [[The Dosadi Experiment]] focuses on the creation of a super race through the control of another race, that forces them to live in an Arcological situation.

===Films and television===
*Arcologies are common elements in futuristic [[anime]] and [[manga]] titles. An example would be the [[post-apocalyptic]]/[[cyberpunk]] series ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]], in which hyperstructures dominate the skyline of the city Olympus.
*In the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' by [[Ridley Scott]], the main offices of the fictional Tyrell Corporation (a [[Megacorp]]) resemble a hyperstructure.
*The city in the 1976 film [[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]] is entirely self contained for all resources, except power, which is said to be supplied by water moved by the tides.
*The Genom Tower arcologies (among other things) in the [[anime]] ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'' were partially inspired by the Tyrell hyperstructure; the series also features an underground &quot;Geo City.&quot;
*In the film ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]'', an arcology named Libria is the last human civilization, a society in which peace is kept by the forced administration of an injected liquid drug designed to completely suppress emotions.
*In the science-fiction movie series ''[[The Matrix]]'', the last human city, known as [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], is a hyperstructure. Due to nuclear scarring of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, the hyperstructure is buried deeply under ground. While ecologically sparse, the habitat's climate is controlled by complex machinery in the lower levels. The population is in the realm of 200,000. Due to the nature of the aggression from the machines, Zion is an example of a heavily fortified hyperstructure.
*In the season four finale of the science fiction show ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' a large battle takes place in space around an antiquated space hyperstructure known simply as 'Arcology'.
*In the episode &quot;[[11:59 (Star Trek: Voyager)|11:59]]&quot; of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' 's fifth season (original air date: May 5, 1999), Earth's first self-contained ecosystem known as &quot;The Millennium Gate&quot; is referenced and described as one kilometer tall and having begun construction in 2001.
*In a number of movies, most notably the ''Star Wars'' prequels, the cities in the more populated worlds have buildings many miles tall, effectively approaching the completely built-over world of Trantor in the classic Isaac Asimov ''Foundation'' trilogy.
*The trailer for the 2009 film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' features arcologies in a futuristic [[Iowa]]; in several scenes, [[James Kirk]] is seen driving among them in his car and motorcycle.
*In the film &quot;[[Æon Flux (film)|Æon Flux]]&quot;, Earth's surviving humans live in Bregna, an enclosed and self-sufficient city-state.
*In the film and book ''[[City of Ember]]'' the principal city is either the last or one of several Underground cities used to escape a devastating war.  However, the scale of the city is far below a typical Arcology, having less than a thousand residents.
*In the [[anime]] &quot;[[Wolf's Rain]]&quot; ancient decaying domed cities from the times of the scientific breakthroughs shelter the remainder of humanity.

===Video games===
* [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright's]] computer game ''[[SimCity 2000]]'' allows the construction of four different types of arcologies. More primitive models hold quite a few people in exchange for producing considerable pollution, but later models are denser and cleaner. When 349 of the most advanced model, the &quot;Launch Arco,&quot; are built, an &quot;exodus sequence&quot; starts in which all Launch Arcos blast into space. This parallels parts of Soleri's book, in which hyperstructures were shown as being appropriate for environments in space, under the sea, in polar lands, etc.
* Another Wright game, ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'', features bubbled cities that serve the same function. In Wright's 1990 ''[[SimEarth]]'', &quot;Nanotech Age&quot; cities eventually advance to an exodus of the entire sentient species of the planet.
* Two levels of the video game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' posits (circa 2072) a futuristic arcology, simply called the Arcology, on the edge of an ancient [[Medina quarter|medina]] in [[Cairo]].
* The Domes seen in 1999 and in the 24th century in ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' could be considered arcologies.
* In the computer game ''[[Afterlife (computer game)|Afterlife]]'', the player controlling [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] can eventually purchase ''Love Domes'' or ''Omnibulges''. Functioning similarly to arcologies, these structures are the remnants of [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]]/destroyed Heaven/Hells that are able to hold billions of souls.
* In the computer game ''[[Civilization: Call to Power]]'', the &quot;Arcology Advance,&quot; found in a near future part of the technology list, grants access to the Arcology building, which reduces overcrowding effects in its host city. This is also available in ''[[Call to Power II]]''.
* In the computer game ''[[EV Nova|Escape Velocity: Nova]]'', many planets that are part of the Auroran Empire have multiple arcologies on them. Many of their populations number in the hundreds of billions.
* The tutorial in the computer game ''[[Dystopia (computer game)|Dystopia]]'' takes place in Yggdrasil's first arcology.
* The wholly self-sustained utopian society 'Rapture' in the computer and Xbox 360 game ''[[BioShock]]'' is an underwater example of an arcology.
* The game ''[[Shadowrun (2007 video game)]]'' mentions, as one of its important world events, the construction of RNA's Santos Corporate Arcology.
* The game ''[[Shadowrun (SEGA MD video game)]]'' includes Renraku Arcology as an in-game location.
* In ''[[Mass Effect]]'' the Codex (an in-game encyclopedia) explains that [[Earth]] is composed mainly of Arcology buildings.
* In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' the massive, plate-suspended city of ''[[Midgar]]'' is an example of arcology.
* In the &quot;Next War&quot; mod, included in [[Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword]], three levels of arcoologies are available as city improvements.
* The ''[[Outpost (video game)]]'' computer game and its sequel both focus on building arcologies (called 'colonies' in the game) on various planets to contain what remains of Humanity after Earth is obliterated by an asteroid.
* Eponymous city of Inganock from [[Seiken no Inganock: What a Beautiful People]] is stated to be the first and only successful arcology in its [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]. At the start of the game, it has survived over 10 years in complete isolation from the rest of the world and is an example of an arcology in [[cyberpunk]] genre.
* The game [[Brink (video game)|Brink]] is set on a futuristic arcology to preserve humanity after a natural flooding disaster.&lt;ref&gt;http://xbox.incgamers.com/Interviews/323/brink-qa-w-creative-director-richard-ham---part-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role-playing and table-top games===
*In the table-top strategy game [[Warhammer 40,000]], hyperstructures, called &quot;hives,&quot; are extremely common and are the main method of housing large populations in the billions. Arcologies are so widespread that some planets, dubbed 'hive worlds', are constructed entirely of hyperstructures. [[Necromunda]], an off-shoot game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, involves conflict between rival gangs on the hive world of Necromunda.
*In the RPG [[Shadowrun]], a number of hyperstructures such as the &quot;Renraku Arcology&quot; exist by 2050, most of which are mega-corporate controlled. A major theme to these is the desire of a large corporation to control every aspect of its employees' lives. A major meta-plot element was the sealing off of the aforementioned Renraku Arcology in [[Seattle]] when the advanced computer control system ''awakened'' into a self-aware [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] named Deus.
*In the RPG [[Trinity (role-playing game)|Trinity]], a number of hyperstructures exist, with the largest being that of the New New York Arcology run by the Psi-Order Orgotek.
*In the RPG [[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]], the capital of the [[Coalition States]] is the city of [[Coalition States#CS Chi-Town|Chi-Town]]. [[Coalition States#CS Chi-Town|Chi-town]] (as well as several other Coalition cities) is considered a &quot;Mega-City&quot;, in that the entire city is housed inside one giant structure, which consists of more than thirty levels, each several stories high, and several sub-levels.
*The tongue-in-cheek RPG [[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]] primarily takes place in the futuristic and mostly computer controlled arcology Alpha Complex.
*In R.Talsorian's follow up to [[Cyberpunk 2020]], Cybergeneration, one of the player archetype Yo-Gangs was called the &quot;Arcorunner&quot;. The character was a child who has grown up in the arcologies, knowing every aspect about them.
*In WildFire's [[CthulhuTech]] RPG, humanity has been forced to live in fortified arcologies due to attacks from the Old Ones and the Migou.
*In Mindstorm's [[Alpha Omega (role-playing game)|Alpha Omega]] RPG, the world's populations have retreated into arcology city-states to protect themselves from the war-torn decimation of the Earth's surface

The '''Amstrad CPC''' (short for ''Colour Personal Computer'') is a series of [[8-bit]] [[home computer]]s produced by [[Amstrad]] between 1984 and 1990. It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the [[Commodore 64]] and the Sinclair [[ZX Spectrum]], where it successfully established itself primarily in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Spain]], and the German-speaking parts of Europe.

The series spawned a total of six distinct models: The ''CPC464'', ''CPC664'', and ''CPC6128'' were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market. The later ''plus'' models, ''464plus'' and ''6128plus'', efforts to prolong the system's lifecycle with hardware updates, were considerably less successful, as was the attempt to repackage the ''plus'' hardware into a game console as the ''GX4000''.

The CPC models' hardware is based on the [[Zilog Z80A]] [[CPU]], complemented with either 64 or 128 kB of memory. Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated mass storage device, either a compact cassette deck or 3&quot; floppy disk drive. The main units were only sold bundled with a colour or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit's power supply. Additionally, a wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as disk drives (for the CPC464), printers, and memory extensions, was available.

The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software. The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor, its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run [[CP/M]] software also rendered the system attractive for business users, which is reflected by a wide selection of application software.

During its lifetime, the CPC series sold approximately three million units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amstrad Product Archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Amstrad Product Archive |url=http://www.amstrad.com/products/archive/index.html |accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
===The original range===

The philosophy behind the CPC series was twofold, firstly the concept was of an “all-in-one” where the computer, keyboard and its data storage device were combined in a single unit, and optionally sold with its own dedicated display monitor.  Most home computers at that time such as [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]]’s ZX- series,  the [[Commodore 64]] and the  [[BBC Micro]] relied on the use of the domestic [[television]] set and a separately connected [[tape recorder]] or [[disk drive]]. In itself, the all-in-one concept was not new, having been seen before on business-oriented machines and the [[Commodore PET]], but in the home computer space, it predated the [[Apple Macintosh]] by almost a year.

Secondly, Amstrad founder [[Alan Sugar]] wanted the machine to resemble a “real computer, similar to what someone would see being used to check them in at the airport for their holidays”,&lt;ref name=&quot;Newkey-Burden2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Chas Newkey-Burden|title=Sir Alan Sugar: The Biography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vW5MQQAACAAJ|accessdate=7 January 2011|date=2 October 2010|publisher=John Blake|isbn=9781844548910}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the machine to not look like &quot;a pregnant calculator&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sugar2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Sugar|title=What You See Is What You Get: My Autobiography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nSLXRgAACAAJ|accessdate=7 January 2011|date=8 October 2010|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=9780230749337}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in reference presumably to the [[Sinclair ZX81]] and [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum|ZX Spectrum]] with their low cost, membrane-type keyboards.

====CPC464====
The CPC464 featured 64 kB RAM and an internal [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]] deck. It was introduced in June 1984 in the UK. Initial suggested retail prices for the CPC464 were GBP249.00/DM899.00 with a green screen and GBP359.00/DM1398.00 with a colour monitor. Following the introduction of the CPC6128 in late 1985, suggested retail prices for the CPC464 were cut by GBP50.00/DM100.00.

In 1990, the 464plus replaced the CPC464 in the model line-up, and production of the CPC464 was discontinued.

====CPC664====
[[Image:Schneider 664 en.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A ''CPC664'' main unit (German Schneider-brand variant)]]
The CPC664 features 64 kB RAM and an internal 3-inch floppy disk drive. It was introduced in May 1985 in the UK. Initial suggested retail prices for the CPC664 were GBP339.00/DM1198.00 with a green screen and GBP449.00/DM1998.00 with a colour monitor.

After the successful release of the CPC464, consumers were constantly asking for two improvements: more memory and an internal disk drive. For Amstrad, the latter was easier to realize first, with a deliberately low-key introduction of the CPC664. It was positioned not only as the lowest cost disc system, but also the lowest cost CP/M 2.2 machine at the time. However, it was not supposed to replace but complement the CPC464 which, upon launch of the CPC664, was neither discontinued nor reduced in price.&lt;ref&gt;The CPC664, ''Amstrad Computer User'' May 1985, P. 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the CPC464, the CPC664's main unit has been significantly redesigned, not only to accommodate the floppy disk drive but also with a redesigned keyboard area. Touted &quot;ergonomic&quot; by Amstrad's promotional material, the keyboard is noticeably tilted to the front with [[MSX]]-style cursor keys above the numeric keypad that now carries &quot;function key&quot; labeling. The CPC464's multicoloured keyboard has been quietened to a grey and pale blue colour scheme on the CPC664.

The back of the CPC664 main unit features the same connectors as the CPC464, with the exception of an additional 12V power lead. Unlike the CPC464's cassette tape drive that could be powered off the main unit's 5V voltage, the CPC664's integrated floppy disk drive requires an additional 12V voltage. This voltage had to be separately supplied by an updated version of the bundled green screen/colour monitor (GT-65 and CTM-644 respectively).

The CPC664 was only produced for approximately six months. In late 1985, when the CPC6128 was introduced in Europe, Amstrad decided not to keep three models in the line-up, and production of the CPC664 was discontinued.&lt;ref name=&quot;InterviewPerry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Roland Perry (in French language)|publisher=Amstrad Forever|url=http://amstrad.cpc.free.fr/article.php?sid=38|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CPC6128====
The CPC6128 features 128 kB RAM and an internal 3-inch floppy disc drive. Aside from various hardware and firmware improvements, one of the CPC6128's most prominent features is the compatibility with the CP/M+ operating system that rendered it attractive for business uses.

The CPC6128 was released in August 1985 and initially only sold in the USA. Imported and distributed by ''Indescomp, Inc. of Chicago'', it was the first Amstrad product to be sold in the United States, a market that at the time was traditionally hostile towards European computer manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;''Amstrad Computer User''. August 1985. P. 7&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1985, it arrived in Europe and replaced the CPC664 in the CPC model line-up. Initial suggested retail prices for the CPC6128 were USD699.00/GBP299.00/DM1598.00 with a green screen and USD799.00/GBP399.00/DM2098.00 with a colour monitor.

In 1990, the 6128plus replaced the CPC6128 in the model line-up, and production of the CPC6128 was discontinued.

===The ''plus range''===

In 1990, confronted with a changing home computer market, Amstrad decided to refresh the CPC model range by introducing a new range variantly labeled ''plus'' or ''PLUS'', ''1990'', or ''CPC+ range''. The main goals were numerous enhancements to the existing CPC hardware platform, to restyle the casework to provide a contemporary appearance, and to enhance support of cartridge media. The new model palette includes three variants, the ''464plus'' and ''6128plus'' computers and the ''GX4000'' video game console. The &quot;CPC&quot; abbreviation has been dropped from the model names.

The redesign significantly enhanced the CPC hardware, mainly to rectify its previous shortcomings as a gaming platform. The redesigned video hardware allows for hardware sprites and soft scrolling, with a colour palette extended from 17 out of 27 to 32 out of 4096 colours. The enhanced sound hardware offers automatic DMA transfer, allowing more complex sound effects with a significantly reduced processor overhead. Other hardware enhancements include the support of analogue joysticks, 8-bit printers, and ROM cartridges up to 4 [[megabit|Mbit]]s.

The new range of models was intended to be completely backward compatible with the original CPC models. Its enhanced features are only available after a deliberately obscure unlocking mechanism has been triggered, thus preventing existing CPC software from accidentally invoking them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArnoldVSpec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Arnold &quot;V&quot; Specification 1.4|publisher=Cliff Lawson, Amstrad|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/arnold5.htm|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the significant hardware enhancements, the hardware platform was already outdated at launch and failed to attract both customers and software producers who had already been moving towards 16-bit systems. The plus range was a commercial failure, and production was discontinued shortly after its introduction in 1990.

====464plus, 6128plus====

[[Image:6128plus es.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A ''6128plus'' main unit (with Spanish keyboard layout)]]

The ''464plus'' and ''6128plus'' models were intended as &quot;more sophisticated and stylish&quot; replacements of the CPC464 and CPC6128. Based on the redesigned plus hardware platform, they share the same base characteristics as their predecessors: The 464plus is equipped with 64 kB RAM and a cassette tape drive, the 6128plus features 128 kB RAM and a 3&quot; floppy disk drive. Both models share a common case layout with a keyboard taken over from the CPC6128 model, and the respective mass storage drive inserted in a case breakout.

In order to simplify the EMC screening process, the edge connectors of the previous models have been replaced with micro-ribbon connectors as previously used on the German Schneider CPC6128. As a result, a wide range  of extensions for the original CPC range is connector-incompatible with the 464plus and 6128plus. In addition, the 6128plus does not have a tape socket for an external tape drive.

The plus range is not equipped with an on-board ROM, and thus the 464plus and the 6128plus do not contain a firmware. Instead, Amstrad provided the firmware for both models via the ROM extension facility, contained on the included ''Burnin' Rubber and Locomotive BASIC'' cartridge. This resulted in reduced hardware localization cost (only some select key caps and case labels had to be localized) with the added benefit of a rudimentary copy protection mechanism (without a firmware present, the machine itself could not copy a game cartridge's content).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArnoldVSpec&quot;/&gt; As the enhanced ''V4'' firmware's structural differences causes problems with some CPC software directly calling firmware functions by their memory addresses, Amstrad separately sold a cartridge containing the original CPC6128's ''V3'' firmware.&lt;ref name=&quot;GrimwareCartridges&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Amstrad System Cartridges|publisher=grimware.org|url=http://www.grimware.org/doku.php/documentations/hardware/amstrad.cartridge.released|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the 464plus and the 6128plus were introduced to the public in September 1990. Initial suggested retail prices were FRF1990 with a green screen and FRF2990 with a colour monitor for the 464plus, and FRF2990 with a green screen and FRF3990 with a colour monitor for the 6128plus.

====GX4000====

[[Image:AmstradGX4000.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Amstrad GX4000]]{{main|Amstrad GX4000}}

Developed as part of the ''plus range'', the GX4000 is Amstrad's short-lived attempt to enter the video game consoles market. Sharing the plus range's hardware characteristics, it represents the bare minimum variant of the range without a keyboard or support for mass storage devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArnoldVSpec&quot;/&gt;

===Special models and clones===
====CPC472====

The ''CPC472'' is a modified CPC464 model, created and only distributed in Spain by Amstrad's Spanish distributor ''Indescomp'' (later to become ''Amstrad Spain''). Its only difference to the CPC464 is the inclusion of an add-on board containing 8 kB of memory. The additional memory is not available to the CPU, its sole purpose was to increase the machine's total memory to 72 kB, thus circumventing a Spanish tax on computers with 64 kB memory or less that were not localized to the Spanish language. Soon after the CPC472's release in 1984, this tax was extended to all computers, regardless of their memory size. CPC models with a Spanish keyboard became available, including a remaining stock of CPC472.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmstradmuseumCPC472&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=CPC472|publisher=Amstradmuseum.com|url=http://perso.wanadoo.es/amstradcpc/cpc/cpc472.html|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====KC Compact====

[[Image:KC-compact-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Kleincomputer KC Compact]]

The ''Kleincomputer KC Compact'' (&quot;Kleincomputer&quot; being a rather literal German translation of the English &quot;microcomputer&quot;) is a clone of the Amstrad CPC built by [[East Germany]]'s ''[[Volkseigene Betriebe|VEB]] Mikroelektronik Mühlhausen'' in 1989. Although the machine included various substitutes and emulations of an Amstrad CPC's hardware, the machine is largely compatible with Amstrad CPC software. It is equipped with 64 kB memory and a CPC6128's firmware customized to the modified hardware, including an unmodified copy of Locomotive BASIC 1.1. The KC Compact is the last 8-bit computer produced in East Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCCompactDocu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=KC Compact Documentation|url=http://www.sax.de/~zander/kcc/kcc_bw.html|accessdate=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
===Processor===
The entire CPC series is based on the [[Zilog Z80]]A processor, clocked at 4&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=&quot;464 Tech spec&quot;&gt;Technical Specification, CPC464 Service Manual, p. 2., Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avoid conflicts resulting from the CPU and the video circuits both accessing the shared main memory (&quot;snowing&quot;), CPU memory access is constrained to occur on microsecond boundaries, effectively padding every CPU instruction to a multiple of four CPU cycles. As typical Z80 instructions require only three or four CPU cycles, the resulting loss of processing power is minor, reducing the effective clock rate to approximately 3.3&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOFT968&quot;&gt;CPC464/664/6128
Firmware ROM routines and explanations (Soft 968)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory===
Amstrad CPCs are equipped with either 64 (CPC464, CPC664, 464plus, GX4000) or 128 (CPC6128, 6128plus) kB of RAM.&lt;ref name=&quot;464 Tech spec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;6128 Tech spec&quot;&gt;Technical Specification, CPC6128 Service Manual, p. 31., Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc.&lt;/ref&gt; This base memory can be extended by up to 512 kB using memory expansions sold by third-party manufacturers, and by up to 4096 kB using experimental methods developed by hardware enthusiasts. Because the Z80 processor is only able to directly address 64 kB of memory, additional memory from the 128 kB models and memory expansions is made available using the [[bank switching]] technique

===Video===
Underlying a CPC's video output is the unusual pairing of a [[Cathode Ray Tube Controller|CRTC]] ([[Motorola 6845]] or compatible) with a custom-designed [[gate array]] to generate a pixel display output. CPC6128s later in production as well as the models from the plus range integrate both the CRTC and the gate array's functions with the system's ASIC.

Three built-in display resolutions are available: 160×200 pixels with 16 colours (&quot;Mode 0&quot;, 20 text columns), 320×200 pixels with 4 colours (&quot;Mode 1&quot;, 40 text columns), and 640×200 pixels with 2 colours (&quot;Mode 2&quot;, 80 text columns).&lt;ref name=&quot;464 Tech spec&quot;/&gt; Increased screen size can be achieved by reprogramming the CRTC.

The original CPC video hardware supports a [[Palette (computing)|colour palette]] of 27 colours,&lt;ref name=&quot;464 Tech spec&quot;/&gt; generated from [[RGB]] colour space with each colour component assigned as either off, half on, or on. The plus range extended the palette to 4096 colours, also generated from RGB with 4 bits each for red, green and blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArnoldVSpec&quot;/&gt;

With the exception of the GX4000, all CPC models lack an [[RF modulator|RF television]] or [[composite video]] output and instead shipped with a proprietary 6-pin [[DIN connector]] intended for use solely with the supplied Amstrad monitor.&lt;ref name=&quot;464 Tech spec&quot;/&gt; It delivers a [[PAL]] frequency 1v p-p analogue RGB with composite sync signal that, if wired correctly, can drive a [[SCART]] television. External adapters for RF television were available as a first-party hardware accessory.

===Audio===

The CPC uses the [[General Instrument AY-3-8910|General Instrument AY-3-8912]] [[sound chip]],&lt;ref name=&quot;464 Tech spec&quot;/&gt; providing three channels, each configurable to generate square waves, white noise or both. A small array of hardware volume envelopes are available.

Output is provided in mono by a small (4 [[Centimetre|cm]]) built-in loudspeaker with volume control, driven by an internal [[amplifier]]. [[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]] output is provided through a {{nowrap|3.5 mm}} [[headphones]] jack.

It is possible to playback [[sampling (signal processing)|digital sound samples]] at a resolution of approximately 5-bit by sending a stream of values to the sound chip. This technique is very processor-intensive and hard to combine with any other processing. Examples are the title screens or other non-playable scenes of games like ''[[Chase H.Q.]]'', ''[[Meltdown (8-bit video game)|Meltdown]]'', and ''[[RoboCop (video game)|RoboCop]]''.

===Floppy disc drive===

[[Image:3 inch floppy discs.jpg|right|thumbnail|3&quot; floppy discs used on CPC machines]]
Amstrad's choice of [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi's]] 3&quot; floppy disc drive, when the rest of the PC industry was moving to [[Sony]]'s 3.5&quot; format, is often wrongly claimed to be due to Amstrad bulk-buying a large consignment of 3&quot; drive units in [[Asia]]; the units were custom-made by Panasonic. The chosen drive (built-in for later models) is a single-sided 40-track unit that requires the user to physically remove and flip the disc to access the other side.&lt;ref name=&quot;6128 Tech spec&quot;/&gt; Each side has its own independent write-protect switch.&lt;ref name=&quot;6128 Tech spec&quot;/&gt; The sides are termed &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, with each one commonly formatted to 180 kB (in [[AMSDOS]] format, comprising 2 kB directory and 178 kB storage) for a total of 360 kB per disc.

The interface with the drives is a NEC 765 [[Floppy disc controller|FDC]], used for the same purpose in the IBM [[PC/XT]], [[PC/AT]] and [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] machines. Its features are not fully used in order to cut costs, namely [[Direct memory access|DMA]] transfers and support for [[single density]] discs; they were formatted as [[double density]] using [[modified frequency modulation]].

Discs were shipped in a paper sleeve or a hard plastic case resembling a [[compact disc]] &quot;jewel&quot; case. The casing is thicker and more rigid than that of 3.5&quot; discettes, and designed to be mailed without any additional packaging{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. A sliding metal cover to protect the media surface is internal to the casing and latched, unlike the simple external sliding cover of Sony's version. They were significantly more expensive than both 5.25&quot; and 3.5&quot; alternatives. This, combined with their low nominal capacities and their essentially proprietary nature, led to the format being discontinued shortly after the CPC itself was discontinued.

Apart from Amstrad's other 3&quot; machines (the [[Amstrad PCW|PCW]] and the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum|ZX Spectrum +3]]), the few other computer systems to use them included the Sega SF-7000 and CP/M systems such as the [[Tatung Einstein]] and [[Osborne Computer Corporation|Osborne]] machines. They also found use on embedded systems.

The [[Shugart]]-standard interface means that Amstrad CPC machines are able to use standard 3&quot;, 3½&quot; or 5¼&quot; drives as their second drive. Programs such as ROMDOS and ParaDOS extend the standard AMSDOS system to provide support for double-sided, 80-track formats, enabling up to 800k to be stored on a single disc.

The 3&quot; discs themselves are usually known as &quot;discs&quot; on the CPC, following the spelling on the machine's plastic casing and conventional non-American spelling.

===Expansion===
The hardware and firmware was designed to be able to access software provided on external ROMs. Each ROM has to be a 16k block and was switched in and out of the memory space shared with the video RAM. The Amstrad firmware is deliberately designed so that new software could be easily accessed from these ROMs with minimum of fuss. Popular applications were marketed on ROM, particularly word processing and programming utility software (examples are Protext and Brunword of the former, and the MAXAM assembler of the latter type).

Such extra ROM chips do not plug directly into the CPC itself, but into extra plug-in &quot;rom boxes&quot; which contain sockets for the ROM chips and a minimal amount of decoding circuitry for the main machine to be able to switch between them. These boxes were either marketed commercially or could be built by competent hobbyists and they attached to the main expansion port at the back of the machine. Software on ROM loads much faster than from disc or tape and the machine's boot-up sequence was designed to evaluate ROMs it found and optionally hand over control of the machine to them. This allowes significant customization of the functionality of the machine, something that enthusiasts exploited for various purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amstrad CPC ROM expansion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Amstrad CPC ROM expansion |url=http://8bit.yarek.pl/hardware/cpc.rom/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the typical user would probably not be aware of this added ROM functionality unless they read the CPC press, as it is not described in the user manual and was hardly ever mentioned in marketing literature. It is, however, documented in the official Amstrad firmware manual.

The machines also feature a 9-pin [[Atari]]-style [[joystick]] socket that will either directly take one joystick, or two joysticks by use of a splitter cable.&lt;ref name=&quot;464 Tech spec&quot;/&gt;

==Peripherals==
===RS232 Serial Adapters===

Amstrad issued two [[RS-232|RS-232-C]] [[D-subminiature|D25]] serial interfaces, attached to the expansion connector on the rear of the machine, with a through-connector for the CPC464 disk drive or other peripherals.

The original interface came with a ''Book of Spells'' for facilitating data transfer between other systems using a proprietary [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] in the device's own ROM, as well as [[computer terminal|terminal]] software to connect to British Telecom's [[Prestel]] service. A separate version of the ROM was created for the U.S. market due to the use of the commands &quot;|SUCK&quot; and &quot;|BLOW&quot;, which were considered unacceptable there.

Software and hardware limitations in this interface led to its replacement with an Amstrad-branded version of a compatible alternative by [[Pace Micro Technology|Pace]]. Serial interfaces were also available from third-party vendors such as KDS Electronics and Cirkit.

==Software==
===BASIC and operating system===

[[Image:Amstrad CPC screen closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive BASIC on the Amstrad CPC 464]]
Like most home computers at the time, the CPC has its [[operating system|OS]] and a [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] built in as [[read-only memory|ROM]]. It uses [[Locomotive BASIC]] - an improved version of Locomotive Software's Z80 BASIC for the [[BBC Microcomputer]] co-processor board. It is particularly notable for providing easy access to the machine's video and audio resources in contrast to the arcane [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]] commands required on generic Microsoft implementations. Other unusual features include timed event handling with the AFTER and EVERY commands, and text-based windowing.

===CP/M===

[[Digital Research]]'s [[CP/M]] operating system was supplied with the 664 and 6128 disk-based systems, and the DDI-1 disk expansion unit for the 464. 64k machines shipped with CP/M 2.2 alone, while the 128k machines also include CP/M 3.1. The compact CP/M 2.2 implementation is largely stored on the boot sectors of a 3&quot; disk in what was called &quot;System format&quot;; typing |CPM from Locomotive BASIC would load code from these sectors, making it a popular choice for custom game loading routines. The CP/M 3.1 implementation is largely in a separate file which is in turn loaded from the boot sector.
Much [[public domain]] CP/M software was made available for the CPC, from word-processors such as [[VDE]] to complete bulletin board systems such as ROS.

===Other languages===

Although it was possible to obtain compilers for Locomotive BASIC, [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], the majority of the CPC's software was written in native Z80 assembly language. Popular assemblers were Hisoft's Devpac, Arnor's Maxam, and (in France) DAMS. Disk-based CPC (not Plus) systems shipped with an interpreter for the educational language [[Logo programming language|LOGO]], booted from CP/M 2.2 but largely CPC-specific with much code resident in the AMSDOS ROM; 6128 machines also include a CP/M 3.1, non-ROM version. A C compiler was also written and made available for the European market through Tandy Europe, by Micro Business products.

===''Roland''===

In an attempt to give the CPC a recognizable mascot, a number of games by Amstrad's in-house software publisher [[Amsoft]] have been tagged with the ''Roland'' name. However, as the games had not been designed around the Roland character and only had the branding added later, the character design varies immensely, from a spiky-haired blonde teenager (''Roland Goes Digging'') to a white cube with legs (''Roland Goes Square Bashing'') or a mutant flea (''[[La Pulga|Roland In The Caves]]''). The only two games with similar gameplay and main character design are ''Roland in Time'' and its sequel ''Roland in Space''. The Roland character has been named after Roland Perry, one of the lead designers of the original CPC range.

==Schneider Computer Division==

[[Image:Schneider Computer Division logo (horizontal).svg|thumb|right|Schneider Computer Division logo]]
In order to market its computers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where Amstrad did not have any distribution structures, Amstrad entered a partnership with ''Schneider'', a German company that - very much like Amstrad itself - was previously only known for value-priced audio products. In 1984, Schneider's ''Schneider Computer Division'' daughter company was created specifically for the task, and the complete Amstrad CPC line-up was branded and sold as ''Schneider CPC''.

Although they are based on the same hardware, the Schneider CPC models differ from the Amstrad CPC models in several details. Most prominently, the Schneider CPC464 and CPC664 keyboards featured gray instead of coloured keys, but still in the original British keyboard layout. To achieve a German &quot;QUERTZ&quot; keyboard layout, Schneider marketed a small software to reassign the keys as well as sticker labels for the keys.&lt;ref&gt;''CPC Schneider International'' 6/85, P. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In order to conform with stricter German [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] regulations, the complete Schneider CPC line-up is equipped with an internal metal shielding. For the same reason, the Schneider CPC6128 features [[micro ribbon]] type connectors instead of [[edge connector]]s. Both the greyscale keyboard and the micro ribbon connectors found their way up into the design of later Amstrad CPC models.

In 1988, after Schneider refused to market Amstrad's AT-compatible computer line, the cooperation ended. Schneider went on to sell the remaining stock of Schneider CPC models and used their now well-established market position to introduce its own PC designs. With the formation of its German daughter company ''Amstrad GmbH'' to distribute its product lines including the CPC464 and CPC6128, Amstrad attempted but ultimately failed to establish their own brand in the German-speaking parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cebit '88, ''Schneider Magazin'' 5/88, P. 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Defunct Audio Manufacturers |url=http://audiotools.com/dead_s.html |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==
The Amstrad CPC enjoyed a strong and long lifetime, mainly due to the machines use for businesses as well as gaming. Dedicated programmers continued working on the CPC range, even producing [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI) operating systems such as [[FutureOS]] and [[SymbOS]]. Internet sites devoted to the CPC have appeared from around the world featuring forums, news, hardware, software, programming and games. CPC [[Computer magazine|Magazines]] appeared during the 1980s including publications in countries such as Britain, France, Spain, Germany, [[Denmark]], [[Australia]], and [[Greece]]. Titles included the official [[Amstrad Computer User]] publication,&lt;ref name=&quot;CPC UK magazines&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=CPC UK Magazines|work=|publisher=Nicholas Campbell|date=|url=http://users.durge.org/~nich/cpcmags/|format=|doi=|accessdate=6 May 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as independent titles like ''[[Amstrad Action]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;CPC UK magazines&quot;/&gt; ''[[Amtix!]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;CPC UK magazines&quot;/&gt; ''[[Computing with the Amstrad CPC]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;CPC UK magazines&quot;/&gt; ''[[CPC Attack]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;CPC UK magazines&quot;/&gt; Australia's ''The Amstrad User'', France's ''Amstrad Cent Pour Cent'' and ''Amstar''. Following the CPCs end of production, Amstrad gave permission for the CPC ROMs to be distributed freely as long as the copyright message is not changed and that it is acknowledged that Amstrad still holds copyright, giving [[emulator]] authors the possibility to ship the CPC firmware with their programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson emulation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawson|first=Cliff|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Lawson emulation|work=|publisher=Cliff Lawson|date=|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cliff.lawson/cpchomec.htm|doi=|accessdate=6 May 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on other Amstrad machines==

Amstrad followed their success with the CPC 464 by launching the [[Amstrad PCW]] word-processor range, another Z80-based machine with a 3&quot; disk drive and software by [[Locomotive Software]]. The PCW was originally developed to be partly compatible with an improved version of the CPC (''ANT'', or Arnold Number Two - the CPC's development codename was Arnold). However, Amstrad decided to focus on the PCW, and the ANT project never came to market.

On 7 April 1986 Amstrad announced it had bought from [[Sinclair Research]] &quot;...the worldwide rights to sell and manufacture all existing and future Sinclair computers and computer products, together with the Sinclair brand name and those intellectual property rights where they relate to computers and computer related products.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/28/news.htm CRASH 28 - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which included the [[ZX Spectrum]], for £5 million. This included Sinclair's unsold stock of [[Sinclair QL]]s and Spectrums. Amstrad made more than £5 million on selling these surplus machines alone. Amstrad launched two new variants of the Spectrum: the [[ZX Spectrum +2]], based on the ZX Spectrum 128, with a built-in [[compact audio cassette|tape]] drive (like the CPC 464) and, the following year, the [[ZX Spectrum +3]], with a built-in [[floppy disk]] drive (similar to the CPC 664 and 6128), taking the 3&quot; disks that Amstrad CPC machines used.

An airport security guard and Imam, '''Abdulaziz al-Omari''' ({{lang-ar|عبد العزيز العمري}}, ''ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-ʿUmarī'', also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alomari''' or '''al-Umari''') (May 28, 1979&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/abdul_aziz_al_omari.htm&lt;/ref&gt; – September 11, 2001) was one of five [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[American Airlines Flight 11]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].

A [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]], Omari arrived in the [[United States]] in June 2001, on a tourist visa, obtained through the [[Visa Express]] program.

On September 11, 2001, Omari boarded [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which was crashed into the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center]], as part of the coordinated attacks.

==History==
Little is known about Omari's life, and it is unclear whether some information refers to Omari or another person by that name. He has used birth dates of December 24, 1972 and May 28, 1979. 

Omari came from [['Asir|Asir Province]], a poor region in southwestern [[Saudi Arabia]] that borders [[Yemen]], and graduated with honours from high school, attained a degree from the [[Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University]], was married, and had a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;CIA analytic report,&quot;The Plot and the Plotters,&quot; June 1, 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is alleged to have often served as an [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|Imam]] at his mosque in Saudi Arabia and is believed by American Authorities to have been a student of a Saudi cleric named Sulayman al Alwan, whose mosque is located in [[Al-Qassim Province]].

According to [[Walid bin 'Attash|Tawfiq bin Attash]], Omari was one of a group of future hijackers who provided security at [[Kandahar]] airport after their basic training at an al-Qaeda camp. During the [[Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit|2000 Al Qaeda Summit]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], American authorities claim that immigration records show that a person named Abdulaziz al-Omari was visiting the country, although they say they are not sure that this was the same person.

In the autumn of 2001, after September 11, al Jazeera television broadcast a tape they claim was made by Omari. The speaker made a farewell suicide video. In it, he reads &quot;I am writing this with my full conscience and I am writing this in expectation of the end, which is near. . . God praise everybody who trained and helped me, namely the leader Sheikh [[Osama bin Laden]].&quot;{{Cn|date=May 2011}}

According to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[Robert Mueller]] and the [[9/11 Commission]], Omari entered the United States through a [[Dubai]] flight on June 29, 2001, with [[Salem al-Hazmi]], landing in [[New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html&lt;/ref&gt; He had used the controversial [[Visa Express]] program to gain entry. He apparently stayed with several other hijackers in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], before moving to his own place at 4032 57th Terrace, [[Vero Beach, Florida]]. On his rental agreement form for that house, Omari gave two license-plates authorized to park in his space, one of which was registered to Atta.&lt;ref name=PATERSON&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/atta/resources/documents/fbiaffidavit11.htm FBI Affidavit: Page 11] ABC&lt;/ref&gt; Omari occasionally trained on simulators at the [[FlightSafety International|FlightSafety Academy]] in [[Vero Beach, Florida]] together with [[Mohand al-Shehri]] and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1341136/Piecing-together-the-shadowy-lives-of-the-hijackers.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Piecing together the shadowy lives of the hijackers | date=September 20, 2001 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omari obtained a fake United States ID card from ''All Services Plus'' in [[Passaic County, New Jersey]], which was in the business of selling fake documents, including another to [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E0DD1E3FF93BA35750C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=A Plea Deal, Then Freedom, in Terror Case Where Prosecutors Kept Evidence a Secret |author=Miller, Jonathan |date=2003-03-08 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks==
[[Image:Atta in airport.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Atta (blue shirt) and Omari at [[Portland International Jetport]] on 9/11]]
{{Main|American Airlines Flight 11}}
On September 10, 2001, [[Mohamed Atta]] picked up Omari from the Milner Hotel in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and the two drove [[Vehicles of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks#Mohamed Atta's Nissan Altima|their rented Nissan]] to a [[Choice Hotels|Comfort Inn]] in [[Portland, Maine|South Portland, Maine]], where they spent the night in room 232. It was initially reported that [[Adnan Bukhari|Adnan]] and [[Ameer Bukhari]] were the two hijackers who had rented and driven the car.&lt;ref name=REPORTED&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200109/13/eng20010913_80131.html Two Brothers among Hijackers: CNN Report] People's Daily&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early hours of September 11, they boarded a commuter flight back to Boston to connect to [[American Airlines Flight 11]]. American 11 was hijacked 15 minutes after the flight departed by Omari and four other hijackers, which allowed trained pilot Mohamed Atta to crash the Boeing 767 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of an attack that killed thousands of people.

==Mistaken identity==
[[Image:Abdulaziz al-omari alive.jpg|thumb|left|80px|Wrongly accused [[Abdul Rahman al-Omari]]]]
Controversy over Omari's identity erupted shortly after the attacks. At first, the FBI had named [[Abdul Rahman al-Omari]], a pilot for [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]], as the pilot of Flight 11. It was quickly shown that this person was still alive, and the FBI issued an apology. It was also quickly determined that [[Mohamed Atta]] was the pilot among the hijackers. The FBI then named Abdulaziz al-Omari as a hijacker.

A man with the same name as those given by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] turned up alive in [[Saudi Arabia]], saying that he had studied at the [[University of Denver]] and his [[passport]] was stolen there in 1995. The name, origin, birth date, and occupation were released by the FBI, but the picture was not of him. &quot;I couldn't believe it when the FBI put me on their list&quot;, he said. &quot;They gave my name and my date of birth, but I am not a suicide bomber. I am here. I am alive. I have no idea how to fly a plane. I had nothing to do with this.&quot;&lt;ref name=NOFLY&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2071FF63D5F0C758DDDA00894D9404482][http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=94438][http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1559151.stm ?] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; This individual was not the same person as the hijacker whose identity was later confirmed by Saudi government interviews with his family, according to the [[9/11 Commission]] Report.

'''Aage Niels Bohr''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɔːʊ̯ ˌnels ˈboɐ̯ˀ|-|Da-Aage Niels Bohr.ogg}}; 19 June 1922 – 8 September 2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/videnskab/article785607.ece &quot;Nobelprisvinderen Aage Bohr er død&quot;] (&quot;''Nobel Prize winner Aage Bohr has died''&quot;), politiken.dk, 10 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate]], and the son of the famous [[physicist]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate]] [[Niels Bohr]].

==Life and career==
Bohr was born in Copenhagen in 1922, and grew up surrounded by physicists such as [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]], who were working with his father at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (now the [[Niels Bohr Institute]]) at the [[University of Copenhagen]].  

In 1940, shortly after the German occupation of Denmark, Bohr began his physics degree at the University of Copenhagen.  In October 1943, shortly before he was to be arrested by the German police, Niels Bohr [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|escaped to Sweden]] with his family, later travelling to London and on to work on the [[Manhattan Project]]. During this time, Aage Bohr travelled with his father, acting as his assistant and secretary.

The Bohrs returned to Denmark in 1945, and Aage returned to University, graduating with a master's degree in 1946, with a thesis concerned with some aspects of atomic stopping problems.  Following graduation, he became an associate at the Niels Bohr Institute.

Bohr worked at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] in early 1948, and later at [[Columbia University]] from January 1949 to August 1950. While in the US, Bohr married Marietta Soffer; the couple had three children, Vilhelm, Tomas and Margrethe.

Bohr became a professor at the University of Copenhagen in 1956, and, following his father's death in 1962, succeeded him as director of the Niels Bohr Institute, a position he held until 1970.  He was also a member of the board of the [[Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (Nordita) from its inception in 1957, becoming its director in 1975.

===Physics===
By the late 1940s it was known that the properties of [[atomic nuclei|atomic nucleus]] could not be explained by the then-current models (such as the [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|liquid drop model]] developed by Niels Bohr amongst others).  The [[Shell model|nuclear shell model]], developed in 1949, allowed some additional features to be explained, in particular the so-called [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]].  However, there were also properties which could not be explained, including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei.

[[James Rainwater]] of Columbia University suggested a model of the nucleus which could explain a non-spherical charge distribution in a 1950 paper. Bohr, visiting Columbia at the time, had independently come up with the same idea, and submitted a paper for publication about a month after Rainwater's which discussed the same problem along more general lines. Bohr later developed the idea further, in 1951 publishing a paper which comprehensively treated the relationship between oscillations of the surface of the nucleus and the movement of the individual [[nucleon]]s.

On his return to Copenhagen in 1950, Bohr began working with [[Ben Roy Mottelson|Ben Mottelson]] to compare the theoretical work with experimental data. In three papers which were published in 1952-53, Bohr and Mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment, for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum.  This work stimulated new theoretical and experimental studies.  As a result, he won the [[Atoms for Peace Award]] in 1969.

Bohr, Mottelson and Rainwater were jointly awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobelpressrelease&quot;&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/ Nobel prize citation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohr and Mottelson continued to work together, publishing a two-volume [[monograph]], ''Nuclear Structure''. The first volume, ''Single-Particle Motion,'' appeared in 1969, and the second volume, ''Nuclear Deformations,'' in 1975.

'''Analytic geometry''', or '''analytical geometry''' has two different meanings in mathematics. The [[Analytic geometry#Modern analytic geometry|modern and advanced meaning]] refers to the geometry of [[analytic variety|analytic varieties]]. This article focuses on the classical and elementary meaning.

In classical mathematics, ''analytic geometry'', also known as '''coordinate geometry''', or '''Cartesian geometry''', is the study of [[geometry]] using a [[coordinate system]] and the principles of [[algebra]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].  This contrasts with the [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] approach of [[Euclidean geometry]], which treats certain geometric notions as [[Primitive notion|primitive]], and uses [[deductive reasoning]] based on [[axiom]]s and [[theorem]]s to derive truth.  Analytic geometry is widely used in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], and is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry, including [[algebraic geometry|algebraic]], [[differential geometry|differential]], [[discrete geometry|discrete]], and [[computational geometry|computational]] geometry.

Usually the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is applied to manipulate [[equation]]s for [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]s, [[straight]] [[Line (geometry)|line]]s, and [[Square (geometry)|square]]s, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions of measurement. Geometrically, one studies the [[Euclidean plane]] (2 dimensions) and [[Euclidean space]] (3 dimensions). As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes' numerical definitions and representations. The numerical output, however, might also be a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] or a [[geometric shape|shape]]. That the algebra of the [[real numbers]] can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the [[Cantor–Dedekind axiom]].

==History==
The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] mathematician [[Menaechmus]] solved problems and proved theorems by using a method that had a strong resemblance to the use of coordinates and it has sometimes been maintained that he had introduced analytic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second Edition |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0471543977|chapter=The Age of Plato and Aristotle|pages=94–95|quote=Menaechmus apparently derived these properties of the conic sections and others as well. Since this material has a strong resemblance to the use of coordinates, as illustrated above, it has sometimes been maintained that Menaechmus had analytic geometry. Such a judgment is warranted only in part, for certainly Menaechmus was unaware that any equation in two unknown quantities determines a curve. In fact, the general concept of an equation in unknown quantities was alien to Greek thought. It was shortcomings in algebraic notations that, more than anything else, operated against the Greek achievement of a full-fledged coordinate geometry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollonius of Perga]], in ''[[Apollonius of Perga#De Sectione Determinata|On Determinate Section]]'', dealt with problems in a manner that may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension; with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second Edition |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0471543977|chapter=Apollonius of Perga |pages=142|quote=The Apollonian treatise ''On Determinate Section'' dealt with what might be called an analytic geometry of one dimension. It considered the following general problem, using the typical Greek algebraic analysis in geometric form: Given four points A, B, C, D on a straight line, determine a fifth point P on it such that the rectangle on AP and CP is in a given ratio to the rectangle on BP and DP. Here, too, the problem reduces easily to the solution of a quadratic; and, as in other cases, Apollonius treated the question exhaustively, including the limits of possibility and the number of solutions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollonius in the ''Conics'' further developed a method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of [[Descartes]] — by some 1800 years. His application of reference lines, a diameter and a tangent is essentially no different than our modern use of a coordinate frame, where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. He further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent to rhetorical equations of curves. However, although Apollonius came close to developing analytic geometry, he did not manage to do so since he did not take into account negative magnitudes and in every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon a given curve ''a posteriori'' instead of ''a priori''. That is, equations were determined by curves, but curves were not determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions applied to a specific geometric situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second Edition |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0471543977|chapter=Apollonius of Perga |pages=156|quote=The method of Apollonius in the ''Conics'' in many respects are so similar to the modern approach that his work sometimes is judged to be an analytic geometry anticipating that of Descartes by 1800 years. The application of references lines in general, and of a diameter and a tangent at its extremity in particular, is, of course, not essentially different from the use fo a coordinate frame, whether rectangular or, more generally, oblique. Distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. The Apollonian relationship between these abscissas and the corresponding ordinates are nothing more nor less than rhetorical forms of the equations of the curves. However, Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes; moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed ''a posteriori'' upon a given curve in order to study its properties. There appear to be no cases in ancient geometry in which a coordinate frame of reference was laid down ''a priori'' for purposes of graphical representation of an equation or relationship, whether symbolically or rhetorically expressed. Of Greek geometry we may say that equations are determined by curves, but not that curves are determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions derived from a specific geometric situation; [...] That Apollonius, the greatest geometer of antiquity, failed to develop analytic geometry, was probably the result of a poverty of curves rather than of thought. General methods are not necessary when problems concern always one of a limited number of particular cases.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eleventh century [[Persian Empire|Persian]] mathematician [[Omar Khayyám]] saw a strong relationship between geometry and algebra, and was moving in the right direction when he helped to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots&quot;/&gt; with his geometric solution of the general [[cubic equation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Glen M. Cooper (2003). &quot;Omar Khayyam, the Mathmetician&quot;, ''The Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''123'''.&lt;/ref&gt; but the decisive step came later with Descartes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=The Arabic Hegemony|pages=241–242|quote=Omar Khayyam (ca. 1050–1123), the &quot;tent-maker,&quot; wrote an ''Algebra'' that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of third degree. Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the sixteenth century later showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, &quot;Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytic geometry has traditionally been attributed to [[René Descartes]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer Omar Khayyam positive roots&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|title=Mathematics and its History |edition=Second Edition |publisher=Springer Science + Business Media Inc.|year=2004|chapter=Analytic Geometry|pages=105|isbn=0387953361|quote=the two founders of analytic geometry, Fermat and Descartes, were both strongly influenced by these developments.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger |last=Cooke |authorlink=Roger Cooke |title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course|publisher=Wiley-Interscience |year=1997 |chapter=The Calculus |pages=326 |isbn=0471180823 |quote=The person who is popularly credited with being the discoverer of analytic geometry was the philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650), one of the most influential thinkers of the modern era.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes made significant progress with the methods in an essay entitled ''[[La Geometrie|Geometry]]'', one of the three accompanying essays published in 1637 together with his ''Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason in the Search for Truth in the Sciences'', commonly referred to as ''[[Discourse on Method]]''. This work, written in his native [[French language|French]] tongue, and its philosophical principles, provided the foundation for [[Infinitesimal calculus]] in Europe.

[[Abraham de Moivre]] also pioneered the development of analytic geometry.

==Basic principles==
[[Image:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|thumb|right|250px|Illustration of a Cartesian coordinate plane. Four points are marked and labeled with their coordinates: (2,3) in green, (−3,1) in red, (−1.5,−2.5) in blue, and the origin (0,0) in purple.]]

===Coordinates===
{{Main|Coordinate systems}}
In analytic geometry, the [[Euclidean plane|plane]] is given a coordinate system, by which every [[point (geometry)|point]] has a pair of [[real number]] coordinates.  The most common coordinate system to use is the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], where each point has an ''x''-coordinate representing its horizontal position, and a ''y''-coordinate representing its vertical position.  These are typically written as an [[ordered pair]] (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'').  This system can also be used for three-dimensional geometry, where every point in [[Euclidean space]] is represented by an [[Tuple|ordered triple]] of coordinates (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'').

Other coordinate systems are possible.  On the plane the most common alternative is [[polar coordinates]], where every point is represented by its [[radius]] ''r'' from the origin and its [[angle]] ''θ''.  In three dimensions, common alternative coordinate systems include [[cylindrical coordinates]] and [[spherical coordinates]].

===Equations of curves===
In analytic geometry, any [[equation]] involving the coordinates specifies a [[subset]] of the plane, namely the [[solution set]] for the equation.  For example, the equation ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' corresponds to the set of all the points on the plane whose ''x''-coordinate and ''y''-coordinate are equal.  These points form a [[line (geometry)|line]], and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' is said to be the equation for this line.  In general, linear equations involving ''x'' and ''y'' specify lines, [[quadratic equation]]s specify [[conic section]]s, and more complicated equations describe more complicated figures.

Usually, a single equation corresponds to a [[curve]] on the plane.  This is not always the case: the trivial equation ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' specifies the entire plane, and the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 specifies only the single point (0,&amp;nbsp;0).  In three dimensions, a single equation usually gives a [[surface]], and a curve must be specified as the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of two surfaces (see below), or as a system of [[parametric equation]]s. The equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the equation for any circle with a radius of r.

[[Image:Distance Formula.svg|thumb|right|250px|The distance formula on the plane follows from the Pythagorean theorem.]]

===Distance and angle===
In analytic geometry, geometric notions such as [[distance]] and [[angle]] measure are defined using [[formula]]s.  These definitions are designed to be consistent with the underlying [[Euclidean geometry]].  For example, using [[Cartesian coordinates]] on the plane, the distance between two points (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2},\!&lt;/math&gt;
which can be viewed as a version of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].  Similarly, the angle that a line makes with the horizontal can be defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \tan^{-1}(m)\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the [[slope]] of the line.

===Transformations===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Transformations are applied to parent functions to turn it into a new function with similar characteristics. For example, the parent function y=1/x has a horizontal and a vertical asymptote, and occupies the first and third quadrant, and all of its transformed forms have one horizontal and vertical asymptote,and occupies either the 1st and 3rd or 2nd and 4th quadrant. In general, if ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x''), then it can be transformed into ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''af''(''b''(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''))&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h''. In the new transformed function, a is the factor that vertically stretches the function if it is greater than 1 or vertically compresses the function if it is less than 1, and for negative a values, the function is reflected in the ''x''-axis. The b value compresses the graph of the function horizontally if greater than 1 and stretches the function horizontally if less than 1, and like ''a'', reflects the function in the ''y''-axis when it is negative. The k and h values introduce translations, ''h'', vertical, and ''k'' horizontal. Positive ''h'' and ''k'' values mean the function is translated to the positive end of its axis and negative meaning translation towards the negative end.

===Intersections===
{{Empty section|date=December 2009}}

==Themes==
Important themes of analytical geometry are
* [[vector space]]
* definition of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]
* [[distance]] problems
* the [[dot product]], to get the angle of two vectors
* the [[cross product]], to get a perpendicular vector of two known vectors (and also their spatial volume)
* [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] problems

Many of these problems involve [[linear algebra]].

==Example==
Here  an example of a problem from the [[United States of America Mathematical Talent Search]] that can be solved via analytic geometry:

'''Problem:''' In a convex pentagon &lt;math&gt;ABCDE&lt;/math&gt;, the sides have lengths &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;, though not necessarily in
that order. Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoints of the sides &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CD&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoint of segment &lt;math&gt;FH&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be the midpoint of segment &lt;math&gt;GI&lt;/math&gt;. The length of
segment &lt;math&gt;XY&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. Find all possible values for the length of side &lt;math&gt;AE&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Solution:''' [[Without loss of generality]], let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be located at &lt;math&gt;A=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B=(a,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C=(b,e)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D=(c,f)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E=(d,g)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the [[midpoint]] formula, the points &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are located at

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(\frac{a}{2},0\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G\left(\frac{a+b}{2},\frac{e}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H\left(\frac{b+c}{2},\frac{e+f}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I\left(\frac{c+d}{2},\frac{f+g}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X\left(\frac{a+b+c}{4},\frac{e+f}{4}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Y\left(\frac{a+b+c+d}{4},\frac{e+f+g}{4}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[distance]] formula,

:&lt;math&gt;AE=\sqrt{d^2+g^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;XY=\sqrt{\frac{d^2}{16}+\frac{g^2}{16}}=\frac{\sqrt{d^2+g^2}}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;XY&lt;/math&gt; has to be an [[integer]],
:&lt;math&gt;AE\equiv 0\pmod{4}&lt;/math&gt;
(see [[modular arithmetic]]) so &lt;math&gt;AE=4&lt;/math&gt;.

==Modern analytic geometry==
{{Main|Algebraic geometry}}
{{See|Complex geometry}}

An '''[[analytic variety]]''' is defined locally as the set of common solutions of several equations involving [[analytic function]]s. It is analogous to the included concept of real or complex [[algebraic variety]]. Any [[complex manifold]] is an analytic variety. Since analytic varieties may have [[Mathematical singularity|singular points]], not all analytic varieties are manifolds.

Analytic geometry is essentially equivalent to real and complex [[Algebraic geometry]] as it has been shown by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] in his paper ''[[GAGA]]'', whose name is, in French, ''Algebraic geometry and analytic geometric''. Nevertheless, the two fields remain distinct, as the methods of proof are quite different and algebraic geometry includes also geometry in finite [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]].

The '''Arabic alphabet''' ({{lang-ar|أبجدية عربية}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾabǧadiyyah ʿarabiyyah}}'') or '''Arabic abjad''' is the [[writing system|script]] used for writing several languages of Asia and Africa, such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Urdu]]. After the [[Latin alphabet]], it is the second-most widely used alphabet around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9008156/Arabic-alphabet |title=Arabic Alphabet |accessdate=2007-11-23 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic script is written from right to left, in a [[cursive]] style, and includes 28 basic letters. Because all letters usually&lt;ref&gt;While there are ways to mark vowels, these are not always employed. Because of this, it is more exactly called an &quot;impure abjad&quot;. See [[Abjad#Impure abjads]] for a discussion of this nomenclature.&lt;/ref&gt; stand for consonants, it is classified as an [[abjad]]. 

The script was first used to write texts in Arabic, most notably the ''[[Qur'an|{{transl|ar|DIN|Qurʾān}}]]'', the holy book of [[Islam]]. With the spread of Islam, it came to be used to write languages of many language families, leading to the addition of new letters and other symbols. (See section {{sectionlink|Languages written with the Arabic alphabet}} below.) It is also the basis for a rich tradition of [[Arabic calligraphy]].

==Consonants==

The Arabic alphabet has 28 basic [[letter (alphabet)|letters]]. Adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages, such as [[Perso-Arabic script|Persian]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Urdu]], [[Jawi script|Malay]] or [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Arabi Malayalam]], have additional letters, on which see below. There are no distinct [[Letter case|upper and lower case]] letter forms.

Many letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots (''{{transl|ar|ʾiʿǧām}}'') above or below their central part, called ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[rasm]]}}''. These dots are an integral part of a letter, since they distinguish between letters that represent different sounds. For example, the Arabic letters transliterated as ''{{transl|ar|DIN|b}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|t}}'' have the same basic shape, but ''{{transl|ar|DIN|b}}'' has one dot below, {{rtl-lang|ar|ب}}, and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|t}}'' has two dots above, {{rtl-lang|ar|ت}}.

Both printed and written Arabic are [[cursive]], with most of the letters within a word directly connected to the adjacent letters.

===Alphabetical order===

There are two main [[collation|collating sequences]] for the Arabic alphabet:

* The original ''{{transl|ar|DIN|abǧadī}}'' order ({{lang|ar|أبجدي}}), used for lettering, derives from the order of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. In this order letters are also used as numbers.

* The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hiǧāʾī}}'' ({{lang|ar|هجائي}}) or ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalifbāʾī}}'' order shown in the table below, used where lists of names and words are sorted, as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries, groups letters by similarity of shape.

The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|abǧadī}}'' order is not a simple historical continuation of the earlier north Semitic alphabetic order, since it has a position corresponding to the Aramaic letter ''[[samekh]]''/''semkat'' {{lang|he|ס}}, yet no letter of the Arabic alphabet historically derives from that letter. Loss of samekh was compensated for by the split of [[shin (letter)|''shin'']] {{lang|he|ש}} into two independent Arabic letters, {{lang|ar|ش}} (''shīn'') and {{lang|ar|ﺱ}} (''sīn'') which moved up to take the place of ''samekh''.

The most common ''{{transl|ar|DIN|abǧadī}}'' sequence is:
:{{lang|ar|أ ب ج د ه‍ و ز ح ط ي ك ل م ن س ع ف ص ق ر ش ت ث خ ذ ض ظ غ}}
:&lt;span style=&quot;direction:rtl; unicode-bidi:bidi-override; letter-spacing:1px;&quot;&gt;{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾ b ǧ d h w z ḥ ṭ y k l m n s ʿ f ṣ q r š t ṯ ḫ ḏ ḍ ẓ ġ }}&lt;/span&gt;
This is commonly vocalized as follows:
:*''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾabǧad hawwaz ḥuṭṭī kalaman saʿfaṣ qarašat ṯaḫaḏ ḍaẓaġ}}''.
Another vocalization is:
:*''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾabuǧadin hawazin ḥuṭiya kalman saʿfaṣ qurišat ṯaḫuḏ ḍaẓuġ}}''

Another ''{{transl|ar|DIN|abǧadī}}'' sequence (probably older, now mainly confined to the Maghreb), is:&lt;ref name=magb&gt;{{ar icon}} [http://alyaseer.net/vb/showthread.php?t=8807 Alyaseer.net ترتيب المداخل والبطاقات في القوائم والفهارس الموضوعية Ordering entries and cards in subject indexes] Discussion thread ''(Accessed 2009-Oct-06)''&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{lang|ar|أ ب ج د ه‍ و ز ح ط ي ك ل م ن ص ع ف ض ق ر س ت ث خ ذ ظ غ ش}}
:&lt;span style=&quot;direction:rtl; unicode-bidi:bidi-override; letter-spacing:1px;&quot;&gt;{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾ b ǧ d h w z ḥ ṭ y k l m n ṣ ʿ f ḍ q r s t ṯ ḫ ḏ ẓ ġ š}}&lt;/span&gt;

which can be vocalized as:
:*''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾabuǧadin hawazin ḥuṭiya kalman ṣaʿfaḍ qurisat ṯaḫuḏ ẓaġuš}}''

Modern dictionaries and other reference books do not use the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|abǧadī}}'' order to sort alphabetically; instead, the newer ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hiǧāʾī}}'' order (with letters partially grouped together by similarity of shape) is used:
:{{lang|ar|أ ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه و ي}}
:&lt;span style=&quot;direction:rtl; unicode-bidi:bidi-override; letter-spacing:1px;&quot;&gt;{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾ b t ṯ ǧ ḥ ḫ d ḏ r z s š ṣ ḍ ṭ ẓ ʿ ġ f q k l m n h w y}}&lt;/span&gt;

Another kind of ''{{transl|ar|alphabaʼi}}''&lt;!--needs confirmation--&gt; order used to be widely used in the [[Maghreb]] until recently when it was replaced by the [[Mashriq|''{{transl|ar|DIN|mašriqī}}'']] order:&lt;ref name=magb/&gt;
:{{lang|ar|أ ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ  ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه‍ و ي}}

===Letter forms===

Unlike cursive writing based on the [[Latin alphabet]], the standard Arabic style is to have a substantially different shape depending on whether it will be connecting with a preceding and/or a succeeding letter, thus all primary letters have conditional forms ([[Allography|allographs]]), depending on whether they are at the beginning, middle or end of a word, so they may exhibit four distinct forms ('''''initial''''', '''''medial''''', '''''final''''' or '''''isolated'''''). However, six letters (&lt;big&gt;{{lang|ar|و ز ر ذ د ا}}&lt;/big&gt;) have only isolated or final form, and so force the following letter (if any) to take an initial or isolated form, as if there were a word break. For example, '''&lt;big&gt;أرارات&lt;/big&gt;''' ([[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]) has only isolated forms, because each letter cannot be connected to its adjacent one.

Some letters look almost the same in all four forms, while others show considerable variation. Generally, the initial and middle forms look similar except that in some letters the middle form starts with a short horizontal line on the right to ensure that it will connect with its preceding letter. The final and isolated forms, are also similar in appearance but the final form will also have a horizontal stroke on the right and, for some letters, a loop or longer line on the left with which to finish the word with a subtle ornamental flourish. In addition, some letter combinations are written as [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] (special shapes), including ''{{transl|ar|lām-ʾalif}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Writing Systems: A Linguistic Approach |author=Rogers, Henry |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2005 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''&lt;br /&gt;
*The transliteration given is the widespread [[DIN 31635]] standard, with some common alternatives. See the article ''[[Romanization of Arabic]]'' for details and various other transliteration schemes.

*Regarding pronunciation, the phonetic values given are those of the pronunciation of [[literary Arabic]], the standard which is taught in universities. In practice, pronunciation may vary considerably between the different [[varieties of Arabic]]. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the article ''[[Arabic phonology]]''.

*The names of the Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they were meaningful words in the [[Proto-Semitic]] language.

*Six letters (&lt;big&gt;{{lang|ar|و ز ر ذ د ا}}&lt;/big&gt;) don't have a distinct medial form and have to be written with their final form without being connected to the next letter. Their initial form matches the isolated form.

====Further notes====
* The letter ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'' originated in the [[Phoenician alphabet]] as a consonant-sign indicating the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. Today it has lost its function as a consonant, and, together with  ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yaʾ}}'' and  ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}'', is a ''[[mater lectionis]]'', a consonant sign standing in for a long vowel (see below), or as support for certain diacritics (''{{transl|ar|DIN|maddah}}'' and ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}]]'').

* The shape of the final ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'' is always undotted &lt;big&gt;{{lang|ar|[[ى]]}}&lt;/big&gt; in both print and handwriting in Egypt and Sudan, mainly.

* Arabic currently uses a diacritic sign, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;&quot;&gt; {{rtl-lang|ar|ﺀ}}&lt;/span&gt;, called ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}]]'', to denote the glottal stop, written alone or with a carrier:
** alone: {{rtl-lang|ar|ء}} ;
** with a carrier: {{rtl-lang|ar|إ أ}} (above or under a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}''), {{rtl-lang|ar|ؤ}} (above a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}''), {{rtl-lang|ar|ئ}} (above a dotless ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}''  or ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ hamzah}}'').

* Letters lacking an initial or medial version are never linked to the letter that follows, even within a word. The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}'' has a single form, since it is never linked to a preceding or following letter.  However, it is sometimes combined with a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}'', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'', and in that case the carrier behaves like an ordinary ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}'', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}''.

In academic work, the glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is transliterated with the [[ʾ|right half ring]] sign ('''&lt;big&gt;{{transl|sem|ʾ}}&lt;/big&gt;'''), while the [[ʿ|left half ring sign]] ('''&lt;big&gt;{{transl|sem|ʿ}}&lt;/big&gt;''') represents a different letter, with a different pronunciation, called [[Ayin|''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿayin}}'']].

====Ligatures====
[[Unicode]] primary range for basic Arabic language alphabet is the U+06xx range. Other ranges are for compatibility to older standards and do contain some ligatures. The only compulsory [[Typographical ligature|ligature]] for fonts and text processing in the basic Arabic language alphabet range U+06xx are ones for ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'' + ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}''. All other ligatures (''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'' + ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mīm}}'', etc.) are optional. Example to illustrate it is below. The exact outcome may depend on your browser and font configuration.
* (initial or isolated) ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'' + ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'' (''{{transl|ar|DIN|lā}}'' {{IPA|/laː/}}):
:: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|لا}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Note: [[Unicode]] also has in its Presentation Form B FExx range a code for this ligature. If your browser and font are configured right for Arabic, the ligature displayed above should be identical to this one, U+FEFB ARABIC LIGATURE LAM WITH ALEF ISOLATED FORM:
:: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|ﻻ}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

* (final or medial) ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'' + ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'' (''{{transl|ar|DIN|lā}}'' {{IPA|/laː/}}):
:: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|ـلا}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Note: [[Unicode]] also has in its Presentation Form B U+FExx range a code for this ligature. If your browser and font are configured right for Arabic, the ligature displayed above should be identical to this one, U+FEFC ARABIC LIGATURE LAM WITH ALEF FINAL FORM:
:: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|ـﻼ}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Another interesting ligature in the [[Unicode]] Presentation Form A range U+FB50 to U+FDxx is the special code for glyph for the ligature ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh}}'' (“God”), U+FDF2 ARABIC LIGATURE ALLAH ISOLATED FORM:
:: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|ﷲ}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

This latter ligature code again is a work-around for the shortcomings of most text processors, which are incapable of displaying the correct [[harakat|vowel marks]] for the word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Allāh]]}}'' in [[Koran]]. Because Arabic script is used to write other texts rather than Koran only, rending ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'' + ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'' + ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hāʾ}}'' as the previous ligature is considered faulty:&lt;ref&gt;[[SIL International]]: [http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=ArabicFonts&amp;_sc=1 This simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic languages]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'', (geminated) ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'' (with implied short ''a'' vowel, reversed) ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hāʾ}}'' :
:: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|لله}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot; lang=&quot;ar&quot; style=&quot;font-family:mry_KacstQurn,'DejaVu Sans',Scheherazade; font-size:200%;line-height:180%&quot;&gt; لله &lt;/span&gt; &lt;small&gt;(if one of these fonts: ''mry_KacstQurn, DejaVu Sans'' or ''Scheherazade'' is installed, the latter would render without the gemination mark and superscript Alef)&lt;/small&gt;
* ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'', (geminated) ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'' (with implied short ''{{transl|ar|DIN|a}}'' vowel, reversed) ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hāʾ}}'' :
:: &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:180%;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|الله}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot; lang=&quot;ar&quot; style=&quot;font-family:mry_KacstQurn,'DejaVu Sans',Scheherazade; font-size:200%;line-height:180%&quot;&gt; الله &lt;/span&gt; &lt;small&gt;(if one of these fonts: ''mry_KacstQurn, DejaVu Sans'' or ''Scheherazade'' is installed, the latter would render without the gemination mark and superscript Alef)&lt;/small&gt;
* ''{{transl|ar|ʾalif}}'' + ''{{transl|ar|lām}}'' + (U+0651 ARABIC SHADDA) + (U+0670 ARABIC LETTER SUPERSCRIPT ALEF) + ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hāʾ}}'' :
:: &lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot; lang=&quot;ar&quot; style=&quot;font-family:mry_KacstQurn,Scheherazade; font-size:200%;line-height:200%&quot;&gt; اللّٰه &lt;/span&gt;

====Gemination====
{{further|[[Shadda]]}}
[[Image:00-Taschdid.svg|thumb|right|The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šaddah}}'' ([[shadda]]) sign indicates a doubled consonant.]]

[[Gemination]] is the doubling of a consonant. Instead of writing the letter twice, Arabic places a ''W''-shaped sign called ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šaddah}}'', or ''shadda'', above it. (The generic term for such [[diacritic]]al signs is ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[harakat|ḥarakāt]]}}''). When a shadda is used on a consonant which also takes a [[Harakat#Kasra|''{{transl|ar|DIN|kasrah}}'']] (a dash below the consonant indicating that it takes a short /i/ as its vowel), the kasra may be written between the consonant and the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šaddah}}'' rather than in its normal place.

Nunation (the Arabic term is {{lang|ar|تنوين}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|tanwīn}}'')  is the addition of a final ''{{transl|ar|DIN|-n}}'' to a [[noun]] or [[adjective]]. The vowel before it indicates [[grammatical case]]. In written Arabic nunation is indicated by doubling the vowel diacritic at the end of the word. There are three of these vowel diacritics, and the signs indicate, from left to right, the endings ''{{transl|ar|DIN|-un}}'' ([[nominative case]]), ''{{transl|ar|DIN|-in}}'' ([[genitive]]), and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|-an}}'' ([[accusative]]). The sign {{rtl-lang|ar|ـً}} is most commonly written in combination with {{rtl-lang|ar|ا}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|ـًا}}), {{rtl-lang|ar|ةً}} (''[[Ta' marbuta|{{transl|ar|DIN|tāʾ marbūṭah}}]]'' {{lang|ar|تاء مربوطة}}) or stand-alone {{rtl-lang|ar|ءً}} (''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}]]'' {{lang|ar|همزة}}). An ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'' should always be written unless the word ends in ''{{transl|ar|DIN|tāʾ marbūṭah}}'', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}'' or is a [[diptote]], even though the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|-un}}'', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|-an}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|DIN|-in}}'' is not written. Nunation is used only in literary Arabic; it is absent in everyday [[varieties of Arabic|spoken Arabic]], and many Arabic textbooks introduce even literary Arabic without these endings.

== Vowels ==
Users of Arabic usually write [[vowel length|long vowels]] but omit short ones, so readers must utilize their knowledge of the language in order to supply the missing vowels. However, in the education system and particularly in classes on Arabic grammar these vowels are used since they are crucial to the grammar. An Arabic sentence can have a completely different meaning by a subtle change of the vowels. This is why in an important text such as the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Qurʾān}}'' the vowels are mandated.

===Short vowels===
{{See|Arabic diacritics}}

Vowels are conveyed by diacritical marks placed above or below the letters. In the Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written. On the other hand, copies of the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Qurʾān}}'' cannot be endorsed by the religious institutes that review them unless the diacritics are included.  It is also generally preferred and customary that they be included whenever the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Qurʾān}}'' is cited in print.  Children's books, elementary-school texts, and Arabic-language grammars in general will include diacritics to some degree.  These are known as &quot;[[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]]&quot; texts.

Written Arabic cannot be considered truly complete{{By whom|date=November 2010}} without the notation of its short vowels, which are essential to it.  They convey information not coded in any other way. Like dotted letters, diacritical marks were a later addition to the original writing system.

Short vowels can be included in cases where readers could not easily resolve word ambiguity from context alone, or simply wherever their writing might be considered [[calligraphy|aesthetically pleasing]].

Short vowels may be written with [[diacritic]]s placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable, called ''harakat''. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; in Arabic, words like &quot;Ali&quot; or &quot;alif&quot;, for example, start with a consonant: ''{{transl|ar|ʿAliyy}}''&lt;!--not DIN 31635 transliteration--&gt;, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}''.

===Long vowels===
In the fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] Arabic text found in texts such as [[Koran]], a long ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ā}}'' following a consonant other than a ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}]]'' is written with a short ''{{transl|ar|DIN|a}}'' sign (''{{transl|ar|DIN|fatḥah}}'') on the consonant plus an ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'' after it; long ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ī}}'' is written as a sign for short ''{{transl|ar|DIN|i}}'' (''{{transl|ar|DIN|kasrah}}'') plus a {{transl|ar|DIN|''yāʾ''}} ; and long ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ū}}'' as a sign for short ''{{transl|ar|DIN|u}}'' (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḍammah}}'') plus a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}''. Briefly, ''{{transl|ar|ᵃa}}'' = ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ā}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ⁱy}}'' = ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ī}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ᵘw}}'' = ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ū}}''. Long ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ā}}'' following a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}'' may be represented by an ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif maddah}}'' or by a free ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}'' followed by an ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}''.

The table below shows vowels placed above or below a dotted circle replacing a primary consonant letter or a [[Shadda|''{{transl|ar|DIN|šaddah}}'']] sign. For clarity in the table, the primary letters on the left used to mark these long vowels are shown only in their isolated form. Please note that most consonants do connect to the left with ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'' written then with their medial or final form. Additionally, the letter ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'' in the last row may connect to the letter on its left, and then will use a medial or initial form. Use the table of primary letters to look at their actual glyph and joining types.

In unvocalized text (one in which the short vowels are not marked), the long vowels are represented by the vowel in question: ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'', ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif maqṣūrah}}'' (or ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yaʾ}}''), ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}''. Long vowels written in the middle of a word of unvocalized text are treated like consonants with a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' (see below) in a text that has full diacritics. Here also, the table shows long vowel letters only in isolated form for clarity.

Combinations {{rtl-lang|ar|وا}} and {{rtl-lang|ar|يا}} are always pronounced ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wā}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yā}}'' respectively, the exception is when {{rtl-lang|ar|وا}} is the verb ending, where {{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}} is silent, resulting in ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ū}}''.

===Vowel omission===
An Arabic [[syllable]] can be open (ending with a vowel) or closed (ending with a consonant):

* open: CV [consonant-vowel] (long or short vowel)
* closed: CVC (short vowel only)

In closed syllables, we can indicate that the closing consonant does not carry a vowel by marking it with a [[diacritic]] called ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' ( {{lang|ar|  ْ  }} ) to remove any ambiguity, especially when the text is not vocalized. A normal text is composed only of series of consonants; thus, the word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qalb}}'', &quot;heart&quot;, is written ''{{transl|ar|qlb}}''. The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' indicates where not to place a vowel: ''{{transl|ar|qlb}}'' could, in effect, be read ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qalab}}'' (meaning &quot;he turned around&quot;), but written with a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' over the ''{{transl|ar|l}}'' and the ''{{transl|ar|b}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|قلْبْ}}), it can only have the form ''{{transl|ar|qVlb}}''. This is one step down from full vocalization, where the vowel ''{{transl|ar|DIN|a}}'' would also be indicated by a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|fatḥah}}'': {{rtl-lang|ar|قَلْبْ}}.

The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Qurʾān]]}}'' is traditionally written in full vocalization. Outside of the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Qurʾān}}'', putting a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' above a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'' (representing {{IPA|/iː/}}), or above a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}'' (representing {{IPA|/uː/}}) is extremely rare, to the point that ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'' with ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' will be unambiguously read as the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/aj/}}, and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}'' with ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' will be read {{IPA|/aw/}}. For example, the letters ''{{transl|ar|m-w-s-y-q-ā}}'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|موسيقى}} with an ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif maqṣūrah}}'' at the end of the word)
will be read most naturally as the word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mūsīqā}}'' (&quot;music&quot;).  If one were to write a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' above the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}'', the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'' and the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'', one would get {{rtl-lang|ar|موْسيْقىْ}}, which would be read as  ''{{transl|ar|*mawsaykāy}}'' (note however that the final ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif maqṣūrah}}'', because it is an ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'', never takes a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'').  The word, entirely vocalized, would be written as {{rtl-lang|ar|مُوسِيقَى}}.  The Koranic spelling would have no ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' sign above the final ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif maqṣūrah}}'', but instead a miniature ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'' above the preceding ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qāf}}'' consonant, which is a valid [[Unicode]] character but most Arabic computer fonts cannot in fact display this miniature ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'' as of 2006.

No ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' is placed on word-final consonants, even if no vowel is pronounced, because fully vocalized texts are always written as if  the ''[[ʾIʿrab|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾIʿrāb}}]]'' vowels were in fact pronounced.  For example, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾAḥmad zawǧ šarrīr}}'', meaning “Ahmed is a wicked husband”, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if still pronounced with full ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾIʿrāb}}'', i.e. ''{{transl|ar|ʾAḥmadu zawǧun šarrirun}}'' with the complete [[desinence]]s.

The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' is also used for transliterating words into the Arabic script. The Persian word {{rtl-lang|fa|ماسک}} (''mâsk'', from the English word &quot;mask&quot;), for example, might be written with a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|sukūn}}'' above the {{rtl-lang|fa|ﺱ}}  to signify that there is no vowel sound between that letter and the {{rtl-lang|fa|ک}}.

==Additional letters==&lt;!--If any are missing, please add them.--&gt;

Additional modified letters, used in non-Arabic languages, or in Arabic for transliterating foreign words only, include:
&lt;!-- This would look nicer in tables. --&gt;

===Additions used in Arabic dialects===

*&lt;big&gt;{{unicode|[[چ]]}}&lt;/big&gt; — ''Tche'', used mostly in the Iraqi Arabic and rarely in the Maghrebi spelling for {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} sound.

*&lt;big&gt;{{unicode|ڜ}}&lt;/big&gt; — a Maghrebi letter for {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}}.

*&lt;big&gt;{{unicode|ڢ}}&lt;/big&gt; — a [[Pe_(letter)#Arabic_fa|Maghrebi]] variation of standard letter {{unicode|ف}}.

*[[File:Qaf Maghribi.svg|12px]] and &lt;big&gt;{{unicode|ف/ڧ}}&lt;/big&gt; — a [[ق#Arabic_qaf|Maghrebi]] variation of standard letter {{unicode|ق}} (as a rule, dotless in isolated and final positions and dotted in the initial and medial forms).

*&lt;big&gt;{{unicode|ڨ}}&lt;/big&gt; — a Maghrebi letter, sometimes used for {{IPA|[g]}}.

*&lt;big&gt;{{unicode|[[گ]]}}&lt;/big&gt; — the ''gāf'' letter used in the Iraqi Arabic for {{IPA|[g]}}.

===Sometimes used for writing foreign words===
*&lt;big&gt;[[ڤ]]&lt;/big&gt; - ''Ve'', sometimes used to represent the sound {{IPA|[v]}} when transliterating foreign words in Arabic. Also used in writing [[Varieties of Arabic|dialects]] with that sound.&lt;ref name=dialecttutorial&gt;[http://www1.ccls.columbia.edu/~cadim/ArabicDialectTutorialAMTA2006.pdf Arabic Dialect Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the letter &lt;big&gt;[[ف]]&lt;/big&gt; - ''{{transl|ar|fāʾ}}'' - is used to transliterate {{IPA|[v]}}. Also used as ''pa'' in the [[Jawi script]]. In [[Tunisia]] a character similar to ''ve'' in its initial and medial forms is sometimes used to represent the phoneme {{IPA|[ɡ]}}. In final and isolate form it has the form {{unicode|ڨ}}[[File:Tunisian-gaf.svg|11px]] which resembles the letter ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qāf}}'' whence it is derived. The sound {{IPA|[v]}} in Tunisia and some other regions of Maghreb is rendered using the Arabic letter ''{{transl|ar|fāʾ}}'' with three dots underneath &lt;big&gt;{{unicode|ڥ}}&lt;/big&gt;.
**Also used in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. &lt;!--If any, add more languages. --&gt;

*&lt;big&gt;[[پ]]&lt;/big&gt; - ''Pe'', used to represent the sound {{IPA|[p]}} in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]; sometimes used to represent the letter {{IPA|[p]}} when transliterating foreign words in Arabic, although Arabic nearly always substitutes {{IPA|[b]}} for {{IPA|[p]}} in the transliteration of foreign terms.  Normally the letter &lt;big&gt;[[ب]]&lt;/big&gt; - ''{{transl|ar|bāʾ}}'' - is used to transliterate {{IPA|[p]}}. So, &quot;[[7up]]&quot; can be transcribed as  &lt;big&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|سفن أب}}&lt;/big&gt; or {{Script/Arabic|سڤن أﭖ}}.
**Also used in [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. &lt;!--If any, add more languages. --&gt;

*&lt;big&gt;[[چ]]&lt;/big&gt; - ''Che'', used to represent {{IPAblink|tʃ}} (&quot;ch&quot;). It is used in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and sometimes used when transliterating foreign words in Arabic. In the Iraqi spoken dialect this is often used, especially when referring in the feminine, although it is rarely written.  Nevertheless, Arabic usually substitutes other letters in the transliteration of foreign terms: normally the combination &lt;big&gt;{{rtl-lang|ar|تش}}&lt;/big&gt; - ''{{transl|ar|DIN|tāʾ}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šīn}}'' - is used to transliterate the {{IPA|/tʃ/}} sound, as in &quot;[[Chad]]&quot;. In Egypt &lt;big&gt;چ&lt;/big&gt; is used for {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (or {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, which is approximated to {{IPA|[ʒ]}}).
**''Ca'' in the [[Jawi script]].&lt;!--If any, add more languages. --&gt;

*&lt;big&gt;[[گ]]&lt;/big&gt; - ''{{transl|ar|Gāf}}'', used to represent the {{IPA|[ɡ]}} sound (as in &quot;get&quot;). Normally used in [[Persian alphabet|Persian]], [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish]], and Urdu. Often foreign words with {{IPA|[ɡ]}} are transliterated in Arabic with &lt;big&gt;[[ك]]&lt;/big&gt; (''{{transl|ar|DIN|kāf}}''), &lt;big&gt;[[غ]]&lt;/big&gt; (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ġayn}}'') or &lt;big&gt;[[ج]]&lt;/big&gt; (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ǧīm}}''), which may or may not change the original sound. In Egypt &lt;big&gt;ج&lt;/big&gt; is normally pronounced {{IPA|[ɡ]}}.
**Also used in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], and [[Bedouin]] dialects.&lt;ref name=dialecttutorial/&gt; &lt;!--If any, add more languages. --&gt;

*&lt;big&gt;[[ژ]]&lt;/big&gt; - ''{{transl|ar|Že/zhe}}'', used to represent the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPAblink|ʒ}} in, [[Persian Language|Persian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]. This is used to transliterate words of foreign origin, mostly French, in [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]] and [[Maghrebi Arabic]] dialects. In Egypt &lt;big&gt;[[چ]]&lt;/big&gt; is used for {{IPAblink|ʒ}} (or {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, which is approximated to {{IPAblink|ʒ}}). In the Leavant and northwest  Africa (except Algeria), &lt;big&gt;[[ج]]&lt;/big&gt; is normally pronounced {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, so it is used to transcribe that sound. &lt;big&gt;[[ش]]&lt;/big&gt; might be used instead as well.
**Also used in [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. &lt;!--If any, add more languages. --&gt;

*In addition, when transliterating [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Italian language|Italian]], Arabic language speakers write out most or all the vowels as long (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ā}}'' with ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif}}'', ''ē''&lt;!--not DIN 31635 standard--&gt; and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ī}}'' with ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yaʾ}}'', and ''ō''&lt;!--not DIN 31635 standard--&gt; and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ū}}'' with ''{{transl|ar|DIN|wāw}}''), meaning it approaches a true alphabet.

===Used in languages other than Arabic===

==  Numerals  ==
{{Main|Arabic numerals}}

There are two kinds of numerals used in Arabic writing; standard numerals{{Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=explain or wikilink &quot;standard numeral&quot;: what are they? The same as the western numerals 1,2,3, and so forth?}} (predominant in the [[Arab World]]), and [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] (used in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]).  In Arabic, the former are referred to as &quot;Indian numbers&quot; (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾarqām hindiyyah}}'', {{rtl-lang|ar|أرقام هندية}}).  Arabic (or Hindu-Arabic) numerals are also used in Europe and the rest of the [[Western World]] in a third variant, the Western Arabic numerals, even though the Arabic alphabet is not. In most of present-day North Africa, the usual western numerals are used; in medieval times, a slightly different set was used, from which Western Arabic numerals derive, via Italy. Like Arabic alphabetic characters, Arabic numerals are written from right to left, though the units are always right-most, and the highest value left-most, just as with Western &quot;Arabic numerals&quot;. Telephone numbers are read from left to right.

In addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers ([[Abjad numerals]]). This usage is based on the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|abǧadī}}'' of the alphabet. {{rtl-lang|ar|أ}} ''{{transl|ar|ʾalif}}'' is 1, {{lang|ar|ب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bāʾ}}'' is 2, {{lang|ar|ج}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ǧīm}}'' is 3, and so on until {{lang|ar|ي}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yāʾ}}'' = 10, {{lang|ar|ك}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kāf}}'' = 20, {{lang|ar|ل}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|lām}}'' = 30, …, {{lang|ar|ر}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|rāʾ}}'' = 200, …, {{lang|ar|غ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ġayn}}'' = 1000.  This is sometimes used to produce [[chronogram]]s.

{{Main|History of the Arabic alphabet}}
[[Image:Arabic script evolution.svg|thumb|250px|Evolution of early Arabic calligraphy (9th - 11th century). The ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[w:Basmala|Basmalah]]}}'' was taken as an example, from [[kufic]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Qurʾān]]}}'' manuscripts.

Later, a second black dots system was used to differentiate between letters like ''{{transl|ar|DIN|fāʾ}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qāf}};&lt;ref name=&quot;wikimedia1&quot;&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Kufi.jpg File:Kufi.jpg – Wikimedia Commons]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wikimedia1&quot;/&gt;  (4) 11th century, In [[Khalil ibn Ahmad|Al Farāhídi]]'s system (system we know today) dots were changed into shapes resembling the letters to transcribe the corresponding long vowels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Qur'an_folio_11th_century_kufic.jpg File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the [[Nabataean alphabet]] used to write the [[Nabataean]] dialect of [[Aramaic]]. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late fourth-century inscription from ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Jabal Ramm|Ǧabal Ramm]]}}'' (50&amp;nbsp;km east of ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Aqaba|ʿAqabah]]}}''), but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at [[Zebed]] in [[Syria]] from 512.  However, the [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them.  (The Aramaic language had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so that in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds; cf. the similarly ambiguous [[Book Pahlavi|Pahlavi]] alphabet.)  The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic [[papyrus]] ([[PERF 558]]), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts like the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Qurʾān]]}}'' were and still are frequently memorized, especially in [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Qur'an memorization]], a practice which probably arose partially from a desire to avoid the great ambiguity of the script.

Later still, vowel marks and the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|hamzah}}'' were introduced, beginning some time in the latter half of the seventh century, preceding the first invention of [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and [[Tiberian vocalization|Hebrew vocalization]].  Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned by an [[Umayyad]] governor of [[Iraq]], ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|Ḥaǧǧaǧ ibn Yūsuf]]}}'': a dot above = ''{{transl|ar|DIN|a}}'', a dot below = ''{{transl|ar|DIN|i}}'', a dot on the line = ''{{transl|ar|DIN|u}}'', and doubled dots indicated [[nunation]].  However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted.  The system was finalized around 786 by ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[al-Farahidi|al-Farāhīdī]]}}''.

=== Arabic printing presses ===
Although [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] generally is given the credit with introducing the printing press to [[Egypt]], upon invading it in 1798, and he did indeed bring printing presses and [[Arabic script]] presses, to print the French occupation's official newspaper ''Al-Tanbiyyah'' (''The Courier''), the process was started several centuries earlier.

[[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s invention of the printing press in 1450 was followed up by Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, who in 1514 published an entire prayer book  in Arabic script entitled ''Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i'' intended for the eastern Christian communities. The script was said to be crude and almost unreadable.

Famed type designer [[Robert Granjon]] working for Cardinal [[Ferdinando de Medici]] succeeded in designing elegant Arabic typefaces and the Medici press published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late sixteenth century.

The first Arabic books published using movable type in the Middle East were by the [[Maronite]] monks at the ''Maar Quzhayy'' Monastery in [[Mount Lebanon]]. They transliterated the Arabic language using [[Syriac]] script. It took a fellow goldsmith like Gutenberg to design and implement the first true Arabic script movable type printing press in the Middle East. The [[Greek Orthodox]] monk ''[[Abd Allah Zakhir]]'' set up an [[Arabic language]] [[printing press]] using [[movable type]] at the monastery of Saint John at the town of ''[[Dhour El Shuwayr]]'' in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using true Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did the founding of the elegant typeface. He created the first true Arabic script type in the Middle East. The first book off the press was in 1734; this press continued to be used until 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198102/arabic.and.the.art.of.printing-a.special.section.htm Arabic and the Art of Printing – A Special Section], by Paul Lunde&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic script has been adopted for use in a wide variety of languages besides Arabic, including [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and [[Urdu language|Urdu]], which are not [[Semitic]]. Such adaptations may feature altered or new characters to represent [[phoneme]]s that do not appear in Arabic [[phonology]]. For example, the Arabic language lacks a [[voiceless bilabial plosive]] (the {{IPA|[p]}} sound), so many languages add their own letter to represent {{IPA|[p]}} in the script, though the specific letter used varies from language to language.  These modifications tend to fall into groups: all the [[India]]n and [[Turkic languages]] written in Arabic script tend to use the [[Persian alphabet|Persian modified letters]], whereas [[languages of Indonesia|Indonesian language]]s tend to imitate those of [[Jawi (script)|Jawi]]. The modified version of the Arabic script originally devised for use with Persian is known as the [[Perso-Arabic script]] by scholars.

In the case of [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], vowels are mandatory, making the script an abugida rather than an abjad as it is for most languages.  [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], also, write all vowels.

Use of the Arabic script in [[West Africa]]n languages, especially in the [[Sahel]], developed with the penetration of [[Islam]]. To a certain degree the style and usage tends to follow those of the [[Maghreb]] (for instance the position of the dots in the letters ''[[Pe (letter)|{{transl|ar|DIN|fāʾ}}]]'' and ''[[Qoph|{{transl|ar|DIN|qāf}}]]''). Additional diacritics have come into use to facilitate writing of sounds not represented in the Arabic language. The term [[Ajami script|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿAǧamī}}]], which comes from the Arabic root for &quot;foreign&quot;, has been applied to Arabic-based orthographies of African languages.

=== Languages currently written with the Arabic alphabet ===
Today Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, India, Israel and China are the main non-Arab states using the Arabic alphabet to write one or more official national languages, including [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] (sorani dialect/southern [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].

The Arabic alphabet is currently used for the following:

* [[Malay language|Malay]] in the Arabic script known as [[Jawi (script)|Jawi]] is co-official in [[Brunei]], and used for religious purposes in [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Southern Thailand]], [[Singapore]], and predominantly Muslim areas of the [[Philippines]]. Therefore, Arabic script or Jawi can be seen or used for the sign board or market or shop board. Particularly in Brunei, Jawi is practically used in terms of writing or reading for Islamic Religious Educational Program which is like Primary school, Secondary School, College even higher educational institute such as University. In addition, some television programs is associated with Jawi for announcement, advertisement, news, social programs, obviously religious program and etc.
* Early history of Islamic belief and culture is experienced by [[Brunei]] from the influence of Arabian merchants. Through the Arabian reached Brunei, some culture of Brunei is mixed with Arab even today some language is derived from Arab words. According to history, during the 14th century the founder of Brunei Sultanate is Sultan [[Muhammad Shah]] (1363 to 1402, formerly Awang Alak Betatar) who converted to Islam through the relational marriage with Tumasek (now [[Singapore]]) princess (now [[Johor]] in which at that time already received the teaches of Islamic faith). However, the influence of Islam is not strong enough at that time in Brunei.
* During 15th century one of Arab merchant named [[Sharif Ali]], who believed was the direct-descendant of [[Muhammad]], his grandchild, was Saidina Hassan r.a who married [[Sultan Ahmad]]'s daughter, Puteri Ratna Kesuma.

=== Languages formerly written with the Arabic alphabet ===
[[File:Arabisch-Afrikaans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pamphlet in [[Arabic Afrikaans]], 1872]]

Speakers of languages that were previously unwritten used Arabic script as a basis to design writing systems for their mother languages. This choice could be influenced by Arabic being their second language, the language of scripture of their faith, or the only written language they came in contact with. Additionally, since most education was once religious, choice of script was determined by the writer's religion; which meant that Muslims would use Arabic script to write whatever language they spoke. This led to Arabic script being the most widely used script during the Middle Ages.

In the 20th century, the Arabic script was generally replaced by the [[Latin alphabet]] in the [[Balkans]], parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Asia]],
while in the [[Soviet Union]], after a brief period of [[Latinisation (USSR)|Latinisation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/52_folder/52_articles/52_alphabet.html Alphabet Transitions - The Latin Script: A New Chronology - Symbol of a New Azerbaijan], by Tamam Bayatly&lt;/ref&gt; use of the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] was mandated. [[Turkey]] changed to the Latin alphabet in 1928 as part of an internal Westernizing revolution. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of the Turkic languages of the ex-USSR attempted to follow Turkey's lead and convert to a Turkish-style Latin alphabet. However, renewed use of the Arabic alphabet has occurred to a limited extent in [[Tajikistan]], whose language's close resemblance to [[Persian language|Persian]] allows direct use of publications from Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimera.org/files/camel/en/27e/MICA27E-Siddikzoda.pdf Tajik Language: Farsi or Not Farsi?] by Sukhail Siddikzoda, reporter, Tajikistan.&lt;/ref&gt;

* All the Muslim peoples of the [[USSR]] between 1918-1928 (many also earlier), including [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]] etc.  After 1928 their script became Latin, then later Cyrillic.

====Southeast Asia====
* [[Malay language|Malay]] in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]
* [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] in Indonesia
* [[Banjar language|Banjar]] in Indonesia
* [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] in Indonesia, used only in Islamic schools and institutions
* [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanaon]] in the [[Philippines]]
* [[Tausug language|Tausug]] in the [[Philippines]]

====Middle East====
* [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in Arabic script until [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] declared the change to [[Roman script]] in 1928. This form of Turkish is now known as [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and is held by many to be a different language, due to its much higher percentage of Persian and Arabic [[loanword]]s ([[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]]);
* [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] (Kurmanji dialect) in Turkey and Syria was written in Arabic script until 1932, when a modified [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish Latin alphabet]] was introduced by [[Jaladat Ali Badirkhan]] in Syria.

== Computers and the Arabic alphabet ==

The Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several [[character set]]s, including [[ISO-8859-6]], [[Windows-1256]] and [[Unicode]] (see links in Infobox, above), in the latter thanks to the &quot;Arabic segment&quot;, entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, neither of these sets indicate the form each character should take in context. It is left to the [[rendering engine]] to select the proper [[glyph]] to display for each character.

For compatibility with previous standards, initial, medial, final and isolated forms can be encoded separately in [[Unicode]]; however, they can also be inferred from their joining context, using the same encoding. The following table shows this common encoding, in addition to the compatibility encodings for their normally contextual forms (Arabic texts should be encoded today using only the common encoding, but the rendering must then infer the joining types to determine the correct glyph forms, with or without ligation).

===Unicode===
{{Main|Arabic Unicode}}
As of Unicode 6.0, the following ranges encode Arabic characters:
*[[Template:Unicode chart Arabic|Arabic]] (0600-06FF)
*[[Template:Unicode chart Arabic Supplement|Arabic Supplement]] (0750-077F)
*[[Template:Unicode chart Arabic Presentation Forms-A|Arabic Presentation Forms-A]] (FB50-FDFF)
*[[Template:Unicode chart Arabic Presentation Forms-B|Arabic Presentation Forms-B]] (FE70-FEFF)

The basic Arabic range encodes the standard letters and diacritics, but does not encode contextual forms (U+0621-U+0652 being directly based on [[ISO 8859-6]]); and also includes the most common diacritics and [[Arabic-Indic digits]]. U+06D6 to U+06ED encode Qur'anic annotation signs such as &quot;end of ''[[ayah]]''&quot; {{unicode|۝&amp;#x6d6;}} and &quot;start of ''[[Rub El Hizb|rub el hizb]]''&quot;  {{unicode|۞}}. The Arabic Supplement range encodes letter variants mostly used for writing African (non-Arabic) languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-A range encodes contextual forms and ligatures of letter variants needed for Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Central Asian languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-B range encodes spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and more contextual letter forms.

===Keyboards===

[[File:Intellark4qwerty.png|thumb|450px|[[Intellark]] imposed on a QWERTY keyboard layout.]]

Keyboards designed for different nations have different layouts so that proficiency in one style of keyboard such as Iraq's does not transfer to proficiency in another keyboard such as Saudi Arabia's.   Differences can include the location of non-alphabetic characters such as '&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ArabicAZERTY.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Arabic/AZERTY keyboard &lt;' as well as the location of vowel marks and possibly others.
in [[Morocco]]{{puic|Image:ArabicAZERTY.jpg|log=2008 February 24}}]] --&gt;

All Arabic keyboards allow typing Roman characters, e.g., for the URL in a [[web browser]]. Thus, each Arabic keyboard has both Arabic and Roman characters marked on the keys. Usually the Roman characters of an Arabic keyboard conform to the [[QWERTY]] layout, but in [[North Africa]], where [[French language|French]] is the most common language typed using the Roman characters, the Arabic keyboards are [[AZERTY]].

To maximize [[knowledge transfer]], the Arabic letter keyboard layout [[Intellark]] is designed to allow [[QWERTY]], [[AZERTY]] or any Latin-derived keyboard layout users to retain and reuse their knowledge of key locations. In [[Intellark]], a relationship is established between Latin-based and Arabic-based characters based on phonetic sound. For example, typing the English element in the pairs (a, ا), (s, س), (d, د), (f, ف), or (w, و) produces the Arabic one. Next, further relationships are drawn among the Arabic characters themselves, where double pressing the element on the right in each pair in (و، ؤ) ,(د، ذ) ,(س، ش) ,(ا، أ) produces a dependent character as based on shape, phonetic sound, or both, and so on.

When one wants to encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired. The range ''Arabic presentation forms A'' (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) contain ligatures while the range ''Arabic presentation forms B'' (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contains the positional variants. These effects are better achieved in Unicode  by using the ''[[zero-width joiner]]'' and ''[[zero-width non-joiner|non-joiner]]'', as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.

Finally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in ''logical order'', that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's [[bi-directional text]] features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it is an indication that the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out-of-date.&lt;ref&gt;For more information about encoding Arabic, consult the Unicode manual available at [http://www.unicode.org/ The Unicode website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/Multilingual_Computing_with_Arabic_and_Arabic_Transliteration.pdf MULTILINGUAL COMPUTING WITH ARABIC AND ARABIC TRANSLITERATION Arabicizing Windows Applications to Read and Write Arabic &amp; Solutions for the Transliteration Quagmire Faced by Arabic-Script Languages] and [http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/multilingual_computing_arabic.ppt A PowerPoint Tutorial (with screen shots and an English voice-over) on how to add Arabic to the Windows Operating System].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are competing online tools, e.g. [http://www.yamli.com/editor/ Yamli editor], allowing to enter Arabic letters without having Arabic support installed on a PC and without the knowledge of the layout of the Arabic keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yamli.com/press/ Yamli in the News]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handwriting recognition===
The first software program of its kind in the world that identifies Arabic handwriting in real time has been developed by researchers at [[Ben-Gurion University]].

The prototype enables the user to write Arabic words by hand on an electronic screen, which then analyzes the text and translates it into printed Arabic letters in a thousandth of a second. The error rate is less than three percent, according to Dr. Jihad El-Sana, from BGU's department of computer sciences, who developed the system along with master's degree student Fadi Biadsy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel21c.org/bin/en.jsp?enDispWho=Articles%5El1650&amp;enPage=BlankPage&amp;enDisplay=view&amp;enDispWhat=object&amp;enVersion=0&amp;enZone=Technology&amp; Israel 21c]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:angel letiel.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ángel arcabucero]], 17th century Peru (?)]]
'''[[Angel]]s''' have appeared in works of [[art]] for millennia.
Angel-shaped beings appear in ancient [[Mesopotamian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] art and were probably the inspiration for the popular [[Christianity|Christian]] image of angels.

Angels remained a popular subject for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Europe]]an paintings and sculpture.  Angels have also become an integral part of [[Anime]] culture, particularly in [[fan art]] and [[webcomic]]s.

==In Christian art==
[[Image:Erzengel Michael und Gabriel.jpg|thumb|12th century [[icon]] of the Archangels [[Michael (angel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] wearing the ''loros'' of the Imperial guards.]]
The earliest known Christian image of an angel, in the ''Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione'' in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], which is dated to the middle of the third century, is without wings. Representations of angels on [[sarcophagi]] and on objects such as lamps and [[reliquaries]] of that period also show them without wings,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 81-89; cf. review in [[La Civiltà Cattolica]], 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt; as for example the angel in the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' scene in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]].

The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the Prince's Sarcophagus, discovered at Sarigüzel, near [[Istanbul]], in the 1930s, and attributed to the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In this same period, Saint [[John Chrysostom]] explained the significance of angels' wings: &quot;They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on, though of course with some exceptions, Christian art represented angels with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Basilica of Saint Mary Major]] (432-440).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 90-95; cf. review in [[La Civiltà Cattolica]], 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multi-winged angels, often with only their face and wings showing, drawn from the higher grades of angels, especially [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]], are derived from Persian art, and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the [[pendentive]]s of [[dome]]s or [[semi-dome]]s of churches.

Angels, especially the Archangel Michael, who were depicted as military-style agents of God, came to be shown wearing [[Late Antique]] military uniform.  This could be either the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, armour breastplate and [[pteruges]], but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], with a long tunic and the ''loros'', a long gold and jewelled  [[pallium]] restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards.  The basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the [[Baroque]] period and beyond in the West (see Reni picture above), and up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s.  Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes, and in the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a [[deacon]], a [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]], especially [[Gabriel]] in [[Annunciation]] scenes - for example the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation in Washington]] by [[Jan van Eyck]].

A few noteworthy examples are:
* ''The [[Ecstasy of St Theresa]]'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]
* ''[[:Category:Annunciations|Annunciations]] by many artists.
* ''The [[Sopo Archangels]]''
*[[Ángel arcabucero]], Latin American angels with guns

The '''Arctic Fox.''' (''Vulpes lagopus'' &lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;, formerly known as ''Alopex lagopus''), also known as the '''White Fox''', '''Polar Fox''' or '''Snow Fox''', is a small [[fox]] native to  [[Arctic]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and is common throughout the [[Tundra#Arctic tundra|Arctic tundra]] [[biome]]. The Greek word ''alopex'', (''ἀλώπηξ'') means a fox and ''Vulpes'' is the [[Latin]] version. ''Lagopus'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ''lago'' (''λαγως''), meaning &quot;[[hare]]&quot;, + ''pous'' (''πους''), &quot;foot&quot; and refers to the hair on its feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/713_Alopex_lagopus.pdf Alopex lagopus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/714_Vulpes_zerda.pdf Vulpes zerda]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has previously been assigned to its own [[genus]] ''Alopex'', [[Genetics|genetic]] evidence places it in ''[[Vulpes]]'' ([[Mammal Species of the World]]) with the majority of the other foxes.&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt;&lt;ref name=complete&gt;{{cite journal|title=Building large trees by combining phylogenetic information: a complete phylogeny of the extant Carnivora (Mammalia)|journal=Biol.

==Adaptations==
[[File:Alopex lagopus IMG 9019.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Vulpes lagopus]]'' (arctic fox) sleeping with its tail wrapped as a blanket.]]
The Arctic Fox lives in some of the most frigid extremes on the planet. Among its [[adaptation]]s for cold survival are its deep, thick fur,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/actionplans/canids.pdf Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals and Dogs]&lt;/ref&gt; a system of [[Countercurrent exchange|countercurrent heat exchange]] in the circulation of paws to retain [[wiktionary:core temperature|core temperature]], and a good supply of [[Adipose tissue|body fat]]. The fox has a low [[surface area to volume ratio]], as evidenced by its generally rounded body shape, short muzzle and legs, and short, thick ears. Since less of its surface area is exposed to the Arctic cold, less heat escapes the body. Its furry paws allow it to walk on ice in search of food. The Arctic Fox has such keen hearing that it can precisely locate the position of prey under the snow. When it finds prey, it pounces and punches through the snow to catch its victim. Its fur changes colour with the seasons: in the winter it is white to blend in with snow, while  in the summer months it changes to brown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/snp/Animals/arctic_fox.htm Arctic Fox Alopex lagopus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
The Arctic Fox tends to be active from early September to early May. The [[gestation period]] is 53 days. Litters tend to average 5-8 pups but may be as many as 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Both the mother and the father help to raise their young. The females leave the family and form their own groups and the males stay with the family.

Foxes tend to form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs in the breeding season. Litters are born in the early summer and the parents raise the young in a large den. Dens can be complex underground networks, housing many generations of foxes. Young from a previous year's litter may stay with the parents to help rear younger siblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;&gt;Dewey, T. and C. Middlebrook. 2007. &quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot; (On-line). Accessed May 16, 2009 at [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Vulpes_lagopus.html Animal Diversity Web]&lt;/ref&gt; The kits are initially brownish; as they become older they turn white.

==Diet==
The Arctic Fox will generally eat any small animal it can find: lemmings, hares, owls, [[Egg (food)|egg]]s, and [[carrion]], etc. Lemmings are the most common prey. A family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day. During April and May the Arctic Fox also preys on [[Ringed Seal]] pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are relatively helpless. Fish beneath the ice are also part of its diet. If there is an overabundance of food hunted, the Arctic Fox will bury what the family cannot eat. When its normal prey is scarce, the Arctic Fox scavenges the leftovers and even [[feces]] of larger predators, such as the [[polar bear]], even though the bear's prey includes the Arctic Fox itself.

==Size==
The average length is {{convert|85.3|cm|abbr=on}}, with a range of {{convert|83|to|110|cm|abbr=on}}, in the male and {{convert|82.1|cm|abbr=on}}, with a range of {{convert|71.3|to|85|cm|abbr=on}}, in the female.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;/&gt; The tail is {{convert|31|cm|abbr=on|1}} long in the male and {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on|1}} long in the female. It is {{convert|25|-|30|cm|abbr=on|1}} high at the shoulder.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} On average males weigh {{convert|3.5|kg|abbr=on}}, with a range of {{convert|3.2|to|9.4|kg|abbr=on}}, while females average {{convert|2.9|kg|abbr=on}}, with a range of {{convert|1.4|to|3.2|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;&quot;Alopex lagopus&quot; at the [http://www.mnh.si.edu/mna/image_info.cfm?species_id=2 Smithsonian]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subspecies==
Besides the nominate, ''Vulpes lagopus lagopus'', there are four [[subspecies]] of this fox:
*[[Bering_Sea#Islands|Bering]] Islands Arctic Fox, ''Vulpes lagopus beringensis''
*[[Iceland]] Arctic Fox, ''Vulpes lagopus fuliginosus''
*[[Pribilof Islands]] Arctic Fox, ''Vulpes lagopus pribilofensis''
*[[Greenland]] Arctic Fox, ''Vulpes lagopus foragorapusis''

==Population and distribution==
[[File:Lagopusskull.jpg|thumb|left|Arctic fox skull]]
The Arctic Fox has a circumpolar range, meaning that it is found throughout the entire Arctic, including the outer edges of [[Greenland]], [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Alaska]], and [[Svalbard]], as well as in [[Subarctic]] and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas, such as [[Iceland]] and mainland alpine [[Scandinavia]]. The conservation status of the species is good, except for the Scandinavian mainland population. It is acutely endangered there, despite decades of legal protection from hunting and persecution. The total population estimate in all of [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] is a mere 120 adult individuals.

The Arctic Fox is the only native land mammal to Iceland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iceland&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.is/pages/alife/biglf.html|title=Wildlife|year=2000|work=Iceland Worldwide|publisher=iww.is|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came to the isolated [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] island at the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], walking over the frozen sea. The [[The Arctic Fox Center|Arctic Fox Center]] in [[Súðavík]] contains an exhibition on the Arctic Fox and conducts studies on the influence of tourism on the population &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcticfoxcenter.com/|title=The Arctic Fox Center|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The abundance of the Arctic Fox species tends to fluctuate in a cycle along with the population of lemmings. Because the fox reproduces very quickly and often dies young, population levels are not seriously impacted by [[Animal trapping|trapping]]. The Arctic Fox has, nonetheless, been eradicated from many areas where humans are settled.

The pelts of Arctic foxes with a slate blue coloration - an expression of a [[recessive gene]] -  were especially valuable. They were transported to various previously fox-free  [[Aleutian Island]]s during the 1920s.  The program was successful in terms of increasing the population of blue foxes, but their predation of [[Aleutian Cackling Goose|Aleutian Canadian geese]] conflicted with  the goal of preserving that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sbYL7JNnMNIC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=arctic+fox+blue+phase&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s0IKTc_LMcOOnwfV5YH-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=arctic%20fox%20blue%20phase&amp;f=false|page=42|title=Ecology of North America|author=Eric G. Bolen|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=1998|ISBN=9780471131564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic Fox is losing ground to the larger [[Red Fox]]. Historically, the [[Gray Wolf]] has kept Red Fox numbers down, but as the wolf has been hunted to near [[extinction]] in much of its former range, the Red Fox population has grown larger, and it has taken over the niche of [[Apex predator|top predator]]. In areas of northern [[Europe]] there are programs in place that allow hunting of the Red Fox in the Arctic Fox's previous range.

As with many other game species, the best sources of historical and large scale population data are hunting bag records and questionnaires. There are several potential sources of error in such data collections.&lt;ref name=G_and_E&gt;{{cite book | author = Garrott and Eberhardt | year = 1987 | chapter = Arctic fox | editor = Novak, M. et al. (eds.) | title = Wild furbearer management and conservation in North America | pages = 395–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, numbers vary widely between years due to the large population fluctuations. However, the total population of the Arctic Fox must be in the order of several hundred thousand animals.&lt;ref name=Tannerfeldt&gt;{{cite book | author = Tannerfeldt, M. | year = 1997 | title = Population fluctuations and life history consequences in the Arctic fox. | publisher = Dissertation, Stockholm University | location = Stockholm, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world population is thus not endangered, but two Arctic Fox subpopulations are. One is on [[Medny Island]] ([[Commander Islands]], Russia), which was reduced by some 85-90%, to around 90 animals, as a result of [[mange]] caused by an ear tick introduced by dogs in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Goltsman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goltsman et al. | year = 1996 | last2 = Kruchenkova | first2 = E. P. | last3 = MacDonald | first3 = D. W. | title = The Mednyi Arctic foxes: treating a population imperilled by disease | journal = Oryx | volume = 30 | pages = 251–258 | doi = 10.1017/S0030605300021748}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population is currently under treatment with antiparasitic drugs, but the result is still uncertain.

The other threatened population is the one in [[Fennoscandia]] (Norway, Sweden, Finland and [[Kola Peninsula]]). This population decreased drastically around the start of the 20th century as a result of extreme fur prices which caused severe hunting also during population lows.&lt;ref name=Lönnberg&gt;{{cite book | author = Lönnberg, E. | year = 1927 | title = Fjällrävsstammen i Sverige 1926 | publisher = Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | location = Uppsala, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population has remained at a low density for more than 90 years, with additional reductions during the last decade.&lt;ref name=Angerbjörn&gt;{{cite journal | author = Angerbjörn, A. et al. | year = 1995 | title = Dynamics of the Arctic fox population in Sweden | journal = Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume = 32 | pages = 55–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total population estimate for 1997 is around 60 adults in Sweden, 11 adults in Finland and 50 in Norway. From Kola, there are indications of a similar situation, suggesting a population of around 20 adults. The Fennoscandian population thus numbers a total of 140 breeding adults. Even after local lemming peaks, the Arctic Fox population tends to collapse back to levels dangerously close to non-viability.&lt;ref name=Tannerfeldt/&gt;

{{US culture}}
The '''folklore of the United States''', or '''American folklore''', is one of the folk traditions which has evolved on the [[North America]]n continent since [[Europe]]ans arrived in the 16th century. While it contains much in the way of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tradition, it should not be confused with the tribal beliefs of any community of native people. American folklore covers the same broad categories as the folklore of other nations. It encompasses myths, jokes, riddles, legends, cautionary tales, and many other forms of storytelling.

== Founding myths ==
The founding of the [[United States]] is often surrounded by legends and tall tales. Many stories have developed since the founding long ago to become a part of America's folklore and cultural awareness, and non-native American folklore especially includes any narrative which has contributed to the shaping of [[American values]] and belief systems. These narratives may be true and may be false; the veracity of the stories is not a determining factor. Three so-called &quot;[[founding myth]]s&quot; (or [[national myth]]s) include: Christopher Columbus, the Pilgrims, and George Washington.

=== Christopher Columbus ===
Though [[Christopher Columbus]] did not participate in the founding of the American government, he has been interpreted as a &quot;founder&quot; of the American nation, in that it is descended from the [[Europe]]an immigrants who would not have moved to the New World if Columbus had not found where it was. Indeed, one particularly pervasive story is that Columbus discovered America, as it is far easier to elevate a man to heroic status than to reflect the reality among complex series of waves of immigrants from multiple conditions and walks of life. 

According to some stories, Columbus began his journey across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on Friday, August 3, 1492, in order to prove that the world was round, because he expected to reach the Far East by sailing west. In fact, it was generally accepted by Columbus' time that the world was round. What set Columbus apart was that he believed the world to be considerably smaller than most thought, small enough that a ship sailing west to the Far East could carry enough supplies for the journey.

By this legend Columbus' mission is then rendered entirely noble, intellectual and rational. He helped dispel the inaccurate beliefs of his time, and, so, it is concluded, the nation he founded must be a nation of intellect and logic. [[Washington Irving]] is the first citation for this belief. The late 20th century, however, saw a decrease in the prestige of Columbus' legend as skepticism about Europeans' activities in the New World and elsewhere has become more prevalent.

=== Pilgrims ===
The Pilgrim ship the [[Mayflower]] landed at [[Plymouth Rock]] in 1620 and the [[Plymouth Colony]] was established. The holiday of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] is said to have begun with the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] in 1621. They had come to America to escape religious persecution, but then nearly starved to death due to the unfamiliar land. Some friendly [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (including [[Squanto]]) helped the Pilgrims survive through the first winter. The perseverance of the Pilgrims is celebrated during the annual Thanksgiving festival. As a legend, this story relates to the founding of the culture. The Pilgrims' dedication to their cause in spite of the hardships renders the foundation of the country, and therefore the country itself, seem stronger and more resilient. It is also a fertility festival, similar in some ways to other harvest-time celebrations in other cultures, celebrating the nourishment that comes from the earth. Although there were earlier colonies, Plymouth is one of the most famous and only the second [[England|English]] colony to be successful, after [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in Virginia, which was settled more than 10 years earlier, in 1607.

===Puritans===
In 1630, aboard the ship [[Arbella]], [[Puritan]] preacher [[John Winthrop]] delivered his famous sermon ''[[Shining city on a hill|Shining city upon a hill]]''. The ship landed in 1630 and the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was established at what is now [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Winthrop's sermon gave rise to the common belief in American folklore that the [[United States of America]] has a special status in the world as ''God's Country''. This belief is called by historians [[American exceptionalism]].

=== George Washington ===
[[George Washington]], the country's first president, is often said to be the founder of the United States. Since his death, Washington has been &quot;mythologized&quot;, with many anecdotes and stories about his life told, in general, to present the founder of the modern American nation as a just and wise [[culture hero|cultural hero]]. For example, it is said that Washington, as a young child, chopped down his father's cherry tree. His angry father confronted the young Washington, who proclaimed &quot;I can not tell a lie&quot; and admitted to the transgression, thus illuminating his honesty. Parson [[Mason Locke Weems]] is the first citation of the legend, in his 1850 book, ''The Life of George Washington: With Curious Anecdotes, Equally Honorable to Himself and Exemplary to His Young Countrymen''. [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]] (Mark Twain) is also known to have spread the story while lecturing, personalizing it by adding &quot;I have a higher and greater standard of principle. Washington could not lie. I can lie but I won't.&quot; Stories of national value often have similar themes – that the founder of the nation, [[Deucalion]], George Washington, [[Abraham]] – was a wise, virtuous and brave man.

'''''Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri''''' ('''''SMAC''''') is the critically acclaimed [[science fiction]] [[4X]] [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] sequel to the [[Civilization (series)|''Civilization'' series]]. [[Sid Meier]], designer of ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'', and [[Brian Reynolds (game designer)|Brian Reynolds]], designer of ''[[Civilization II]]'', developed ''Alpha Centauri'' after they left [[MicroProse]] to join the newly-created [[Video game developer|developer]] [[Firaxis Games]]. [[Electronic Arts]] released both ''SMAC'' and its expansion, '''''Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire''''' ('''''SMAX'''''), in 1999. In 2000, [[Aspyr Media]] and [[Loki Software]] [[Porting|ported]] both titles over to [[Mac OS]] and [[Linux]].

Set in the [[2100s (decade)#Fictional events|22nd century]], the game begins as seven competing ideological factions land on the planet Chiron (&quot;Planet&quot;) in the [[Alpha Centauri]] [[star system]]. As the game progresses, Planet's growing sentience becomes a formidable obstacle to the human colonists. ''Alpha Centauri'' features improvements on ''Civilization II''{{'}}s [[game engine]], including simultaneous multiplay, social engineering, climate, customizable units, alien native life, additional diplomatic and spy options, additional ways to win, and greater mod-ability . ''Alien Crossfire'' introduces two non-human factions as well as additional technologies, facilities, secret projects, native life, unit abilities and a victory condition.

The game received wide critical acclaim, being compared favorably to ''Civilization II''. Critics praised its science fiction storyline (comparing the plot to works by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Isaac Asimov]]), the in-game writing, the voice acting, the user-created custom units, and the depth of the [[technology tree]]. ''SMAC'' also won several awards for best game of the year and best strategy game of the year. However, despite the critical acclaim, the game had the lowest sales of the ''Civilization'' series.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
''SMAC'' takes place in the ''Civilization'' universe, beginning in the [[22nd century#Video games|22nd century]], and follows the space-race victory in ''Civilization II''&lt;!--    There is also a space-race victory in Civilization, but the source was written before Civilization III    --&gt;.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1&gt;[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The premise is that the [[United Nations]] has sent the &quot;Unity&quot; colonization mission to the [[Alpha Centauri]] planet Chiron (&quot;Planet&quot;).&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p2&gt;[[#SMACManual|Reynolds (1999)]], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced aliens had conducted an experiment in planetary-level sentience on Chiron, leaving behind monoliths and artifacts.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p3&gt;[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the experiment was a disaster, creating a hundred-million-year evolutionary cycle ending in the death of all animal life.&lt;ref name=Primap286&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.286.&lt;/ref&gt; After the disaster, the aliens split into the Manifold Caretakers, who opposed further experimentation, and the Manifold Usurpers, who favored further experimentation. Immediately prior to the start of the game, a reactor malfunction wakes the crew and colonists on the Unity early and irreparably severs communications with Earth.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p3&gt;[[#SMACManual|Reynolds (1999)]], p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; After the captain is assassinated, the most powerful leaders on board build ideological factions with dedicated followers, conflicting agendas for the future of mankind, and &quot;desperately serious&quot; commitments.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMACManual1999p3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosen1999&gt;[[#Rosen1999|Rosen (1999)]]&lt;/ref&gt; As the ship breaks up, seven escape pods, each containing a faction, are scattered across Planet.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p1&gt;[[#Tito2005|Tito (2005)]], p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
The game focuses on the leaders of seven factions, chosen by the player from the 14 possible leaders in ''SMAC'' and ''SMAX'', and Planet (voiced by Alena Kanka).&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p246&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], p.246.&lt;/ref&gt; The characters are developed from the faction leaders' portraits, the spoken monologues accompanying scientific discoveries and the &quot;photographs in the corner of a commlink – home towns, first steps, first loves, family, graduation, spacewalk.&quot;&lt;ref name=Edge2006p1&gt;[[#Edge2006|Edge Staff (2006)]], p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders in ''SMAC'' comprise: Lady Deirdre Skye (voiced by Carolyn Dahl) of ''Gaia's Stepdaughters'', Chairman Sheng-Ji Yang (voiced by Lu Yu) of the ''Human Hive'', Academician Prokhor Zakharov (voice by Yuri Nesteroff) of the ''University of Planet'', CEO Nwabudike Morgan (voiced by Regi Davis) of ''Morgan Industries'', Colonel Corazon Santiago (voiced by Wanda Nino) of the ''Spartan Federation'', Sister Miriam Godwinson (voiced by Gretchen Weigel) of the ''Lord's Believers'', and Commissioner Pravin Lal (voiced by Hesh Gordon) of the ''Peacekeeping Forces''.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p246/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999pp11-13&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], pp.11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The seven faction leaders in ''SMAX'' are Prime Function Aki Zeta-Five (voiced by Allie Rivenbark) of ''The Cybernetic Consciousness'', Captain Ulrik Svensgaard (voiced by James Liebman) of ''The Nautilus Pirates'', Foreman Domai (voiced by Frederick Serafin) of ''The Free Drones'', Datajack Sinder Roze (voiced by Christine Melton) of ''The Data Angels'', Prophet Cha Dawn (voiced by Stacy Spenser) of ''The Cult of Planet'', Guardian Lular H'minee (voiced by Jeff Gordon) of ''The Manifold Caretakers'', and Conquerer Judaa Maar (voiced by Jeff Gordon) of ''The Manifold Usurpers''.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999pp11-13&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999)]], pp.11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p49&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999)]], p49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The player controls one of the leaders and competes against the others to colonize and conquer Planet.&lt;ref name=Rosen1999/&gt; The Datalinks (voiced by Robert Levy and Katherine Ferguson) are minor characters who provide information to the player.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p246/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p111&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; Each faction excels at one or two important aspects of the game and follows a distinct philosophical belief, such as [[technological utopianism]], [[environmentalism]], [[capitalism]], [[militarism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[piracy]], [[classic liberalism]], or the [[Gaia philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Shah2000p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD898p2&gt;[[#DD|Train (1998-08-11)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes place on the last &quot;character&quot;, Planet, with its &quot;rolling red ochre plains&quot;, and &quot;bands of lonely terraformed green&quot;.&lt;ref name=Edge2006p2&gt;[[#Edge2006|Edge Staff (2006)]], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
The story unfolds via the introduction video, explanations of new technologies, videos obtained for completing secret projects, interludes, and cut-scenes.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1/&gt; The native life consists primarily of simple wormlike aliens and a type of red fungus.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p2&gt;[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The fungus is difficult to traverse, provides invisibility for the enemy, provides few resources, and spawns &quot;mindworms&quot; that attack bases and units with a neural attack.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2&gt;[[#Tito2005|Tito (2005)]], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Mindworms can be captured or bred in captivity and used as weapons,&lt;ref name=Primap277&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.277.&lt;/ref&gt; and the player eventually discovers that the fungus and mindworms can [[Group mind (science fiction)|think collectively]].&lt;ref name=Primap277/&gt; Soon the player dreams of a voice.&lt;ref name=Primap278&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.278.&lt;/ref&gt; This voice later intrudes into waking moments, threatening more attacks if the pollution and corruption caused by humans goes unchecked.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap281&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.281.&lt;/ref&gt; The player discovers that Planet is a semi-dormant [[Sentience|sentient]] hive organism that will soon experience a metamorphosis which will destroy all human life.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap282&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.282.&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this threat, the player or a computer faction builds &quot;The Voice of Alpha Centauri&quot; secret project, which delays the metamorphosis and increases the intelligence of the hive organism.&lt;ref name=Primap283&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap284&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap285&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.285.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the player or the computer embraces the &quot;Ascent to Transcendence&quot; in which humans join the hive organism in &quot;godhood&quot;.&lt;ref name=Primap287&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.287.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Alpha Centauri'' closes &quot;with a swell of hope and wonder in place of the expected triumphalism&quot;, reassuring &quot;that the events of the game weren’t the entirety of mankind’s future, but just another step.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edge2006p2&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--  As time passes, Chiron begins to awake and intrude on the player's dreams, eventually giving a player the chance to &quot;transcend&quot; or join &quot;Planet&quot; through technological research and the construction of the massive project, &quot;The Ascent to Transcendence&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;book&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journey to Centauri|first=Mike|last=Ely|work=Firaxis Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Gameplay==

SMAC, a [[turn-based strategy]] game with a science fiction setting, is played from a third-person, [[Isometric graphics in video games|isometric]] perspective. Many game features from ''[[Civilization II]]'' are present, but renamed or slightly tweaked: players establish bases (Civilization II's cities), build facilities (buildings) and secret projects (Wonders of the World), explore territory, research technology, and conquer other factions (civilizations).&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tito2005p1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Noer |first=Michael |url=http://www.forbes.com/1997/07/25/sid.html |title=Sid starts up.

The main map (the upper two thirds of the screen) is divided into squares, on which players can establish bases, move units and engage in combat. Through [[Terraforming in popular culture|terraforming]], players may modify the effects of the individual map squares on movement, combat and resources. Resources are used to feed the population, construct units and facilities, and supply energy. Player can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves. Unlike ''Civilization II'', new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre-designed units, allowing players to design and re-design units as their factions' priorities shift.&lt;ref name=Edge2006p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap230&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy reserves allow the player to upgrade units, maintain facilities, and attempt to win by the Global Energy Market scenario. Bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies. They produce military units, house the population, collect energy, and build secret projects and Subspace Generators. Facilities and secret projects improve the performance of individual bases and the entire faction.

In addition to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically-based bonuses and penalties forced by the player's choice of faction.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edge2006p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shah2000p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD898p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD898p1&gt;[[#DD|Train (1998-08-11)]], p1.&lt;/ref&gt; Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player to create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, similar to the [[United Nations Security Council]], takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], p.132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to futuristic technological advances and secret projects, the game includes alien life, structures and machines.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1/&gt; &quot;Xenofungus&quot; and &quot;sea fungus&quot; provide movement, combat, and resource penalties, as well as concealment for &quot;mindworms&quot; and &quot;spore launchers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Shah2000p4/&gt; Immobile &quot;fungal towers&quot; spawn native life.

Excessive development leads to terraforming-destroying fungus blooms and new native life.

''SMAC'' provides a single player mode and supports [[customization]] and [[multiplayer]]. Players may customize the game by choosing options at the beginning of the game, using the built-in scenario and map editors, and modifying ''SMAC''{{'}}s game files. In addition to a choice of seven (or 14 in ''SMAX'') factions, pre-game options include scenario game, customized random map, difficulty level, and game rules that include victory conditions, research control, and initial map knowledge. The scenario and map editors allow players to create customized scenarios and maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civgaming.net/smac/acad_scened.shtml &quot;The Scenario Editor&quot;], Civilization Gaming Networks.&lt;/ref&gt; The game's basic rules, diplomatic dialog, and the factions' starting abilities are in text files, which &quot;the designers have done their best to make it reasonably easy to [[mod (computer gaming)|modify]]..., even for non-programmers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], p.207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civgaming.net/smac/alphaxguide_v1_3.html &quot;Alpha(x).txt editing (v. 1.3)&quot;], Civilization Gaming Networks.&lt;/ref&gt; ''SMAC'' supports play by email (&quot;PBEM&quot;) and TCP/IP mode featuring simultaneous movement, and introduces direct player-to-player negotiation, allowing the unconstrained trade of technology, energy, maps, and other elements.&lt;ref name=DD1298p2&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-12-09)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==
===Inspirations===
In 1996, [[MicroProse]] released the lauded ''Civilization II'', designed by [[Brian Reynolds (game designer)|Brian Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/civilization2?q=civilization |title=Civilization II (pc) reviews at |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=1996-02-29 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the firm's management had changed and moved to California by the time the game shipped,&lt;ref name=Harrison2000&gt;[[#Harrison2000|Harrison (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and disagreements between the new management and its employees prompted Reynolds, [[Jeff Briggs]], and [[Sid Meier]] (designer of the original ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'') to leave MicroProse and found [[Firaxis]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?print=1 |title=Features - The History of Civilization |publisher=Gamasutra |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/company/microprose-software-inc/history |title=History for MicroProse Software, Inc |publisher=Mobygames.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although unable to expand upon ''Civilization II'', the new company felt that players wanted &quot;a new sweeping epic of a turn-based game&quot;. Having just completed a game of human history up to the present, they wanted a fresh topic and chose science fiction.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p237&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; With no previous experience in science fiction games, the developers believed [[future history]] was a fitting first foray.&lt;ref name=DD698p1&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-06-04)]], p1.&lt;/ref&gt; For the elements of exploring and terraforming an alien world, they chose a plausible near future situation of a human mission to colonize the solar system's nearest neighbor and human factions.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], pp.238.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds researched science fiction for the game's writing.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; His inspiration included&lt;!-- not sure if this wording is still within what the source says: source says &quot;inspiration&quot;--&gt; &quot;classic works of science fiction&quot;, including [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[The Jesus Incident]]'', ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' by [[Vernor Vinge]], and ''[[The Mote in God's Eye]]'' by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]] for alien races; [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Red Mars]]'', ''Slant'' by [[Greg Bear]], and [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s ''[[The Real Story]]'' for future technology and science; and ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by Herbert and Bear's ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'' for negative interactions between humans.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p228&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (February, 1999)]], p.228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p229&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (February, 1999)]], pp.229.&lt;/ref&gt;

''SMAC'' set out to capture the whole sweep of humanity's future, including technology, futuristic warfare, social and economic development, the future of the human condition, spirituality, and philosophy.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p237/&gt; Reynold's also said that &quot;getting philosophy into the game&quot; was one of the attractions of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison2000&quot;/&gt; Believing good science fiction thrives on constraint, the developers began with near-future technologies. As they proceeded into the future, they tried to present a coherent, logical, and detailed picture of future developments in physics, biology, information technology, economics, society, government, and philosophy.&lt;ref name=DD698p1/&gt; Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into ''SMAC'' as external &quot;natural forces&quot; intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; Chris Pine, creator of the in-game map of Planet, strove to make Planet look like a real planet, which resulted in evidence of tectonic action. Another concern was that Planet matched the story, which resulted in the fungus being connected across continents, as it is supposed to be a gigantic neural network.&lt;ref name=Prima70&gt;[[#Prima|Pine (1999)]], p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terraforming]] is a natural outgrowth of colonizing an alien world.&lt;ref name=DD698p2&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-06-04)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt; The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes; for example, creating a ridge-line and then watch the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt icecaps.&lt;ref name=DD698p2/&gt;

In addition to scientific advances, the designers speculated on the future development of human society.&lt;ref name=DD698p3&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-06-04)]], p3.&lt;/ref&gt; The designers allow the player to decide on a whole series of value choices and choose a &quot;ruthless,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;idealistic&quot; stance.&lt;!-- list seems excess here. , i.e. &quot;economics, liberties, religion, health care, military service, education, environment, and information,&quot;--&gt;&lt;!--I think we can just say a series of value choices, but I like the &quot;ruthless,&quot; &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;idealistic&quot;--&gt; Reynolds said the designers don't promote a single &quot;right&quot; answer, instead giving each value choice positive and negative consequences. This design was intended to force the player to &quot;think&quot; and make the game &quot;addictive.&quot;&lt;ref name=DD698p3/&gt; He also commented that ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s fictional nature allowed them to draw their characters &quot;a lot more sharply and distinctly than the natural blurring and greyness of history.&quot;&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;
&lt;!--[[Chiron]], the name of the planet, is the name of the only non-barbaric [[centaur]] in Greek mythology and an important loregiver and teacher for humanity. The name also pays homage to [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan's]] 1982 [[space opera]] novel ''[[Voyage from Yesteryear]]'', in which a human colony is artificially planted by an automatic probe on a planet later named by colonists as Chiron. In the game, Chiron has two moons, named after the centaurs [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]] and [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]], with the combined tidal force of [[Moon|Earth's Moon]], and is the second planet out from Alpha Centauri A, the innermost planet being the [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]-like planet named after the centaur [[Eurytion]]. Alpha Centauri B is also dubbed [[Hercules]], a reference to him killing several centaurs in mythology, and the second star preventing the formation of larger planets. The arrival on Chiron is referred to as &quot;Planetfall&quot;, which is a term used in many science fiction novels, including [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''Future History'' series, and [[Infocom]]'s celebrated comic [[interactive fiction]] adventure ''[[Planetfall]]''. [[Vernor Vinge]]'s concept of ''technological singularity'' is the origin of the Transcendence concept. The game's cutscenes use montages of live-action video, CGI, or both; most of the former is from the 1992 experimental documentary ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}--&gt;

===Alpha Centauri===
In July 1996, Firaxis began work on ''SMAC'';&lt;ref name = &quot;B&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri|url=http://www.firaxis.com/games/game_detail.php?gameid=7|work=Firaxis Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p236&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.236.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds headed the project.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; Meier and Reynolds wrote playable prototype code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development [[Library (computing)|libraries]].&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p236/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/075/075802p1.html| title = Brian Reynolds Launches New Development Studio| publisher = IGN| date = 2000-02-28| accessdate = 2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the development of ''Gettysburg'' took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; By late 1996, the developers were playing games on the prototype, and by the middle of the next year, they were working on a multiplayer [[Game engine|engine]].&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; Reynolds' previous games omitted internet support because he believe that complex turn-based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online.&lt;ref name=DD1298p1&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-12-09)]], p1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way. Reynolds felt that smart computer opponents are an integral part of a classic computer game, and considered it a challenge to make them so.&lt;ref name=DD498p1&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-04-14)]], p1.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the most important principle of game design is for the designer to play the game as it is developed;&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; Reynolds claimed that this was how a good [[Game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] (AI) was built. To this end, he would track the decisions he made and why he made them as he played the game.&lt;ref name=DD498p1/&gt; The designer also watched what the computer players did, noting &quot;dumb&quot; actions and trying to discover why the computer made them.&lt;ref name=DD498p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD498p2&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-04-14)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds then taught the computer his reasoning process so the AI could find the right choice when presented several attractive possibilities.&lt;ref name=DD498p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD498p2/&gt; He said the AI for diplomatic personalities was the best he had done up to that point.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;

Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of ''Civilization II'', was invited to join development as a game balancer.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; Reynolds cited the ''SMAC''{{'}}s balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, ''[[Sid Meier's Colonization]]''.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; According to producer Timothy Train, in designing the strengths and weaknesses of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;DD898p1&quot;/&gt; He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest.&lt;ref name=DD898p2/&gt; Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.&lt;ref name=DD898p3&gt;[[#DD|Train (1998-08-11)]], p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the summer of 1997&lt;!-- what time? a date to anchor this would be good--&gt;, the staff began research on the scientific realities involved in interstellar travel.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; In late 1997, [[Bing Gordon]]—then Chief Creative Officer of [[Electronic Arts]]—joined the team, and was responsible for the Planetary Council, extensive diplomacy, and landmarks.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p239&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.239.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months before the 1998 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), the team incorporated the Explore/Discover/Build/Conquer marketing campaign into the game.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p239/&gt; The game was announced in May 1998 at E3.&lt;!--According to your guidelines, when and where was the game first announced?--&gt;

In the latter half of 1998, the team produced a polished and integrated interface, wrote the game manual and foreign language translations, painted the faction leader portraits and terrain, built the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] vehicles and vehicle parts, and created the music.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p240-1&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], pp.240-1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ely]] directed the Secret Project movies and casted the faction leaders.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p241&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; 25 volunteers participated in Firaxis' first public [[Software release life cycle|beta test]].&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p242&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.242.&lt;/ref&gt; The beta testers suggested the Diplomatic and Economic victories and the Random Events.&lt;!-- How are they responsible?

The design team started with a very simple playable game.&lt;ref name=DD399p1/&gt; They strengthen the &quot;fun&quot; aspects and fixed or removed the unenjoyable ones, a process Sid Meier called &quot;surrounding the fun.&quot;&lt;ref name=DD399p1/&gt; After the revision, they played it again, repeating the cycle of revision and play.&lt;ref name=DD399p1/&gt; Playing the game repeatedly and in-depth was a rule at Firaxis.&lt;ref name=DD898p3/&gt; In the single-player mode, the team tried extreme strategies to find any sure-fire paths to victory and to see how often a particular computer faction ends up at the bottom.&lt;ref name=DD898p3/&gt; The goal was a product of unprecedented depth, scope, longevity, and addictiveness, where the player is always challenged by the game to come up with new strategies with no all-powerful factions or unstoppable tactics.&lt;ref name=DD898p3/&gt; According to Reynolds, the process has been around since Sid Meier's early days at Microprose.&lt;ref name=DD399p1/&gt; At Firaxis, as iterations continue, they expand the group giving feedback, bringing in outside gamers with fresh perspectives.&lt;ref name=DD399p2&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1999-03-15)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alpha Centauri'' was the first game with public beta testers.&lt;ref name=DD399p2/&gt;

Finally, Brian Reynolds discussed the use of the demo in the development process.&lt;ref name=DD399p2/&gt; Originally a marketing tool released prior to the game, they started getting feedback.&lt;ref name=DD399p3&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1999-03-15)]], p3.&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to incorporate many suggestions into the retail version.&lt;ref name=DD399p3/&gt; According to Brian Reynolds, they made improvement in the game's interface, added a couple of new features and fixed a few glitches.&lt;ref name=DD399p3/&gt; They also improved some rules, fine-tuned the game balance and improved the AI.&lt;ref name=DD399p3/&gt; Finally, he adds that they continued to add patches to enhance the game after the game was released.&lt;ref name=DD399p3/&gt;
&lt;!--Reynolds also said that the diplomatic personality was the best he has ever done up to that point, that the system of boundaries (introduced in ''SMAC'') worked really well without adding micromanagement, that he would have liked to have expanded the cutscenes, and that the biggest frustration was getting the 3d &quot;Voxel&quot; code to draw units.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;--&gt;In the months leading to the release of ''SMAC'', multimedia producer [[Michael Ely]] wrote the 35 weekly episodes of ''Journey to Centauri'' detailing the splintering of the U.N. mission to Alpha Centauri.&lt;ref name=OfficialSiteStory&gt;[[#OfficialSite|Official Site: The Story]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alien Crossfire===
A month after ''SMAC''{{'}}s February 1999 release, the Firaxis team began work on the expansion pack, ''Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire'' (''SMAX'').&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/009/009941.html |title=IGN: Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p45&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alien Crossfire'' features seven new factions (two that are non-human), new technologies, new facilities, new secret projects, new alien life forms, new unit special abilities, new victory conditions (including the new &quot;Progenitor Victory&quot;)&lt;!-- is this victory more important than the other new victories? --&gt;&lt;!--the Progenitor Victory was totally new; other victory conditions were modified to take the aliens into account--&gt; and several additional concepts and strategies.&lt;ref name = &quot;B&quot;/&gt; The development team included Train as producer and designer, Chris Pine as programmer, Jerome Atherholt and Greg Foertschand as artist, and Doug Kaufman as co-designer and game balancer.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; The team considered several ideas, including a return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p45/&gt; The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt;

Train wanted to improve the &quot;build&quot; aspects, feeling that the god-game genre had always been heavily slanted towards the &quot;Conquer&quot; end of the spectrum.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; He wanted to provide &quot;builders&quot; with the tools to construct an empire in the face of heated competition.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; The internet community provided &quot;invaluable&quot; feedback.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; The first &quot;call for features&quot; was posted around April 1999 and produced the Fletchette Defense System, Algorithmic Enhancement, and The Nethack Terminus.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; The team had several goals: factions should not be &quot;locked-in&quot; to certain strategies; players should have interesting things to do without unbalancing the game, and the factions must be fun to play.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47-8&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], pp.47-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The team believed the &quot;coolness&quot; of the Progenitor aliens would determine the success or failure of ''SMAX''.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; They strove to make them feel significantly different to play, but still compatible with the existing game mechanics.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47/&gt; The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres, a Planetary survey, non-blind research, and other powers to produce &quot;a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down.&quot;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47/&gt; Chris Pine modified&lt;!-- is &quot;added&quot; the proper term here? --&gt; the AI to account for the additions.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; The team also used artwork, sound effects, music, and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47/&gt; Other than the aliens, the Pirates proved to be the toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p48&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], p.48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion, the team felt that ''SMAX'' was somewhere between an expansion and a full-blown sequel.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p48/&gt; In the months leading to the release of ''SMAX'', multimedia producer [[Michael Ely]] wrote the 9&amp;nbsp;episodes of ''Centauri: Arrival'', introducing the ''SMAX'' factions.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialSiteStory&quot;/&gt; The game initially had a single production run. [[Electronic Arts]] bundled ''Alpha Centauri'' and ''Alien Crossfire'' in the ''Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack'' in 2000 and included both games in ''The Laptop Collection'' in 2003.&lt;ref name = &quot;C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-alpha-centauri-planetary-pack|work=Moby Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Laptop Collection|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/laptop-collection|work=Moby Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, both ''SMAC'' and ''SMAX'' were ported to [[Mac OS]] by [[Aspyr Media]] and to [[Linux]] by [[Loki Software]].&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=43 |title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri |publisher=Insidemacgames.com |date=2000-06-09 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shah |first=Rawn |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/08/24/linux.civ.review.idg/index.html |title=Review: Alpha Centauri for Linux |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date=2000-08-24 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The game can fail to run on some default configurations of modern Linux distributions created after 2004, although there are workarounds available that address this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lordhedgehog.hedgie.com/smac/ |title=Running Alpha Centauri in Linux |publisher=Lordhedgehog.hedgie.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Swanson |url=http://www.swanson.ukfsn.org/loki/ |title=Libraries for running old Loki games |publisher=Swanson.ukfsn.org |date=2009-10-03 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loki installers for linux gamers]] supplies an installer that allows the game to run on modern systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liflg.org/?catid=7&amp;gameid=90 |title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Beta Linux Installer from |publisher=LIFLG |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;!-- This last part about Linux problems comes across as a how-to-guide Is it necessary and are the source reliable? --&gt;&lt;!--This is a vestige from the article prior to this summer.

This was followed by 50,000&amp;nbsp;copies in April, May and June.&lt;ref name=Rosen1999/&gt;

The game showed well at the 1998 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3).&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p240&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.240.&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Morbeck of GameSpot said that ''SMAC'' was &quot;more than hi-tech physics and new ways to blow each other up,&quot; and that the game would feature realistic aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.e3news.com/pc/centauri/index.html| title = Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri| publisher = GameSpot| first = Walter| last = Morbeck| date = 1998-06-03| archivedate = 1999-01-28| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19990128233315/www.e3news.com/pc/centauri/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Coleman of ''Computer Gaming World'' predicted that ''SMAC'' would be &quot;another huge hit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.e3news.com/pc/centauri/index2.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990129011712/www.e3news.com/pc/centauri/index2.html| title=GameSpot's E3 News - Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri| publisher=GameSpot| first = Terry| last = Coleman| date= 1998-06-03| archivedate = 1999-01-29| accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; OGR awarded it &quot;Most Promising Strategy Game&quot; and one of the top 25 games of E3 '98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ogr.com/specials/bestofe3/e3awards.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990203073840/www.ogr.com/specials/bestofe3/e3awards.html| title=Specials - Best of E3 Expo '98| publisher=OGR.com| year = 1998| archivedate=1999-02-03| accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ogr.com/specials/bestofe3/best_of_e3.shtml| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19990203031205/www.ogr.com/specials/bestofe3/best_of_e3.shtml| title=Specials - Best of E3 Expo '98| publisher=OGR.com| year = 1998| archivedate=1999-02-03| accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a vote of 27&amp;nbsp;journalists from 22&amp;nbsp;gaming magazine, ''SMAC'' won &quot;Best Turn Based Strategy&quot; of E3 Show Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.e3.net/1998/award/details.html| title = UGO Best of E3 Show Award Winners| publisher = UGO Networks| year = 1998| archivedate = 1999-02-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19990221124201/www.e3.net/1998/award/details.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron John Loeb, the Awards Committee Chairman, said &quot;for those that understand the intricacies, the wonder, the glory of turn based 'culture building,' this is the game worth skipping class for.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e3.net/1998/award/alphacentauri.html| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19981201232145/www.e3.net/1998/award/alphacentauri.html| title=Best of E3 Show Awards - 1998| publisher=UGO| year = 1998| archivedate= 1998-12-01| accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alpha Centauri's'' science fiction storyline received high praise; IGN considered the game an exception to PC sc-fi cliches,&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt; and ''GamePro'' compared the plot to the works of writers [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Isaac Asimov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gproreview&quot; /&gt; J.C.

''Alpha Centauri's'' turn-based gameplay, including the technology trees and factional warfare, was commonly compared to ''Civilization'' and ''Civilization II''. The Adrenaline Vault's Pete Hines said, &quot;While SMAC is the evolutionary off-spring to Civ and Civ 2, it is not Civ 2 in space. Although the comparison is inevitable because of the lineage, it is still short-sighted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; ''Edge'' in 2006 praised &quot;Alpha Centauri’s greater sophistications as a strategy game.&quot; &lt;ref name=Edge2006p1/&gt; IGN said &quot;Alpha Centauri is a better game than Civilization II; it's deep, rich, rewarding, thought-provoking in almost every way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt; Game Revolution's reviewer was less magnanimous, saying &quot;Alpha Centauri is at least as good a game as Civilization 2. But it is its great similarity that also does it the most detriment. Alpha Centauri simply does not do enough that is new; it just doesn't innovate enough to earn a higher grade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grevreview&quot; /&gt; The ability to create custom units was praised,&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; as was the depth of the tech tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grevreview&quot; /&gt; The artificial intelligence of computer-controlled factions, which featured adaptability and behavioral subtlety,&lt;ref name=&quot;redefining&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Scheisel | first = Seth | authorlink = | title = Redefining the Power of the Gamer | work = The New York Times | publisher = | date = June 7, 2005 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/arts/07arti.html | accessdate = November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was given mixed comments; some reviewers thought it was efficient and logical,&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gproreview&quot; /&gt; while others found it confusing or erratic.&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grevreview&quot; /&gt; ''Edge'' was disappointed in the game's diplomacy, finding &quot;no more and no less than is expected from the genre&quot; and unhappy with &quot;the inability to sound out any real sense of relationship or rational discourse.&quot; &lt;ref name=Edge2006p2/&gt;

{{Rquote|left|If you're looking for gratuitous eye candy, then you're obviously in the wrong place. Alpha Centauri's graphics are quite good, but they're not going to make anyone sit up and take notice.|Bob Colayco|FiringSquad&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;}}

The game's graphics were widely acknowledged to be above average at the time of its release, but not revolutionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt; Its maps and interface were
considered detailed and in accordance with a space theme,&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grevreview&quot; /&gt; but the game was released with a limited color palette.&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; The in-game cutscenes, particularly the [[full motion video]] that accompanied technological advances, were praised for their quality and innovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; ''Alpha Centauri's'' sound and music received similar comments;&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; FiringSquad said &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[The sound effect quality]&lt;/nowiki&gt; sort of follows the same line as the unit graphics - not too splashy but enough to get the job done.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;

''Alpha Centauri'' has won several Game of the Year awards,&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; including those from the ''[[The Denver Post|Denver Post]]'' and the ''[[Toronto Sun]]''. It won the &quot;Turn-based Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award from [[GameSpot]] as well. The [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] named ''Alpha Centauri'' the best strategy game of the year, and in 2000, ''Alpha Centauri'' won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Strategy Computer Game of 1999''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.firaxis.com/smac/game.cfm| title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri: The Game| publisher=Firaxis| archivedate = 2008-01-24| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080124172058/www.firaxis.com/smac/game.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alpha Centauri'' has the distinction of receiving gaming magazine ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s highest score (98%),&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; surpassing ''Civilization II''{{'}}s score (97%).&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamer&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=PC Gamer|year=1999|month=April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of the expansion, multimedia producer [[Michael Ely]] wrote a trilogy of novels based on the game. Illustrator [[Rafael Kayanan]] also wrote a [[graphic novel]] entitled ''Alpha Centauri: Power of the Mindworms''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialSiteStory&quot;/&gt;

While not a direct sequel of ''Civilization II'', ''Alpha Centauri'' is considered a spiritual successor because it shares the same general principles and was made by many of the original developers. There have been no sequels beyond ''SMAX'', something that writer Greg Tito attributed to Reynolds leaving Firaxis in 2000 to form [[Big Huge Games]].&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; ''SMAX'' producer and lead designer Timothy Train also left Firaxis with Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/company.php?id=494 |title=Firaxis Games |publisher=Allgame.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the features introduced in ''SMAC'' were carried over into subsequent ''Civilization'' titles.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; For example, each civilization's characteristics in ''Civilization III'' are reminiscent of faction bonuses and penalties,&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; the government system in ''[[Civilization IV]]'' closely resembles ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s,&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; and ''[[Civilization V]]'' includes a new win condition: the completion of the Utopia project, which is reminiscent of the Ascent to Transcendence secret project.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards2010|Edwards (2010)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release, ''Civilization III'' was compared negatively to ''Alpha Centauri'',&lt;ref name=&quot;NewSeason&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Schiesel | first = Seth | authorlink = | title = The New Season Video Games; Going to War in the Matrix, Middle Earth, or the Bronx | work = The New York Times | publisher = | date = September 11, 2005 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E3DA1431F932A2575AC0A9639C8B63 | accessdate = November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Edge'' magazine noted that ''Alpha Centauri'' remained &quot;highly regarded&quot; in 2006.&lt;ref name=Edge2006p2/&gt; [[Steve Jackson Games]] published ''GURPS Alpha Centauri'', a sourcebook for the [[GURPS]] [[role-playing game (pen and paper)|role-playing game]] set in the ''Alpha Centauri'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/alphacentauri/ Official homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 2010, Brendan Casey released an unofficial [[Patch (computing)|patch]], which fixes bugs in ''Alpha Centauri''.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Brendan (also known as scient, 2010) [http://www.civgaming.net/forums/showthread.php?p=162396#post162396 &quot;Unofficial SMAC/X Patches Version 1.0&quot;], Civilization Gaming Networks Forums, May 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His project began in February 2009 at Apolyton's Alpha Centauri site&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Brendan (2009) [http://www.apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?p=5531636#post5531636 &quot;Fixing SMACX Bugs&quot;], Apolyton Civilizations Site Forums, February 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and moved in June 2009 to the Civilization Gaming Network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civgaming.net/forums/showthread.php?p=161019#post161019 &quot;Orientation and Moderation&quot;], Civilization Gaming Networks Forums, June 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; where he plans to continue developing further patch versions.&lt;ref&gt;WePlayCiv [http://www.weplayciv.com//node/233 &quot;Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri / Alien Crossfire Unofficial Patch released!&quot;], ''WePlayCiv'', May 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sold-Out Software]] also re-released the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fink |url=http://www.mastertronic.com/productSoldOut.asp?pid=756&amp;productLabelID=1 |title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Complete |publisher=Mastertronic |date= |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Is the re-release of the game ten years later really part of Legacy or is this WP:INDISCRIMINATE?--&gt;

'''Abu Sayyaf''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;جماعة أبو سياف&lt;/big&gt;}}; {{transl|sem|Jamāʿah Abū Sayyāf}}, '''ASG''', {{lang-fil|Grupong Abu Sayyaf}}) also known as '''al-Harakat al-Islamiyya'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rommel Banlaoi|title=Al Harakatul Al Islamiyah: Essays on the Abu Sayyaf Group|url=http://pipvtr.com/pipvtr/files/Book_AHAI_Essays_on_ASG_Book_Banlaoi_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is one of several military [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[separatism|separatist]] groups based in and around the southern [[Philippines]], in [[Bangsamoro]] ([[Jolo, Sulu|Jolo]], [[Basilan]] and [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]]) where for almost 30 years various Muslim groups have been engaged in an [[insurgency]] for an independent province in the country. The name of the group is derived from the Arabic ابو, ''[[Abu (Arabic term)|abu]]'' (&quot;father of&quot;) and ''sayyaf'' (&quot;Swordsmith&lt;ref name=&quot;24threlease&quot;&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mostwantedterrorists022406.htm FBI Updates Most Wanted Terrorists and Seeking Information – War on Terrorism Lists], ''FBI national Press Release'', February 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;). The group calls itself &quot;Al-Harakat Al-Islamiyya&quot; or the &quot;Islamic Movement&quot;. 

Since its inception in the early 1990s, the group has carried out [[bombing]]s, [[kidnapping]]s, [[assassination]]s and [[extortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rommel C. Banlaoi|title=Abu Sayyaf Group:  From Mere Banditry to Genuine Terrorism|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/southeast_asian_affairs/summary/v2006/2006.banlaoi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in what they describe as their fight for an [[Independence|independent]] [[Islamic republic|Islamic province]] in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=204 |title=Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) |publisher=MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base |accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ideology: Abu Sayyaf seeks the establishment of an [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Iranian-style]] Islamic [[theocracy]] in the southern Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Lynn  Nankivell/James Boutilier (2007): ''Sout East Asia and Global Terror'', in: Christopher Ankersen (ed.): ''Understanding Global Terror'', Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

* Manpower: Abu Sayyaf forces in [[Basilan]] and in [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] were, by June 2003, believed to number less than 500, down from more than 1,000 a year earlier.

* Equipment: Abu Sayyaf uses mostly grenades, bombs (modified [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]'s and land mines), machine guns, rifles, rocket launchers and other weapons have been reported.

The [[United States Department of State]] has classified the group as a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group by adding it to the list of [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organizations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot;/&gt; As a result, the CIA deployed paramilitary officers from their elite [[Special Activities Division]] to hunt down and kill or capture key terrorist leaders. Several hundred United States soldiers are also stationed in the area to mainly train local forces in counter terror and counter guerrilla operations, but as a status of forces agreement and under Philippine law are not allowed to engage in direct combat.

The Abu Sayyaf also a part-time operating [[criminal gang]], where they conduct drive-by-shootings, larceny, drug dealing and excess theft in Mindanao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091111-235574/Abu-Sayyaf-survives-US-based-Philippine-crackdown INQUIRER.net]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Location and view on Abu Sayyaf==

Until his death in a gunbattle on September 4, 2006, [[Khadaffy Janjalani]] was considered the nominal leader of the group by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. His older brother [[Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani]], the founder of Abu Sayyaf, died in December 1998 in a gun battle with Filipino forces. Khadaffy's death was officially confirmed on January 20, 2007, through [[DNA analysis]] of both brother's remains. Both were natives of [[Isabela City]], currently one of the poorest [[cities of the Philippines]]. Located on the north of the island of Basilan, Isabela is also the capital of Basilan province, across the Basilan Strait from [[Zamboanga City]]. But Isabela City is administered under the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] political region north of the island of Basilan, while the rest of the island province of Basilan is now (since 1996) governed as part of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) to the east. 

Consequently, being on the social or political division line, Basilan, Jolo and Sulu have seen some of the fiercest fighting between government troops and the Muslim separatist group Abu Sayyaf through the early 1990s. The Abu Sayyaf primarily operates in the southern Philippines with members traveling to [[Manila]] and other provinces in the country. It was reported that Abu Sayyaf had begun expanding into neighbouring [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] by the early 1990s. 

The Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest but strongest of the Islamic separatist groups in the Philippines. Some Abu Sayyaf members have studied or worked in [[Saudi Arabia]] and developed ties to [[mujahadeen]] while fighting and training in the war against the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;PacCom&quot;/&gt; Abu Sayyaf proclaimed themselves as [[mujahideen]] and freedom fighters but are not supported by many people in the Philippines including its Muslim [[cleric]]s.

Abu Sayyaf is estimated to have a membership of 200 with an extended membership of over 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Who are the Abu Sayyaf |date=2000-12-30 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/719623.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group was originally not thought to receive funding from outside sources, but intelligence reports from the [[United States]], Indonesia and [[Australia]] have found intermittent ties to the Indonesian [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] terrorist group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bomb hits Philippines ferry |publisher=CNN |date=2005-08-28 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/08/28/philippines.ferry.blast/index.html}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government considers the Abu Sayyaf as a part of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] and notes that initial funding came from [[Al-Qaeda]] through the brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, through Islamic charities in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Return of Abu Sayyaf |date=2004-08-30 |publisher=Time Asia Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501040830-686107,00.html | first=Simon | last=Elegant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCAirRebel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Air raids hit Philippines rebels |publisher=BBC |date=2004-11-20 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4027721.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AsiaWeek: 08.31.1999 |publisher=AsiaWeek |date=1999-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing ties to Islamist groups in the Middle East indicate that Al-Qaeda may be continuing support.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunfight in philippine bomber hunt |publisher=CNN |date=2003-08-10 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/08/10/philippine.gunfight/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bin Laden Funds Abu Sayyaf Through Muslim Relief Group |date=2000-08-09 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters and other sources of funding==

The group obtains most of its financing through [[ransom]] and extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rommel C. Banlaoi|title=The Sources of Abu Sayyaf's Resilience in the Southern Philippines|url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-sources-of-the-abu-sayyaf’s-resilience-in-the-southern-philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One report estimated its revenues from ransom payments in 2000 alone between $10 and $25 million. According to the State Department, it may also receive funding from radical Islamic benefactors in the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. &quot;Libya was a conduit for ransoms paid to Abu Sayyaf and other Filipino Muslim groups...[Libya] also offered money for ‘livelihood projects’ in its role in the 2000 hostage negotiations...this raises the possibility that Libyan money gets channeled to Abu Sayyaf.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Niksch, Larry |title=Abu Sayyaf: Target of Philippine-U.S. Anti-Terrorism Cooperation |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |date=2002-01-25 |work=CRS Report for Congress |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31265.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian intelligence agencies connected [[Victor Bout]]'s planes have provided Abu Sayyaf with arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?id=88499&amp;lng=en The deadly convenience of Victor Bout].

==Abu Sayyaf-Al Qaeda group==
The group may be funding from Al-Qaeda in the early 1990s through Mohammad Jamal Khalifa, a brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79205&amp;page=1&amp;page=1 | title=The Abu Sayyaf-Al Qaeda Connection-Abu Sayyaf Terrorist Group Alleged to Have Links to Al Qaeda | publisher=abc News International | accessdate=20 December 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091111-235574/Abu-Sayyaf-survives-US-based-Philippine-crackdown | title=Abu Sayyaf survives US-backed Philippine crackdown | publisher=INQUIRER.net | accessdate=11 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda collaborator Ramzi Yousef operated in the Philippines in the mid-1990s and trained Abu Sayyaf soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banlaoi|first=Rommel|title=War on Terrorism in Southeast Asia|year=2004|publisher=Rex Book Store|location=Quezon City|isbn=971-23-4031-7|pages=1-235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2002 edition of the United State Department’s Patterns of Global Terrorism mention links to Al-Qaeda.

Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani’s first recruits were soldiers of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (M.N.L.F.) and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (M.I.L.F.). However, the M.I.L.F. and M.N.L.F. deny having links with Abu Sayyaf. Both officially distance themselves from Abu Sayyaf because of its attacks on civilians and its supposed profiteering. The Philippine military, however, has claimed that elements of both groups provide support to the Abu Sayyaf.

==History==
In the early 1970s, the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (M.N.L.F.) was the main Muslim rebel groups fighting in Basilan and Mindanao in the southern Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot; /&gt;

[[Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani]], the older brother of [[Khadaffy Janjalani]], had been a teacher from Basilan, who later studied Islamic [[theology]] and [[Arabic]] in [[Libya]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;PacCom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu Sayyaf History |publisher=U.S. Pacific Command |date=2000-09-216 |url=http://www.pacom.mil/piupdates/abusayyafhist.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot; /&gt; Abdurajik then went to Afghanistan to fight against the [[Soviet Union]] and the Afghan government during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in the 1980s. During that period, he is alleged to have met [[Osama Bin Laden]] and been given $6 million to establish a more Islamic group with the M.N.L.F. in the southern Philippines, made up of members of the extant M.N.L.F.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah |url=http://www.nbr.org/publications/analysis/pdf/vol14no5.pdf |publisher=The National Bureau of Asian Research |accessdate=September 20, 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, as a political solution in the southern Philippines, ARMM had been established in 1989.

===Abu Sayyaf under Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani===
M.N.L.F. had moderated into an established political government, the ARMM. It was established in 1989, fully institutionalized by 1996 and which eventually became the ruling government in southern Mindanao. 

When Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani returned home to Basilan island in 1990, he gathered radical members of the old M.N.L.F. who wanted to resume armed struggle for an independent Islamic state and in 1991 established the Abu Sayyaf.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot; /&gt; 

By 1995 Abu Sayyaf was active in large scale bombings and attacks in the Philippines. The Abu Sayyaf's first attack was the assault on the town of [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] in [[Mindanao]] in April 1995. This year also marked the escape of 20 year old Khadaffy Janjalani from [[Camp Crame]] in [[Manila]] along with another member named Jovenal Bruno.

On December 18, 1998, Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani was killed in a gun battle with the [[Philippine National Police]] on Basilan Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot; /&gt; He is thought to have been about age 39 at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot; /&gt; The death of Aburajik Abubakar Janjalani marked a turning point in Abu Sayyaf operations, shifting from its ideological focus to more general kidnappings, murders and robberies, as the younger brother Khadaffy Janjalani succeeded Aburajak.

===Abu Sayyaf under Khadaffy Janjalani===
The 23 year-old Khadaffy Janjalani then took leadership of one of Abu Sayyaf's factions in an internecine struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCFresh&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh fighting in S Philippines |publisher=BBC |date=2006-09-07 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5322680.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked to consolidate his leadership of the Abu Sayyaf, causing the group to appear inactive for a period. After Janjalani's leadership was secured, the Abu Sayyaf began a new strategy, as they proceeded to take hostages.

The group's motive for kidnapping became more financial and religious during the period of Khadaffy's leadership, according to locals in the areas associated with Abu Sayyaf. The hostage money is probably the method of financing of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBR&quot; /&gt;
The group expanded its operations to [[Malaysia]] in 2000 when it abducted foreigners from two different resorts. This action was condemned by most leaders in the Islamic world. [[File:Terhapilon2000.jpg|left|thumb|Isnilon Totoni Hapilon in 2000.]]It was also responsible for the kidnapping and murder of more than 30 foreigners and Christian clerics and workers, including Martin and [[Gracia Burnham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNCapture&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Manilla captures senior Abu Sayyaf |publisher=CNN |date=2003-12-07 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/12/07/philippines.abusayyaf/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-hostage describes jungle ordeal |publisher=CNN |date=2003-05-09 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/05/08/cnna.burnham/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commander named [[Abu Sabaya]] was killed in 2002 while trying to evade forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ict&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Prominent Abu Sayyaf Commander Believed Dead |url=http://www.ict.org.il/spotlight/det.cfm?id=796 |publisher=Institute for Counter-Terrorism |accessdate=September 20, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060105081224/http://www.ict.org.il/spotlight/det.cfm?id=796 |archivedate = January 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galib Andang, one of the leaders of the group was captured in [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] in December 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNCapture&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCProfiles&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Profiles of dead Abu Sayyaf leaders |publisher=BBC |date=2005-03-15 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4350033.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCBloody&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloody end to Manila jail break |publisher=BBC |date=2005-03-15 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4349471.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An explosition at a military base in Jolo on February 18, 2006 was blamed on Abu Sayyaf by Brig. General Alexander Aleo, an Army officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Blast at US Philippines army base |publisher=BBC |date=2006-02-18 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4727842.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sali.jpg|right|thumb|Jainal Antel Sali, Jr.]]
Khadaffy Janjalani was indicted in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] for his alleged involvement in terrorist attacks, including hostage taking by Abu Sayyaf and murder, against United States nationals and other foreign nationals in and around the Republic of the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCIndict&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=US indicts Abu Sayyaf leaders |publisher=BBC |date=2002-07-23 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2147381.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently on February 24, 2006, Janjalani was among six fugitives in the second and most recent group of indicted fugitives to be added to the [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists]] list along with two fellow members of the Abu Sayyaf, including [[Isnilon Totoni Hapilon]] and [[Jainal Antel Sali, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNFBI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI puts al-Zarqawi high on its list |date=2006-02-24 |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/24/zarqawi.mostwanted/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HouseIndict&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiahrt responds to the Abu Sayyaf terrorist indictments |publisher=United States House of Representatives |url=http://www.house.gov/tiahrt/communications/press_releases/2002/07232002.htm |accessdate=September 20, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060910033008/http://www.house.gov/tiahrt/communications/press_releases/2002/07232002.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2006, it was reported that Abu Sayyaf members may have been planning attacks during the [[ASEAN]] summit in the Philippines. The group was reported to have been training alongside Jemaah Islamiyah militants. The plot was reported to have involved detonating a car bomb in the town of Cebu where the summit was scheduled to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manila Again Denies Terror Plot Led to Postponement of Asia Summits |date=2006-12-13 |publisher=Voice of America (VoA) |url=http://voanews.com/english/2006-12-13-voa11.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 2006, the Philippine military reported that Janjalani's remains had been recovered near Patikul, in Jolo in the southern Philippines and that DNA tests had been ordered to confirm the discovery. He was allegedly shot in the neck in an encounter with government troops on September on Luba Hills, Patikul town in Sulu. 
In 2009, with the shooting of two United States soldiers, Abu Sayyaf was again put in the international spotlight.

Abu Solaiman a soldier of the Abu Sayyaf was killed by government troops on January 16, 2007.

===2000 Sipadan kidnapping===
On May 3, 2000, Abu Sayyaf guerillas occupied the [[Malaysia]]n dive resort island [[Sipadan]] and took 21 [[hostages]], including 10 tourists and 11 resort workers - 19 non-Filipino nationals in total. The hostages were taken to an Abu Sayyaf base in [[Jolo]], Sulu.&lt;ref name = &quot;gmaabusayyaf&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Two [[Muslim]] Malaysians were released soon after, however Abu Sayyaf made various demands for the release of several prisoners, including [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|1993 World Trade Centre bomber]] [[Ramzi Yousef]] and $2.4 million. In July, a Filipino television evangelist and 12 of his crew offered their help and went as mediators for the relief of other hostages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmcim.org]&lt;/ref&gt; They, three French television crew members and a German journalist, all visiting Abu Sayyaf on Jolo, were also taken hostage.&lt;ref name = &quot;cdnn&quot;/&gt; Most hostages were released between August and September, 2000, partly due to mediation by Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and an offer of $25 million in &quot;development aid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/898190.stm BBC news.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; One hostage reported other female captives being raped.&lt;ref name = &quot;cdnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|coauthors=FREEMAN WASHINGTON|url=http://www.cdnn.info/news/industry/i000910.html|title=Abu Sayyaf Muslim rebels raped Sipadan dive tourist hostages| newspaper=[[CDNN]] |date=2000-09-10 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidnapping of Jeffrey Schilling===
[[File:Schilling.jpg|thumb|right|Jeffrey Schilling]]

Jeffrey Schilling, an [[United States|American]] citizen and [[Muslim]] convert, was held by Abu Sayyaf for 8 months after being captured while visiting a terrorist camp with his wife, Ivy Osani. Abu Sayyaf demanded a $10 million dollar ransom for his release, but Schilling escaped after more than 7 months and was picked up by the [[Philippines|Philippine]] Marines Corps on April 12, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/04/02/world/main283170.shtml |publisher=''CBS News'' |date=April 12, 2001 |title=US Hostage Freed in Philippines |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/23/bn.01.html |title=Larry Thompson, Deputy Attorney General (Live Transcript) |date=July 23, 2002 |publisher=CNN International}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Many commentators have been critical of Schilling, who had reportedly walked into the camp. Schilling claims to have been invited, through a relative of his wife who was a member of Abu Sayyaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/14/MNE165246.DTL |title= What Was Schilling Thinking?

===Martin and Gracia Burnham's kidnapping===
{{See also|Dos Palmas kidnappings}}
On May 27, 2001, an Abu Sayyaf raid kidnapped about 20 people from Dos Palmas, an expensive resort in Honda Bay, to the north of [[Puerto Princesa City]] on the island of [[Palawan]], which had been &quot;considered completely safe&quot;. The most &quot;valuable&quot; of the hostages were three North Americans, Martin and Gracia Burnham (a missionary couple) and Guillermo Sobero (a Peruvian-American tourist who was later [[Decapitation|beheaded]] by Abu Sayyaf) for whom Abu Sayyaf demanded $1 million in [[ransom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsstand.blogs.com/newsstand/2007/01/turns_out_abu_s.html Gracia's enemies newsstand.blogs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The hostages and hostage-takers then returned hundreds of kilometres back across the [[Sulu Sea]] to the Abu Sayyaf's territories in Mindanao.&lt;ref name=Bowden2007p54&gt;&quot;Manhunt&quot; by Mark Bowden, ''The Atlantic'', March 2007, p.54 (15)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author [[Mark Bowden]], the leader of the raid was [[Abu Sabaya]]. According to [[Gracia Burnham]], she told her husband &quot;to identify his kidnappers&quot; to authorities &quot;as 'the Osama bin Laden Group,' but Burnham was unfamiliar with that name and stuck with&quot; Abu Sayyaf. After returning to Mindanao, Abu Sayyaf operatives conducted numerous raids, &quot;including one at a coconut plantation called Golden Harvest; they took about 15 people captive there and later used [[bolo knife|bolo knives]] to hack the heads off two men. The number of hostages waxed and waned as some were ransomed and released, new ones were taken and others were killed.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bowden2007p54 /&gt; 

On 7 June 2002, about a year after the raid, Philippine army troops attempted a rescue operation in which two of the three hostages held were killed, Martin Burnham and a Filipino nurse Ediborah Yap. The remaining hostage was wounded and the hostage takers escaped. 

In July 2004, Gracia Burnham [[Testimony|testified]] at a trial of eight Abu Sayyaf members and identified six of the suspects as being her erstwhile captors, including Alhamzer Limbong, Abdul Azan Diamla, Abu Khari Moctar, Bas Ishmael, Alzen Jandul and Dazid Baize. 

&quot;The eight suspects sat silently during her three-hour testimony, separated from her by a wooden grill. They face the death sentence if found guilty of kidnapping for ransom. The trial began this year and is not expected to end for several months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graciaburnham.org/pdf/Article_7-30-04.pdf Burham identifies former Abu Captors]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alhamzer Limbong was later killed in a [[Prison riot|prison uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graciaburnham.org/index.asp?sec=3_1 PHILIPPINES BRACE FOR RETALIATION] Tuesday, March 15, 2005, Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gracia Burnham]] has caused controversy since returning to the United States, by implying that Philippine military officials were colluding with her captors. She made the claim in a book about her experiences called [http://books.google.com/books?id=XtE5QEW0ukUC&amp;dq=In+the+Presence+of+My+Enemies&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=aBsO-csyzG&amp;sig=lwOf29qR-dcKscY3A-_qNV0QnJ0&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DIn%2Bthe%2BPresence%2Bof%2BMy%2BEnemies%26btnG%3DGoogle%2BSearch&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=2 ''In the Presence of My Enemies'']. In it she states that the Armed Forces of the Philippines &quot;didn't pursue us ... As time went on, we noticed that they never pursued us.&quot;

===Superferry 14 Bombing===
{{Main|Superferry 14 }}

[[Superferry 14]] was a large [[ferry]] destroyed by a bomb on February 27, 2004, killing 116 people in the [[Philippines]]' worst [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack and the world's deadliest terrorist attack at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rommel C. Banlaoi|title=Maritime Terrorism in Southeast Asia:  The Abu Sayyaf Threat|url=http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/f54ece77-3d67-4c32-bfaa-02b476a569d8/Maritime-Terrorism-in-Southeast-Asia--The-Abu-Sayy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On that day, the 10,192 [[ton]] ferry was sailing out of [[Manila]], with about 900 passengers and crew. A television set filled with 8&amp;nbsp;lb. (4 kilograms) of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] had been placed on board. 90 minutes out of port, the bomb exploded. 63 people were killed immediately and 53 were missing and presumed dead.

Despite claims from terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident, caused by a gas explosion. But after divers righted the ferry five months after it sunk, they found evidence of a bomb blast. Also, a man named Redendo Cain Dellosa admitted to planting the bomb on board for the Abu Sayyaf.

Philippine president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] announced on October 11, 2004, that investigators had concluded the explosion was caused by a bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rommel C.

==Military Action==
The military has intensified its intelligence operation against the Abu Sayyaf following the arrest of a [[Filipino-American]] allegedly selling illegal weapons to the Al-Qaeda linked group. Security forces have arrested Victor Moore Infante in Zamboanga for selling weapons to the extremist group. The 34-year old man was tagged by authorities as &quot;one of the United States most wanted fugitives.&quot;

His arrest was made secret and announced by the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation. Infante, who was reported to have traveled to Basilan, a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf, had been deported to Guam. Federal agents escorted the Filipino-American, who was also suspected of planning to smuggle illegal drugs to the Philippines. United States authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of Infante in New York after Customs men in July 2003 seized one of his package from Oakland containing weapons’ parts addressed to his safehouse in Zamboanga City.

&quot;His arrest and deportation is another big step in our campaign against terrorism because this man is known to have aided the Abu Sayyaf in acquiring weapons used by the group in committing atrocities against our soldiers and civilians,&quot; Philippine immigration chief Andrea Domingo said in a statement.

The United States in 2002 included the Abu Sayyaf in its list of foreign terrorist organization, along side with the Al-Qaeda network and the Indonesian-based Jemaah Islamiya. Philippine authorities tagged the group as behind the kidnapping and killing of two United States hostages Guillermo Sobero and Martin Burnham in Mindanao.

==Targeting the United States==
Most of the Abu Sayyaf victims have been Filipinos. However, the group has also targeted foreigners for kidnapping because of the large [[ransom]] payments and North Americans for [[politics|political]] reasons. Abu Sayyaf kidnapped an American Bible translator in the southern Philippines in 1993. In 2000, Abu Sayyaf captured an American Muslim visiting Jolo and demanded that the United States release [[Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman]] and [[Ramzi Yousef]], who were jailed for their involvement in the 1993 [[World Trade Center bombing]]. Leaders of the Abu Sayyaf stated that &quot;We have been trying hard to get an American because they may think we are afraid of them,&quot; a spokesman for Abu Sayyaf said. &quot;We want to fight the American people.&quot; 

They have also targeted Canadians, Australians, and European tourists as well.

==Criticism==
===Muslim===
*The [[Foreign relations of Libya|Libyan envoy]] accused the group of inhumanity and violating the tenets of Islam by holding innocent people. Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, former ambassador to the Philippines, criticised the [[kidnappers]] for holding people who have nothing to do with the conflict. The hostage-takers should not use religion as a reason to keep the hostages isolated from their families, he said.

*Sheikh [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] in [[Qatar]] has denounced the kidnapping and killings committed by the Abu Sayyaf towards civilians and foreigners, asserting that they are not part of the dispute between the Abu Sayyaf and the Philippines government. He stated that it is shameful to commit such acts in the name of the Islamic faith, saying that such acts produce backlashes against Islam and Muslims worldwide. It is known that Qaradawi supports the rights of Muslims in Philippines. Qaradawi spoke of the importance of education in the life of Muslims, stating that educational institutions in the Muslim world should review their educational philosophy in order that it may reflect Islamic values aiming to create pious Muslims good to themselves and non-Muslims as well.

*The [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) condemned the Sipadan kidnapping and offered to help secure their release. OIC Secretary General [[Azeddine Laraki]] who represents the world's largest Islamic body, told the Philippine government he was prepared to send an envoy to help save the hostages and issued a statement condemning the rebels. &quot;The Secretary General has pointed out that this operation and the like are rejected by divine laws and that they are neither the appropriate nor correct means to resolve conflicts,&quot; the statement said.

===Non-Muslim===
Mark Bowden in an Atlantic story on the Martin and [[Gracia Burnham]] kidnapping and captivity describe the couple as &quot;gently engaged their captors in theological discussion&quot; and finding these [[jihad]]ists to be shallow, even adolescent, in their faith. Unfamiliar with the [[Qur'an]], the outlaws had only a sketchy notion of Islam, which they saw as a set of behavioral rules, to be violated when it suited them. Kidnapping, murder and theft were justified by their special status as [[mujahideen|holy warriors]]. One by one they sexually appropriated several of the women captives, claiming them as `wives`.&lt;ref name=Bowden2007p60&gt;&quot;Manhunt&quot; by Mark Bowden ''The Atlantic'', March 2007, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armenian language''' ({{lang|hy|[[wikt:հայերէն|հայերէն]]}} in [[Traditional Armenian orthography|TAO]] or {{lang|hy|[[wikt:հայերեն|հայերեն]]}} in [[Reformed Armenian orthography|RAO]], {{IPA-hy|hɑjɛˈɾɛn}}—''{{transl|hy|ISO|hayeren}}'') is an [[Indo-European language]] spoken by the [[Armenians|Armenian people]]. It is the official language of the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] as well as in the region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The language is also widely spoken by Armenian communities in the [[Armenian diaspora]]. It has its own script, the [[Armenian alphabet]], and is of interest to linguists for its distinctive phonological developments within Indo-European.&lt;ref&gt;''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', Benjamin W. Fortson, John Wiley and Sons, 2009 [http://books.google.com/books?id=_kn5c5dJmNUC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=meillet+armenian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AlOeTP7kOYX7lwe2ruXRCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=meillet%20armenian&amp;f=false p383].&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists classify Armenian as an independent branch of the [[Indo-European]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109780/Armenian-language Armenian language - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian shares a number of major innovations with Greek, and some linguists group these two languages together with [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] and the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] family into a higher-level subgroup of Indo-European which is defined by such [[synapomorphy|shared innovations]] as the [[Augment (linguistics)|augment]]. More recently, others have proposed a Balkan grouping including Greek, Armenian, Phrygian and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].&lt;ref&gt;''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', Benjamin W. Fortson, John Wiley and Sons, 2009, p383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenian has a long literary history, with a fifth-century Bible translation as its oldest surviving text. Its vocabulary has been heavily influenced by [[Middle Iranian languages|Western Middle Iranian languages]], particularly [[Parthian language|Parthian]], and to a lesser extent by Greek, [[Latin]], [[Old French]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages throughout its history. There are two standardized modern literary forms, [[Eastern Armenian]] and [[Western Armenian]], with which most contemporary dialects are [[mutually intelligible]]. The divergent and almost extinct [[Lomavren language]] is a [[Romani language|Romani]]-influenced dialect with an Armenian grammar and a largely Romani-derived vocabulary, including Romani numbers.

While the Armenians were known to history much earlier (for example, they were mentioned in the 6th century BC [[Full translation of the Behistun Inscription|Behistun Inscription]] and [[Xenophon]]'s 4th century BC history, ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|The Anabasis]]''),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Armenia as Xenophon Saw It&quot;, p 47, ''A History of Armenia''. Vahan Kurkjian, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest surviving Armenian language text is the 5th century AD [[Bible]] translation of [[Saint Mesrob Mashtots|Mesrob Mashtots]].

===Early contacts===
The large percentage of loans from [[Iranian languages]] initially led linguists to erroneously classify Armenian as an Iranian language. The distinctness of Armenian was only recognized when Hübschmann (1875)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/read12.html&lt;/ref&gt; used the [[comparative method]] to distinguish two layers of Iranian loans from the true Armenian [[vocabulary]]. 

W. M. Austin in 1942 concluded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Austin |first=William M. |title=Is Armenian an Anatolian Language? |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |date=January - March, 1942 |pages=22–25 |doi=10.2307/409074 |journal=Language |volume=18 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/409074 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was an early contact between Armenian and [[Anatolian languages]], based on what he considered common archaisms, such as the lack of a feminine and the absence of inherited long vowels. But, unlike shared innovations (or ''[[synapomorphies]]'') the common retention of archaisms (or ''[[symplesiomorphy]]'') is not necessarily considered evidence of a period of common isolated development. (For example, the fact that birds and turtles have scales is not evidence of any special closeness, some mammals retain scales too, and scales date back to our common ancestors, the fish.)

In his paper, &quot;Hurro-Urartian Borrowings in Old Armenian&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 105.4 (1985) [http://azargoshnasp.net/history/Hurrian/diaokonoff_hurro_armenian_borrowing.pdf text]&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet linguist [[Igor Mikhailovich Diakonov]] notes the presence in [[Grabar|Old Armenian]] of what he calls a [[Caucasian language|Caucasian substratum]], identified by earlier scholars, consisting of loans from the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] and [[Northeast Caucasian languages]] such as [[Udi language|Udi]]. Noting that the [[Hurro-Urartian]] peoples inhabited the Armenian homeland in the second millennium BC, Diakonov identifies in Armenian a Hurro-Urartian substratum of social, cultural, and zoological and biological terms such as ''[[wikt:աղախին|ałaxin]]'' ('slavegirl') and ''[[wikt:խնձոր|xnjor]]'' ('apple(tree)'). Some of the terms he gives admittedly have an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] or [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] provenance, but he suggests they were borrowed through Hurrian or Urartu. Given that these borrowings do not undergo [[sound change]]s characteristic of the development of Armenian from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], he dates their borrowing to a time before the written record but after the [[Proto-Armenian language]] stage.

===Graeco-Armenian hypothesis===
{{Main|Graeco-Armenian hypothesis}}

The hypothesis that Greek is Armenian's closest living relative originates with [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Pedersen]] (1924), who noted that the number of Greek-Armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between Armenian and any other Indo-European language. [[Antoine Meillet|Meillet]] (1925, 1927) further investigated morphological and phonological agreement, postulating that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the [[PIE|parent language]]. Meillet's hypothesis became popular in the wake of his ''Esquisse'' (1936). Solta (1960) does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage, but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology, Greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to Armenian. Hamp (1976:91) supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis, anticipating even a time &quot;when we should speak of Helleno-Armenian&quot; (meaning the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language). Armenian shares the [[Augment (linguistics)|augment]], a negator derived from the set phrase ''*ne hoiu kwid'' (&quot;not ever at all&quot;), the representation of word-initial [[laryngeals]] by prothetic vowels, and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with Greek. The closeness of the relationship between Armenian and Greek sheds light on the [[paraphyletic]] nature of the [[Centum-Satem isogloss]]. Nevertheless, linguists including Fortson (2004) comment &quot;by the time we reach our earliest Armenian records in the 5th century A.D., the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to a few tantalizing pieces.&quot;

==Evolution==
Early in the fifth century, [[Classical Armenian]], or Grabar, was one of the great languages of the Near East and Asia Minor. Although an autonomous branch within the Indo-European family of languages, it had some affinities to Middle Iranian, Greek and the Balto-Slavic languages, but belonged to none of them. It was characterized by a system of inflection unlike the other languages, as well as a flexible and liberal use of combining root words to create derivative and compound words by the application of certain agglutinative affixes.

The classical language imported numerous words from Middle Iranian languages, primarily [[Parthian language|Parthian]], and contains smaller inventories of borrowings from Greek, Syriac, Latin, and [[Autochthonic language|autochthonous languages]] such as [[Urartian language|Urartian]]. Middle Armenian (11th–15th centuries AD) incorporated further loans from Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Latin, and the modern dialects took in hundreds of additional words from Modern Turkish and Persian. Therefore, determining the historical evolution of Armenian is particularly difficult because Armenian borrowed many words from [[Parthian language|Parthian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] (both [[Iranian language]]s) as well as from Greek.

In the period that followed the invention of the alphabet and up to the threshold of the modern era, Grabar (Classical Armenian) lived on. An effort to modernize the language in [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] (11-14th centuries) resulted in the addition of two more characters to the alphabet, bringing the total number to 38.

The Book of Lamentations by [[Gregory of Narek]] (951-1003), that could be considered a masterpiece of world literature, is perhaps a good example of the development of a literature and writing style that came to be known as Middle Armenian or Vernacular. In addition to elevating the literary style of the Armenian language, Gregory of Nareg paved the way for his successors to include secular themes in their writings. The thematic shift from mainly religious texts to writings with secular outlooks further enhanced and enriched the vocabulary. “A Word of Wisdom,” a poem by Hovhannes Sargavak devoted to a starling, legitimizes poetry devoted to nature, love or female beauty. Gradually, the interests of the “vulgar population” were also reflected in other literary works. Konsdantin Yerzinkatsi and several others even take the unusual step of criticizing the ecclesiastic establishment and addressing the social issues of the Armenian homeland. Not surprisingly, these changes altered the nature of the literary style and syntax but they did not constitute radical changes to the fundamentals of the grammar or the morphology of the language.

The [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828 once again divided the traditional Armenian homeland. This time, two thirds of historical Armenia fell under Ottoman control, while the remaining territories were divided between the Russian and Persian empires. The antagonistic relationship between the Russian and Ottoman Empires led to creation of two separate and different environments under which Armenians lived and suffered. Halfway through the 19th century, two important concentrations of Armenian communities were constituted.

Because of persecutions or the search for better economic opportunities, many Armenians living under Ottoman rule gradually moved to [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]], while Tiflis (Tbilisi), in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], became the center of Armenians living under Russian rule. These two cosmopolitan cities very soon became the primary poles of Armenian intellectual and cultural life.

The introduction of new literary forms and styles, as well as many new ideas sweeping Europe reached Armenians living in both regions. This created an ever-growing need to elevate the vulgar language, Ašxarhabar, to the dignity of a modern literary language, in contrast to the now-anachronistic Grabar. Numerous dialects developed in the traditional Armenian regions, which, different as they were, had certain morphological and phonetic features in common. On the basis of these features two major variants emerged:
* Western Variant: The influx of immigrants from different parts of the traditional Armenian homeland to Constantinople crystallized the common elements of the regional dialects, paving the way to a style of writing that required a shorter and more flexible learning curve than Grabar.
* Eastern Variant: The dialect of the Ararat plateau provided the primary elements of Eastern Armenian, centered in Tiflis ([[Tbilisi]], Georgia). Similar to the Western Armenian variant, the Modern Eastern was in many ways more practical and accessible to the masses than Grabar.

Both centers vigorously pursued the promotion of Ašxarhabar. The proliferation of newspapers in both versions (Eastern &amp; Western) and the development of a network of schools where modern Armenian was taught, dramatically increased the rate of literacy (in spite of the obstacles by the colonial administrators), even in remote rural areas. The emergence of literary works entirely written in the modern versions increasingly legitimized the language’s existence. By the turn of the 20th century both varieties of the one modern Armenian language prevailed over Grabar and opened the path to a new and simplified grammatical structure of the language in the two different cultural spheres. Apart from minor morphological, phonetic and grammatical differences, the largely common vocabulary and identical rules of grammatical fundamentals allows users of one variant to understand the other easily.

After the [[First World War]], the existence of the two modern versions of the same language was sanctioned even more clearly. The [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (1920–1990) used Eastern Armenian as its official language, while the Diaspora created after the Genocide of 1915 carried with it the only thing survivors still possessed: its mother tongue, Western Armenian.

===Modern changes===
The two modern literary dialects, Western (originally associated with writers in the Ottoman Empire) and Eastern (originally associated with writers in the Russian Empire), removed almost all of their Turkish lexical influences in the 20th century, primarily following the [[Armenian Genocide]].

==Phonology==
[[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] voiceless stops are aspirated in [[Proto-Armenian]], one of the circumstances that is often linked to the [[Glottalic theory]], part of which postulated that the voiceless stops of Proto-Indo-European were aspirated.&lt;ref&gt;James Clackson, ''Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (2007, Cambridge)&lt;br&gt;Robert S.P. Beekes, ''Comparative Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (1995, John Benjamins)&lt;br&gt;Oswald J.L. Szemerényi, ''Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics'' (1996, Oxford)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress===
In Armenian the stress ''always'' falls on the last syllable, unless the last syllable contains {{IPA|[ə]}}, in which case it falls on the penultimate one. For instance, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[wikt:ախորժակ|ɑχoɾˈʒɑk]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[wikt:մաղադանոս|mɑʁɑdɑˈnos]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[wikt:գինի|giˈni]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[wikt:Վահագն|vɑˈhɑgən]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[wikt:դաշտը|ˈdɑʃtə]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

===Vowels===
{{Armenians}}
Modern Armenian has six monophthong vowel sounds.

===Consonants===
The following table lists the Eastern Armenian consonantal system. The [[stop consonant|occlusives]] and [[affricate]]s have a special aspirated series (transcribed with a Greek ''[[spiritus asper]]'' after the letter): ''{{unicode|p῾}}'', ''{{unicode|t῾}}'', ''{{unicode|c῾}}'', ''{{unicode|č῾}}'', ''{{unicode|k῾}}''. Each phoneme in the table is represented by three symbols. The topmost indicates the phoneme's pronunciation in the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA); below that appears the corresponding letter of the [[Armenian alphabet]]; and the bottom symbol is its [[Latin alphabet|Latin-alphabet]] [[transliteration]] (according to [[ISO 9985]]).

==Morphology==
[[File:Manuscript arm 5-6AD.jpg|right|thumb|Armenian manuscript, circa 5th-6th century.]]
Armenian corresponds with other Indo-European languages in its structure, but it shares distinctive sounds and features of its grammar with neighboring languages of the [[Caucasus]] region. Armenian is rich in combinations of consonants. Both classical Armenian and the modern spoken and literary dialects have a complicated system of declining nouns, with six or seven noun cases but no gender. In modern Armenian the use of auxiliary verbs to show tense (comparable to will in &quot;he will go&quot;) has generally supplemented the inflected verbs of [[Classical Armenian]]. Negative verbs are conjugated differently from positive ones (as in English &quot;he goes&quot; and &quot;he does not go&quot;). Grammatically, early forms of Armenian had much in common with classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], but the modern language, like modern Greek, has undergone many transformations. With time the Armenian language made a transition from a synthetic language (Old Armenian or [[Grabar]]) to a typical analytic language (Modern Armenian) with Middle Armenian as a midpoint in this transition.

===Noun===
Classical Armenian has no [[grammatical gender]], not even in the pronoun. The nominal inflection, however, preserves several types of inherited stem classes. The noun may take seven cases, [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[locative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[ablative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]].

===Verb===
{{Main|Armenian verbs}}

Verbs in Armenian have an expansive system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] with two main verb types (three in Western Armenian) changing form based on [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].

==Dialects==
The major division is between the Eastern and Western dialects. The most distinctive feature of Western Armenian is that it has undergone several phonetic mergers; these may be due to proximity to Arabic and Turkish-speaking communities.

For example, Eastern Armenian speakers pronounce ({{lang|hy|թ}}) as an aspirated &quot;t&quot; as in &quot;tiger&quot;, ({{lang|hy|դ}}) like the &quot;d&quot; in &quot;develop&quot;, and ({{lang|hy|տ}}) as an unaspirated voiceless stop, sounding somewhere between the two as in &quot;s'''t'''op.&quot; Western Armenian has simplified the stop system into a simple division between voiced stops and voiceless aspirate ones; the first series corresponds to the unaspirated voiceless series of Eastern Armenian, and the second corresponds to the Eastern voiced and aspirated voiceless series. Thus, the Western dialect pronounces both ({{lang|hy|թ}}) and ({{lang|hy|դ}}) as an aspirated &quot;t&quot; as in &quot;tiger,&quot; and the ({{lang|hy|տ}}) letter is pronounced like the letter &quot;d&quot; as in &quot;develop.&quot;

There is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a dialect transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically identified dialects.

Armenian can be subdivided in two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into individual dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have died due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide. In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. While Western and Eastern Armenian are often described as different dialects of the same language, some subdialects are not readily mutually intelligible. It is true, however, that a fluent speaker of one of two greatly varying dialects who is exposed to the other dialect over even a short period of time will be able to understand the other with relative ease{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

===Standardized forms===
Armenian is a [[pluricentric language]], having two [[Standard language|standardized]] forms: [[Eastern Armenian]] and [[Western Armenian]].

===Historical Armenian dialects===
In 1909, linguist [[Hrachia Acharian]] in his &quot;Classification des dialects arméniens&quot; (&quot;Classification of Armenian dialects&quot;) surveyed many of the Armenian dialects in what is now present day [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]] and other surrounding countries settled by [[Armenians]]. Unlike the traditional dialect division of Armenian into western and eastern dialects, [[Hrachia Acharian|Acharian]] divided Armenian into three main dialects based on which indicative particles are used. He labeled them as the -owm dialects, gë dialects, and -el dialects. These three major dialects were further divided into sub-dialects.

==Indo-European linguistic comparison==
Armenian is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], and so many of its [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]-descended words are [[cognate]]s of words in other Indo-European languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Sanskrit]]. This table lists only some of the more recognizable cognates that Armenian shares with English (more specifically, with English words descended from the [[Old English language|Old English(Anglo-Saxon) language]]).

'''Additive synthesis''' is a technique of [[sound synthesis]] that creates [[music]]al [[timbre]] by explicitly adding [[sinusoid]]al [[overtones]] together.

The timbre of an instrument is composed of multiple [[harmonic]] or inharmonic [[harmonic series (music)|''partials'']] (individual [[sine function|sine]] waves), of different frequencies and amplitudes, that change over time. Additive synthesis allows the emulation of a given tone or sound by giving control over the frequency and amplitude of each individual harmonic or partial.  In general, each harmonic generator has its own customizable [[amplitude]] [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[instantaneous frequency]] function, creating a realistic, dynamic sound that changes over time.

==Theory==
The concept behind additive synthesis is directly related to work done by the French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]].  Fourier discovered that periodic functions are formed by the summation of an infinite series of [[sinusoidal]] functions, called [[Fourier series]].  Following this, it was established that all periodic signals, when represented as a mathematical function, can be composed as a sum of sinusoidal functions (&amp;nbsp;sin(''x''),&amp;nbsp;cos(''x'')&amp;nbsp;) of various frequencies.  More rigorously, any periodic sound in the [[discrete time]] domain can be synthesized as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \frac{1}{2} a_0[n] + \sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k[n] \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi k f_0}{F_\mathrm{s}} n \right)-b_k[n] \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi k f_0}{F_\mathrm{s}} n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \frac{1}{2} a_0[n] + \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi k f_0}{F_\mathrm{s}} n + \phi_k[n] \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''y''[''n''] is the output sample at discrete time ''n'',
: ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] = ''r&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] cos(''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''])
: ''b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] = ''r&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] sin(''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''])
: ''r&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] is the [[amplitude]] [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the ''k''-th harmonic at discrete time ''n'',
: ''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] is the [[instantaneous phase]] function of the ''k''-th harmonic at discrete time ''n'',
: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[sampling frequency]],
: ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the waveform or the [[Piano key frequencies|note frequency]],
: ''k'' ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the frequency of the ''k''-th harmonic,
: ''K'' &lt; [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]](''F''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/(2 ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)) is the number of harmonics,
: ''K'' ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the frequency of the highest harmonic and below the [[Nyquist frequency]], ''F''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/2.

The [[direct current|DC]] term is generally undesirable in audio synthesis, so the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; term can be removed.  Introducing time varying coefficients ''r&lt;sub&gt;k''&lt;/sub&gt;[''n''] allows for the dynamic use of envelopes to modulate oscillators creating a &quot;[[Almost periodic function#Quasiperiodic signals in audio and music synthesis|quasi-periodic]]&quot; waveform (one that is periodic over the short term but changes its waveform shape over the longer term).

Additive synthesis can also create non-[[harmonic]] sounds (which have non-periodic waveforms) if the individual harmonics do not all have a frequency that is an integer multiple of the [[fundamental frequency]].  By replacing the ''k''-th harmonic frequency, ''k f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with time-varying and general (not necessarily harmonic) frequencies, ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''], (the [[instantaneous frequency]] of the ''k''-th partial at the time of sample ''n'') the definition of the synthesized output would be, (also eliminating the DC term):

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k[n] \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi}{F_\mathrm{s}} \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_k[i] \right) - b_k[n] \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi}{F_\mathrm{s}} \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_k[i] \right)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi}{F_\mathrm{s}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_k[i] + \phi_k[n] \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a_k[n] = r_k[n] \cos \left( \phi_k[n] \right) \quad b_k[n] = r_k[n] \sin \left( \phi_k[n] \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] = ''k f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with constant ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, all partials are harmonic, the synthesized waveform is quasi-periodic, and the more general equations above reduce to the simpler equations at the top.  For each non-harmonic partial, the phase term ''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] can be absorbed into the instantaneous frequency term, ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] by the substitution:

:&lt;math&gt;f_k[n] \leftarrow f_k[n] + \frac{F_\mathrm{s}}{2 \pi}\left( \phi_k[n]-\phi_k[n-1] \right)&lt;/math&gt;

If that substitution is made, all of the ''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''[''n''] phase terms can be set to zero with no loss of generality (retaining the initial phase value at ''y''[0]) and the expressions of non-harmonic additive synthesis can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi}{F_\mathrm{s}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_k[i] + \phi_k[0] \right)&lt;/math&gt; .

If this constant phase term (at time ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_k[0] = \frac{2 \pi}{F_\mathrm{s}}\sum_{i=-\infty}^{0}f_k[i],&lt;/math&gt;

the general expression of additive synthesis can be further simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi}{F_\mathrm{s}}\sum_{i=-\infty}^{n}f_k[i] \right) =  \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left( \theta_k[n] \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt; \theta_k[n] = \theta_k[n-1] + \frac{2 \pi}{F_\mathrm{s}} f_k[n]\quad\text{for all }n. &lt;/math&gt;

==Implementations==
[[Image:Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church pipe organ.jpg|thumb|upright|Pipe organ in [[Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church]]]]
{{POV-check-section|date=September 2010}}

=== Pipe organs ===
{{main|Pipe organ}}
Certain organ pipes, which create nearly sinusoidal/triangle waves (mostly flute pipes), can be combined in the manner of additive synthesis: it's the classical organ plenum practice. However, pipes which generate other types of wave forms (for example square wave generating clarinet stops) are not suited to this purpose: they are used more as solo stops.

=== Electronic organs ===
[[Image:Hammond b3 con leslie 122.jpg|thumb|upright|Hammond B3]]

The [[Hammond organ]] uses nine drawbars to mix several harmonics, which are generated by a set of [[tonewheel]]s.  It was invented in 1934&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a substitute for the much bulkier and expensive pipe organ.

=== Additive synthesizers ===
====Early experimental models====
One of the first product in this category may be the [[Rocky Mount Instruments|RMI]] Harmonic synthesizer, a very rare monophonic synthesizer utilizing static additive synthesis implementation: it had two digital harmonic oscillators with 16 harmonics, but each amplitudes of harmonics couldn't be changed in real time by envelope generators or sliders.&lt;ref name=&quot;synthemuseum-RMI&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cn-span|It was not a real additive synth|date=March 2011}}: one can construct a patch defining 16 partials per voice&lt;ref name=&quot;risberg1980digital&quot;/&gt; (as in the [[Casio FZ-1]], [[Korg DSS-1]], and [[Kawai K3]]) and apply dynamic enveloping, and FM operator with envelope, only with the partial timbre.  With Synclavier software upgrade one can specify several harmonic spectrums and crossfade between them in time.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} &lt;br/&gt;
Note that Synclavier's FM re-synthesis feature with fine grain time slice is sometimes considered as equivalent to [[Wavetable synthesis]], and Wavetable synthesis under some conditions is equivalent to real-time additive synthesis. ''(&amp;rArr; See section [[#Wavetable synthesis|Wavetable synthesis]])''

;DK Synergy:
{{main|Larry Fast}}
The DK Synergy (released in 1982), a descendant of [[Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer|Alles Machine]], is a user definable PM (as FM) semi algorithmic with additive capabilities, 32 digital oscillators synth.&lt;ref name=&quot;synthony&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 |title    = Digital Keyboards Synergy Preservation Page 
 |url      = http://users.ece.gatech.edu/lanterma/synergy/ 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that you could use it as a 16 partials two voice polyphony fully additive synth (with limited timbrical results) or the most usual way: complex 8 voice polyphony Yamaha FM style synthesis. One can think of it as a much more flexible algorithm, envelope (for frequency and amplitude for each oscillator) and filter equalization DX7 style synth. In fact, one can came very close to the original patches using a soft synth as FM7: you cannot do the best patches (as [[Wendy Carlos]]'s collection) on a DX7 because of the limited envelopes and operator output fixed curves, not to consider the somewhat &quot;metallic&quot; quality of sound that all the DXs have. In comparison, the Synergy is really warm.

;Seiko Digital Sound System
In 1984, [[Seiko]] introduced its &quot;Digital Sound System&quot; line of keyboard instruments, which utilized a 16-operator additive synthesis engine. Although the keyboards (the DS-101, DS-202, and DS-250) were not directly programmable, a separate programming device was available that allowed the user to create new presets.&lt;ref name=&quot;seiko&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Additive resynthesis==
As demonstrated by software such as [http://www.klingbeil.com/spear/ SPEAR], it is possible to analyse the frequency components of a recorded sound and then resynthesize a representation of the sound using additive techniques. By calculating the frequency and amplitude weighting of discrete partials in the frequency domain (typically using a [[fast Fourier transform]]), an additive resynthesis system can construct an equally weighted sinusoid at the same frequency for each partial.

Because the sound is represented by a bank of oscillators inside the system, a user can make adjustments to the frequency and amplitude of any set of partials. The sound can be 'reshaped' – by alterations made to timbre or the overall amplitude envelope, for example. A harmonic sound could be restructured to sound inharmonic, and vice versa.

An '''aircraft carrier''' is a [[warship]] designed with a primary mission of deploying and recovering [[aircraft]], acting as a seagoing [[airbase]]. Aircraft carriers thus allow a [[navy|naval force]] to project [[air power]] worldwide without having to depend on local bases for staging aircraft operations. They have evolved from wooden vessels, used to deploy [[balloon]]s, into [[Nuclear propulsion|nuclear-powered]] warships that carry dozens of [[fixed wing|fixed-]] and [[rotary-wing]] aircraft.

==History==
{{Main|History of the aircraft carrier}}
[[File:Wakamiya.jpg|thumb|The Japanese seaplane carrier [[Japanese seaplane carrier Wakamiya|''Wakamiya'']] conducted the world's first naval-launched air raids in 1914.]]

The [[Wright brothers|1903 advent]] of heavier-than-air, fixed-wing aircraft was closely followed in 1910 by the first experimental take-off of such an airplane from the deck of a [[US Navy]] vessel (cruiser {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|6}}), and the first experimental landings in 1911. [[Seaplane tender]] support ships came next; in September 1914, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[Japanese seaplane carrier Wakamiya|''Wakamiya'']] conducted the world's first successful naval-launched air raids.&lt;ref&gt;Wakamiya is &quot;credited with conducting the first successful carrier air raid in history&quot;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/index.html Source:GlobalSecurity.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sabre et pinceau&quot;, Christian Polak, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It lowered four [[Maurice Farman]] seaplanes into the water using its crane, which were taking off to bombard German forces and could be retrieved back from surface afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/wakamiya-av.htm IJN Wakamiya Aircraft Carrier]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of flat top vessels produced the first large fleet ships. In 1918, [[HMS Argus (I49)|HMS Argus]] became &quot;the world's first carrier capable of launching and landing naval aircraft&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Till, &quot;Adopting the Aircraft Carrier: The British, Japanese, and American Case Studies&quot; in {{cite book |title= Military Innovation in the Interwar Period|edition=|editor1-first= Williamson|editor1-last= Murray|editor2-first= Allan R|editor2-last= Millet |year= 1996|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 0-521-63760-0|page= 194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier evolution was well underway in the mid-1920s, resulting in ships such as {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō|Hōshō]]''.  Most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships.  The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 affected aircraft carrier plans. The US and UK were permitted up to 135,000 tons of carriers each while specific exemptions on the upper tonnage of individual ships permitted conversion of capital ship hulls to carriers such as the {{Sclass|Lexington|aircraft carrier|1}}s.

During the 1920s, several navies started ordering and building aircraft carriers that were specifically designed as such. This allowed the design to be specialized to their future role, and resulted in superior ships. During the Second World War, these ships would become the backbone of the carrier forces of the US, British, and Japanese navies, known as [[fleet carrier]]s. 

[[World War II]] saw the first large-scale use and further refinement of the aircraft carrier, spawning several types. [[Escort aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}}, were built only during World War II. Although some were purpose-built, most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. [[Light aircraft carrier]]s, such as {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|6}}, represented a larger, more &quot;militarized&quot; version of the escort carrier concept. Although the light carriers usually carried the same size [[air group]]s as escort carriers, they had the advantage of higher speed as they had been converted from cruisers under construction.

Wartime [[Emergency|emergencies]] also saw the creation or conversion of unconventional aircraft carriers. [[CAM ship]]s, like {{SS|Michael E}}, were cargo-carrying merchant ships which could launch but not retrieve fighter aircraft from a catapult. These vessels were an emergency measure during World War II as were [[Merchant aircraft carrier]]s (MACs), such as {{MV|Empire MacAlpine}}, another emergency measure which saw cargo-carrying merchant ships equipped with flight decks. Battle carriers were created by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] to partially compensate for the loss of carrier strength at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Two of them were made from {{Sclass|Ise|battleship}}s during late 1943. The aft turrets were removed and replaced with a hangar, deck and catapult. The heavy cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Mogami (1934)|''Mogami'']] concurrently received a similar conversion. This &quot;half and half&quot; design was an unsuccessful compromise, being neither one thing nor the other. [[Submarine aircraft carrier]]s, such as the French [[French submarine Surcouf|''Surcouf'']] and the Japanese [[I-400 class submarine]], which was capable of carrying three [[Aichi]] [[Aichi M6A|M6A ''Seiran'']] aircraft, were first built in the 1920s, but were generally unsuccessful at war.

[[File:USS Tripoli LPH10 a.jpg|thumb|The ''Tripoli'', a US Navy ''Iwo Jima''-class helicopter carrier]]

Modern navies that operate such ships treat aircraft carriers as the [[capital ship]] of the fleet, a role previously played by the [[battleship]]. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant factor in warfare, took place during World War II. This change was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. Following the war, carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance.  [[Supercarrier]]s, the latest aircraft carriers, typically displacing 75,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes or greater, have become the pinnacle of carrier development. Most are powered by [[nuclear reactor]]s and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. Amphibious assault ships, such as {{USS|Tarawa|LHA-1|6}} and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines, and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. Also known as &quot;commando carriers&quot; or &quot;helicopter carriers&quot;, many have a secondary capability to operate [[VSTOL]] aircraft.

Lacking the firepower of other warships, carriers by themselves are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines, or missiles. Therefore, aircraft carriers are generally accompanied by a number of other ships, to provide protection for the relatively unwieldy carrier, to carry supplies, and to provide additional offensive capabilities. This is often termed a battle group or carrier group, sometimes a [[carrier battle group]].

Before World War II international naval treaties of [[Washington Naval Treaty|1922]], [[London Naval Treaty|1930]] and [[Second London Naval Treaty|1936]] limited the size of capital ships including carriers. Aircraft carrier designs since World War II have been effectively unlimited by any consideration save budgetary, and the ships have increased in size to handle the larger aircraft. The large, modern {{Sclass|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|4}} of United States Navy carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II–era {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same—a consequence of the steadily increasing size and weight of military aircraft over the years.

==Modern significance==
Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that many countries risk significant political and economic, as well as military, ramifications if they were ever to lose one during any kind of operation.  Also, observers have opined that modern anti-ship weapons systems, such as torpedoes and missiles, have made aircraft carriers obsolete as too vulnerable for modern combat.  Countries appear, however, willing to take the risks in building and fielding aircraft carriers because of the geo-political and military prestige they give by being able to project power at some distance from their national land boundaries.  Furthermore, aircraft carriers facilitate quicker projections of military power into local and regional conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Lekic, Slobodan, [[Associated Press]], &quot;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eu_aircraft_carrier_boom Aircraft carriers gain clout in naval power]&quot;, ''[[Yahoo!

===By role===
A fleet carrier is intended to operate with the main fleet and usually provides an offensive capability. These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison [[escort carrier]]s were developed to provide defence for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, in the case of [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. [[Light aircraft carrier]]s were carriers that were fast enough to operate with the fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity.

There are three main configurations of aircraft carrier in service in the world's navies:

* Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery ([[STOBAR]])
* Short Take-Off Vertical Landing ([[STOVL]])

===By size===

==Flight deck==
{{Main|Flight deck}}
[[File:DeHavilland Vampire HMS Ocean Dec1945 NAN1 47.jpg|thumb|The first carrier landing and take-off of a jet aircraft: [[Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown]] landing on {{HMS|Ocean|R68}} in 1945.]]

As &quot;runways at sea,&quot; modern aircraft carriers have a flat-top deck design that serves as a [[flight deck]] for the [[Takeoff|launch]] and [[landing|recovery]] of aircraft. Aircraft are launched in a forward direction, into the wind, and recover from astern. Carriers steam at speed, for example up to {{nowrap|35 [[knot (nautical)|knots]]}} ({{nowrap|65&amp;nbsp;km/h}}), into the wind during flight deck operations in order to increase the wind over the deck to exceed a safe minimum.  This increase in effective wind speed provides a higher launch airspeed for aircraft at the end of the catapult stroke or ski-jump, plus it makes recovery safer by reducing the difference between the relative speeds of the aircraft and ship.  

On conventional carriers, a steam-powered [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] is used to accelerate the aircraft to a safe flying speed by the end of the catapult stoke after which the aircraft is airborn and further propulsion is provided by its own engines. On other modern carriers, aircraft do not require catapult assistance for take off, instead an upwards vector is provided by a ski-jump at the forward end of the flight deck.  Which form of assistance provided is dependent on aircraft design and performance and is part of the overall design of the carrier and aircraft as a system.

[[File:F-18 - A 3-wire landing.ogv|thumb|F/A-18 landing video]]

Conversely, when recovering onto a carrier, conventional aircraft rely upon a [[tailhook]] that catches on [[arrestor wires]] stretched across the deck to bring them to a stop in a short distance. [[Helicopter]]s and [[V/STOL]] (Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing) aircraft usually recover by coming abreast the carrier on the port side and then using their hover capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for arresting gear.

Conventional (&quot;tailhook&quot;) aircraft rely upon a [[landing signal officer]] (LSO, sometimes called &quot;paddles&quot;) to monitor the plane's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as [[Optical Landing System|optical landing system]] have provided information on proper [[glide slope]], but LSOs still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio.

[[File:USS Harry S Truman (CVN-75) Flight Deck.JPG|thumb|left||[[F/A-18 Hornet]]s on the [[flight deck]] of the [[Nimitz class carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] [[supercarrier]] {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75|2}} ]]

To facilitate working on the flight deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the sailors wear colored shirts that designate their responsibilities. There are at least seven different colors worn by flight deck personnel for [[modern United States Navy carrier air operations]].  Carrier operations of other nations use similar color schemes.  

Key personnel involved in the flight deck include the Shooters, the Handler, and the Air Boss. Shooters are [[naval aviator]]s or [[Naval Flight Officer]]s and are responsible for launching aircraft. The Handler works just inside the island from the flight deck and is responsible for the movement of aircraft before launching and after recovery. The Air Boss (usually a [[commander]]) occupies the top bridge (Primary Flight Control, also called &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;the tower&quot;) and has the overall responsibility for controlling launch, recovery and &quot;those aircraft in the air near the ship, and the movement of planes on the flight deck, which itself resembles a well-choreographed ballet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/powerhouse/powerhouse.asp |title= The US Navy Aircraft Carriers |publisher=Navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captain of the ship spends most of his time one level below Primary on the Navigation Bridge. Below this is the Flag Bridge, designated for the embarked admiral and his staff.

[[File:DN-SD-07-00030.jpg|thumb|Ripples appear along the fuselage of a U.S. Navy [[E-2C Hawkeye]] due to loads from landing on the {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75}}.]]

Since the early 1950s on conventional carriers it has been the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this &quot;angled deck&quot; is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a [[Bolter (aviation)|bolter]], to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The angled deck also allows simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.

The superstructure of a carrier (such as the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], flight [[control tower]]) are concentrated to the [[starboard]] side of the deck in a relatively small area called an &quot;island&quot;, a feature pioneered on the [[HMS Hermes (95)|HMS ''Hermes'']] in 1923. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island and such a configuration has not been seen in a fleet-sized carrier. The &quot;flush deck&quot; configuration proved to have very significant drawbacks, complicating navigation, air traffic control and had numerous other adverse factors.

[[File:FRS.1 ski-jump take-off HMS Invincible.JPEG|thumb|left|Ski-jump on Royal Navy carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05}}]]

A more recent configuration, originally developed by the Royal Navy but since adopted by many navies for smaller carriers, has a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch [[VTOL]] (or [[STOVL]]) aircraft (aircraft that are able to take off and land with little or no forward movement), such as the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]].  Although these aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from the deck, using the ramp is more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight. As catapults and arrestor cables are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for equipment. Russian and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching conventional aircraft.  

The disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range): large, slow planes such as the [[E-2 Hawkeye]] and heavily laden strike fighters like the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] and [[Sukhoi Su-33]] cannot successfully launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or catapult assistance, although the Su-33 does launch with a light fuel and weapons load from a ski jump.

Aircraft carriers are generally the largest ships operated by navies.  A total of 22 aircraft carriers in active service are maintained by nine navies. In addition, the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] possesses the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft carrier [[Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|''Varyag'']]. Australia, Brazil, France, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain,  United Kingdom, United States and the People's Republic of China also operate vessels capable of carrying and operating multiple helicopters.

==Future aircraft carriers==
{{See also|List of aircraft carriers by country}}

Several nations which currently possess aircraft carriers are in the process of planning new classes to replace current ones. The world's navies still generally see the aircraft carrier as the main future capital ship, with developments such as the [[arsenal ship]], which have been promoted as an alternative, seen as too limited in terms of flexibility.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===China===
[[File:USNWC Varyag02.jpg|thumb|''Varyag'' under tow in Istanbul]]

China bought the unfinished Soviet aircraft carrier [[Soviet aircraft carrier Varyag|''Varyag'']] in 2001 from [[Ukraine]], supposedly to turn it into a floating casino. Pictures taken while in port suggest this plan has been abandoned and show that work is being carried out to maintain its military function. There is no conclusive evidence as to what role it would play in the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Chinese Navy]].

In late December 2008 and early January 2009, there were multiple reports of China building [[Future Chinese aircraft carrier|two conventionally powered aircraft carriers]] displacing 50,000–60,000 tonnes, possibly to be launched in 2015. In December 2010 China's [[State Oceanic Administration]] announced that this vessel would be finished one year earlier, in 2014. A nuclear powered carrier is planned for launch around 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Minemura, Kenji |url = http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201012160435.html |title = Beijing admits it is building an aircraft carrier |work= [[Asahi Shimbun]] |date= December 17, 2010 |accessdate= December 17, 2010 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5v35O99uQ |archivedate= December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to James Nolt, senior fellow at the World Policy Institute in New York, it might take China many years to develop the technology, training, and operational capability necessary for an effective carrier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2010/china-100921-voa01.htm China Working to Counter US Naval Power in the Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The [[French Navy]] has set in motion possible plans for a [[Future French aircraft carrier|second CTOL aircraft carrier]], to supplement [[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']]. The design would be much larger, in the range of 65–74,000 tonnes, and would not be nuclear-powered like ''Charles de Gaulle''. There are plans to base the carrier on the current [[Royal Navy CVF programme|Royal Navy design]] for [[CATOBAR]] operations. (The [[Thales Group|Thales]]/[[BAE Systems]] design for the Royal Navy is for a STOVL carrier which is reconfigurable to CATOBAR operations.)

On 21 June 2008, French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] decided to place France's participation in the project on hold. He stated that a final decision on the future of the French carrier would be taken in 2011 or 2012. British plans for two aircraft carriers will go ahead as planned and were in no way conditional on French participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article4183255.ece |title=President Sarkozy ditches Franco-British carrier project |publisher=Business.timesonline.co.uk |date= 2008-06-21|accessdate=2009-01-30 | location=London | first=Adam | last=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[File:INS Vikramaditya cg.png|thumb|Impression of the [[INS Vikramaditya|INS ''Vikramaditya'']], which is under refit for the [[Indian Navy]].]]

India started the construction of a 40,000-tonne, 260-metre-long [[Vikrant class aircraft carrier|''Vikrant''-class]] aircraft carrier in April 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;iac&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Aircraft Carrier (Project-71) |work=Indian Navy [Bharatiya Nau Sena] |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Ships/Future/185-Indian-Aircraft-Carrier.html |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new carrier will cost US$762 million and will operate [[MiG-29K]], Naval [[HAL Tejas]] and Sea Harrier aircraft along with the Indian-made helicopter [[HAL Dhruv]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iac&quot;/&gt; The ship will be powered by four turbine engines and will have a range of 8,000&amp;nbsp;nautical miles (14,000&amp;nbsp;km), carrying 160 officers, 1,400 sailors, and 30 aircraft. The carrier is being constructed by a state-run shipyard in Cochin.&lt;ref name=&quot;iac&quot;/&gt; The ship is scheduled for commissioning in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;indiatoday.intoday.in&quot;&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/73256/Top%20Stories/First+indigenous+aircraft+carrier+to+be+launched+next+year:+Navy+chief.html First indigenous aircraft carrier to be launched next year: Navy chief: LATEST HEADLINES : India Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2009, Navy chief Admiral Nirmal Verma said at his maiden navy week press conference that concepts currently being examined by the Directorate of Naval Design for the second indigenous aircraft carrier, the IAC-2, are for a conventionally powered carrier displacing over 50,000 tons and equipped with steam catapults (rather than the ski-jump on the Gorshkov/Vikramaditya and the IAC) to launch fourth-generation aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;indiatoday.intoday.in&quot;/&gt;

In 2004, India agreed to buy the [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|''Admiral Gorshkov'']] from Russia for US$1.5 billion. It is named [[INS Vikramaditya|INS ''Vikramaditya'']],&lt;ref name=&quot;rss&quot;&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081113/118299115.html Russian aircraft carrier ready in 2012 if India pays $2 bln more]&lt;/ref&gt; and was expected to join the [[Indian Navy]] in 2008 after a refit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/12/content_433517.htm |title=Article on India's indigenously built aircraft carrier |publisher=.chinadaily.com.cn |date=2005-04-12 |accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, delays in the refit were announced in July 2007, and the carrier will now be ready by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080603/109132065.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Russia increased the total price to US$3.4 billion because of unexpected cost overruns due to the deteriorated condition of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;rss&quot;/&gt; In December 2008, India decided in favour of purchasing ''Admiral Gorshkov'' as the best option available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gorshkov-medvedev-on-his-way-centre-okays-price-renegotiation/393524/ Gorshkov: Medvedev on his way, Centre okays price renegotiation]&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2009, Russia asked for an additional $700 million over the originally contracted price for the completion of the reconstruction of the ''Admiral Gorshkov'', bringing the total requested price to $2.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/navy/Indian_Navy_Stunned_By_Latest_Russian_Demand_For_Gorschkov120017208.php {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 8 December 2009, it was reported that India and Russia ended the stalemate over Gorshkov price deal by agreeing on a price of US$2.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-Russia-end-stalemate-over-Gorshkov-price-deal/articleshow/5314150.cms India, Russia end stalemate over Gorshkov price deal - The Times of India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/usd-2.2billion/551431/ India, Russia end stalemate over Gorshkov's price deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
[[Russian Navy]] Commander-in-Chief [[Admiral]] [[Vladimir Masorin]] officially stated on June 23, 2007, that the Navy was considering the specifications of a new nuclear aircraft carrier design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kommersant.com/p-10807/r_500/aircraft_carrier/ |title=Russia to Build New Aircraft Carrier |accessdate= 2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lenta 6/23&quot;&gt;[http://www.lenta.ru/news/2007/06/23/aircarrier/ Lenta.

Production of the carriers is expected to start around 2010 at the Zvezdochka plant in [[Severodvinsk]], where a large [[drydock]], capable of launching vessels with more than 100,000&amp;nbsp;ton displacement, is now being built.&lt;ref name=&quot;lenta 07/04&quot;&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2006/07/04/carrier/ Lenta.

The projected carrier is to have nuclear propulsion, to displace about 50,000&amp;nbsp;tons and to carry an air wing of 30–50 air superiority aircraft and helicopters, which makes her roughly comparable with the French [[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']]. &quot;The giants that the US Navy builds, those that carry 100–130 aircraft, we won't build anything like that&quot;, said Admiral [[Vladimir Masorin|Masorin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lenta 6/23&quot;/&gt; The planned specifications reflect the role, traditional in the Russian Navy, of the aircraft carrier as an air support platform for guided missile cruisers and submarines.

The Russian naval establishment had long agreed, since the decommissioning of the [[Kiev class aircraft carrier|''Kiev''-class]] carriers, that the only operational carrier, [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']], was insufficient, and that three or four carriers were necessary to meet the Navy's air support requirements.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} However, financial and organisational turmoil in the 1990s made even the maintenance of ''Admiral Kuznetsov'' a difficult undertaking. The improvement in Russia's economic situation after the year 2000 has allowed a major increase in defence spending. Admiral [[Vladimir Vysotsky (Admiral)|Vladimir Vysotsky]] announced on [[Navy Day]] 2008 that Russia plans to build five or six carriers of the new design for deployment in the [[Russian Northern Fleet|Northern]] and [[Pacific Ocean Fleet (Russia)|Pacific]] fleets, starting around 2012–2013.&lt;ref&gt;RIA Novosti. 2008, 27 July. [http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080727/115004797.html &quot;Russia to have 5–6 aircraft carriers in Northern, Pacific Fleets&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The new carrier groups are planned to be at full strength around 2050–2060.&lt;ref&gt;RIA Novosti. 2008, 4 April. [http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080404/103745057.html &quot;Russia to have 5–6 aircraft carriers by 2060—Navy commander&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; According to sources from the [[United Shipbuilding Corporation]] the new carriers will carry new fifth-generation fighters as well as [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] and have a displacement of up to 60,000 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090227/120342249.html Russia to build nuclear-powered 60,000-ton aircraft carrier &amp;#124; Russia &amp;#124; RIA Novosti]&lt;/ref&gt;

While planning for new carriers, and carrying out design projects, the Russian government has not committed to building the carriers. Russia's economic climate is not yet sufficient to allow the construction and support of additional carriers in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;SpaceDaily, SPACEwar, [http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Russia_halts_aircraft_carriers_building_999.html &quot;Russia halts aircraft carriers building&quot;], UPI, 10 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
Since the end of World War II, Japan has commissioned no full-fledged aircraft carrier. As of 2010, the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] has two small helicopter carriers ([[Hyūga class helicopter destroyer|Hyūga class]]).

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Pa2 uk.svg|thumb|Impression of the [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier|''Queen Elizabeth''-class]], two of which are under construction for the [[Royal Navy]].]]

The [[Royal Navy]] has signed a deal to build two new larger STOVL/CATOBAR aircraft carriers, the [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier|''Queen Elizabeth''-class]], to replace the three [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible''-class]] carriers. The ships are to be named {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|CVF|6}} and {{HMS|Prince of Wales|CVF|6}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;pike_cvf&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/cvf.htm ''Queen Elizabeth'' class Future Aircraft Carrier CVF (002)].&quot; Pike, J.

Although initially designed to be configured for STOVL operations, at least one of the carriers will be built to [[CATOBAR]] configurations to allow the F-35C to be operated, as announced in the 2010 [[Strategic Defence and Security Review]].

===United States===
[[File:CVN-78 Artist Image.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of the US [[Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier|''Gerald R. Ford''-class aircraft carrier]] ]] 

The current US fleet of [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class]] carriers are to be followed into service (and in some cases replaced) by the [[Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier|''Gerald R. Ford''-class]]. It is expected that the ships will be more automated in an effort to reduce the amount of funding required to maintain and operate its [[supercarrier]]s. The main new features are implementation of [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]] (EMALS) (which replace the old steam catapults) and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s.

With the decommissioning of the {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} in May 2009, the U.S. fleet comprises 11 supercarriers. The [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces|House Armed Services Seapower subcommittee]] on July 24, 2007, recommended seven or maybe eight new carriers (one every four years). However, the debate has deepened over budgeting for the $12–14.5 billion (plus $12 billion for development and research) for the 100,000 ton ''Gerald Ford''-class carrier (estimated service 2015) compared to the smaller $2 billion 45,000 ton [[America class amphibious assault ship|''America''-class amphibious assault ships]] able to deploy squadrons of [[F-35B]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFAmag&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kreisher |first = Otto|title = Seven New Carriers (Maybe) |journal = AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, Journal of the Air Force Association |volume = 90 |issue = 10 |pages = 68–71 |month = October |year = 2007 |publisher = Air Force Association |url = http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/October%202007/1007carriers.aspx |id = {{ISSN|0730-6784}} |accessdate = 2007-10-02 |format = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apicomplexa''' (also referred to as '''Apicomplexia''') are a large group of [[protist]]s, most of which possess a unique [[organelle]] called [[apicoplast]] and an ''apical complex'' structure involved in penetrating a host's cell. They are unicellular, spore-forming, and exclusively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jadwiga Grabda |title=Marine fish parasitology: an outline |page=8 |year=1991 |publisher=VCH |isbn=0895738236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; parasites of animals. Motile structures such as [[flagellum|flagella]] or [[pseudopod]]s are present only in certain [[gamete]] stages. This is a diverse group including organisms such as [[coccidia]], [[gregarine]]s, [[piroplasm]]s, [[haemogregarine]]s, and [[Plasmodiidae|plasmodia]]. Diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include, but are not limited to:
 	
* [[Babesiosis]] (''[[Babesia]]'')	
* [[Malaria]] (''[[Plasmodium]]'')	
* [[Coccidia]]n diseases including:	
** [[Cryptosporidiosis]] (''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'')	
** [[Cyclosporiasis]] (''[[Cyclospora cayetanensis]]'')	
** [[Isosporiasis]] (''[[Isospora belli]]'')
** [[Toxoplasmosis]] (''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'')

The name of the taxon ''Apicomplexa'' is derived from two [[Latin]] words - ''apex'' (top) and ''complexus'' (infolds) - and refers to a set of [[organelle]]s in the sporozoite. The older taxon ''Sporozoa'' grouped the ''Apicomplexa'' together with the ''[[Microsporidia]]'' and ''[[Myxosporida]]''. This grouping is no longer regarded as biologically valid and its use is discouraged.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlIntroduction to the Apicomplexa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/apicomplexa.html |title=Introduction to the Apicomplexa |work= |accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first apicomplexan protozoan was seen by [[Antony van Leeuwenhoek]] who in 1674 saw [[oocyst]]s of ''[[Eimeria stiedae]]'' in the [[gall bladder]] of a [[rabbit]]. The first member of the [[phylum]] to be named (by Dufour in 1828) was ''[[Gregarina ovata]]'' in [[earwig]]s. Since then many more have been identified and named. During the quarter century 1826-1850, 41 species and 6 genera of Apicomplexa were named. In the quarter century 1951-1975, 1873 new species and 83 new genera were added.

==Taxonomy==

By 1987 a comprehensive survey of the phylum was completed: in all, 4516 species and 339 genera had been named. They consisted of:
* the gregarines (subclass ''[[Gregarinasida]]'') with 1624 named species and 231 named genera
* the hemogregarines (family ''[[Haemogregarinidae]]'') with 399 species and 4 genera
* the eimeriorins (order ''[[Eimeriorida]]'') with 1771 species and 43 genera
* the hemospororids (order ''[[Haemosporasina]]'' with 444 species and 9 genera
* the piroplasmids (order ''[[Piroplasmorida]]'') with 173 species and 20 genera
* and a few others (105 species and 32 genera)

Although there has been considerable revision of this phylum (the order Haemosporidia now has 17 genera rather than 9) it seems likely these numbers are still approximately correct.

Roberts and Janovy in 1996 divided the phylum into five taxonomic groups:

The gregarines (subclass ''[[Gregarinasina]]'') are generally one-host parasites of invertebrates. 

The adeleorins (subclass ''[[Coccidiasina]]'', suborder ''[[Adeleorina]]'') are one-host parasites of invertebrates or vertebrates, or two-host parasites that alternately infect haematophagous (blood-feeding) invertebrates and the blood of vertebrates. 

The eimeriorins (subclass ''Coccidiasina'', suborder ''[[Eimeriorina]]''), are a diverse group that includes one host species of invertebrates, two-host species of invertebrates, one-host species of vertebrates and two-host species of vertebrates. 

The eimeriorins are frequently called the coccidia. Somewhat confusingly this term is often used to include the adeleorins. 

Haemospororins (subclass ''Coccidiasina'', suborder ''[[Haemosporasina]]''), often known as the malaria parasites, are two-host Apicomplexa that parasitize blood-feeding dipteran fies and the blood of various tetrapod vertebrates. 

All species of piroplasms (subclass ''[[Piroplasmasina]]'') are two-host parasites infecting ticks and vertebrates.

==General morphological features==

All members of this phylum have an infectious stage - the zoite - which possess an apical complex. This complex consists of a set of spirally arranged [[microtubule]]s (the [[conoid]]), a secretory body (the [[rhoptry]]) and one or more [[polar ring]]s. Additional slender electron dense secretory bodies ([[microneme]]s) may also be present. It is this structure that gives the phylum its name.

Other morphological findings that are common to all members of this phylum include:

*The [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]] is [[haploid]].
*[[Flagella]]e are found only in the motile gamete. These are posteriorly directed and vary in number (usually one to three).
*[[Basal body|Basal bodies]] are present. Although hemosporidians and piroplasmids have normal triplets of [[microtubule]]s in their basal bodies and coccidians and gregarines have 9 singlets. 	
*The [[mitochondria]] have tubular [[cristae]].
*A [[Golgi apparatus]] is present.
*[[Chloroplast]]s and [[centriole]]s are absent.
*Colourless [[plastid]]s are present in some species.
*The cell is surrounded by a [[pellicle (biology)|pellicle]] of three membrane layers (the alveolar structure) penetrated by micropores.

==General features==

Within this phylum there are four groups - ''[[Perkinsus]]'', coccidians, gregarines and haemosporidians. The coccidians and gregarines appear to be relatively closely related and ''Perkinsus '' appears to be basal within this phylum. 

''Perkinsus'' is a parasite of bivalve [[mollusk]]s and is currently the only known species in this class. It displayes a number of features characteristic of the [[dinoflagellate]]s including laterally inserted heterodynamic [[flagella]]. It is likely there are additional species in this class that have yet to be described. 
 
The gregarines are generally parasites of [[annelid]]s, [[arthropod]]s and mollusks. They are often found in the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]]s of their hosts but may invade the other tissues. In the typical gregarine life cycle a [[trophozoite]] develops within a host cell into a plasmodium. This then divides into a number of [[merozoite]]s by [[schizogony]]. The [[merozoite]]s are released by lysing the host cell which in turn invade other cells. At some point in the life cycle [[gamont]]s are formed. These are released by lysis of the host cells and group together by [[syzygy]]. Each gamont forms multiple [[gamete]]s. The gametes fuse with another to form [[oocyst]]s. The oocysts leave the host to be taken up by a new host.

Coccidians are generally parasites of [[vertebrate]]s. Like gregarines they are commonly parasites of the [[epithelial]] cells of the gut but may infect other tissues. The typical coccidial life cycle while similar to that of the gregarines differs in [[zygote]] formation. Some trophozoites enlage and become [[macrogamete]] while others divide repeatedly to form [[microgamete]]s. The microgametes are motile and must reach the macrogamete to fertilize it. The fertilized macrogamete forms a zygote which in its turn forms an oocyst which is normally released from the body. 

The Haemosporidians have more complex life cycles that alternate between an arthropod and a vertebrate host. The trophozoite parasitises [[erythrocyte]]s or other tissues in the vertebrate host. Microgametes and macrogametes are always found in the blood. The gametes are taken up by the insect vector during a blood meal. The microgametes migrate within the gut of the insect vector and fuse with the macrogametes. The fertilized macrogamete now becomes an [[ookinete]] which penetrates the body of the vector. The ookinete then transforms into an oocyte and divides initially by meiosis and then by mitosis to give rise to the [[sporozoite]]s. The sporozoites escape from the oocyst and migrate within the body of the vector to the salivary glands where they are injected into the new vertebrate host when the insect vector feeds again.

== Evolution ==
Many ''Coccidiomorpha'' have an [[intermediate host]] as well as a primary host, and the evolution of hosts proceeded in different ways and at different times in these groups. For some coccidiomorphs, the original host has become the intermediate host while in others it has become the definitive host. In the genera ''[[Aggregata]]'', ''[[Atoxoplasma]]'', ''[[Cystoisospora]]'', ''[[Schellackia]]'' and ''[[Toxoplasma]]'' the original is now definitive while in ''[[Akiba (protozoa)|Akiba]]'', ''[[Babesiosoma]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', ''[[Haemogregarina]]'', ''[[Haemoproteus]]'', ''[[Hepatozoon]]'', ''[[Karyolysus]]'', ''[[Leucocytozoon]]'', ''[[Plasmodium]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'' and ''[[Theileria]]'', the original hosts are now intermediate.

Similar strategies to increase the likelihood of transmission have evolved in multiple genera. Polyenergid [[oocyst]]s and tissue cysts are found in representatives of the orders [[Protococcidiida]] and [[Eimeriida]]. [[Hypnozoite]]s are found in ''[[Karyolysus lacerate]]'' and most species of ''[[Plasmodium]]''; transovarial transmission of parasites occurs in life cycles of ''[[Karyolysus]]'' and ''[[Babesia]]''.

Most members have a complex life-cycle, involving both asexual and sexual reproduction.  Typically, a host is infected via an active invasion by the parasites (similar to [[entosis]]), which divide to produce ''[[sporozoite]]s'' that enter its cells.  Eventually, the cells burst, releasing ''[[merozoites]]'' which infect new cells.  This may occur several times, until ''gamonts'' are produced, forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts.  There are many variations on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.

The apical complex includes [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called [[rhoptries]] and [[microneme]]s, which open at the anterior of the cell.  These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells.  The tip is surrounded by a band of [[microtubule]]s, called the ''polar ring'', and among the Conoidasida there is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the ''conoid''.&lt;ref name=coccidiaworld&gt;{{cite web

| format = Online database }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Over the rest of the cell, except for a diminished mouth called the micropore, the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli, forming a semi-rigid pellicle.

The presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the [[alveolate]]s.  Several related flagellates, such as ''[[Perkinsus marinus|Perkinsus]]'' and ''[[Colpodella]]'' have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the [[dinoflagellate]]s.  They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.

Another similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single [[plastid]], called the [[apicoplast]], surrounded by either 3 or four membranes.  Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and heme biosynthesis, and it appears to be necessary for survival.  Plastids are generally considered to share a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence generally points to an origin from [[red algae]] rather than [[green alga|green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1481 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1481–1493 | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J. Keeling | doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1481 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn483 | year = 2008 | month = July | author = Ram, Ev; Naik, R; Ganguli, M; Habib, S | title = DNA organization by the apicoplast-targeted bacterial histone-like protein of Plasmodium falciparum | volume =  36| issue =  15| pages =  5061–73| pmid = 18663012 | journal = Nucleic acids research | pmc = 2528193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apicomplexa comprise the bulk of what used to be called the Sporozoa, a group for parasitic protozoans without flagella, pseudopods, or cilia. Most of the Apicomplexa are motile however.  The other main lines were the [[Ascetosporea]], the [[Myxozoa]] (now known to be derived from [[animal]]s), and the [[Microsporidia]] (now known to be derived from [[fungus|fungi]]).  Sometimes the name Sporozoa is taken as a synonym for the Apicomplexa, or occasionally as a subset.

== Blood-borne genera ==
Within the Apicomplexa there are three suborders of parasites. 

* suborder [[Adeleorina]] - 8 genera
* suborder [[Haemosporina]] - all genera in this suborder
* suborder [[Eimeriorina]] - 2 genera (''[[Lankesterella]]'' and ''[[Schellackia]]'')

Within the ''Adelorina'' are species that infect [[invertebrate]]s and others that infect [[vertebrate]]s.  

The ''Haemosporina'' includes the [[malaria]] parasites and their relatives. 

The ''Eimeriorina'' - the largest suborder in this phylum - the life cycle involves both sexual and asexual stages. The asexual stages reproduce by [[schizogony]]. The male gametocyte produces a large number of gametes and the [[zygote]] gives rise to an [[oocyst]] which is the infective stage. The majority are monoxenous (infect one host only) but a few are heteroxenous (life cycle involves two or more hosts).

Both the number of families in this later suborder is debated with the number of families being between one and twenty depending on the authority and the number of genera being between nineteen and twenty five. This somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs awaits resolution with DNA based methods.

== Disease genomics ==
As noted above, many of the apicomplexan parasites are important pathogens of human and domestic animals. In contrast to [[bacteria]]l pathogens, these apicomplexan parasites are [[eukaryote]]s and share many metabolic pathways with their animal hosts. This fact makes therapeutic target development extremely difficult – a drug that harms an apicomplexan parasite is also likely to harm its human host. Currently there are no effective [[vaccine]]s available for most diseases caused by these parasites. Biomedical research on these parasites is challenging because it is often difficult, if not impossible, to maintain live parasite cultures in the laboratory and to genetically manipulate these organisms. In the recent years, several of the apicomplexan species have been selected for [[genome sequencing]]. The availability of [[genome]] sequences provides a new opportunity for scientists to learn more about the [[evolution]] and biochemical capacity of these parasite. A [[NIH]]-funded database, [http://ApiDB.org ApiDB.org], provides public access to currently available genomic data sets.  One possible target for drugs is the plastid, and in fact existing drugs such as [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline]]s which are effective against apicomplexans seem to operate against the plastid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00394-06 | year = 2006 | month = September | author = Dahl, El; Shock, Jl; Shenai, Br; Gut, J; Derisi, Jl; Rosenthal, Pj | title = Tetracyclines specifically target the apicoplast of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum | volume = 50 | issue = 9 | pages = 3124–31 | pmid = 16940111 | pmc = 1563505 | journal = Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy | url = http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16940111 | format = Free full text }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most apicomplexans have plastid genomes as well as nuclear ones, although ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' spp. and possibly [[gregarines]] are exceptions as they are thought to have lost plastids after the diverging [[last common ancestor]] of apicomplexans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Asadito.jpg|210px|thumb|''Asado'' (grill)]][[File:Argentine-woman-making-empanadas.JPG|thumb|Cooks in [[Buenos Aires]] prepare [[empanada]]s, perhaps the signature dish of [[Spanish language]] regions in South America, including Argentina.]]

'''Argentine cuisine''' is distinctive in South America because of its strong resemblance to [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[French cuisine|French]] and other European cuisines while the cuisine of the Argentine Northwest has more elements of [[Andean cuisine]].

Another determining factor in Argentine cuisine is that the country is one of the world's major food producers. It is a major producer of [[meat]] (especially [[beef]]), [[wheat]], [[maize|corn]], [[milk]], [[bean]]s, and since the 1970s, [[soybean]]s. Given the country's vast production of beef, [[red meat]] is an especially common part of the Argentine [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Historically, Argentine annual consumption of beef averaged 100&amp;nbsp;kg (220&amp;nbsp;lbs) per capita,&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Magazine''. March 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; approaching 180&amp;nbsp;kg (396&amp;nbsp;lbs) per capita during the 19th century; consumption averaged 67.7&amp;nbsp;kg (149&amp;nbsp;lbs) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comex.infobaeprofesional.com/notas/62697.html&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the enormous quantities of domestically harvested wheat have made white [[bread]] (made with [[wheat flour]]) the most commonly found on the table, the wheat-based Italian dishes popular, and Argentine [[pizza]] use more dough than Italian pizza.

Besides some regional disparities addressed in this article, there exist at least two other comparisons which are important in understanding Argentine cuisine: the first distinguishes a cuisine that is essentially [[urban area|urban]] and [[multicultural|cosmopolitan]] (highly influenced by the &quot;[[globalization]]&quot; of food and eating patterns) from a more traditional, idiosyncratic [[rural]] cuisine. The second comparison is made on the basis of socioeconomic differences.

While certain foods can be found in all corners of the country ([[Asado]], or [[barbecue]]d meat; [[dulce de leche]]; [[empanada]]s; and [[yerba mate]]; in addition to all sorts of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], and French dishes) one can [[map]] out four broad culinary regions based on major trends.

== Typical foods ==
[[File:AlfajoresTriples.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfajores]] triples, an Argentine version of the classic South American tea pastry.]]
[[File:Scones.JPG|thumb|[[Scones]] are also commonly served with [[jam]] and [[clotted cream]] (commonly known as a [[cream tea]]).]]

Argentines are famous for their high [[protein]] diet, particularly beef. [[Grilling|Grilled]] meat from the ''[[asado]]'' (barbecue) is a staple, with [[steak]] and beef [[rib]]s especially common. ''[[Chorizo]]'' ([[pork]] [[sausage]]), ''[[blood sausage|morcilla]]'' (blood sausage), ''[[chitterlings|chinchulines]]'' (chitterlings), ''[[sweetbread|mollejas]]'' (sweetbread), and other parts of the animal are enjoyed. In [[Patagonia]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[chivito]] ([[goat]]) are eaten more than beef. Whole lambs and goats can be seen on the asado. ''[[Chimichurri]]'', a [[sauce]] of [[herb]]s, garlic and vinegar, is often used as an accompaniment (most Argentines have a relatively delicate palate and do not include chili in their version of chimichurri).

[[Breading|Breaded]] and [[Frying|fried]] meat ([[schnitzel]])— ''[[Milanesa|milanesas]]'' — are used as [[snack]]s, in [[sandwich]]es or eaten warm with [[mashed potato]]es — ''[[purée]]''. ''[[Empanadas]]'' — small [[pastries]] of meat, [[cheese]], [[sweet corn]] and a hundred other varieties — are a common sight for parties, [[Entrée|starters]] and [[picnic]]s across Argentina. Another variation is the &quot;empanada gallega&quot; (Spanish empanada, known as simply &quot;empanada&quot; in Spain. &quot;Galician/gallego&quot; is a common adjective to refer to Spain.), which has a round shape and is more like a big, round meat pie made mostly of [[tuna]] and [[mackerel]] (&quot;''caballa''&quot; in Spanish). [[Vegetable]]s and [[salad]]s are important too for Argentines, even beyond the fried or mashed potato. [[Tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[lettuce]], [[eggplant]]s, [[Squash (fruit)|squashes]] and [[zucchini]] are common [[side dishes]].

Just as much as beef, Italian staples, such as [[pizza]] and ''[[al dente]]'' [[pasta]], are eaten. ''[[Noodle|Fideos]]'', ''[[Tallarines]]'', ''[[Gnocchi|ñoquis]]'', ''[[Ravioli|ravioles]]'' and [[Cannelloni|canelones]] can be bought freshly made in many establishments in the larger cities. Italian-style [[ice cream]] is served in large [[parlour]]s and even drive-through businesses.
In [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], the [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Welsh community]] is known for their [[teahouse]]s, with [[scones]] and ''[[Torta Galesa]]'', rather like [[Bara Brith|Torta negra]].

''[[Sandwiches de miga]]'' are delicate sandwiches made with crustless buttered white bread, very thinly sliced [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] meat and cheese and [[lettuce]]. They are often purchased from entrepreneurial home cooks and consumed for a light evening meal.

Argentine food also reflects its European roots and sometimes tend to vary in certain regions then in others.

A sweet [[Paste (food)|paste]], ''dulce de leche'' is another national obsession, used to fill [[cake]]s and [[pancake]]s, spread over [[toast]]ed bread for [[breakfast]] or as an ice cream flavour. ''[[Alfajor]]es'' are [[shortbread]] [[cookies]] sandwiched together with dulce de leche or a [[fruit]] paste. The &quot;[[police]]man's&quot; or &quot;[[truck]] driver's&quot; sweet is cheese with [[quince]] paste or ''[[dulce de membrillo]]''. ''[[Dulce de batata]]'' is made of [[sweet potato]]/[[yam (vegetable)|yam]]: this with cheese is the ''[[Martin Fierro|Martín Fierro]]'''s [[sweet]]. [[Apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[kiwifruit]]s, [[avocado]]s and [[plum]]s are major [[export]]s.

A traditional [[drink]] of Argentina is an [[infusion]] called [[mate (beverage)|mate]] (in Spanish, ''mate'', with the accent on the first syllable). The dried [[Leaf|leaves]] and [[twig]]s of the [[yerba mate]] plant (''[[Ilex paraguariensis]]'') are placed in a small [[Drinkware|cup]], also called ''mate'', usually made from a [[gourd]], but also bone or [[Drinking horn|horn]]. The drink is sipped through a metal or cane [[straw]] called a ''[[bombilla]]''. Mate can be sweetened with [[sugar]], or [[flavor]]ed with [[aromatic]] herbs or dried [[orange (fruit)|orange]] [[peel (fruit)|peel]], to hide its [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] flavour. Hot water is poured into the gourd at near-[[boiling point]] so as to not burn the herb and spoil the flavour. At family or small social gatherings, one mate may be shared by the group, with the host preparing the mate to the preference of each guest. When one guest is finished, the mate is returned to the host, who will then prepare a mate for another guest. This is considered an important social ritual. ''[[Mate cocido]]'' is the same leaf, which rather than [[Boiling|brewed]], is [[Boiling|boiled]] and served, as [[coffee]] or [[tea]], with [[milk]] or sugar to taste.

Other typical drinks include [[wine]] (occasionally mixed with [[carbonated water]] known as ''[[Soda water|soda]]''); tea and coffee are equally important. [[Quilmes]] is the national [[brand]] of [[pale lager]], named after the town of [[Quilmes, Buenos Aires]], where it was first produced.

== Regional differences ==
Argentine Cuisine is heavily influenced by its European roots. Asado, dulce de leche, empanadas and yerba mate are found throughout Argentina. In many parts of the country food is prepared differently and different kinds of foods are made this includes to a smaller degree food from [[pre-Columbian]] times like in the Northwest.

=== Central region and las Pampas ===
[[File:Spaghetti-prepared.jpg|210px|thumb|Though most commonplace in central Argentina, ''[[Fideos]]'' and other Italian dishes are central to Argentine cuisine generally.]]
This region consists of the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], part of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], and all of the city of [[Buenos Aires]]. It is also a crucial center of [[cattle]] production for Argentina and is thus the origin of the quintessentially Argentine dishes ''[[asado]]'' (barbecued beef) and ''[[dulce de leche]]''. It is here that red-meat-based foods are combined with white meat, [[dairy product]]s and pasta, producing a high-[[protein]] [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

In addition to the aforementioned ''asado'' and ''dulce de leche'', other dishes that typify the region are ''[[Milanesa|milanesas]]'' (The name comes from the original [[cotoletta alla milanese]] from [[Milan]], Italy ), or breaded meats. A common dish of this variety is the ''[[milanesa napolitana]]'' (the name comes from a [[restaurant]] that used to be in Buenos Aires, &quot;[[El Napolitano]]&quot;). ''Milanesa napolitana'' known elswhere as &quot;[[schnitzel]] [[parmigiana]]&quot; is locally claimed as an Argentine innovation despite its name and consists of breaded meat with cheese, tomatoes and in some special cases, [[ham]]. In addition to [[roast beef]], ''[[bifes]]'', and ''[[Churrasco|churrascos]]'', a visitor to the central region will find many dishes of Spanish and Italian origin that have been incorporated into Argentine cuisine and, in the case of the Italian staples, heavily modified from their original forms.

[[Pizza]] (locally pronounced ''pisa or pitsa''), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian [[calzone]]s than it does its Italian ancestor. Typical Argentine pizzas include ''[[pizza canchera]]'', ''[[pizza rellena]]'' ([[stuffing|stuffed]] pizza), ''[[pizza por metro]]'' (pizza by the meter), and ''[[pizza a la parrilla]]'' (grilled pizza). While Argentine pizza, derives from [[Naples|Neapolitan]] cuisine, the Argentine ''[[fugaza|fugaza''/''fugazza]]'' comes from the ''[[focaccia]]'' ([[Genoa]]n), but in any case its preparation is different from its Italian counterpart, and the addition of cheese to make the dish ([[fugaza con queso]] or [[fugazzeta]]) is an Argentine modification.

''[[Fainá]]'' is a type of thin bread made with [[chickpea]] flour (adopted from northern Italy). During the 20th century, people in pizzerias in Buenos Aires, [[Rosario]] or [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] have commonly ordered a &quot;[[combination|combo]]&quot; of ''moscato'', pizza, and ''fainá''. This is a large glass of a sweet wine called moscato ([[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]]), plus two [[triangular]] stacked pieces (the lower one being pizza and the upper one ''fainá''). Despite both pizza and faina being Italian in origin, they are never served together there.

Nevertheless, ''[[pasta]]'' surpasses pizza in consumption levels. Among the most common are ''[[tallarines]]'', ''[[ravioles|ravioli]]'', ''[[gnocchi|ñoquis]]'' and ''[[canelones]]'' ([[cannelloni]]). They are usually cooked, served, and consumed in Argentine fashion, called ''al-uso-nostro'', a phrase of Italian origin underlining the deliberate nature of changes to the traditional European foods.
[[File:Fainá.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[Fainá]] in a quintessential local deli.]][[File:Pizza over Fainá.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Sliced pizza served over ''[[fainá]]'', a common combination.]]

For example, it is common for pasta to be eaten together with white bread (&quot;French bread&quot;), which is unusual in Italy. This can be explained by the low cost of bread and the fact that Argentine pasta tends to come together with a large amount of sauce ''tuco'' (Italian ''sugo'') and accompanied by [[stew|''estofado'' (stew)]]. Less commonly, pastas are eaten with ''[[pesto]]'' or [[Béchamel sauce|''salsa blanca'' (Béchamel sauce)]].

''[[Sorrentinos]]'' are also a local dish with a misleading name (they do not come from [[Sorrento]], but were invented in [[Mar del Plata]]). They look like big round ''ravioles'' stuffed with [[mozzarella]], [[ham]], and sometimes [[ricotta]], too.

''[[Polenta]]'' comes from [[Northern Italy]] and is very common throughout Argentina. But unlike in Italy, this [[cornmeal]] is eaten as a main dish, with sauce and [[melted]] cheese.

[[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] influences are abundant: [[dessert]]s like the ''[[churros]]'' (cylinders of [[pastry]], usually fried, sometimes filled with dulce de leche), ''[[flan]]'', ''[[ensaimada]]s'' ([[Catalonia|Catalan]] sweet bread), and ''[[alfajor]]es'' are all descended from Spain. Main dishes such as the ''[[Spanish tortilla|tortillas]]'' ([[omelet]]s of [[Egg (food)|egg]], [[onion]] and potato, and having no relation to the Mexican dish of the same name), nearly all kinds of stews known as &quot;guisos&quot; or &quot;estofados&quot;, ''arroces'' (rice dishes such as [[paella]]), and ''fabada'' ([[Asturias|Asturian]] bean stew). All of the ''[[guiso]]s'' and ''[[puchero]]s'' ([[stew]]s) are of Spanish origin. Argentine preparations of [[fish]], such as dried [[salt cod]] (''[[Bacalhau|bacalao]]''), [[calamari]], and [[octopus]], originate from the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] regions.

''[[Empanada]]s'', though typically South American, have a [[Moorish]] origin (they derived from the [[West Asia]]n ''[[lahmayim]]'' and ''[[fatay]]''), and can be also traced to the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] empanada.

[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence has impacted Argentine food as well, particularly sweet dishes. The pastries known as ''[[facturas]]'' are Germanic in origin: [[croissant]]s, known as ''[[medialuna]]s'', are the most popular of these, and can be found in two varieties: butter- and [[lard]]-based. Also German in origin are the &quot;[[Berliner (pastry)|Berlinese]]&quot;, also known colloquially as ''bolas de fraile'' (&quot;[[friar]]'s [[Testicle|balls]]&quot;), and the [[pastries]] called ''[[piononos]]''. The ''facturas'' were renamed, given the difficult phonology of [[German language|German]], and usually Argentinized by the addition of a dulce of leche filling. In addition, dishes like [[Sauerkraut|''Chucrut'' (Sauerkraut)]] have also made it into mainstream Argentine cuisine. Most of the names given to [[bakery]] and pastry elaborations such as 'facturas' are designed to be contemptuous of [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Church]] or [[State (polity)|State]] institutions, as well as management, partly a legacy of the [[anarchist]] or [[socialist]] tendencies of [[bakers]]' [[Trade union|unions]] during the early 1900s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
[[File:La Estancia Steakhouse.jpg|thumb|210px|A chef minds the [[asado]] at ''La Estancia'', one of Buenos Aires' hundreds of steakhouses.]]

Not much is left of the ''[[gaucho]]'' food, except ''asado'', ''dulce de leche'', mate (the yerba mate infusion), ''[[Sopaipilla|tortas fritas]]'', and ''[[Rice pudding#Europe|arroz con leche]]'' ([[rice pudding]]).

The scene was different until the first half of the 19th century. [[Lucio V. Mansilla]] in his ''[[Memorias]]'' records that in the cities of Buenos Aires province (which at that time also included [[Montevideo]], now in [[Uruguay]]) common foods were ''[[quibebe]]'', ''[[mazamorra]]'' (a sweet, milky corn [[pudding]]) as a dessert, ''[[chancaca]]'' (a sugary, brown, [[maize|corn]] cake), the [[pacú]] fish, ''[[surubí]], [[Prochilodus lineatus|sábalo]], ''asados'' (roasts) etc.''

When the [[Salta]]-born [[Juana Manuela Gorriti]] wrote her book ''[[La cocina ecléctica]]'' (''Eclectic Cuisine'') in the last years of the 19th century, already a large part of the Argentine preparations mentioned in this book were forgotten among the people of the Central region and the [[Pampa]]s. It was precisely in this era that the great innovative influx of Italian immigrants and Italian food occurred. The aforementioned L.V. Mansilla noted the existence of ''ravioles'' in principal cities of the [[Río de la Plata]] basin around the 1880s; [[Jorge Luis Borges]] said that &quot;the first time&quot; that he came to know ravioli was at the beginning of the 20th century, while very young, at the home of Italian immigrants whose son invited him.

In the rural areas of the Pampas corresponding to la [[Pampa Húmeda]], principally in the center and south of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], center, east and south of Córdoba and north Buenos Aires, sausage preparations such as [[''salames'' (salami)]], ''[[bondiola]]s'', [[Cotechino|''codeguines'' (Cotechino)]],  etc. are very common.
[[File:Milanesa napolitana (1).jpg|thumb|210px|Dish of ''[[milanesa]] napolitana'', an Argentine take on the Italian classic.]]
The preparation of ham is inherited as much from the Spanish ''[[jabugo]]s'' as from the ''[[prosciutto|prosciutti]]'' of [[Parma]] (Italy). The most famous Argentine hams are probably the [[Serrano ham|''jamones serranos'' (Serrano hams)]] from [[Sierras de Córdoba]] and environs.
‎
Although many Italian and Spanish immigrants came from coastal areas, with fish and seafood being an important component of Italian and Spanish cuisines, and despite the fact that Argentina is rich in marine resources, the level of fish consumption in the country is relatively low. The main explanation of this phenomenon is the abundant availability of beef and [[poultry]] (mainly [[chicken]]), with local prejudices against fish being less filling than meats; the most common preparations of fish are simple [[escalope]]s of [[fillet (cut)|fillet]] of [[Merlucciidae|merluza]] and ''chupínes''.

Although since the second half of the twentieth century the percentage of practicing [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] has steadily declined, and although in 2005 they may account for only 20 percent of the total population, many of the [[festivities]] and dishes associated with their tradition have remained visible: on [[Christmas]] (Navidad) it is traditional to eat oven-roasted pork or, less commonly, [[duck]], accompanied by [[turron]]s, and ''[[pan dulce]]'' that is directly derived from Milanese [[panettone]]. For [[Easter]], [[Easter egg]]s are eaten, whereas during the [[Semana Santa]] or days leading up to Easter the Catholic teaching is to renounce meats except for fish. During this time a typical food is ''[[empanadas de vigilia]]'', which are empanadas principally filled with [[tuna]], and [[guisados]] with [[bacalao]] (cod).
[[File:Un Cafe y un sandwich mixto.jpg|thumb|left|210px|''Carlitos'', the Buenos Aires brunch staple.]]
Wine production in this part of Argentina is qualitatively and quantitatively inferior than that in the Northeast and the [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]]; nonetheless, there are some interesting wines: in the colonial era, famous wines were made by the [[Jesuits]] in [[Alta Gracia]] (in the [[Sierras de Córdoba]]), and since the end of the 19th century notable wines have come from [[Caroya]], also in the province of Córdoba though not in the ''[[Sierra de Córdoba|sierra]]'' but the [[piedemont]] of the Córdoban ''pampa''. Also, this region has grown and produced wines in the humid region called &quot;[[La Costa]]&quot;, which is to say the area around the river [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and the river [[La Plata]] from the city of Santa Fe to the ''adyacencias'' of La Plata; on the other side of the Río de La Plata, in Uruguay, they produce higher quality wine, principally in [[Juanicó]].

The region is a center of dairy production, though on retreat due to the movement towards [[soy]] products during the 1990s and 2000s. Although this high level of [[dairy]] production does not include an entire line of regional cheeses, there are a few, including ''[[Queso Mar del Plata]]'' and ''[[Queso Colonia]]'' (a Uruguayan product from ''[[Colonia Suiza]]'' whosen manufacture has spread to Buenos Aires and Santa Fe). Also originating in this zone, as its name indicates, is [[Queso Chubut]]; during the twentieth century, the southern province of Buenos Aires was an important producer of this cheese. Argentine pizzas tend to be prepared with ''[[musarela]]'', a cheese which imitates the Italian [[mozzarella]] (although for the most part ''musarela'' is made with cow's milk, or sometimes sheep's milk, unlike the Italian original which sometimes substitutes cow's with buffalo's milk), and with noodles and pasta (or polenta) covered with [[grated cheese|grated]] [[parmesan]].

Yet another cheese of Italian origin much appreciated in Argentina (and often eaten together with ''asados'' or grilled itself) is [[provolone]], though French cheese has also been appreciated and imitated by Argentine cheese producers throughout the 20th century.

=== Northwest region ===
[[File:Empanadas salteñas 1.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Empanadas]], hot off the oven.]][[File:DulceDeLecheSweets.jpg|thumb|210px|Traditional [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]] pastries made with Argentina's famed, creamy spread, ''[[dulce de leche]]''.]]
The Northwest region includes the provinces of [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]], [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] and the west of [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]].

The cuisine of this region shows more influence from its pre[[hispanic]] cultures in the [[Andes Mountains]] than in the rest of the country; in fact the historical centers of the provinces of this region are located in Andean areas, with the exception of Tucumán, [[Santiago del Estero]]. Although, still the primary influence is by European foods.

In [[agriculture]], in addition to [[potato]]es and corn, one finds many varieties of indigenous vegetables: [[quinoa]] and [[kiwicha]] prosper in the least humid zones, while in more humid areas, beans, tomatoes, [[pumpkin]]s, [[chile pepper]]s, avocados, and [[chayote]] abound.

Non-native plant [[species]] are also cultivated in the northwest region, including [[grape]]s, [[olive]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[peach]]es, [[pear]]s, [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], and [[plum]]s.

In the most humid areas, there is a large production of sugar cane, lemons, plantains, and oranges. Apples do well in the coldest areas.
From this we can infer that, traditionally, this region has had a great foundation for a great variety of dishes. Generally what stands out are the ''tucumanas'' and ''salteñas'', stuffed with meat or humita.

Another typical dish of the region (and available throughout the country) is a type of succulent stew prepared mostly with corn grains: ''el [[locro]]''. In truth, there are many varieties of ''locro'', including ''huascha locro'' and ''locro pobre''.

On the other hand, in this area the preparation of [[tamale]]s and [[humita]]s in corn husks is common.
[[File:Locro.jpg|thumb|left|210px|A bowl of ''Locro'' stew, a traditional standby in northwestern Argentina.]]
Other culinary specialties of this region are [[almond]] paste ([[marzipan]]), dried peaches, [[maize]] cake, [[pork]] [[stew]] with corn, [[steak]], cheap stew, meat stew and eggs ''[[quimbos]]''; as well as potato cake, although this last one is often made in other areas of Argentina in recent times.

While nearly all the provinces in the region (except for Tucumán and Santiago del Estero) produce wines that in most cases have won worldwide acclaim, among the wines one must mention at least one that is exclusively Argentine: ''[[torrontés]]'', a [[fragrant]] white wine with a fruity flavor, produced in the [[Calchaquíes Valleys]]. Among [[vintners]] producing ''torrontés'', the most famous is [[Cafayate]]. In the north, as well as in [[Tarija, Argentina|Tarija]], [[liquor]]s (''[[aguardiente]]s'') are made from grapes or [[distilled]] from wine, such as [[singani]], or others similar to [[Chilean cuisine|Chilean]] [[pisco]].

Mention has already been made of the carob tree, whose bark is used to make artisan foods and drinks: a type of bread called ''patay'' and a type of beer called ''aloja''.

Northwest Argentina is a territory that produces a great variety of sweets, some of which are consumed in massive amounts in other parts of the country: ''[[dulce de batata]]'' and ''dulce de membrillo''. These are used, together with ''queso fresco'', in the desserts known as ''fresco y batata'' and ''postre vigilante'', very common in most parts or Argentina.

More restricted to the northeast are ''[[chañar]]'' fruit and [[pear]]s, and the sweets of molasses and ''cayote'' marmalade. Another simple dessert typical of northeast Argentina is goat cheese with honey.

=== The Cuyo region ===
The [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]] region includes the provinces of [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] and [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]., reunites gastronomics elements of the Central region and Northwest region. The Cuyo standing by the greats productions of [[wine]]s ([[Malbec]], [[Pinot Noir]], [[Chardonnay]], [[Syrah]], [[Cabernet]], [[Charbono|Bonarda]], [[Riesling]]) and fruits of temperate clima like [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]s and [[grape]]s.

However, the great majority of Argentines prefer French-style wines (including [[sparkling wine]]s like [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]). This taste is found in the higher economic strata, where the purchasing power is greatest, and as a consequence, native, Italian, and Spanish wines all play second [[fiddle]] to French wines in Argentina.

Of the Italian-style wines produced in Argentina, the most outstanding imitate the ''[[Chianti]]''; of those in the Spanish style, the best-known are called ''[[carlón]]''.

* ''See also: [[Argentine wine]]''

In certain parts of Argentina and certain socioeconomic classes there is a preference for artificially sweetened wines known as ''abocados'' (no relation to the vegetable, which is known in Spanish as ''aguacate'', and in Argentina as ''palta.''), a taste derived from ''vinos de misa'' (principally one known as ''[[mistela]]''), which can be better understood if one remembers that the first grapevines for wine were planted in Argentina at the start of the 16th century precisely to be used in [[Roman Catholic]] [[eucharist|communion]].

=== Northeast region ===
[[File:Fruteria de la Esquina.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Fruit stand in Buenos Aires. Northern Argentina is well-known for its variety of citrus.]]
The region includes the [[province]]s of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], and most of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], the north of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and the east of [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]].

Four principal foods characterize the nourishing productions of this Argentine region: ''la mandioca'', rice, freshwater fish, and mate.
[[File:Kaa mate.JPG|thumb|[[Yerba mate]] tea, the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|northeastern region]]'s best-known contribution to Argentine cuisine.]][[File:Pan casero.jpg|thumb|Portion of ''pan casero'', &quot;home-style bread&quot;.]]
This area of Argentina provides yerba maté (Guarani, ''[[caá]]'') to the rest of the nation, and even to neighboring states. The two provinces of Corrientes and Misiones are the principal producers of ''yerba''. As the main producer of yerba maté, the maté drink is most popular in this area. In the Northeast, maté is sometimes mixed with cold fruit [[juice]]s (called ''[[Tereré]]''), or even with [[Distilled beverage|spirits]].

''[[Mandioca]]'' [[cassava]] and many dishes of Northeast Argentina are identical or very similar to those of [[Paraguay]] and of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]. Common foods include varieties of home-style breads (''[[w:es:pan casero|panes caseros]]''), some made with ''mandioca'' [[flour]], and [[tapioca]]. Varieties of tapioca called ''[[chipá]]'' and ''[[chipaca]]'' spread throughout [[Southern cone]] due to internal migrations. ''Mandioca'' is also the base for the dish called ''[[beyú]]'' (also known as ''[[mbeyú]]'' or ''[[mvejú]]''). Empanadas are also made here with ''Mandioca'' flour instead of traditional wheat flour. [[Rice]] is widely available and is often used in the filling of empanadas. In the Entre Ríos province it is also possible to find empanadas filled with [[milk pudding]].

The abundance of rivers, [[stream]]s, and [[lagoon]]s makes fish common to the northeastern diet. Among the fish commonly eaten are ''[[pacú]]'', ''[[dorado]]'', [[surubí]], ''[[mandiyú]]'', ''[[manguruyú]]'', ''[[patí]]'' and [[Leporinus obtusidens|boga]]. They can be roasted, served with rice stews or in empanadas.

''[[Carpincho]]'' ([[capybara]]) and ''[[yacare|yacaré]]'' meat were common before the arrival of the Spanish conquest, and can still be found. The ''carpincho'' is sometimes cooked by placing hot stones inside the dead animal.

Fruit production is also widespread, and fruit is a component of various desserts and [[beverage]]s. The horticultural fruits are [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[banana]]s, [[watermelon]]s, avocados, [[grapefruit]]s, [[tangerine]]s, and [[pineapple]]s.

[[Palm tree]]s are found in this region, and the ''[[palmitos]]'' ([[palm heart]]s) are nowadays eaten all over Argentina, usually with ''[[Salsa golf|Salsa Golf]]'', a mix of [[ketchup]] and [[mayonnaise]].

=== Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego ===
[[File:Fruit jam.JPG|thumb|210px|Vendor with artisanal jams and conserves, [[Mendoza Province]].]]
This region consists of the provinces of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], and [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego, and Antarctica]].

Here, one can encounter ''asados'' (roasts), ''dulce de leche'', ''empanadas'', and the intake of infusions of yerba maté (although it often has to come from abroad).

Tallarines, Raviolis, ''ñoquis'' (gnocchi), and pizzas are also common in Southern Argentina. Unlike the rest of the country, the southern region has, like its natural production, migratory influences, and its climate, has come unique characteristics. In addition to the always present influence of Italian and Spanish flavors, one can notice the influence of Central and Northwestern Europe.
[[File:Tortas en San Martín de los Andes.JPG|thumb|left|210px|''Chocolate y [[dulce de leche]]'' cake and other regional favorites in a [[San Martín de los Andes]], [[Neuquen Province|Neuquén]] shop.]]
[[Welsh people|Welsh]] immigration, for example, since the second half of the 1860s in Chubut has introduced two large contributions to local cuisine: the [[bara brith|torta negra]], and the cheese called Chubut, whose consumption later spread to the greater part of Patagonia (especially in [[Neuquén]]) and in the south of the province of Buenos Aires.

Central European immigration has spread the preparation of certain desserts and [[sweets]] ([[cherry]], [[apple]], [[raspberry]], [[bilberry]], ''[[rosa mosqueta]]'', ''[[zarzaparrilla]]'' ([[sarsaparilla]]), [[sauce]]s, etc.) [[chocolate]]s like those of [[Bariloche]] and the practice of [[smoking]] [[wild boar]] and [[red deer]] meat.

The original peoples had made their particular contributions, such as the [[curanto]], [[el ñaco]] (a kind of [[porridge]]), breads and cakes made from flour composed of ''&quot;[[nuez]]&quot; de [[pehuén]]'', a [[candy]] called ''[[llao llao]]'', as well as the fruits of the [[Lenga Beech|lenga]] and [[calafate]].

The coastlines and lakes of this region have proven rich in fish and [[shellfish]], leading to extravagant preparation of [[seafood]]. It is common to find ''&quot;[[patés]]&quot;'', roasts and ''guisos'' of [[Lithodes santolla|''centolla'' (spider crab)]], [[squid]], [[octopus]], [[pollock]], [[salmon]], [[trout]]s, ''[[corvina]]s'', [[oyster]]s, and so forth.

The cold weather is a good &quot;excuse&quot; for the consumption of spirits, the Andean portion of Patagonia produces their crafted [[beer]]s, and the current trends compare those found in Ireland and [[Central Europe]]. In the valleys of the [[Río Negro y Neuquén]] (ultimately going into northwest Chubut) fine white wines such as [[Riesling]] are made, being perhaps the most southern [[vineyard]]s in the world.

Characteristically, in the southern part of Argentina, besides cattle roast, there are pig roasts, goat roasts, and especially &quot;[[corderito patagónico]]&quot; (Patagonic lamb), ''[[ñandú]]'' ([[rhea (bird)|rhea]]), and &quot;[[ciervo patagónico]]&quot; (Patagonic deer).

== Other foods and beverages ==
[[File:Coto.jpg|thumb|210px|''Coto'', a supermarket chain popular in Argentina. Argentines spend less than a third of their food expenditures in supermarkets, preferring smaller venues.]][[File:Gato negro.jpg|thumb|210px|''El Gato Negro'' Café and spice shop (Buenos Aires).]]
Though a review of the cuisine of Argentina and its principal regions has been assembled, with abundant information, it would be incomplete if the article mentioned only the foods and beverages already cited.

For example, though the importance of the production and consumption of [[wine]] (''vino'') has been discussed, it is important to note that beer (''cerveza''; the Italian ''[[birra]]'' is frequently used) in the second half of the 20th century (at the least) and in the first five years of the 21st, competes with wine in popularity. Breweries appeared in Argentina at the end of the 1860s, started by [[Alsace|Alsatian]] colonists; the first were almost in the downtown of Buenos Aires (''el égido de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires''), and soon [[Poland|Polish]] brewers began industrial production of beer: [[San Carlos, Mendoza|San Carlos]] in the province of Santa Fe, [[Río Segundo]] and Córdoba in the province of Córdoba, [[Quilmes]] ([[Cerveza Quilmes|Quilmes beer]]) and [[Lavallol]] on the outskirts of [[La Plata]] (in Buenos Aires Province), [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] in the province of Tucumán and on the outskirts of the cities of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and [[Salta]].
[[File:Petit Verdot.jpg|thumb|left|210px|''Petit Verdot'' in a glass, [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], Argentina.]][[File:Cerveceria Quilmes.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Quilmes beer, the most-widely consumed in Argentina.]]
The local consumption of beer has risen dramatically in the last generation: Argentines consumed 233 million liters in 1980 and 1.57 billion in 2007 (40 liters per capita).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mecon.gov.ar/peconomica/basehome/infoeco.html Ministry of the Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; Outpacing that of wine since 2001, the growing production and consumption of beer has supported the existence of related events, for example the so-called ''[[Oktoberfest]]s'' (sic) or &quot;''[[Fiestas de la Cerveza]]''&quot; in locations that have a significant [[Germans|German]] population ([[Villa General Belgrano]] in Córdoba, [[San Carlos, Santa Fe|San Carlos]] and [[Esperanza, Santa Fe|Esperanza]] in the province of Santa Fe, etc.). Such celebrations copy, in an Argentine manner, [[Munich]]'s ''Oktoberfest'', and similarly are tourist attractions. However, the presence of a vigorous population of [[Celt]]ic lineage, principally of Irish origin, has supported the creation of other celebrations of beer, often for marketing purposes, such as [[Saint Patrick's Day]] (''[[Día de San Patricio]]''), patron of Ireland, which is celebrated with abundant libations.

The consumption of alcoholic beverages in Argentina is similar to that of the United States and somewhat lower than the Western Europe average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_status_report_2004_overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Argentines enjoy a variety of alcoholic beverages and Argentina can boast a varied array of ''elaboraciones'', whether industrial or [[artisanal]]. Besides beer and wine, Argentines frequently drink [[cider]] (here again, the heritage comes from Spain and Italy, more precisely from [[Asturias]] and [[Campania]]). Cider is the most popular beverage of the middle and lower economic classes at Christmas and [[New Year]] (the upper classes proverbially preferring to celebrate with locally produced [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], although real old-line &quot;[[Creole peoples|creole]]&quot; aristocrats will still drink cider, which is much more traditional).

Other widely consumed spirits are ''[[aguardiente]]'' (firewater) made from [[sugar cane]], known as ''[[caña quemada]]'' (&quot;burnt cane&quot;) or, simply, ''[[caña]]'' (&quot;cane&quot;). (Although &quot;caña&quot; is really derived from &quot;[[cognac]]&quot; and was traditionally used in old Argentina for any [[brandy]], but especially peach brandy, ''[[caña de durazno]]''.) A folkloric note about ''caña quemada'': until June 21 it is traditional to drink ''caña quemada'' with ''[[ruda macho]]'' (a variant of [[common rue]]), it is supposed that this mixture prevents the [[flu]] and other illnesses. ''Caña'' competes, mainly in rural areas, with [[gin]] (&quot;ginebra&quot;—as in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] kind of gin.)

There are many artisanally produced [[liqueur]]s (distilled, flavored [[alcohol]]ic beverages) in Argentina, for example those flavored with [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[egg (food)|egg]], [[anise]], coffee, cherry and, inevitably, ''dulce de leche''. The ''[[Hesperidina]]'' is a type of liqueur made from orange peels, invented in Argentina around 1890. One may also encounter ''[[chitronchelo]]'' or (in Italian) ''[[citroncello]]'', based on lemon. This beverage arrived with immigrants from the [[Mezzogiorno]], and is produced both artisanally and industrially (for example, at [[Mar del Plata]]).

== Non-alcoholic specialties ==
[[File:Boldo.jpg|thumb|210px|An infusion of [[Peumus boldus|boldo]], a digestive tea popular in many Latin cultures.]]
Argentines enjoy a wide variety of non-alcoholic infusions (although now and then both &quot;families&quot; are mixed; the ''[[yerbiao]]'' for example, is mate mixed with ''caña'' or gin). Among these, mate has long been the most widely enjoyed; in 2006, over 700,000 metric tons were harvested in Argentina, mostly for domestic consumption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indec.mecon.ar/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mate 02.jpg|thumb|left|Steaming [[yerba mate]] in its traditional gourd. The bitter tea is a ubiquitous drink in Argentina and neighboring areas to the east.]]
The fact that mate is so prevalent in the ''[[Southern Cone]]'', however, must not lure visitors into thinking that other infusions are rare in the region; in Argentina especially, given that there is a strong European cultural imprint, the consumption of coffee is very common (141 cups per capita, annually).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.federicosanchez.info/2002/07/20/%C2%BFel-negocio-del-cafe-en-argentina-puede-seguir-creciendo/ El negocio del café en la Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt; Chocolate [[infusions]] are also popular (the eating of chocolate is a Spanish influence—although the plant originated in [[Mesoamerica]]), this consumption grows during autumn and winter, or in the cold regions of the country; there are two dates where consumption of chocolate infusions is traditional in the primary educational centres: 25 May and 9 July, that is, the two national dates of Argentina.

English cultural influence (reinforced at the end of the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th by British contacts with the [[Far East]]) has also made the consumption of [[tea]] very common.

To conclude the summary of infusions consumed in Argentina, it must be said that [[medicinal herbs]] are common in the whole country; among the most popular are: [[chamomile]], [[lanceleaf]], ''[[boldo]]'', ''[[poleo]]'', ''[[peperina]]'', ''[[carqueja]]'', [[thyme]], ''[[canchalagua]]'', [[rue]] (''macho'' and ''hembra'', that is, &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;), [[Malva|mallow]], [[rosemary]], [[passion flower]], ''[[bira bira]]'', ''[[palán palán]]'', ''[[muña muña]]'', to mention only the main ones. Many of these herbs are also used in [[apéritif]]s and [[bitters]], whether alcoholic or not.

== Popular short-order dishes ==
[[File:BarBritanico.JPG|thumb|210px|''Bar Britanico'', Buenos Aires. These &quot;bars&quot; are typically more akin to [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British]] &quot;[[pubs]]&quot; and are popular at lunchtime.]]
Common ''restoranes'' or ''[[restaurant]]es'' and ''[[rotiseria]]s'' nearly anywhere in Argentina today serve (into the small hours) quickly prepared meals that in the course of the 20th century came to be known as ''[[minutas]]'', &quot;short-order dishes.&quot; Some of the dishes included in the category of ''minutas'' are ''[[Milanesa|milanesas]]'', ''churrascos'', ''bifes'', ''[[escalopes]]'', ''[[tallarines]]'', ''[[ravioles]]'', ''[[ñoquis]]'', although some are very typical of locations that sell food: &quot;''[[bifes a caballo]]''&quot; (beef [[steak]] with two [[fried egg]]s), &quot;''[[milanesa a caballo]]''&quot;, &quot;''[[milanesa completa]]''&quot; (a ''milanesa'' with two fried eggs and a [[garnish (food)|garnish]] of [[french fries|fries]]), &quot;''[[revuelto Gramajo]]''&quot;, &quot;''[[colchón de arvejas]]''&quot;, &quot;''[[suprema de pollo]]''&quot; (a kind of chicken ''milanesa''), ''[[matambre]]s'', &quot;''[[lengua a la vinagreta]]''&quot; and &quot;[[sandwich]]es&quot; ([[sandwiches de miga]]).

The variety of &quot;sandwiches&quot; (called thus in Argentina, as opposed to the Spanish ''[[emparedado]]'') are nearly infinite. The most common are those made of ''milanesa'', [[baked ham]] and cheese, ''[[pan de miga]]'', [[toast]], ''[[pebete]]s'', ''[[pancho (food)|pancho]]s'', ''[[choripan]]es'', ''[[morcipan]]es'', etc.; from [[Montevideo]] comes a different species of sandwich called the ''[[chivito (sandwich)|chivito]]'', even though it contains no goat meat.
[[File:Picadacordobesa.JPG|thumb|left|210px|A ''Picada'', the Italian-influenced between-meals standby.]]
Also worth mentioning are ''picadas'', which are consumed at home or in [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], [[café]]s, &quot;''[[cafetines]]''&quot; and &quot;''[[bodegones]]''&quot;; they consist of an ensemble of plates containing cubes of cheese (typically from [[Mar del Plata]] or [[Chubut Province|Chubut]]), pieces of [[salame]], [[olive]]s in [[brine]], french fries, ''[[maníes]]'' ([[peanut]]s), etc.; ''[[picada]]''s are eaten accompanied by an alcoholic beverage (&quot;''[[fernet]]''&quot;, beer, wine with [[Carbonated water|soda]], to give some common examples).

To conclude, it should be noted that the people of Argentina greatly enjoy ''[[helado (food)|helado]]'' (ice cream, [[sorbet]], etc.), especially the Italian kind. This fondness is not new: from the time of the Spanish colonies there has existed a type of [[sorbet]] made from fallen [[hail]] or snow. (This has been documented; desserts were made with snow in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] at the beginning of the 19th century.)

In most parts of Argentina, lunch is the biggest meal of the day. Most of the cities (excluding Buenos Aires) close for lunch time. This is when most people return home to enjoy a large meal. Traditional lunches in Argentina are long and well developed. Most of the popular food has European roots. Lots of meats, pastas and breads are included in an Argentina diet.

An '''''ad hominem''''' ([[Latin]]: &quot;to the man&quot;), short for '''''argumentum ad hominem''''', is an attempt to link the [[validity]] of a [[premise]] to a characteristic or belief of the person advocating the premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/ad-hominem |title=ad hominem: West's Encyclopedia of American Law |publisher=Answers.com |date=2007-09-10 |accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ad hominem'' is normally described as a logical [[fallacy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Doug Walton|Walton, Douglas]] |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not always fallacious; in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walton, Douglas |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is essential to understanding certain moral issues, and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic reasoning]] of [[naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles Taylor (philosopher) |last=Taylor |first=Charles |chapter=Explanation and Practical Reason |title=Philosophical Arguments |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1997 |pages=34–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
===Abusive===
Abusive ''ad hominem'' (also called personal abuse or personal attacks) usually involves insulting or belittling one's opponent in order to invalidate their argument, but can also involve pointing out factual but apparent character flaws or actions that are irrelevant to the opponent's argument. This tactic is logically fallacious because insults and negative facts about the opponent's personal character have nothing to do with the logical merits of the opponent's arguments or assertions.

'''Examples:'''
* &quot;You can't believe Jack when he says the proposed policy would help the economy. He doesn't even have a job.&quot;
* &quot;Candidate Jane's proposal about zoning is ridiculous. She was caught cheating on her taxes in 2003.&quot;

An abusive ad hominem can apply to a judgment of cultural works or academic efforts  based on the behavior or unconventional political beliefs of an artist, author, or musician, or the taste of an infamous person who loved a certain work.

'''Examples:'''

* [[Jimi Hendrix]] died of a drug overdose, so his music was worthless.
* [[Leni Riefenstahl]] was a Nazi, so her film [[The Triumph of the Will]] is devoid of merit.
* [[Sylvia Plath]] was a depressive who eventually committed suicide, so her works are unreadable.
* That [[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]] was the favorite opera of [[Josef Stalin]] indicates the worthlessness of the opera.
* What [[Ted Kaczynski]] wrote about boundary conditions in mathematics is shown false due to his crimes.
* White men are &quot;privileged&quot;, so they can't comment on female oppression.

===Circumstantial===
''Ad hominem'' circumstantial points out that someone is in circumstances such that he is disposed to take a particular position. ''Ad hominem'' circumstantial constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument false; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).&lt;ref name=&quot;Walton (1998) p18-21&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Ad Hominem Arguments |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8173-0922-5 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstantial fallacy applies only where the source taking a position is only making a logical argument from premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of  the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallacy Files&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Examples''':

[[Mandy Rice-Davies]]'s famous testimony during the [[Profumo Affair]], &quot;Well, he would [say that], wouldn't he?&quot;, is an example of a valid circumstantial argument. Her point was that since a man in a prominent position, accused of an affair with a [[callgirl]], would deny the claim whether it was true or false, his denial, in itself, carries little evidential weight against the claim of an affair.  Note, however, that this argument is valid only insofar as it devalues the denial; it does ''not'' bolster the original claim.  To construe evidentiary invalidation of the denial as evidentiary validation of the original claim is fallacious (on several different bases, including that of argumentum ad hominem); however likely the man in question would be to deny an affair that did in fact happen, he could only be more likely to deny an affair that never did.

'''Conflict of Interest''': Where a source seeks to convince by a claim of authority or by personal observation, identification of conflicts of interest are not ''ad hominem'' – it is generally well accepted that an &quot;authority&quot; needs to be objective and impartial, and that an audience can only evaluate information from a source if they know about conflicts of interest that may affect the objectivity of the source. Identification of a conflict of interest is appropriate, and concealment of a conflict of interest is a problem.

===Tu quoque===
{{Main|Tu quoque}}
''Ad hominem [[tu quoque]]'' (literally: &quot;You too!&quot;) refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument. In particular, if Source A criticizes the actions of Source B, a ''tu quoque'' response is that Source A has acted in the same way.  This argument is fallacious because it does not disprove the argument; if the premise is true then Source A may be a hypocrite, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective.  Indeed, Source A may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.

For example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.

===Guilt by association===
{{Main|Association fallacy}}
Guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walton (1998) p18-21&quot;/&gt;

This form of the argument is as follows:

:Source S makes claim C.
:Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.
:Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to the group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.

==Common misconceptions==

Gratuitous [[verbal abuse]] or &quot;name-calling&quot; itself is ''not'' an ''ad hominem'' or a [[logical fallacy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallacy Files&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;plover.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plover.net/~bonds/adhominem.html |title=Ad Hominem |publisher=Plover.net |accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theautonomist.com/aaphp/permanent/fallacies.php#adhom |title=Logic Fallacies |publisher=The Autonomist |accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/Logic/Informal/AdHominem.html |title=AdHominem |publisher=Drury.edu |accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/ad-hominem/ |title=Logical Fallacies» Ad Hominem (Personal Attack) |publisher=Logicalfallacies.info |accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to be confused with a true fallacy, which would be &quot;X is idiotically ignorant [of politics], so why should we listen to him now?&quot;

To '''analyze an algorithm''' is to determine the amount of resources (such as time and storage) necessary to execute it. Most [[algorithm]]s are designed to work with inputs of arbitrary length. Usually the efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps ([[time complexity]]) or storage locations (space complexity).

Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader [[computational complexity theory]], which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given computational problem. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for efficient algorithms.

In theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. [[Big O notation]], omega notation and theta notation are used to this end. For instance, [[binary search]] is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the list being searched, or in O(log(n)), colloquially &quot;in logarithmic time&quot;. Usually [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] estimates are used because different [[implementation]]s of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency. However the efficiencies of any two &quot;reasonable&quot; implementations of a given algorithm are related by a constant multiplicative factor  called a ''hidden constant''.

Exact (not asymptotic) measures of efficiency can sometimes be computed but they usually require certain assumptions concerning the particular implementation of the algorithm, called [[model of computation]]. A model of computation may be defined in terms of an [[abstract machine|abstract computer]], e.g., [[Turing machine]], and/or by postulating that certain operations are executed in unit time.
For example, if the sorted list to which we apply binary search has ''n'' elements, and we can guarantee that each lookup of an element in the list can be done in unit time, then at most log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''n'' + 1 time units are needed to return an answer.
&lt;!-- Exact measures of efficiency are useful to the people who actually implement and use algorithms, because they are more precise and thus enable them to know how much time they can expect to spend in execution. To some people (e.g. game programmers), a hidden constant can make all the difference between success and failure.--&gt;

== Cost models ==
Time efficiency estimates depend on what we define to be a step. For the analysis to correspond usefully to the actual execution time, the time required to perform a step must be guaranteed to be bounded above by a constant. One must be careful here; for instance, some analyses count an addition of two numbers as one step. This assumption may not be warranted in certain contexts. For example, if the numbers involved in a computation may be arbitrarily large, the time required by a single addition can no longer be assumed to be constant.

Two cost models are generally used:&lt;ref name=&quot;AhoHopcroft1974&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred V. Aho|author2=John E. Hopcroft|author3=Jeffrey D.

* the '''uniform cost model''', also called '''uniform-cost measurement''' (and similar variations), assigns a constant cost to every machine operation, regardless of the size of the numbers involved
* the '''logarithmic cost model''', also called '''logarithmic-cost measurement''' (and variations thereof), assigns a cost to every machine operation proportional to the number of bits involved

The latter is more cumbersome to use, so it's only employed when necessary, for example in the analysis of [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] algorithms, like those used in [[cryptography]].

A key point which is often overlooked is that published lower bounds for problems are often given for a model of computation that is more restricted than the set of operations that you could use in practice and therefore there are algorithms that are faster than what would naively be thought possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/608/examples-of-the-price-of-abstraction Examples of the price of abstraction?], cstheory.stackexchange.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Run-time analysis==
Run-time analysis is a theoretical classification that estimates &amp; anticipates the increase in ''[[DTIME|running time]]'' (or run-time) of an [[algorithm]] as its ''[[Information|input size]]'' (usually denoted as ''n'') increases.  Run-time efficiency is a topic of great interest in [[computer science]]:  A [[Computer program|program]] can take seconds, hours or even years to finish executing, depending on which algorithm it implements (see also [[performance analysis]], which is the analysis of an algorithm's run-time in practice).

===Shortcomings of empirical metrics===

Since algorithms are [[platform-independent]] (i.e. a given algorithm can be implemented in an arbitrary [[programming language]] on an arbitrary [[computer]] running an arbitrary [[operating system]]), there are significant drawbacks to using an [[empirical]] approach to gauge the comparative performance of a given set of algorithms.

Take as an example a program that looks up a specific entry in a [[collation|sorted]] [[list (computing)|list]] of size ''n''.  Suppose this program were implemented on Computer A, a state-of-the-art machine, using a [[linear search]] algorithm, and on Computer B, a much slower machine, using a [[binary search]] algorithm.  [[benchmark (computing)|Benchmark testing]] on the two computers running their respective programs might look something like the following:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! ''n'' (list size)
! Computer A run-time&lt;br /&gt;(in [[nanosecond]]s)
! Computer B run-time&lt;br /&gt;(in [[nanosecond]]s)
|-
| 15
| 7 ns
| 100,000 ns
|-
| 65
| 32 ns
| 150,000 ns
|-
| 250
| 125 ns
| 200,000 ns
|-
| 1,000
| 500 ns
| 250,000 ns
|}

Based on these metrics, it would be easy to jump to the conclusion that ''Computer A'' is running an algorithm that is far superior in efficiency to that of ''Computer B''.  However, if the size of the input-list is increased to a sufficient number, that conclusion is dramatically demonstrated to be in error:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! ''n'' (list size)
! Computer A run-time&lt;br /&gt;(in [[nanosecond]]s)
! Computer B run-time&lt;br /&gt;(in [[nanosecond]]s)

| 31,536 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; ns,&lt;br /&gt;or 1 year
| 1,375,000 ns,&lt;br /&gt;or 1.375 milliseconds
|}

Computer A, running the linear search program, exhibits a [[linear]] growth rate.  The program's run-time is directly proportional to its input size.  Doubling the input size doubles the run time, quadrupling the input size quadruples the run-time, and so forth.  On the other hand, Computer B, running the binary search program, exhibits a [[logarithm]]ic growth rate.  Doubling the input size only increases the run time by a [[wiktionary:Constant|constant]] amount (in this example, 50,000 ns).  Even though Computer A is ostensibly a faster machine, Computer B will inevitably surpass Computer A in run-time because it's running an algorithm with a much slower growth rate.

===Orders of growth===
{{main|Big O notation}}
Informally, an algorithm can be said to exhibit a growth rate on the order of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] if beyond a certain input size ''n'', the function ''f(n)'' times a positive constant provides an [[Asymptotic analysis|upper bound or limit]] for the run-time of that algorithm.  In other words, for a given input size ''n'' greater than some ''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a constant ''c'', the running time of that algorithm will never be larger than ''c &amp;times; f(n)''.  This concept is frequently expressed using Big O notation.  For example, since the run-time of [[insertion sort]] [[quadratic growth|grows quadratically]] as its input size increases, insertion sort can be said to be of order ''O(n²)''.

Big O notation is a convenient way to express the [[Best, worst and average case|worst-case scenario]] for a given algorithm, although it can also be used to express the average-case &amp;mdash; for example, the worst-case scenario for [[quicksort]] is ''O(n²)'', but the average-case run-time is ''O(n log n)''.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''lg'' is often used as shorthand for log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluating run-time complexity ===
The run-time complexity for the worst-case scenario of a given algorithm can sometimes be evaluated by examining the structure of the algorithm and making some simplifying assumptions.  Consider the following [[pseudocode]]:

 1    ''get a positive integer from input''
 2    '''if''' n &gt; 10
 3        '''print''' &quot;This might take a while...&quot;
 4    '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' n
 5        '''for''' j = 1 '''to''' i
 6            '''print''' i * j
 7    '''print''' &quot;Done!&quot;

A given computer will take a [[DTIME|discrete amount of time]] to execute each of the [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] involved with carrying out this algorithm.  The specific amount of time to carry out a given instruction will vary depending on which instruction is being executed and which computer is executing it, but on a conventional computer, this amount will be [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]].&lt;ref&gt;However, this is not the case with a [[quantum computer]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Say that the actions carried out in step 1 are considered to consume time T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, step 2 uses time T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and so forth.

In the algorithm above, steps 1, 2 and 7 will only be run once.  For a worst-case evaluation, it should be assumed that step 3 will be run as well.  Thus the total amount of time to run steps 1-3 and step 7 is:

:&lt;math&gt;T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7. \,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[program loop|loops]] in steps 4, 5 and 6 are trickier to evaluate.  The outer loop test in step 4 will execute ( n + 1 )
times (note that an extra step is required to terminate the for loop, hence n + 1 and not n executions), which will consume T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;( n + 1 ) time.  The inner loop, on the other hand, is governed by the value of i, which [[iteration|iterates]] from 1 to n.  On the first pass through the outer loop, j iterates from 1 to 1:  The inner loop makes one pass, so running the inner loop body (step 6) consumes T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; time, and the inner loop test (step 5) consumes 2T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; time.  During the next pass through the outer loop, j iterates from 1 to 2:  the inner loop makes two passes, so running the inner loop body (step 6) consumes 2T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; time, and the inner loop test (step 5) consumes 3T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; time.

Altogether, the total time required to run the inner loop body can be expressed as an [[arithmetic progression]]:

:&lt;math&gt;T_6 + 2T_6 + 3T_6 + \cdots + (n-1) T_6 + n T_6&lt;/math&gt;

which can be [[factorization|factored]]&lt;ref&gt;It can be proven by [[Mathematical induction|induction]] that &lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n-1) + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;T_6 \left[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n-1) + n \right] = T_6 \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] &lt;/math&gt;

The total time required to run the inner loop test can be evaluated similarly:

:&lt;math&gt;2T_5 + 3T_5 + 4T_5 + \cdots + (n-1) T_5 + n T_5 + (n + 1) T_5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; = T_5 + 2T_5 + 3T_5 + 4T_5 + \cdots + (n-1)T_5 + nT_5 + (n+1)T_5 - T_5&lt;/math&gt;

which can be factored as

:&lt;math&gt;T_5 \left[ 1+2+3+\cdots + (n-1) + n + (n + 1) \right] - T_5 = T_5 \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n + 2) \right] - T_5&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the total running time for this algorithm is:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 + (n + 1)T_4 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2+3n+2) \right] T_5 - T_5&lt;/math&gt;

which [[reduction (mathematics)|reduces]] to

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7
&lt;/math&gt;

As a [[rule-of-thumb]], one can assume that the highest-order term in any given function dominates its rate of growth and thus defines its run-time order.  In this example, n² is the highest-order term, so one can conclude that f(n) = O(n²).  Formally this can be proven as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Prove that &lt;math&gt;\left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \le cn^2,\ n \ge n_0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\le ( n^2 + n )T_6 + ( n^2 + 3n )T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7&lt;/math&gt; (''for n ≥ 0'')

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let k be a constant greater than or equal to [T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;..T&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_6( n^2 + n ) + T_5( n^2 + 3n ) + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \le k( n^2 + n ) + k( n^2 + 3n ) + kn + 5k&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;= 2kn^2 + 5kn + 5k \le 2kn^2 + 5kn^2 + 5kn^2&lt;/math&gt; (''for n ≥ 1'') &lt;math&gt;= 12kn^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore &lt;math&gt;\left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + n) \right] T_6 + \left[ \frac{1}{2} (n^2 + 3n) \right] T_5 + (n + 1)T_4 + T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_7 \le cn^2, n \ge n_0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;c = 12k, n_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A more [[elegance|elegant]] approach to analyzing this algorithm would be to declare that [T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;..T&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] are all equal to one unit of time greater than or equal to [T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;..T&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;].{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}  This would mean that the algorithm's running time breaks down as follows:&lt;ref&gt;This approach, unlike the above approach, neglects the constant time consumed by the loop tests which terminate their respective loops, but it is [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] to prove that such omission does not affect the final result&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;4+\sum_{i=1}^n i\leq 4+\sum_{i=1}^n n=4+n^2\leq5n^2&lt;/math&gt; (''for n ≥ 1'') &lt;math&gt;=O(n^2).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Growth rate analysis of other resources===
The methodology of run-time analysis can also be utilized for predicting other growth rates, such as consumption of [[DSPACE|memory space]].  As an example, consider the following pseudocode which manages and reallocates memory usage by a program based on the size of a [[computer file|file]] which that program manages:

 '''while''' (''file still open'')
     '''let''' n = ''size of file''
     '''for''' ''every 100,000 [[kilobyte]]s of increase in file size''
         ''double the amount of memory reserved''

In this instance, as the file size n increases, memory will be consumed at an [[exponential growth]] rate, which is order O(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is an extremely rapid and most likely unmanageable growth rate for consumption of memory [[Resource (computer science)|resources]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance==
Algorithm analysis is important in practice because the accidental or unintentional use of an inefficient algorithm can significantly impact system performance. In time-sensitive applications, an algorithm taking too long to run can render its results outdated or useless. An inefficient algorithm can also end up requiring an uneconomical amount of computing power or storage in order to run, again rendering it practically useless.

'''Ælle''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|æ|l|ə}}; also '''Aelle''' or '''Ella''') is recorded in early sources as the first [[King (monarch)|king]] of the [[Kingdom of Sussex|South Saxons]], reigning in what is now called [[Sussex]], England, from 477 to perhaps as late as 514.  The information about him is so limited that it cannot be said with certainty that Ælle existed.

Ælle and three of his sons are reported to have arrived from the continent near what is now [[Selsey Bill]]&amp;mdash;the exact location is under the sea, and is probably the shoals currently known as [[the Owers]]&amp;mdash;and fought against the [[Brython|Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;King (1863) .Channel Pilot of South West and South Coast of England. Part 1. pp 193 - 202.  The Admiralty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heron-Allen. Selsey Bill. Historic and Prehistoric.  Duckworth.  Ch.VII pp 88-90 Heron-Allen discusses the confusion by historians about the location of Cymens'ora and argues the case for it being Keynor&lt;/ref&gt; A victory in 491 at present day [[Pevensey]] is said to have ended with the Saxons slaughtering their opponents to the last man.  Although the details of these traditions cannot be verified, evidence from the place names of Sussex does make it clear that it was an area with extensive and early settlement by the Saxons, supporting the idea that this was one of their early conquests.

Ælle was the first king recorded by the 8th century chronicler [[Bede]] to have held &quot;[[imperium]]&quot;, or overlordship, over other [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms.&lt;ref name=Bede_111&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', II 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 9th-century [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] (around four hundred years after his time) Ælle is recorded as being the first [[bretwalda]], or &quot;Britain-ruler&quot;, though there is no evidence that this was a contemporary title.  Ælle's death is not recorded, and it is not known who succeeded him as king of the South Saxons.

==Historical context==
[[Image:Ella - John Speed.JPG|thumb|right|Imaginary depiction of Ælle from [[John Speed]]'s 1611 &quot;Saxon Heptarchy&quot;.]]
Ælle, if he existed, lived in the middle of the least-documented period in [[England|English]] history of the last two millennia.&lt;ref name=CampbellTAS20&gt;For example, James Campbell writes: &quot;The natural vice of historians is to claim to know about the past.  Nowhere is this claim more dangerous than when it is staked in [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] between AD 400 and 600&quot; (''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 5th century Britain had been [[Roman Britain|Roman]] for over three hundred and fifty years.  The most troublesome enemies of Roman Britain were the [[Pict]]s of central and northern [[Scotland]], and the [[Gaels]] known as [[Scoti]], who were raiders from [[Ireland]]. Also vexatious were the [[Saxons]], the name Roman writers gave to the peoples who lived in the northern part of what is now Germany and the southern part of the [[Jutland]] peninsula.  Saxon raids on the southern and eastern shores of England had been sufficiently alarming by the late 3rd century for the Romans to build the [[Saxon Shore Forts|Saxon Shore forts]], and subsequently to establish the role of the [[Count of the Saxon Shore]] to command the defence against these incursions.  Roman control of Britain finally ended in the early part of the 5th century; the date usually given as marking the end of Roman Britain is 410, when the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] sent letters to the British, urging them to look to their own defence.  Britain had been repeatedly stripped of troops to support usurpers' claims to the Roman empire, and after 410 the Roman armies never returned.&lt;ref name=Blair_IASE_1&gt;Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_13&gt;Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources for events after this date are extremely scarce, but a tradition, reported as early as the mid-6th century by a British priest named [[Gildas]], records that the British sent for help against the barbarians to [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], a Roman [[consul]], probably in the late 440s.  No help came.  Subsequently (and Gildas's information here is supplemented by other, later sources, such as the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]), a British leader named [[Vortigern]] is supposed to have invited continental mercenaries to help fight the Picts who were attacking from the north.  The leaders, whose names are recorded as [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]], rebelled, and a long period of warfare ensued.  The invaders&amp;mdash;[[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]], and [[Frisians]]&amp;mdash;gained control of parts of England, but lost a major battle at [[Mons Badonicus]] (the location of which is not known).  Some authors have speculated that Ælle may have led the Saxon forces at this battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradbury|first=James|title=The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare|pages=140|year=2004| location= New York|publisher=Routledge| isbn= 0-415-22126-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others reject the idea out of hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warner|first=Philip|title=British Battlefields: The Midlands|pages=23|year=1972|location=Reading|publisher=Osprey| oclc=60058359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British thus gained a respite, and peace lasted at least until the time [[Gildas]] was writing: that is, for perhaps forty or fifty years, from around the end of the 5th century until midway through the sixth.&lt;ref name=Blair_IASE_13&gt;Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_23&gt;Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'' p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Gildas's time the Anglo-Saxon advance was resumed, and by the late 6th century nearly all of southern England was under the control of the continental invaders.&lt;ref name=Blair_RBaEE_204&gt;Hunter Blair (''Roman Britain'', p. 204) gives the twenty-five years from 550 to 575 as the dates of the final conquest.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early sources==
[[Image:Parker chronicle f. 5a 455-490.gif|thumb|250px|right|A page from the [A] manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.  Ælle's name, spelled &quot;Elle&quot;, can be seen in two of the entries at the end of the page.  The last entry on the page, for 488, refers to events in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and does not mention Ælle.]]There are two early sources that mention Ælle by name.  The earliest is ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|The Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', a history of the English church written in 731 by [[Bede]], an English monk.  Bede mentions Ælle as one of the Anglo-Saxon kings who exercised what he calls &quot;imperium&quot; over &quot;all the provinces south of the river [[Humber]]&quot;; &quot;imperium&quot; is usually translated as &quot;overlordship&quot;.  Bede gives a list of seven kings who held &quot;imperium&quot;, and Ælle is the first of them.  The other information Bede gives is that Ælle was not a Christian&amp;mdash;Bede mentions a later king as &quot;the first to enter the kingdom of heaven&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bede_111 /&gt;

The second source is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals assembled in the Kingdom of [[Wessex]] in c. 890, during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]].  The Chronicle has three entries for Ælle, from 477 to 491, as follows:&lt;ref name=Swanton_14&gt;Translations are Michael Swanton's (''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 14), from the A text of the Chronicle; except that Frank M. Stenton's translation (''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 17–18) of part has been substituted to keep &quot;Andredes leag&quot; and &quot;Andredes cester&quot; in the text, for subsequent explanation.&lt;/ref&gt;

*477: Ælle and his 3 sons, Cymen and Wlencing and Cissa, came to the land of Britain with 3 ships at the place which is named [[Cymen's shore]], and there killed many Welsh and drove some to flight into the wood called Andredes leag.
*485: Here Ælle fought against the Welsh near the margin of Mearcred's Burn.
*491: Here Ælle and Cissa besieged Andredes cester, and killed all who lived in there; there was not even one Briton left there.

The Chronicle was put together about four hundred years after these events.  It is known that the annalists used material from earlier chronicles, as well as from oral sources such as sagas, but there is no way to tell where these lines came from.&lt;ref name=Swanton_xviii&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. xviii-xix&lt;/ref&gt;  It should also be noted that the terms 'British' and 'Welsh' were used interchangeably, as 'Welsh' is the Saxon word meaning 'foreigner', and was applied to all the native Romano-British of the era.&lt;ref name=Swanton_14_2&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the places named can be identified.  &quot;[[Cymen's shore]]&quot; (&quot;Cymenes ora&quot; in the original) now lies under the sea, but from later references it is clear it lay south of what is now Selsey Bill, just east of the [[Isle of Wight]].  Sandbanks&amp;mdash;the Middle and Outer Owers&amp;mdash;now mark the spot.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_176&gt;Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wood called &quot;Andredes leag&quot; is the [[Weald]], which at that time was a forest extending from north-west [[Hampshire]] all through northern Sussex; and &quot;Andredes cester&quot; is known to be [[Anderitum]], the Saxon Shore fort, built by the Romans, at [[Pevensey Castle]], just outside the town.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_176 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stenton_17&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;   This was later to be the Norman base before the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, which marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule.

[[Image:Owers sandbanks map 1780.gif|thumb|250px|left|A detail from a 1780 map, showing the Isle of Wight, Selsey Bill, and the Owers sandbanks to the south. Pevensey is about thirty miles to the east, along the coast.]]The Chronicle mentions Ælle once more under the year 827, where he is listed as the first of the eight &quot;[[bretwaldas]]&quot;, or &quot;Britain-rulers&quot;.  The list consists of Bede's original seven, plus [[Egbert of Wessex]].&lt;ref name=Swanton_60&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been much scholarly debate over just what it meant to be a &quot;bretwalda&quot;, and the extent of Ælle's actual power in southern England is an open question.&lt;ref name=Blair_IASE_201&gt;Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_53&gt;Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is also noteworthy that there is a long gap between Ælle and the second king on Bede's list, [[Ceawlin of Wessex]], whose reign began in the late 6th century; this may indicate a period in which Anglo-Saxon dominance was interrupted in some way.&lt;ref name=Stenton_17 /&gt;

Earlier sources than Bede exist which mention the South Saxons, though they do not name Ælle.  The earliest reference is still quite late, however, at about 692: a charter of King [[Nothelm of Sussex|Nothelm]]'s, which styles him &quot;King of the South Saxons&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kirby_20&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charters are documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and which would be witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land.  They are one of the key documentary sources for Anglo-Saxon history, but no original charters survive from earlier than the end of the 7th century.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_14&gt;Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_95_2&gt;Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp.95–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other early writers whose works can shed light on Ælle's time, though they do not mention either him or his kingdom.  Gildas's description of the state of England in his time is useful for understanding the ebb and flow of the Anglo-Saxon incursions.  [[Procopius]], a [[Byzantine]] historian, writing not long after Gildas, adds to the meagre sources on population movement by including a chapter on England in one of his works.  He records that the peoples of Britain&amp;mdash;he names the English, the British, and the Frisians&amp;mdash;were so numerous that they were migrating to the kingdom of the Franks in great numbers every year.&lt;ref name=Blair_RBaEE_164&gt;Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is probably a reference to Britons emigrating to [[Armorica]] to escape the Anglo-Saxons. They subsequently gave their name to the area they settled as [[Brittany]], or ''Bretagne''.

==Evidence from place names in Sussex==
The early dates given in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the colonization of Sussex are supported by an analysis of the place names of the region.   The strongest evidence comes from place names that end in &quot;-ing&quot;, such as [[Worthing]] and [[Angmering]].  These are known to derive from an earlier form ending in &quot;-ingas&quot;.  &quot;[[Hastings]]&quot; for example, derives from &quot;Hæstingas&quot; which means &quot;the followers or dependents of a person named Hæsta&quot;.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_176_2&gt;Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', pp. 176–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

From west of Selsey Bill to east of Pevensey can be found the densest concentration of these names anywhere in Britain. There are a total of about forty-five place names in Sussex of this form, and the personal names from which these are derived appear in many cases to have gone out of current use before the 7th century, when written records appear again.  Hence it is generally accepted that these place names are evidence of the establishment of [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] communities with stable populations as early as the fifth and 6th centuries.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_176_2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blair_IASE_22&gt;Hunter Blair, ''An Introduction'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Sussex has unusually few place names of British origin.  This does not necessarily mean that the Saxons killed or drove out almost all of the native population, despite the slaughter of the Britons reported in the Chronicle entry for 491; however, it does imply that the invasion was on a scale that left little space for the British.&lt;ref name=Stenton_17 /&gt;

These lines of reasoning cannot prove the dates given in the Chronicle, much less the existence of Ælle himself, but they do support the idea of an early conquest and the establishment of a settled kingdom.&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_176_2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blair_IASE_22 /&gt;

==Reign==
[[Image:SE England Aelle.gif|thumb|250px|right|A map of south-eastern England showing places visited by Ælle, according to the [[Anglo-Saxon]] Chronicle, and the area of modern Sussex.]]If the dates given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle are accurate to within half a century, then Ælle's reign lies in the middle of the Anglo-Saxon expansion, and prior to the final conquest of the Britons.  It also seems consistent with the dates given to assume that Ælle's battles predate Mons Badonicus.  This in turn would explain the long gap, of fifty or more years, in the succession of the &quot;bretwaldas&quot;: if the peace gained by the Britons did indeed hold till the second half of the 6th century, it is not to be expected that an Anglo-Saxon leader should have anything resembling overlordship of England during that time. The idea of a pause in the Anglo-Saxon advance is also supported by the account in Procopius of 6th century migration from Britain to the kingdom of the [[Franks]].&lt;ref name=Stenton_17/&gt;  Procopius's account is consistent with what is known to be a contemporary colonization of [[Armorica]] (now [[Brittany]], in [[France]]); the settlers appear to have been at least partly from [[Dumnonia]] (modern [[Cornwall]]), and the area acquired regions known as Dumnonée and Cornouaille.&lt;ref name=Campbell_TAS_22&gt;Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems likely that something at that time was interrupting the general flow of the Anglo-Saxons from the continent to Britain.&lt;ref name=Stenton_12&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dates for Ælle's battles are also reasonably consistent with what is known of events in the kingdom of the Franks at that time.  [[Clovis I]] united the Franks into a single kingdom during the 480s and afterwards, and the Franks' ability to exercise power along the southern coast of the English channel may have diverted Saxon adventurers to England rather than the continent.&lt;ref name=Stenton_12 /&gt;

It is possible, therefore, that a historical king named Ælle existed, who arrived from the continent in the late 5th century, and who conquered much of what is now Sussex.  He may have been a prominent war chief with a leadership role in a federation of Anglo-Saxon groups fighting for territory in Britain at that time.  This may be the origin of the reputation that led Bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern Britain.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_17&gt;Fletcher, ''Who's Who'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The  battles listed in the Chronicle are compatible with a conquest of Sussex from west to east, against British resistance stiff enough to last fourteen years.&lt;ref name=Stenton_17 /&gt;  His area of military control may have extended as far as [[Hampshire]] and north to the upper [[Thames]] valley, but it certainly did not extend across all of England south of the Humber, as Bede asserts.&lt;ref name=Kirby_55&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ælle's death is not recorded by the Chronicle, which gives no information about him, or his sons, or the South Saxons until 675, when the South Saxon king [[Aethelwalh of Sussex|Æthelwalh]] was baptized.&lt;ref name=Stenton_12&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atari''' is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972. It is currently owned by Atari Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of the French publisher [[Atari, SA]] (ASA).&lt;ref name=subsidiary&gt;{{cite web|last = Atari Inc.|title = 10-KT · For 3/31/03|publisher=Atari Inc.|date = 2003-03-31|url =http://www.secinfo.com/dsvr4.28Z7.htm|accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Atari Inc.]] was founded in 1972 by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and Ted Dabney.

==History==

===Atari Inc. (1972–1984)===
{{Main|Atari, Inc.}}
In 1971, [[Nolan Bushnell]] and Ted Dabney founded an engineering firm, Syzygy Engineering,&lt;ref name=&quot;syzygy engineering&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Vendel| first = Curt| title = ATARI Coin-Op/Arcade Systems 1970 - 1974 | url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade70.html| accessdate = 2008-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that designed and built the first arcade video game - [[Computer Space]] for Nutting Associates. On June 27, 1972 Atari, Inc. was incorporated and soon hired [[Al Alcorn]] as their first design engineer. Bushnell decided to have Alcorn produce as a test of his abilities, an arcade version of the [[Magnavox Odyssey]]'s Tennis game,&lt;ref name=&quot;nolanmagnavox&quot;&gt;http://www.ralphbaer.com/video_game_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which would be named [[Pong]]. While Bushnell incorporated Atari in June 1972, Syzygy Company was never formally incorporated. Before Atari's official incorporation, Bushnell wrote down several words from the game [[Go (board game)|Go]], eventually choosing ''[[Go terms#Atari (当たり)|atari]]'', a term which in the context of the game means a state where a [[Rules of go#Stones|stone]] or group of stones is imminently in danger of being taken by one's opponent. In Japanese, ''atari'' is the nominalized form of ''ataru'' (verb), meaning &quot;to hit the target&quot; or &quot;to receive something fortuitously&quot;. The word 'atari' is used in Japanese when a prediction comes true or when someone wins a lottery. The choice of Atari as a brand name was arguably better than Syzygy for most markets in terms of spelling, pronunciation and potential name recognition. Atari was incorporated in the state of California on June 27, 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;inc1972&quot;&gt;[http://kepler.ss.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C0654542 California Secretary of State - California Business Search - Corporation Search Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The third version of the Atari [[Atari 2600|Video Computer System]] sold from 1980 to 1982]]
In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a &quot;competitor&quot; called [[Kee Games]], headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to circumvent [[pinball]] distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market (virtually) the same game to different distributors, with each getting an &quot;exclusive&quot; deal. Though Kee's relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari that same year.

In 1976, Bushnell, through a Grass Valley, CA. engineering firm - Cyan Engineering, started an effort to produce a flexible video game console that was capable of playing all four of Atari's then-current games. The result was the [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]], or &quot;VCS&quot; (Later renamed the Atari 2600 when the Atari 5200 was released). Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands, but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. Looking for outside investors, in 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to [[Time-Warner|Warner Communications]] for an estimated $28 – $32 million, using part of the money to buy the [[Folgers]] Mansion. Nolan continued to have disagreements with Warner Management over the direction of the company, the discontinuing of the Pinball division and most importantly, he felt that the Atari 2600 should be discontinued. In 1978, the Kee Games brand was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcurrent.name/atarihistory/atari.html A History of Atari / Atari Games / Atari Holdings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year during a heated argument between Nolan Bushnell and [[Manny Gerard]], Bushnell was fired.

A project to design a successor to the 2600 started as soon as the system shipped. The original development team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years, and decided to build the most powerful machine they could, given that time frame. Midway into the effort's time-frame, the [[home computer]] revolution was taking off, so the new machines were adapted, with the addition of a keyboard and various inputs, to produce the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]], and its smaller cousin, the 400. Although a variety of issues made them less attractive than the [[Apple II]] for some users, the new machines had some success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980. In 1982, the [[Atari 5200]] was released, based heavily on the 400 and 800 models, but without a keyboard.

Under Warner, Atari Inc. achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time. However, Atari Inc. ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its [[home computer]], [[video game console]], and [[Video arcade|arcade]] divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.

These problems were followed by the infamous [[video game crash of 1983]], with losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division.
In 1983, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari over an insider stock trading sale, and executives involved in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] lost track of the negotiations, and the deal eventually died. With Atari's further financial problems and the Famicom's runaway success in Japan after its July 16, 1983 release date, [[Nintendo]] decided to go it alone.

Financial problems continued to mount and Ray's successor, [[James J. Morgan]], had less than a year in which to tackle his predecessor's problems, he began a massive restructuring of the company and worked with Warner Communications in May 1984 to create &quot;NATCO&quot; which stood for New Atari Company which would further lean the company facilities, personnel and spending and make the company profit. Unknown to James Morgan and the senior management of Atari, Warner had been in talks with Tramel Technology to buy Atari's Consumer electronics and Home Computer divisions. Negotiating up until close to midnight of July 1, 1984 Jack Tramiel purchased Atari. Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to [[Jack Tramiel]] for $50 cash and $240 million in promisary notes and stocks, giving Warner a 20% stake in Atari Corporation &lt;ref name=&quot;sale&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name [[Atari Games]], but sold it to [[Namco]] in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling '''Ataritel''' to [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]].

===Atari Corporation (1984–1996)===
{{Main|Atari Corporation}}
[[Image:Atari 1040STf.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Atari ST]]

Under Tramiel's ownership, '''Atari Corp.''' used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development on a 16/32-bit computer system, the [[Atari ST]]. (&quot;ST&quot; stands for &quot;sixteen/thirty-two&quot;, referring to the machines' 16-bit bus and 32-bit processor core.) In April 1985, they released the first update to the 8-bit computer line - the Atari 65XE, the [[Atari XE]] series.  June 1985 saw the release of the Atari 130XE, Atari User Groups received early sneak-preview samples of the new Atari 520ST's, and major retailer shipments hit store shelves in September 1985 of Atari's new 32-bit [[Atari ST]] computers. In 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under Warner - the Atari 2600jr and the [[Atari 7800]] console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, earning a $25 million profit that year. 

In 1989, Atari released the [[Atari Lynx]], a handheld console with color graphics, to much fanfare. A shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season, and the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's [[Game Boy]] which, despite only having a black and white display, was cheaper, had better battery life and had much higher availability. Tramiel emphasized computers over game consoles but Atari's proprietary computer architecture and operating system fell victim to the success of the [[Wintel]] platform while the game market revived. In 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly.&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendosuit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In 1993, Atari positioned its [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] as the only 64-bit interactive media entertainment system available but it sold poorly. 

By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits&lt;ref name=&quot;segalawsuit&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Tramiel and his family also wanted out of the business. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with [[JT Storage|JTS Inc.]], a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp.&lt;ref name=&quot;jtmerger&quot;&gt;[http://contracts.onecle.com/atari/jt.mer.1996.04.08.shtml Sample Contracts - Agreement and Plan of Reorganization - Atari Corp. and JT Storage Inc. - Competitive Intelligence for Investors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Atari's role in the new company largely became that of holder for the Atari properties and minor support, and consequently the name largely disappeared from the market.

===As a division of Hasbro (1998–2001)===
{{Main|Atari Interactive}}
In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 million—less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the [[brand]] and [[intellectual property]], which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000 when French software publisher [[Infogrames]] took over [[Hasbro Interactive]].

===Atari Inc., a division of Atari, SA (2001-)===
{{Main|Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)}}
In October 2001 [[Infogrames]] (now Atari, SA) announced that it was &quot;reinventing&quot; the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On May 7, 2003, [[Infogrames]] had its majority-owned, but discrete US subsidiary Infogrames NA officially renamed '''Atari, Inc.''', renamed its European operations to Atari Europe but kept the original name of the main company [[Infogrames Entertainment]]. The original Atari holdings division purchased from Hasbro, [[Atari Interactive]], was also made a separate corporate entity.

In November 2006, Krome Studios had acquired Melbourne House from Atari and that the studio would be renamed to [[Krome Studios Melbourne]].

On November 13, 2007, The US division announces to exit the game development business to concentrate solely on publishing and distribution.

On March 6, 2008, Infogrames made an offer to Atari Inc. to buy out all remaining public shares for a value of $1.68 per share, or $11 million total. The offer would make Infogrames sole owner of Atari Inc., thus making it a privately held company.&lt;ref name=&quot;offer&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080529210707/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080306/nyth121.html?.v=101 Atari, Inc.

Namco Bandai has purchased a 34% stake in Atari Europe on May 14, 2009, paving the way for its acquisition from Infogrames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/namco-bandai-to-swallow-atari-europe|title=Namco Bandai To Swallow Atari Europe|accessdate=2009-05-30|date=2009-05-14|publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Atari has had significant financial issues for several years now, posting losses in the tens of millions since 2005.

===Atari, SA (2009-)===
{{Main|Atari, SA}}
In May 2009 Infogrames Entertainment, SA, the parent company of Atari Inc. and Atari Interactive Inc., announced it would be changing Infogrames' name to Atari, SA.
In April 2010, Atari board member, and former CEO David Gardner resigned. His replacement is Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/04/nolan-bushnell-rejoins-atari-phil-harrison-leaves.ars|title=Nolan Bushnell rejoins Atari, Phil Harrison leaves|author=Andrew Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The University==
[[Image:Uhall1.JPG|thumb|left|Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia.]]

Acadia University is located in the town of Wolfville, Nova Scotia, approximately 100 kilometres northwest of [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] the provincial capital. Founded in 1838 by the [[Baptist]] Community, Acadia's beginning was the result of the commitment and enthusiasm of a community determined to build a university. The University has been shaped by their spirit of hard work and dedication to the principles that everyone should have access to university regardless of gender, race or religious affiliations - a spirit which continues to guide the university today.

In 2010, Acadia was ranked second in [[Maclean's]] Magazine for Best Overall in the Primarily Undergraduate University category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macleans.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/111108_dundergradchart.jpg|title=Maclean's Undergrad Chart}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acadia also received several A-level grades in the [http://%5Bhttp://www.globecampus.ca/in-the-news/globecampusreport/university-report-e-zine-includes-the-latest-survey-results-on-which-schools-made-the-grade/ 2010 Globe and Mail Canadian University Report], receiving highest marks in six of seventeen categories. The university has emphasized a personalized education. Acadia's average class has 26 students, which helps to maintain an intimate learning environment for students.

==History==

Acadia University, established at [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia]] in 1838 has a strong [[Baptist]] religious affiliation. It was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008242 |title=University |author= |date= |work= |publisher= The Canadian Enxyclopedia|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acadia began as Horton Academy (1828), which was founded by [[Baptists]] from Nova Scotia and Queen's College (1838).&lt;ref name=&quot;Longley, R.

The two major Universities of the day in Nova Scotia were heavily controlled by Denominational structures. King's College ([[University of King's College]]) was an [[Anglican]] School and [[Dalhousie University]], which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the [[Church of Scotland]]. It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar, Edmund Crawley, to the Chair of [[Classics]], as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a College established and run by the Baptists.

In 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for Queen Victoria). The College began with 21 students in January 1839. The name &quot;Queen's College&quot; was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed &quot;Acadia College&quot; in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an [[Acadian]] settlement. Acadia College awarded its first degrees in 1843 and became Acadia University in 1891,&lt;ref name=&quot;Longley, R. S 1938&quot;/&gt; established by the Acadia University Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/58th_1st/1st_read/b044.htm |title=Acadia University Act (amended) |author= |date= |work=Bill No. 44 |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Granville Street Baptist Church (now [[First Baptist Church Halifax]]) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the University. It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development. Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president [[John Pryor]], were members of the First Baptist Church Halifax congregation. Similarly, the adjacent Wolfville United Baptist Church plays a significant role in the life of the university.

The original charter of the college stated:

{{quote|And be it further enacted, that no religious tests or subscriptions shall be required of the Professors Fellows, Scholars, Graduates or Officers of the said College; but that all the privileges and advantages thereof shall be open and free to all and every Person and Persons whomsoever, without regard to religious persuasion... And it shall and may be lawful for the trustees and Governors of the said College to select as Professors, and other Teaches or Officers, competent persons of any religious persuasion whatever, provided such person or persons shall be of moral and religious character.}}

This was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff.

Clara Belle Marshall, from [[Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia]], became the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eapps.ednet.ns.ca/HPIPublic/PropertyDisplay.aspx?Fid=00PNS0193 |title=Mount Hanley School Section Number 10 |author= |date= |work=Nova Scotia Historic Places Initiative Database |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The War Memorial Hall (more generally known as Memorial Hall), which is a residence, and War Memorial Gymnasium &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=1786 War Memorial Gymnasium&lt;/ref&gt;
are landmark buildings on the campus of Acadia University. The Memorial Hall and Gymnasium honours students who had enlisted and died in the [[First World War]], and in the [[Second World War]]. Two granite shafts, which are part of the War Memorial Gymnasium complex at Acadia University, are dedicated to the university's war dead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=1785 Acadia University memorial granite shafts&lt;/ref&gt; The War Memorial House is dedicated to the war dead from Acadia University during the Second World War &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=1787 Acadia University War memorial house&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the Baptist denomination relinquished direct control over the University. The denomination maintains nine seats on the University's Board of Governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/board/members.htm |title=Acadia University - Board of Governors |author=Mr. Paul Jewer, Board Chair |date= |work= |publisher=Acadia University |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2008, Dr. Gail Dinter-Gottlieb decided to step down as President and Vice Chancellor of the University before her term expired. Her resignation was effective February 29, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/whatsnew/newsrelease/2008/gail_gottlieb_steps_down_jan4.html |title=Acadia President to Step Down Ahead of Schedule |author=Scott Roberts |date=January 4, 2008 |work= |publisher=Arcadia University |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Ivany]] began his position as President and Vice-Chancellor on April 1, 2009.

===Faculty strikes===

Acadia University's Board of Governors and members of the Acadia University Faculty Association (AUFA) have ratified a new [http://www2.acadiau.ca/acadia-news-reader/items/board-and-faculty-sign-new-four-year-contract.html collective agreement news release] covering the period July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2014. The faculty of Acadia University have been on strike twice in the history of the institution. The first was February 24 to March 12, 2004. The second was October 15 to November 5, 2007. The second strike was resolved after the province's labour minister, [[Mark Parent]], appointed a mediator, on November 1, to facilitate an agreement.

==Academics==
===Profile===
As a primarily undergraduate institution, the university places significant importance on teaching and instruction.

{{quote|The mission of Acadia University is to provide a personalized and rigorous liberal education; promote a robust and respectful scholarly community; and inspire a diversity of students to become critical thinkers, lifelong learners, engaged citizens, and responsible global leaders.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/generalInfo/aboutAcadia/mission.html |title=University Mission Statement |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Acadia University |accessdate=30 August 2010}}  -&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculties===
Acadia is organized into four faculties: Arts, Pure &amp; Applied Science, Professional Studies and Theology. Each faculty is further divided into departments and schools specialized in areas of teaching and research. The Division of Research &amp; Graduate Studies is separate from the faculties and oversees graduate students as well as Acadia's research programs.

==Innovation==
===The Acadia Advantage===

In 1996, Acadia University pioneered the use of mobile computing technology in a post-secondary educational environment.

This academic initiative, named the Acadia Advantage, integrated the use of notebook computers into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching. By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were taking part in the initiative. The initiative went beyond leasing notebook computers to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond.

Because of its pioneering efforts, Acadia is a laureate of Washington’s Smithsonian Institution and a part of the permanent research collection of the National Museum of American History. It is the only Canadian university selected for inclusion in the Education and Academia category of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award.

In addition, Acadia University received the Pioneer Award for [[Ubiquitous computing|Ubiquitous Computing]]. In 2001, it achieved high rankings in the annual ''[[Maclean's]]'' University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum.

In October 2006, Dr. Dinter-Gottlieb established a commission to review the Acadia Advantage learning environment 10 years after inception. The mandate of the commission was to determine how well the current Advantage program meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff and to examine how the role of technology in the postsecondary environment has changed at Acadia, and elsewhere. The commission was asked to recommend changes and enhancements to the Acadia Advantage that would benefit the entire university community and ensure its sustainability.

Some of the recommendations coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased notebook computers to a student-owned computer model. The compelling rationale for this was the integral role technology now plays in our lives, which was not present in 1996.

The University was also advised to unbundle its tuition structure so that the cost of an Acadia education is more detailed and students can understand how their investment in the future of the school is allotted.  In September 2008, Acadia moved to a student-owned notebook computer version of the Acadia Advantage, now named Acadia Advantage 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/advantage |title=Acadia Advantage |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Acadia Advantage |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
Acadia's sports teams are called the [[Acadia Axemen|Axemen]] and [[Acadia Axewomen|Axewomen]]. They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].

School spirit abounds with men’s and women’s varsity teams that have delivered more conference and national championships than any other institution in Atlantic University Sport. Routinely, more than one-third of Acadia’s varsity athletes also achieve Academic All-Canadian designation through Canadian Interuniversity Sport by maintaining a minimum average of 80 per cent.

Expansion and modernization of [[Raymond Field]] was completed in the fall of 2007 and features the installation of an eight-lane all-weather running track and a move to the same premium artificial turf used by the New England Patriots of the [[National Football League]] for its main playing field. The Raymond Field modernization was a gift to the university by friends, alumni, and the province. War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams.

In September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tritons.ca |title=Wolfville Tritons Swim Club |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Acadia Masters Swim Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.ns.sympatico.ca/masters/ |title=Acadia Masters Swim Clug |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form the Acadia Swim Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://axe.acadiau.ca/swimclub/ |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14 year hiatus. On September 26, 2008, the university announced its intention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/sports/swim_returns.htm |title=Varsity Swim team returns to Acadia |author= |date=Friday, September 26, 2008 |work= |publisher=Acadia Sports Information |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to return swimming to a varsity status in September 2009.

==Fight song==
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games are: ''Stand Up and Cheer'', the Acadia University [[fight song]]. According to 'Songs of Acadia College' (Wolfville, NS 1902-3, 1907), the songs include: 'Acadia Centennial Song' (1938); 'The Acadia Clan Song'; 'Alma Mater - Acadia;' 'Alma Mater Acadia' (1938) and 'Alma Mater Song.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000759SUBReadings |title=College Songs and Songbooks |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
In 1974, Acadia was granted a coat of arms designed by the [[College of Arms]] in London, England. The coat of arms is two-tone, with the school's official colours, garnet and blue, on the shield. The axes represent the school's origins in a rural setting, and the determination of its founders who cleared the land and built the school on donated items and labour. The open books represent the intellectual pursuits of a university, and the wolves heads are a whimsical representation of the University's location in Wolfville.  &quot;In pulvere vinces&quot; (In dust you conquer) is the motto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.acadiau.ca/archives/research/fta/oct297.html Acadia University's Coat of Arms]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University seal depicts the Greek goddess of wisdom [[Athena]] in front of the first college hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acadiau.ca/chaplain/window.htm#third Description of stained glass windows in Manning Memorial Chapel. The seal is described in the third lancet, fourth panel.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University also uses a stylized &quot;A&quot; as a logo for its sports teams.

Notable among a number of [[fight song]]s commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games are: the Acadia University [[alma mater]] set to the tune of &quot;[[Annie Lisle]]&quot;. The lyrics are:

:Far above the dykes of Fundy
:And its basin blue
:Stands our noble alma mater
:Glorious to view

:Lift the chorus
:Speed it onward
:Sing it loud and free
:Hail to thee our alma mater
:Acadia, hail to thee

:Far above the busy highway
:And the sleepy town
:Raised against the arch of heaven
:Looks she proudly down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.acadiau.ca/archives/sporthistory/sound/Alma_Mater_Exerp.mp3 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Buildings==

Carnegie Hall, built in 1909, is a large, two-storey, Neo-classical brick building on the Registry of Historic Places of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage-display.aspx?id=4512 |title=Acadia Seminary Registry of Historic Places of Canada. |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seminary House, built in 1879, is on the [[Registry of Historic Places of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage-display.aspx?id=4575 |title=Acadia Seminary Registry of Historic Places of Canada |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the oldest residence in Canada. Seminary House is rumoured to be haunted, therefore, every Halloween, its residents transform the entire building into a Haunted House.

==Student life==

At Acadia University, students have access to the Student Union Building which serves as a hub for students and houses many Student Union organizations. The building also houses The Axe Lounge, a convenience store, an information desk and two food outlets. The university press, The Athenaeum, is a member of [[Canadian University Press|CUP]].

===Student government===

All students are represented by the [[Acadia Students' Union]] and the Union President for the 2010-2011 academic year is Jon Cottreau. The student newspaper is ''[[The Athenaeum (Acadia University)|The Athenaeum]].''
