==Financing==
[[File:CPRR Button 1867.jpg|left|thumb|CPRR logo on a gilded &quot;Staff&quot; uniform button (1867)]]Construction of the road was financed primarily by 30-year, 6% [[Government bonds|U.S. Government Bonds]] authorized by Sec. 5 of the [[Pacific Railway Acts|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]]. They were issued at the rate of $16,000 per mile of tracked grade completed West of the designated base of the [[Sierra Nevada Mountains]]. [http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1862-05] Sec. 11 of the Act also provided that the issuance of bonds &quot;shall be treble the number per mile&quot; (to $48,000) for tracked grade completed over and within the two mountain ranges (but limited to a total of {{convert|300|mi|km}} at this rate), and &quot;doubled&quot; (to $32,000) per mile of completed grade laid between the two mountain ranges. [http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1862-11] The U.S. Government Bonds, which constituted a lien upon the railroads and all their fixtures, were repaid in full (and with interest) by the company as and when they became due.

Sec. 10 of the 1864 amending Pacific Railroad Act (13 Statutes at Large, 356) additionally authorized the company to issue its own &quot;First Mortgage Bonds&quot;[http://cprr.org/Museum/Bond_Adv_CPRR_1867.html] in total amounts up to (but not exceeding) that of the bonds issued by the United States. Such company-issued securities had priority over the original Government Bonds.[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1864-10] (Local and state governments also aided the financing, although the City and County of San Francisco did not do so willingly. This materially slowed early construction efforts.) Sec. 3 of the 1862 Act granted the railroads {{convert|10|sqmi|km2|0}} of public land for every mile laid, except where railroads ran through cities and crossed rivers. This grant was apportioned in 5 sections on alternating sides of the railroad, with each section measuring {{convert|0.2|mi|m}} by {{convert|10|mi|km}}. [http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1862-03] These grants were later doubled to {{convert|20|sqmi|km2|0}} per mile of grade by the 1864 Act.

[[File:San Francisco Pacific Railroad Bond WPRR 1865.jpg|thumb|left|An 1865 San Francisco '''Pacific Railroad Bond''' approved in 1863 but delayed for two years by the opposition of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors]]Although the Pacific Railroad eventually benefited the Bay Area, the City and County of San Francisco obstructed financing it during the early years of 1863-1865. When Stanford was Governor of California, the Legislature passed on April 22, 1863, &quot;An Act to Authorize the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco to take and subscribe One Million Dollars to the Capital Stock of the Western Pacific Rail Road Company and the Central Pacific Rail Road Company of California and to provide for the payment of the same and other matters relating thereto&quot; (which was later amended by Section Five of the &quot;Compromise Act&quot; of April 4, 1864). On May 19, 1863, the electors of the City and County of San Francisco passed this bond by a vote of 6,329 to 3,116, in a highly controversial Special Election.

The City and County's financing of the investment through the issuance and delivery of Bonds was delayed for two years, when Mayor [[Henry P. Coon]], and the County Clerk, Wilhelm Loewy, each refused to countersign the Bonds. It took legal actions to force them to do so: in 1864 the Supreme Court of the State of California ordered them under Writs of Mandamus (''The People of the State of California ''ex rel'' the Central Pacific Railroad Company vs. Henry P. Coon, Mayor; Henry M. Hale, Auditor; and Joseph S. Paxson, Treasurer, of the City and County of San Francisco.'' 25 Cal. 635) and in 1865, a legal judgment against Loewy (''The People ''ex rel'' The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California vs. The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco, and Wilhelm Lowey, Clerk'' 27 Cal. 655) directing that the Bonds be countersigned and delivered. In 1863 the legislature's forcing of City and County action became known as the &quot;Dutch Flat Swindle&quot;. Critics claimed the CPRR intended to build a railroad only as far as Dutch Flat, to connect to the Dutch Flat Wagon Road which they already controlled.

Judah (''r'')]]A replica of the [[Sacramento, California]] Central Pacific Railroad passenger station is part of the [[California State Railroad Museum]], located in the [[Old Sacramento State Historic Park]].

Nearly all the company's early correspondence is preserved at [[Syracuse University]], as part of the Collis Huntington Papers collection. It has been released on microfilm (133 reels). The following libraries have the microfilm: [[University of Arizona]] at Tucson; and [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] at Richmond. Additional collections of manuscript letters are held at Stanford University and the [[Mariners' Museum]] at [[Newport News, Virginia]]. [[Alfred A. Hart]] was the official [[photographer]] of the CPRR construction.

==Locomotives==
The Central Pacific's first three locomotives were of the then common [[4-4-0]] type, although with the [[American Civil War]] raging in the east, they had difficulty acquiring engines from eastern builders, who at times only had smaller [[4-2-4]] or [[4-2-2]] types available. Until the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental rail link]] and the railroad's opening of its own shops, all locomotives had to be purchased by builders in the northeastern U.S. The engine's had to be dismantled, loaded on a ship, which would embark on a four month journey that went around [[Cape Horn|South America's Cape Horn]] until arriving in Sacramento where the locomotives would be unloaded, assembled, and placed in service.

[[File:CPRR Locomotive -113 FALCON 1869.jpg|thumb|left|CPRR #113 ''FALCON'', a Danforth 4-4-0, at Argenta, Nevada, March 1, 1869 (Photo: J.B. Silvis)]]Locomotives at the time came from many manufacturers, such as [[Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works|Cooke]], [[Schenectady Locomotive Works|Schenectady]], Mason, Rogers, Danforth, Norris, Booth, and McKay &amp; Aldus, among others. Interestingly, the railroad had been on rather unfriendly terms with the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], one of the more well-known firms. It is not clear as to the cause of this dispute, though some attribute it to the builder insisting on cash payment (though this has yet to be verified). Consequently, the Central Pacific had only three Baldwin engines, all acquired from the [[Western Pacific Railroad (1862–1870)|Western Pacific Railroad]] which the CP had absorbed in 1870. Aside from those engines, the Central Pacific never bought any engines from Baldwin until well after the road had been acquired by the [[Southern Pacific]].

In the 1870s, the road opened up its own locomotive construction facilities in Sacramento. [[Central Pacific 173|Central Pacific's 173]] was rebuilt by these shops and served as the basis for CP's engine construction.
The locomotives built before the 1870s were given names as well as numbers. By the 1870s, it was decided to eliminate the names and as each engine was sent to the shops for service, their names would be removed. However, one engine that was built in the 1880s did receive a name, the [[El Gobernador]].

==Preserved Locomotives==
{{dablink|See also:[[List of preserved Southern Pacific Railroad rolling stock]]}}

The following CP engines have been preserved:
* [[Gov. Stanford|Central Pacific 1, &quot;Gov. Stanford&quot;]]
* CP 233, a [[2-6-2T]] the railroad had built, is stored at the [[California State Railroad Museum]].
* [[C. P. Huntington|Central Pacific 3, &quot;C. P. Huntington&quot;]]
* Former Western Pacific &quot;Mariposa,&quot; Central Pacific's second number 31. Was sold to [[Stockton Terminal and Eastern]] in 1914. Currently at the [[Travel Town Museum]] in Los Angeles.
* [[Virginia and Truckee RR. Engines No. 18, The Dayton; and No. 22, The Inyo|Virginia and Truckee RR. Engine No. 18, The &quot;Dayton&quot;]] Though the Dayton was not built for, nor served on the Central Pacific, the engine was one of two locomotives built by the CP's Sacramento shops in preservation(the other being CP 233). Moreover, its specifications were derived from CP 173, and thus is the only surviving example of that engine's design.
* Central Pacific's numbers [[Jupiter (locomotive)|60, &quot;Jupiter,&quot;]] and 63 &quot;Leviathan.&quot; Although both engines have been scrapped, and therefore technically do not count as having been preserved, there were exact, full size operating replicas built in recent years. The Jupiter was built for the [[National Park Service]] along with a repla of Union Pacific's 119 for use at their [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]]. Leviathan was finished in 2009, is privately owned, and travels to various railroads to operate.

The author summarizes and criticizes previous treatments of this subject, and discusses his own findings. Using the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific systems as the basis for his investigation, the author concludes that the railroad owners received unaided rates of return that substantially exceeded the private rate of return on the average alternative project in the economy during the same period. Thus, the projects were profitable, although contemporary observers expected that the roads would be privately unprofitable without the land grant aid. The land grants did not have a major effect, increasing the private rate of return only slightly. Nevertheless, he says the policy of subsidizing those railroad systems was beneficial for society since the social rate of return from the project was substantial and exceeded the private rate by a significant margin.
* {{cite journal| title=The Central Pacific Railroad and Exploitation of Chinese Labor| first = Paul M.| last = Ong| journal = Journal of Ethnic Studies| volume = 13| issue = 2| year = 1985| pages = 119–124}} Ong tries to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the literature on Asians in early California, with contradictory studies showing evidence both for and against the exploitation of Chinese labor by the CPRR, using [[monopsony]] theory as developed by Joan Robinson. Because CPRR set different wages for whites and Chinese (each group had different elasticities of supply) and used the two classes in different types of positions, the two groups were complementary, rather than interchangeable. Calculations thus show higher levels of exploitation of the Chinese than found in previous studies.

Analyzing the period 1869-1893, the author shows how Stanford and his associates repeatedly entered into pooling arrangements to prevent competition, bought out competitors, or forced rivals to agree not to compete. He concludes that Stanford and his partners viewed ''laissez-faire'' as applicable only to government controls, and not to businessmen's destruction of competition within the system.

The term '''clairvoyance''' (from 17th century [[French language|French]] with ''clair'' meaning &quot;clear&quot; and ''voyance'' meaning &quot;vision&quot;) is used to refer to the ability to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through means other than the known human [[sense]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clairvoyance Merriam-Webster Online dictionary, Retrieved 2007-10-05 &quot;1: the power or faculty of discerning objects not present to the senses 2: ability to perceive matters beyond the range of ordinary perception: penetration&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9364105 Britannica Online Encyclopedia], Retrieved 2007-10-07. The ESP entry includes clairvoyance&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[extra-sensory perception]].  A person said to have the ability of clairvoyance is referred to as a '''clairvoyant''' (&quot;one who sees clearly&quot;).

Claims for the existence of [[paranormal]] and [[psychic]] abilities such as clairvoyance are highly controversial. [[Parapsychology]] explores this possibility, but the existence of the paranormal is generally not accepted by the [[scientific community]].

==Usage==
Within [[parapsychology]], clairvoyance is used exclusively to refer to the transfer of information that is both contemporary to, and hidden from, the clairvoyant. It is very different from [[telepathy]] in that the information is said to be gained directly from an external physical source, rather than being transferred from the mind of one individual to another.&lt;ref name=parasoc1&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html#c Glossary of Parapsychological terms - Clairvoyance] &amp;mdash; [[Parapsychological Association]] (2007-04-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of parapsychology, clairvoyance is often used to refer to other forms of [[anomalous cognition]], most commonly the perception of events that have occurred in the past, or which will occur in the future (known as [[retrocognition]] and [[precognition]] respectively),&lt;ref name=parasoc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=skepdic1&gt;Carrol, Robert (2003), &quot;[http://www.skepdic.com/clairvoy.html Clairvoyance]&quot; – ''Skeptics Dictionary'', Wiley, ISBN 0471272426 {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to refer to communications with the dead (see [[Mediumship]]).

Clairvoyance is related to [[remote viewing]], although the term &quot;remote viewing&quot; itself is not as widely applicable to clairvoyance because it refers to a specific controlled process.

Bruce Main-Smith writes, &quot;It is unfortunate, indeed careless, that clairvoyance has come to be indicative of all/most forms of purported mediumship.&quot; There are four primary channels, clairsensing, trance, healing and physical, plus a whole raft of others that do not fit neatly into any one primary channel. Clairvoyance (seeing) and clairaudience (hearing) for example are both kinds of clairsensing and belong in that main group. Many mediums who are good clairvoyants may well have little or no clairaudient capability even though both &quot;gifts&quot; belong in the primary channel of clairsensing. Remote viewing is a facet of clairvoyance and usually appears in practitioners suffering from arrested development.

Trance is the ability to communicate with, and mainly to receive from, other entities, incarnate &amp; discarnate, and may sometimes be independent of time; it is usually divided into deep trance (obliterative &amp; so dangerous, where the operative abdicates the throne, quite common) and light trance (a high or even total degree of awareness &amp; thus safer for the practitioner, and extremely rare when well-done).

Healing is the ability to induct health benefits from some usually unspecified higher source where the healer can direct the effects to the beneficiary. Contact healing involves the healer being in the closest proximity but not necessarily actually touching. Absent healing is explained by its alternative name of distant healing and is independent of spatial distance.

Physical mediumship includes events such as table turning, production of quasi-physical objects (even personages) &amp; sometimes involving so-called ectoplasm. It is often said to require either total darkness or at the most a weak red light.

There are many further mediumistic events, still unfortunately too often dubbed clairvoyance, which do not fit neatly into any of the four main channels. These include [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] (establishing the history of an object), slate writing (common in Victorian times), extras appearing in photographs (seemingly no more; possibly since the advent of compound camera lenses using plastic as well as quartz-glass) and a long list of other curiosities too extensive to be dealt with here.

It is most unusual for a medium to have more than one primary channel &quot;open&quot; and under control.

==Status of clairvoyance==
Within the field of parapsychology, there is a consensus that some instances of clairvoyance are verifiable.&lt;ref name=parasoc2&gt;&quot;[http://parapsych.org/faq_file1.html#4 What is parapsychology?]&quot;, FAQ – Parapsychological Association (2007-02-03)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parasoc3&gt;&quot;[http://parapsych.org/faq_file3.html#20 What is the state-of-the-evidence for psi?]&quot;, FAQ - Parapsychological Association (2007-02-03)&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a measured level of belief from amongst the general public, within a portion of the US population who believe in clairvoyance varying between 1/4 and 1/3 over the 15-year period from 1990 to 2005.

The concept of clairvoyance gained some support from the US and Russian governments both during and after the [[Cold War]], and both governments made several attempts to harness it as an intelligence gathering tool.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite news|first=Douglas |last=Waller |authorlink=Douglas C. Waller |date=1995-12-11 |title=The Vision Thing |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983829,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2009-05-30|mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to skeptics, clairvoyance is the result of fraud, self-[[delusion]],&lt;ref name=skepdic1/&gt; [[Forer effect|Barnum effects]], [[Confirmation bias|confirmatory biases]], or failures to appreciate the base rate of chance occurrences. For example, in a scientific experiment of clairvoyance, a purported clairvoyant participant will inevitably make correct guesses some of the time (i.e., during some of the trials within the same experiment), simply because of chance. Furthermore, because of the nature of the statistical tests used by experimenters, a very small proportion of all experiments conducted will yield an overall statistically significant result (suggesting that clairvoyance took place at above-chance levels), again simply because of chance. A proper summary of the experimental evidence on clairvoyance should include a summary of all experiments that were conducted, taking into account their probabilities of turning out false positive and false negative results, and making sure that studies are not included in the review selectively. Some researchers on clairvoyance have tended to purposefully exclude negative findings from their reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Tart, C. T. |year=1983 |title=Information acquisition rates in forced-choice ESP experiments: precognition does not work as well as present-time ESP |journal=Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research |issn=0003-1070 |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=293–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus biasing their own conclusions.

==Clairvoyance and related phenomena throughout history==
There have been [[anecdotal]] reports of clairvoyance and 'clear' abilities throughout history in most cultures.  Often clairvoyance has been associated with religious or [[shaman]]ic figures, offices and practices. For example, ancient Hindu religious texts list clairvoyance amongst other forms of 'clear' experiencing, as [[siddhi]]s, or 'perfections', skills that are yielded through appropriate meditation and personal discipline. But a large number of anecdotal accounts of clairvoyance are of the spontaneous variety among the general populace. For example, many people report seeing a loved one who has recently died before they have learned by other means that their loved one is deceased.  While anecdotal accounts do not provide scientific proof of clairvoyance, such common experiences continue to motivate research into such phenomena.

The earliest record of somnambulistic clairvoyance is credited to the [[Marquis de Puységur]], a follower of [[Mesmer]], who in 1784 was treating a local dull-witted peasant named Victor Race. During treatment, Race reportedly would go into trance and undergo a personality change, becoming fluent and articulate, and giving diagnosis and prescription for his own disease as well as those of others.  When he came out of the trance state he would be unaware of anything he had said or done. This behavior is somewhat reminiscent of the reported behaviors of the 20th century medical clairvoyant and psychic [[Edgar Cayce]]. It is reported that although Puységur used the term 'clairvoyance', he did not think of these phenomena as &quot;[[paranormal]]&quot;, since he accepted [[mesmerism]] as one of the natural sciences.

Clairvoyance was a reported ability of some mediums during the [[spiritualist]] period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and psychics of many descriptions have claimed clairvoyant ability up to the present day.

Early researchers of clairvoyance included [[William Gregory (chemist)]], Gustav Pagenstecher, and [[Rudolf Tischner]]. These were largely qualitative experiments in which selected participants sought to identify a concealed target image, or to provide accurate information about the history of a target object. [[Charles Richet]], the noted physiologist and, later, Ina Jephson, a member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], introduced more quantitative methods. A significant development in clairvoyance research came when [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]], a psychologist at [[Duke University]], introduced a standard methodology, with a standard statistical approach to analysing the data, as part of his research into [[extrasensory perception]]. Perhaps the best-known study of clairvoyance in recent times has been the US government-funded [[remote viewing]] project at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]/[[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] during the 1970s through the mid-1990s; at least those studies amongst these that did not involve &quot;agents&quot; visiting or being otherwise aware of the target sites.

Some parapsychologists have proposed that our different functional labels (clairvoyance, [[telepathy]], [[precognition]], etc.) all refer to one basic underlying mechanism, although there is not yet any satisfactory theory for what that mechanism may be.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Parapsychological research==
Parapsychological research studies of [[remote viewing]] and clairvoyance have produced favorable results significantly above chance, and meta-analysis of these studies increases the significance. For instance, at the [[Stanford Research Institute]], in 1972, [[Harold Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the ''viewers'' or ''percipients'') could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or ''targets''. In the early studies, a human ''sender'' was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term [[remote viewing]] was coined to describe this overall process.

Targ and Puthoff both believed that [[Uri Geller]], retired police commissioner Pat Price and artist [[Ingo Swann]] all had genuine psychic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Abilities,'' by Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, Dell Pub Co., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; They published their findings in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;R. Targ, and H,E, Puthoff, H.E &quot;Information transfer under conditions of sensory shielding,&quot; ''Nature'', 251, 602-607. (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Proceedings of the IEEE]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Puthoff, H.E. and Targ, R. &quot;A Perceptual Channel for Information Transfer over kilometer distances: Historical perspective and recent research.&quot; ''Proc. IEEE,'' Vol. 64, no. 3, 329-254. (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Their work however met criticism from a number of writers, such as psychologists [[David Marks]] and [[Richard Kammann]] in their 1980 book ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, D. and Kammann, R., (1980) ''The Psychology of the Psychic'', p26. Prometheus Books. ISBN 1-57392-798-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to explore the nature of remote viewing channel, the viewer in some experiments was secured in a double-walled copper-screened [[Faraday cage]]. Although this provided attenuation of radio signals over a broad range of frequencies, the researchers found that it did not alter the subject's remote viewing capability. They postulated that [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) propagation might be involved, since Faraday cage screening is less effective in the ELF range. Such a hypothesis had previously been put forward by telepathy researchers in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=kogan&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kogan I |title=Information theory analysis of telepathic communication experiments |journal=Telecommunications and Radio Engineering |volume=23 |issue=2 |month=March |year=1968 |pages=122–125 |issn=0040-2508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paper by Puthoff and Targ on psychic research to appear in a mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journal was published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in March 1974; in it, the team reported some degree of remote viewing success.&lt;ref name=nat251&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/251602a0 |title=Information transmission under conditions of sensory shielding |year=1974 |first=Russel |last=Targ |coauthors=Harold Puthoff |journal=Nature |volume=251 |pages=602–607 |pmid=4423858 |issue=5476}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the individuals involved in these initial studies at SRI was [[Uri Geller]], a well-known celebrity psychic at the time. The research team reported witnessing some of Geller's trademark metal spoon-bending performances, but admitted that they were unable to conduct adequately controlled experiments to confirm any paranormal hypothesis about them.

[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) techniques were also used by team to examine ESP phenomena. In these investigations, a sender, who was isolated in a visually opaque, electrically and acoustically shielded chamber, was stimulated at random by bursts of strobe-light flickers The experimenters reported that, for one receiver, differential alpha block on control and stimulus trials were observed, which showed that some information transfer had occurred. In contrast, this person's expressed statements of when the stimulus occurred were no different than that which would be expected by chance. The researches were unable to identify the physical parameters by which the EEG effect was mediated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=4468758 |year=1974 |month=April |author=Rebert, CS; Turner, A |title=EEG spectrum analysis techniques applied to the problem of psi phenomena. |volume=6 |issue=1-12 |pages=18–24 |issn=0005-7932 |journal=Behavioral neuropsychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of these findings, various attempts to replicate the remote viewing findings were quickly carried out. Several of these follow-up studies, which involved viewing in group settings, reported some limited success. They included the use of face-to-face groups,&lt;ref name=hast1&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10369 |title=A confirmatory remote viewing experiment in a group setting |year=1976 |month=October |author=Hastings, A.C. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1544–1545 |last2=Hurt |first2=D.B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10371 |title=Preliminary experiments in group 'Remote viewing' |year=1976 |month=October |author=Whitson, T.W. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1550–1551 |last2=Bogart |first2=D.N. |last3=Palmer |first3=J. |last4=Tart |first4=C.T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remotely-linked groups using computer conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10372 |title=Remote viewing experiments through computer conferencing |year=1976 |month=October |author=Vallee, J. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1551–1552 |last2=Hastings |first2=A.C. |last3=Askevold |first3=G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various debates in the mainstream scientific literature prompted the editors of 'Proceedings of the IEEE' to invite [[Robert Jahn]], then Dean of the School of Engineering at [[Princeton University]], to write a comprehensive review of psychic phenomena from an engineering perspective. His paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1982.12260 |title=The persistent paradox of psychic phenomena: An engineering perspective |year=1982 |month=February |author=Jahn, R.G. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=70 |pages=136–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in February 1982, includes numerous references to remote viewing replication studies at the time.

Clairvoyance experiments involving [[Zener cards]] currently exist on the internet. One such online system, the Anima Project,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anima&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animaproject.org |title=The Anima Project |accessdate=2008-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gathers user results into a master database which is then analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques.

==Skepticism==
Parapsychological research is regarded by critics as a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref&gt;Marks, D.F. (2000). ''The Psychology of the Psychic'' (2nd Ed.) New York: Prometheus Books. ISBN 1573927988 {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the [[United States National Research Council|US National Research Council]] concluded that it &quot;...finds no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years, for the existence of parapsychological phenomena.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/parapsychology.html ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural''] James Randi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientific skepticism|Skeptics]] say that if clairvoyance were a reality it would have become abundantly clear.  They also contend that those who believe in [[paranormal]] phenomena do so for merely psychological reasons.  According to David G. Myers (''Psychology,'' 8th ed.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;The search for a valid and reliable test of clairvoyance has resulted in thousands of experiments. One controlled procedure has invited 'senders' to telepathically transmit one of four visual images to 'receivers' deprived of sensation in a nearby chamber (Bem &amp; Honorton, 1994). The result? A reported 32 percent accurate response rate, surpassing the chance rate of 25 percent. But follow-up studies have (depending on who was summarizing the results) failed to replicate the phenomenon or produced mixed results (Bem &amp; others, 2001; Milton &amp; Wiseman, 2002; Storm, 2000, 2003).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One skeptic, magician [[Randi#The .241 million challenge|James Randi]], has a longstanding offer—now U.S. $1 million—“to anyone who proves a genuine psychic power under proper observing conditions” (Randi, 1999). French, Australian, and Indian groups have parallel offers of up to 200,000 euros to anyone with demonstrable paranormal abilities (CFI, 2003). Large as these sums are, the scientific seal of approval would be worth far more to anyone whose claims could be authenticated. To refute those who say there is no ESP, one need only produce a single person who can demonstrate a single, reproducible ESP phenomenon. So far, no such person has emerged. Randi’s offer has been publicized for three decades and dozens of people have been tested, sometimes under the scrutiny of an independent panel of judges. Still, nothing.  &quot;People's desire to believe in the paranormal is stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist.&quot;  [[Susan Blackmore]], &quot;Blackmore's first law&quot;, 2004.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other related terms==
The words &quot;clairvoyance&quot; and &quot;psychic&quot; are often used to refer to many different kinds of paranormal sensory experiences, but there are more specific names:

===Clairsentience (feeling/touching)===
In the field of parapsychology, '''clairsentience''' is a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] wherein a person acquires [[psychic]] knowledge primarily by feeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parapsych.org/historical_terms.html Parapsychological Association historical terms glossary], retrieved 2006-12-17&lt;/ref&gt; The word is from the French clair, “clear,” + sentience, “feeling,” and is ultimately derived from the Latin clarus, “clear,” + sentiens, derived from sentire, “to feel”.

In addition to parapsychology, the term also plays a role in some religions. For example: clairsentience is one of the six human special functions mentioned or recorded in [[Buddhism]]. It is an ability that can be obtained at advanced meditation level. Generally the term refers to a person who can feel the vibration of other people. There are many different degrees of clairsentience ranging from the perception of diseases of other people to the thoughts or emotions of other people. The ability differs from [[third eye]] in that this kind of ability cannot have a vivid picture in the mind. Instead, a very vivid feeling can form.

[[Psychometry (paranormal)|Psychometry]] is related to clairsentience. The word stems from ''psyche'' and ''metric'', which means &quot;soul-measuring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rodes Buchanan, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=o0RDAAAAIAAJ&amp;ots=EAuuE0zscq&amp;dq=Manual%20of%20psychometry%20%3A%20the%20dawn%20of%20a%20new%20civilization&amp;pg=PA3 Manual of Psychometry : the Dawn of a New Civilization]'' Boston, Frank H. Hodges (4th edition), 1893 p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clairaudience (hearing/listening)===
In the field of parapsychology, '''clairaudience''' [from late 17th century French ''clair'' (clear) &amp; audience (hearing)] is a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] wherein a person acquires information by [[paranormal]] auditory means. It is often considered to be a form of clairvoyance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parapsych.org/historical_terms.html Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology], Retrieved 2006-01-24&lt;/ref&gt; Clairaudience is essentially the ability to hear in a [[paranormal]] manner, as opposed to paranormal seeing (clairvoyance) and feeling ([[clairsentience]]). Clairaudient people have [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]]-mediated hearing. Clairaudience may refer not to actual perception of sound, but may instead indicate impressions of the &quot;inner mental ear&quot; similar to the way many people think words without having auditory impressions. But it may also refer to actual perception of sounds such as voices, tones, or noises which are not apparent to other humans or to recording equipment.  For instance, a clairaudient person might claim to hear the voices or thoughts of the spirits of persons who are deceased.  In [[Buddhism]], it is believed that those who have extensively practiced [[Buddhist meditation]] and have reached a [[Higher consciousness|higher level of consciousness]] can activate their &quot;third ear&quot; and hear the [[music of the spheres]]; i.e. the music of the celestial [[gandharva]]s.  Clairaudience may be positively distinguished from the voices heard by the mentally ill when it reveals information unavailable to the clairaudient person by normal means (including [[cold reading]] or other magic tricks), and thus may be termed &quot;[[psychic]]&quot; or [[paranormal]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Clairalience (smelling)===
Also known as Clairescence. In the field of parapsychology, '''clairalience''' [presumably from late 17th century French ''clair'' (clear) &amp; alience (smelling)] is a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] wherein a person accesses psychic knowledge through the physical sense of smell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghostvillage.com/resources/2003/resources_10132003.shtml Supernatural Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claircognizance (knowing)===
In the field of parapsychology, '''claircognizance''' [presumably from late 17th century French ''clair'' (clear) &amp; ''cognizance'' (&lt; [[Middle English|ME]] ''cognisaunce'' &lt; [[Old French|OFr]] ''conoissance'', knowledge)] is a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] wherein a person acquires psychic knowledge primarily by means of intrinsic knowledge. It is the ability to know something without a physical explanation why you know it, like the concept of [[mediumship|mediums]].

===Clairgustance (tasting)===
In the field of parapsychology, '''clairgustance''' is defined as a form of [[extra-sensory perception]] that allegedly allows one to taste a substance without putting anything in one's mouth.  It is claimed that those who possess this ability are able to perceive the essence of a substance from the spiritual or ethereal realms through taste.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Chiropractic''' is a form of [[alternative medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;US National Library of Medicine / NIH http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/chiropractic.html&lt;/ref&gt; that emphasizes diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the [[musculoskeletal system]], especially the [[vertebral column|spine]], under the hypothesis that these disorders affect general health via the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt; It is generally categorized as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM),&lt;ref name=Chapman-Smith/&gt; a characterization that many chiropractors reject.&lt;ref name=Redwood-CAM/&gt; Although chiropractors have many attributes of [[primary care]] providers, chiropractic has more of the attributes of a medical specialty like [[dentistry]] or [[podiatry]].&lt;ref name=Meeker-Haldeman/&gt; [[Chiropractic treatment technique]] primarily involves [[manual therapy]], including [[Spinal manipulation|manipulation of the spine]] and other joints, as well as [[soft tissue]] therapies; treatment also commonly includes exercise and health and lifestyle counselling.&lt;ref name=content-of-practice/&gt; Traditional chiropractic assumes that a [[vertebral subluxation]] interferes with the body's [[innate intelligence]],&lt;ref name=History-PPC/&gt;  a [[vitalistic]] notion that &quot;brings ridicule from the scientific and health care communities and confusion within the chiropractic profession.&quot;&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation/&gt; Many of today’s chiropractors focus on [[musculoskeletal]] problems of the spine,[http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB4539/index1.html] and want to separate themselves from the traditional vitality of innate intelligence.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/&gt;

[[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]] founded chiropractic in the 1890s, and his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|B.J. Palmer]] helped to expand it in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; It has two main groups: &quot;straights&quot;, now the minority, emphasize [[vitalism]], innate intelligence and [[spinal adjustment]]s, and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all disease; &quot;mixers&quot; are more open to mainstream and alternative medical techniques such as [[exercise]], [[massage]], [[nutritional supplements]], and [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/&gt; Chiropractic is well established in the U.S., Canada and Australia&lt;ref name=global-strategy/&gt; and is the third largest health profession, behind [[medicine]] and [[dentistry]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Most who seek chiropractic care do so for [[low back pain]].&lt;ref name=Lawrence-Meeker/&gt;

Chiropractic care is an outgrowth of belief in the concept that the body has a natural and powerful ability to heal itself, that the body's structure--bones, joints and muscles--and capacity for healthy function are closely intertwined, and that Chiropractic treatment helps balance the body's structure and function and promotes self-healing.[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/chiropractic-adjustment/MY01107/DSECTION=why-its-done]
Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in [[vitalism]], [[spirituality|spiritual inspiration]] and [[rationalism]]. A philosophy based on [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[dogma|irrefutable doctrine]] helped distinguish chiropractic from medicine, provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession. This &quot;straight&quot; philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejects the [[Inference|inferential reasoning]] of the [[scientific method]],&lt;ref name=Keating05/&gt; and relies on deductions from [[vitalistic]] first principles rather than on the [[materialism]] of science.&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs/&gt; However, most practitioners currently accept the importance of scientific research into chiropractic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Keating05&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Keating JC Jr |chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic |pages=77–98 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition=3rd |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most practitioners are &quot;mixers&quot; who attempt to combine the materialistic reductionism of science with the metaphysics of their predecessors and with the [[Holistic medicine|holistic paradigm of wellness]];&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs/&gt; a 2008 commentary proposed that chiropractic actively divorce itself from the straight philosophy as part of a campaign to eliminate [[Testability|untestable]] dogma and engage in critical thinking and evidence-based research.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod/&gt;

Although a wide diversity of ideas currently exists among chiropractors,&lt;ref name=Keating05/&gt; they share the belief that the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and health are related in a fundamental way, and that this relationship is mediated through the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Gay RE, Nelson CF |chapter= Chiropractic philosophy |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=altrehab.section.336 |editor= Wainapel SF, Fast A (eds.) |title= Alternative Medicine and Rehabilitation: a Guide for Practitioners |year=2003 |isbn=1-888799-66-8 |location= New York |publisher= [[Demos Medical Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractors examine the biomechanics, structure and function, of the spine along with its effects on the musculoskeletal and nervous systems and what they believe to be its role in health and disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACA-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= History of chiropractic care |author= [[American Chiropractic Association]] |accessdate=2008-02-21 |url=http://acatoday.org/level2_css.cfm?T1ID=13&amp;T2ID=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Conservatism''' considers the risks of clinical interventions when balancing them against their benefits. It emphasizes [[noninvasive]] treatment to minimize risk, and avoids [[surgery]] and [[medication]].&lt;ref name=ACA-history/&gt;
*'''[[Homeostasis]]''' emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities. Chiropractic's early notion of [[innate intelligence]] can be thought of as a metaphor for homeostasis.&lt;ref name=Keating05/&gt;

Chiropractic is often described as two professions masquerading as one. Unlike the distinction between [[podiatry]] (a science-based profession for foot disorders) and foot [[reflexology]] (an unscientific philosophy which posits that many disorders arise from the feet), in chiropractic the two professions attempt to live under one roof,&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod/&gt; albeit with much tension between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler&quot;&gt;Richard Tyler, DC. [http://www.chiroweb.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=45426 &quot;Speaking in Strange Tongues&quot;] ''[[Dynamic Chiropractic]]'', August 1, 1990, Vol. 08, Issue 16. &quot;We are the only profession that has factions actively trying to restrict what its members do... It's one thing to believe strongly in something but quite another to force what you believe onto everyone else.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

''Straight'' chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D.D. and B.J. Palmer, and retain [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] definitions and [[vitalistic]] qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an &quot;[[innate intelligence]]&quot; exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for many diseases. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the &quot;secondary effects&quot; of subluxations) to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not &quot;mix&quot; other types of therapies into their practice style.&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and they prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon terminology (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, and so on). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care. Although some consider them a minority group, &quot;they have been able to transform their status as purists and heirs of the lineage into influence dramatically out of proportion to their numbers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaptchuk-Eisenberg&quot;/&gt;

''Mixer'' chiropractors &quot;mix&quot; diagnostic and treatment approaches from osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and they incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ many treatments including conventional techniques of [[physical therapy]] such as exercise, [[massage]], [[ice pack]]s, and [[moist heat]], along with [[nutritional supplements]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]], and [[biofeedback]]. Mixers tend to be open to mainstream medicine and are the majority group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaptchuk-Eisenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Arch Intern Med]] |year=1998 |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |title=Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |author=Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215 |doi=10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mixers are the majority group, many of them retain belief in vertebral subluxation as shown in a 2003 survey of North American chiropractors, which found that 88% wanted to retain the term &quot;vertebral subluxation complex&quot;, and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs (such as the heart, the lungs, or the stomach) that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62%.&lt;ref name=McDonald/&gt;

=== Vertebral subluxation ===
{{Main|Vertebral subluxation}}
Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed ''vertebral subluxations'', interfered with the body's function and its inborn (innate) ability to heal itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;History-PPC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.|Keating JC Jr]] |chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession |pages=23–64 |title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic |edition=3rd |editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.) |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2005 |isbn=0-07-137534-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ. D.D. Palmer, using a vitalistic approach, imbued the term ''subluxation'' with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf |format=PDF |title= D.D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic |author= Keating JC Jr |publisher= [[Association for the History of Chiropractic]] |year=1995 |accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic medicine from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:&quot;Physiologists divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, afferent and efferent. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality—too much or not enough action—which is disease.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Palmer DD |title= The Chiropractor's Adjuster: Text-book of the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic for Students and Practitioners |location=Portland, OR |publisher= Portland Printing House Co |year=1910 |oclc=17205743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertebral subluxation, a core concept of traditional chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation/&gt; In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keating-subluxation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Chiropr Osteopat]] |year=2005 |volume=13 |pages=17 |title=Subluxation: dogma or science? |author=Keating JC Jr, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF |doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-17 |pmid=16092955 |url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/13/1/17 |pmc=1208927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[J Chiropr Educ]] |year=2000 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=71–7 |title=A survey of the use of evidence-based health care in chiropractic college clinics |author=Rose KA, Adams A |url=http://www.journalchiroed.com/2000/JCEFall2000Rose.PDF |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[J Man Manip Ther]] |year=2006 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=E14–8 |title=Can chiropractors and evidence-based manual therapists work together? an opinion from a veteran chiropractor |author=Homola S |url=http://jmmtonline.com/documents/HomolaV14N2E.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 survey of North American chiropractors found that 88% wanted to retain the term ''vertebral subluxation complex'', and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs (such as the heart, the lungs, or the stomach) that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62%.&lt;ref name=McDonald/&gt; In 2005, the chiropractic subluxation was defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as &quot;a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity.&quot; This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as [[X-ray#Medical_uses|X-rays]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO-guidelines&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  |author= World Health Organization |year=2005 |title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-29  |isbn= 92-4-159371-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' states &quot;X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, because they do not exist.&quot;&lt;ref name=Trick-or-Treatment/&gt; Attorney David Chapman-Smith, Secretary-General of the [[World Federation of Chiropractic]], has stated that &quot;Medical critics have asked how there can be a subluxation if it cannot be seen on x-ray.

== Treatment techniques ==
{{Main|Chiropractic treatment techniques|Spinal adjustment}}
[[Spinal manipulation]], which chiropractors call &quot;spinal adjustment&quot; or &quot;chiropractic adjustment&quot;, is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care.&lt;ref name=NBCE_techniques/&gt; Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint; its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP/&gt; Neck manipulations are high-velocity, short-lever thrusts with rotation beyond the physiological range of motion.&lt;ref name=Ernst-death/&gt; High-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) thrusts have physiological effects that signal neural discharge from paraspinal muscle tissues, depending on duration and amplitude of the thrust are factors of the degree in paraspinal muscle spindles activation. Clinical skill in employing HVLA-SM thrusts depends on the ability of the practitioner to handle the duration and magnitude of the load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Spine |year=2007 |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=583– 95 |title= Response of lumbar paraspinal muscles spindles is greater to spinal manipulative loading compared with slower loading under length control |author= Pickar JG, Sung PS, Kang YM, Ge W |pmid=17905321 |pmc=2075482 |doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2006.10.006 |url=http://www.thespinejournalonline.com/article/S1529-9430(06)00973-9/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, [[spinal manipulative therapy]] (SMT) describes techniques where the hands are used to manipulate, massage, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, apply traction to, or otherwise influence the spine and related tissues.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACA-SMP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf |format=PDF |title= Spinal manipulation policy statement |author= Winkler K, Hegetschweiler-Goertz C, Jackson PS ''et al.'' |accessdate=2008-05-24 |year=2003 |publisher= American Chiropractic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several schools of chiropractic adjustive techniques, although most chiropractors mix techniques from several schools. The following adjustive procedures were received by more than 10% of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey:&lt;ref name=NBCE_techniques/&gt; [[Diversified technique]] (full-spine manipulation, employing various techniques), extremity adjusting, [[Activator technique]] (which uses a spring loaded tool to deliver precise adjustments to the spine), Thompson Technique (which relies on a drop table and detailed procedural protocols), [[Clarence Gonstead#Gonstead Technique|Gonstead]] (which emphasizes evaluating the spine along with specific adjustment that avoids rotational vectors), Cox/flexion-distraction (a gentle, low-force adjusting procedure which mixes chiropractic with osteopathic principles and utilizes specialized adjusting tables with movable parts), adjustive instrument, Sacro-Occipital Technique (which models the spine as a torsion bar), [[Neuromuscular therapy|Nimmo Receptor-Tonus Technique]], [[Applied Kinesiology]] (which emphasises &quot;muscle testing&quot; as a diagnostic tool), and cranial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technique Systems in Chiropractic |author=Cooperstein R, Gleberzon BJ |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |year=2004 |isbn=0-443-07413-5 |ref=TSC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medicine-assisted manipulation, such as [[manipulation under anesthesia]], involves sedation or local anesthetic and is done by a team that includes an [[anesthesiologist]]; a 2008 [[systematic review]] did not find enough evidence to make recommendations about its use for chronic low back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dagenais S, Mayer J, Wooley JR, Haldeman S |title=Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with medicine-assisted manipulation |journal=Spine J |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=142–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18164462 |doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2007.09.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other procedures are used by chiropractors for treating the spine, other joints and tissues, and general health issues. The following procedures were received by more than one-third of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey: [[Diversified technique]] (full-spine manipulation; mentioned in previous paragraph), [[physical fitness]]/[[exercise]] promotion, corrective or therapeutic exercise, [[ergonomic]]/[[Neutral spine|postural]] advice, [[self-care]] strategies, [[activities of daily living]], changing risky/unhealthy behaviors, [[Diet (nutrition)|nutritional/dietary]] recommendations, [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]]/[[stress reduction]] recommendations, [[Cryotherapy|ice pack/cryotherapy]], extremity adjusting (also mentioned in previous paragraph), [[Neuromuscular therapy|trigger point therapy]], and [[disease prevention]]/early [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] advice.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBCE_techniques&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Job Analysis of Chiropractic |chapter= Professional functions and treatment procedures |year=2005 |pages=121–38 |author= Christensen MG, Kollasch MW |location= Greeley, CO |publisher= [[National Board of Chiropractic Examiners]] |chapterurl=http://nbce.org/pdfs/job-analysis/chapter_10.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-25 |isbn=1-884457-05-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study describing Belgium chiropractors and their patients found chiropractors in Belgium mostly focus on neuromusculoskeletal complaints in adult patients, with emphasis on the spine.

[[Image:Daniel David Palmer.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length sitting portrait of man in his fifties with large gray beard and moustache, wearing coat and vest|[[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]]]]
Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Palmer, a [[Magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease.&lt;ref name=Baer/&gt; The first chiropractic patient of D.D. Palmer was [[Harvey Lillard]], a worker in the building where Palmer's office was located.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; --&gt; He claimed that he had severely reduced hearing for 17 years, which started soon following a &quot;pop&quot; in his spine.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; --&gt; A few days following his adjustment, Lillard claimed his hearing was almost completely restored.&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; Chiropractic competed with its predecessor [[osteopathy]], another medical system based on magnetic healing and [[bonesetting]]; both systems were founded by charismatic midwesterners in opposition to the conventional medicine of the day, and both postulated that manipulation improved health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Med Anthropol Q |year=1987 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=176–93 |title=Divergence and convergence in two systems of manual medicine: osteopathy and chiropractic in the United States |author=Baer HA |doi=10.1525/maq.1987.1.2.02a00030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially keeping chiropractic a family secret, in 1898 Palmer began teaching it to a few students at his new [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]]. One student, his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer]], became committed to promoting chiropractic, took over the Palmer School in 1906, and rapidly expanded its enrollment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Technol Cult |author=Martin SC |year=1993 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=808–34 |title=Chiropractic and the social context of medical technology, 1895–1925 |doi=10.2307/3106416 |pmid=11623404 |jstor=3106416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of [[innate intelligence]], a [[Vitalism|vital]] nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions. D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|legal protection under the U.S. constitution]], but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]].&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf |format=PDF |author= Palmer DD |title= Letter to P.W. Johnson, D.C. |date=1911-05-04 |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early chiropractors also tapped into the [[Populism|Populist]] movement, emphasizing craft, hard work, competition, and advertisement, aligning themselves with the common man against intellectuals and [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]], among which they included the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

In 1910 B.J. changed course and endorsed [[X-rays]] as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; --&gt; The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; --&gt; That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights.

Chiropractors faced heavy opposition from organized medicine. Thousands of chiropractors were prosecuted for [[Health care provider#Practicing without a license|practicing medicine without a license]], and D.D. and many other chiropractors were jailed. To defend against medical statutes B.J. argued that chiropractic was separate and distinct from medicine, asserting that chiropractors &quot;analyzed&quot; rather than &quot;diagnosed&quot;, and &quot;adjusted&quot; subluxations rather than &quot;treated&quot; disease. B.J. cofounded the Universal Chiropractors' Association (UCA) to provide legal services to arrested chiropractors. Although the UCA won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; The longstanding feud between chiropractors and [[medical doctor]]s continued for decades.

Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and is continuing to be hampered by what are characterized as [[antiscientific]] and [[pseudoscientific]] ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; --&gt; By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;History-Primer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Chiropractic history: a primer |author= Keating JC Jr, Cleveland CS III, Menke M |url=http://www.philosophyofchiropractic.com/primerall72.pdf |format=PDF |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and [[health plan]]s, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services. However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, [[evidence-based medicine]] insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, [[managed care]] restricted payment, and competition grew from [[massage therapist]]s and other health professions. The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into [[alternative medicine]] and [[primary care]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Milbank Q]] |year=2003 |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=107–38 |title= Chiropractic in the United States: trends and issues |author= Cooper RA, McKee HJ |doi=10.1111/1468-0009.00040 |pmid=12669653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===

Chiropractic care in general is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt; --&gt; Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe, but as with all therapeutic interventions, complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and contraindications.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt; --&gt; Absolute [[contraindication]]s to spinal manipulative therapy are conditions that should not be manipulated; these contraindications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and conditions known to result in unstable joints. Relative contraindications are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these contraindications include [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt; Although most contraindications apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to [[emergency medical services]]; these include sudden and severe [[headache]] or [[neck pain]] unlike that previously experienced.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCA-CFCREAB-CPG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc |year=2005 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=158–209 |title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R ''et al.'' |url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2005/2005-3/Chiropracticclinicalpracticeguideline-evidence-basedtreatmentofadultneckpainnotduetowhiplash.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=17549134 |pmc=1839918 }}&lt;br/&gt;• {{cite journal |journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc |year=2008 |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=7–8 |title=A clinical practice guideline update from The CCA•CFCREAB-CPG |author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M ''et al.'' |url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2008/2008-1/ClinicalPracticeGuidelineUpdatefromTheCCACFCREABCPG.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=18327295 |pmc=2258235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinal manipulation is associated with frequent, mild and temporary [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]],&lt;ref name=Ernst-adverse/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG/&gt; including new or worsening pain or stiffness in the affected region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Spine |year=2007 |volume=32 |issue=21 |pages=2375–8 |title= Safety of chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine: a prospective national survey |author= Thiel HW, Bolton JE, Docherty S, Portlock JC |doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181557bb1 |pmid=17906581}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been estimated to occur in 33% to 61% of patients, and frequently occur within an hour of treatment and disappear within 24 to 48 hours;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gouveia&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gouveia LO, Castanho P, Ferreira JJ |title= Safety of chiropractic interventions: a systematic review |journal=Spine |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=E405–13 |year=2009 |pmid=19444054 |doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181a16d63}}&lt;/ref&gt; adverse reactions appear to be more common following manipulation than mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurwitz EL, Morgenstern H, Vassilaki M, Chiang LM |title=Frequency and clinical predictors of adverse reactions to chiropractic care in the UCLA neck pain study |journal=[[Spine]] |volume=30 |issue=13 |pages=1477–84 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15990659 |doi= 10.1097/01.brs.0000167821.39373.c1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractors are more commonly associated with serious manipulation related adverse effects than other professionals.&lt;ref name=Ernst-death/&gt; Rarely,&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt; spinal manipulation, particularly on the upper spine, can also result in complications that can lead to permanent disability or [[death]]; these can occur in adults&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst-adverse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[J R Soc Med]] |year=2007 |volume=100 |issue=7 |pages=330–8 |title= Adverse effects of spinal manipulation: a systematic review |author= Ernst E |pmid=17606755 |url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/content/full/100/7/330 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.100.7.330 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/75754.php |laysource= Med News Today |laydate=2007-07-02 |pmc= 1905885}}&lt;/ref&gt; and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vohra&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |year=2007 |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=e275–83 |title= Adverse events associated with pediatric spinal manipulation: a systematic review |author= Vohra S, Johnston BC, Cramer K, Humphreys K |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1392 |pmid=17178922 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/119/1/e275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary widely for the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of these complications,&lt;ref name=Gouveia/&gt; and the actual incidence is unknown, due to high levels of underreporting and to the difficulty of linking manipulation to adverse effects such as [[stroke]], which is a particular concern.&lt;ref name=Ernst-adverse/&gt; Estimates for serious adverse events vary from 5 strokes in 100,000 manipulations to 1.46 serious adverse events in 10,000,000 manipulations and 2.68 deaths in 10,000,000 manipulations.&lt;ref name=Gouveia/&gt;

Chiropractors, like other primary care providers, sometimes employ diagnostic imaging techniques such as [[X-ray#Medical uses|X-rays]] and [[CT scan]]s that rely on [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref name=Bussieres/&gt; Although there is no clear evidence for the practice, some chiropractors may X-ray a patient several times a year.&lt;ref name=Trick-or-Treatment/&gt; Practice guidelines aim to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bussieres&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bussières AE, Taylor JAM, Peterson C |title=Diagnostic imaging practice guidelines for musculoskeletal complaints in adults—an evidence-based approach—part 3: spinal disorders |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=33–88 |year=2008 |pmid=18308153 |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2007.11.003 |url=http://jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(07)00314-4/fulltext }}&lt;/ref&gt; which increases cancer risk in proportion to the amount of radiation received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, Board on Radiation Effects Research, [[U.S. National Research Council]] |title=Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2 |publisher=The National Academies Press |location=Washington, DC |year=2006 |isbn=0-309-09156-X |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk-benefit ===

A 2010 [[systematic review]] stated that there is no good evidence to assume that manipulation to the neck is an effective treatment for any condition and thus concluded, &quot;the risks of chiropractic neck manipulations by far outweigh their benefits.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst-death&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Int J Clinical Practice |year=2010 |volume=64 |issue= 8 |pages=1162–1165 |title= Deaths after chiropractic: a review of published cases |author= E Ernst |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02352.x |pmid=20642715 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02352.x/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractors have criticized this conclusion, claiming that the author did not evaluate the potential benefits of [[spinal manipulation]].&lt;ref name=Ernst-response/&gt; [[Edzard Ernst]] stated &quot;This detail was not the subject of my review. I do, however, refer to such evaluations and should add that a report recently commissioned by the General Chiropractic Council did not support many of the outlandish claims made by many chiropractors across the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst-response&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Int J Clin Pract|year=2011 |volume=65 |issue= 1 |pages=106 |title= Response to critiques of deaths after chiropractic |author= E Ernst |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02568.x |pmid=21155949 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02568.x/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review evaluating maintenance chiropractic care found that spinal manipulation is routinely associated with considerable harm and no compelling evidence exists to indicate that it adequately prevents symptoms or diseases, thus the risk-benefit is not evidently favorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Prev Med |year=2009 |volume=49 |issue=2–3 |pages=99–100 |title= Chiropractic maintenance treatment, a useful preventative approach? |author= Ernst E |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.05.004 |pmid=19465044}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 summary found that the best evidence suggests that chiropractic care is a useful therapy for subjects with neck or low-back pain for which the risks of serious adverse events should be considered negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.06.001 |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |year=2008 |volume=31 |issue= 6 |pages=461–464 |title= Adverse events following chiropractic care for subjects with neck or low-back pain: do the benefits outweigh the risks? |author= Rubinstein SM |pmid=18722202 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18722202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 systematic review found that with uncertain efficacy and definite risks, the risk-benefit balance of spinal manipulation can't be positive.&lt;ref name=Ernst-adverse/&gt; A 2006 systematic review of systematic reviews found the risk-benefit balance does not favor spinal manipulation over other treatments like [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref name=Ernst-Canter/&gt;

=== Cost-effectiveness ===

A 2006 qualitative review found that the research literature suggests that chiropractic obtains at least comparable outcomes to alternatives with potential cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |year=2006 |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=707–25 |title= Health services research related to chiropractic: review and recommendations for research prioritization by the chiropractic profession |author= Mootz RD, Hansen DT, Breen A, Killinger LZ, Nelson C |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2006.09.001 |pmid=17142165}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 systematic [[cost-effectiveness]] review found that the reported cost-effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation in the [[United Kingdom]] compared favorably with other treatments for back pain, but that reports were based on data from clinical trials without sham controls and that the specific cost-effectiveness of the treatment (as opposed to [[non-specific effect]]s) remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Evid Based Complement Alternat Med]] |year=2006 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=425–32 |title= Cost-effectiveness of complementary therapies in the United Kingdom — a systematic review |author= Canter PH, Coon JT, Ernst E |doi=10.1093/ecam/nel044 |pmid=17173105 |url=http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/4/425 |pmc= 1697737}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 systematic review of economic evaluations of conservative treatments for low back pain found that significant quality problems in available studies meant that definite conclusions could not be drawn about the most cost-effective intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol]] |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=671–84 |title= What is the most cost-effective treatment for patients with low back pain? a systematic review |author= van der Roer N, Goossens MEJB, Evers SMAA, van Tulder MW |doi=10.1016/j.berh.2005.03.007 |pmid=15949783}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care is unknown.&lt;ref name=Leboeuf-Yde-C/&gt;

== Public health ==
{{further | [[Vaccine controversy#Alternative medicine|Vaccine controversy and alternative medicine]] | [[Water fluoridation controversy]] }}
Some chiropractors oppose [[vaccination]] and [[water fluoridation]], which are common [[public health]] practices.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod/&gt; Within the chiropractic community there are significant disagreements about vaccination,&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; one of the most cost-effective public health interventions available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ehreth J |title= The global value of vaccination |journal=Vaccine |volume=21 |issue=7–8 |pages=596–600 |year=2003 |pmid=12531324 |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects,&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt; claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; --&gt; Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but a significant portion of the profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; The extent to which anti-vaccination views sustain the current chiropractic profession is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt; The [[American Chiropractic Association]] and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2000 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=e43 |title= Chiropractors and vaccination: a historical perspective |author= Campbell JB, Busse JW, Injeyan HS |pmid=10742364 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/4/e43 |doi= 10.1542/peds.105.4.e43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Chiropractic Association]] supports vaccination;&lt;ref name=&quot;Busse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |year=2005 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=367–73 |title= Chiropractic antivaccination arguments |author= Busse JW, Morgan L, Campbell JB |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.04.011 |pmid=15965414 |url= http://jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(05)00111-9/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating themselves or their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Russell ML, Injeyan HS, Verhoef MJ, Eliasziw M |title= Beliefs and behaviours: understanding chiropractors and immunization |journal=Vaccine |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=372–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15530683 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.05.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early opposition to water fluoridation included chiropractors, some of whom continue to oppose it as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Am J Public Health |year=1989 |volume=79 |issue=10 |pages=1405–8 |title= Fluoridation referendum in La Crosse, Wisconsin: contributing factors to success |author= Jones RB, Mormann DN, Durtsche TB |pmid=2782512 |pmc=1350185 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/79/10/1405.pdf |format=PDF |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.79.10.1405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional chiropractic opposition to water fluoridation and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive life-long chiropractic treatment.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod/&gt;

[[Image:Carbid.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Calcium carbide]].]]
In [[chemistry]], a '''carbide''' is a compound composed of [[carbon]] and a less [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element.  Carbides can be generally classified by chemical bonding type as follows: (i) salt-like, (ii) [[covalent compound]]s, (iii) [[interstitial compound]]s, and (iv) &quot;intermediate&quot; [[transition metal]] carbides. Examples include [[calcium carbide]], [[silicon carbide]], [[tungsten carbide]] (often called simply ''carbide''), and [[cementite]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|pages=318–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; each used in key industrial applications.

Salt-like carbides are composed of highly electropositive elements such as the [[alkali metal]]s, [[alkaline earth]]s, and group 3 metals including [[scandium]], [[yttrium]] and [[lanthanum]]. [[Aluminium]] from group 13 forms [[Aluminium carbide|carbides]], but [[gallium]], [[indium]] and [[thallium]] do not. These materials feature isolated carbon centers, often described as &quot;C&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;, in the [[methanide]]s or methides; two atom units, &quot;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; in the [[acetylide]]s; and three atom units &quot;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; in the sesquicarbides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt;  The naming of ionic carbides is not consistent and can be quite confusing.

=== Methanides ===
Carbides of this class decompose in water producing [[methane]].  Two such examples are [[aluminium carbide]]  {{chem|Al|4|C|3}} and [[beryllium carbide]] {{chem|Be|2|C}}.

Methanides in general chemical context refers to any compound that hydrolyzes to methane, which might include also salts with hydrogenated anions such as {{chem|CH|3-}}, {{chem|CH|2|2-}}, and {{chem|CH|3|-}}. However, according to IUPAC systematic naming conventions, only the last is properly called &quot;methanide&quot;. In theory one can describe compounds that contain the [[methyl]] group, with relatively large bond polarity between the carbon and non-hydrogen atom, as salts of this anion; however in truth most such compounds, if not all, are, in fact covalent.

===Acetylides===
Several carbides are assumed to be salts of the [[acetylide|acetylide anion]] C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2– &lt;/sup&gt; (also called percarbide), which has a [[covalent bond|triple bond]] between the two carbon atoms. Alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and [[lanthanoid|lanthanoid metals]] form acetylides, e.g., sodium carbide Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, calcium carbide CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[lanthanum carbide|LaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt; Lanthanoids also form acetylides with formula M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Metals from group 11 too tend to form acetylides, such as [[copper(I) acetylide]] and [[silver acetylide]]. Carbides of the [[actinides|actinide elements]], which have stoichiometry MC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are also described as salt-like derivatives of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;.

The C-C triple bond length ranges from 109.2 pm in CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (similar to ethyne), to 130.3  pm in [[lanthanum carbide|LaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and 134 pm in [[uranium carbide|UC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The bonding in [[lanthanum carbide|LaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] has been described in terms of La&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; with the extra electron delocalised into the antibonding orbital on C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;minus&lt;/nowiki&gt;;&lt;/sup&gt;, explaining the metallic conduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt;

===Sesquicarbides===
The [[polyatomic ion]] C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4–&lt;/sup&gt;, sometimes called '''sesquicarbide''', is found in [[lithium carbide|Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The ion is linear and is isoelectronic with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt; The C-C distance in Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is 133.2 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Crystal Structure of Magnesium Sesquicarbide|doi=10.1021/ic00041a018|author=Fjellvag H. and Pavel K. |journal=Inorg. Chem. |year=1992|volume=31|page=3260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yields [[methylacetylene]], CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CCH, on hydrolysis which was the first indication that it may contain C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4–&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Covalent carbides==
The carbides of silicon and boron are described as &quot;covalent carbides&quot;, although virtually all compounds of carbon exhibit some covalent character. [[Silicon carbide]] has two similar crystalline forms, which are both related to the diamond structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt; [[Boron carbide]], B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, on the other hand has an unusual structure which includes icosahedral boron units linked by carbon atoms. In this respect [[boron carbide]] is similar to the boron rich [[boride]]s. Both [[silicon carbide]], SiC, (carborundum) and [[boron carbide]], B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C are very hard materials and [[refractory]]. Both materials are important industrially. Boron also forms other covalent carbides, e.g. B&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;C.

==Interstitial carbides==
The carbides of the group 4, 5 and 6 transition metals (with the exception of chromium) are often described as [[interstitial compound]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt; These carbides have metallic properties and are [[refractory]]. Some exhibit a range of stoichiometries, e.g. [[titanium carbide]], TiC. [[Titanium carbide]] and [[tungsten carbide]] are important industrially and are used to coat metals in cutting tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ettmayer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Carbides: transition metal solid state chemistry|author=Peter Ettmayer &amp; Walter Lengauer|title=Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry| editor=R. Bruce King |year=1994 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longheld view is that the carbon atoms fit into octahedral interstices in a close packed metal lattice when the metal atom radius is greater than approximately 135 pm:&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt; 
*When the metal atoms are [[close-packing|cubic close packed]], (ccp), then filling all of the octahedral interstices with carbon achieves 1:1 stoichiometry with the rock salt structure, (note that in rock salt, NaCl, it is the chloride anions that are [[close-packing|cubic close packed]]).
*When the metal atoms are [[close-packing|hexagonal close packed]], (hcp), as the octahedral interstices lie directly opposite each other on either side of the layer of metal atoms, filling only one of these with carbon achieves 2:1 stoichiometry with the CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure.

The following table&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ettmayer&quot; /&gt; shows actual structures of the metals and their carbides. (N.B. the body centred cubic structure adopted by vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten is not a close packed lattice.) The notation &quot;h/2&quot; refers to the M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C type structure described above, which is only an approximate description of the actual structures. The simple view that the lattice of the pure metal &quot;absorbs&quot; carbon atoms can be seen to be untrue as the packing of the metal atom lattice in the carbides is different from the packing in the pure metal.

For a long time the [[non-stoichiometric]] phases were believed to be disordered with a random filling of the interstices, however short and longer range ordering has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Order and disorder in transition metal carbides and nitrides: experimental and theoretical aspects|author=C.H. de Novion and J.P. Landesman |journal=Pure &amp; Appl. Chem.|volume=57|issue=10|year=1985|page=1391|doi=10.1351/pac198557101391|format=free download pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermediate transition metal carbides==
In these carbides, the transition metal ion is smaller than the critical 135 pm, and the structures are not interstitial but are more complex. Multiple stoichiometries are common, for example iron forms a number of carbides, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C. The best known is [[cementite]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, which is present in steels.
These carbides are more reactive than the interstitial carbides, for example the carbides of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni all are hydrolysed by dilute acids and sometimes by water, to give a mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbons. These compounds share features with both the inert interstitials and the more reactive salt-like carbides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt;

==Molecular carbides==
[[Image:Au6C(PPh3)6.png|thumb|right|240 px|The complex [Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, containing a carbon-gold core.]]
Metal complexes containing C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; fragments are well known. Most common are carbon-centered clusters, such as [Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Similar species are known for the [[metal carbonyl]]s and the early metal halides. Even terminal carbides have been crystallized, e.g., CRuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Impossible carbides==
Some metals, such as [[lead]] and [[tin]], are believed not to form carbides under any circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;percy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Percy|page=67|year=1870|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/metallurgyleadi01percgoog#page/n86/mode/2up/ |title=The Metallurgy of Lead, including Desiverization and Cupellation|publisher= J. Murray|place=London}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There exists however a mixed titanium-tin carbide, which is a two-dimensional conductor.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Y. C. Zhou, H. Y. Dong and B. H. Yu|year=2000|title=Development of two-dimensional titanium tin carbide (Ti2SnC) plates based on the electronic structure investigation|journal=Materials Research Innovations |volume=4|issue=1|pages=36–41|doi=10.1007/s100190000065}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2007, there were two reports of a [[lead carbide]] PbC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, apparently of the acetylide type; but these claims have yet to be published in reviewed journals.)

==Related materials==
In addition to the carbides, other groups of related carbon compounds exist:&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot; /&gt; 
*[[graphite intercalation compound]]s
*alkali metal fullerides
*[[endohedral fullerenes]], where the metal atom is encapsulated inside a fullerene molecule
*metallacarbohedrenes(met-cars) which are cluster compounds containing C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units.
*[[tunable nanoporous carbon]], where gas chlorination of metallic carbides removes metal molecules to form a highly porous, near-pure carbon material capable of high-density energy storage.
*[[Transition metal carbene complex]]es.

[[General officer|General]] '''Charles Chandler Krulak''' (born March 4, 1942) served as the 31st [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] from July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1999. He is the son of Lieutenant General [[Victor H. Krulak|Victor H. &quot;Brute&quot; Krulak]], USMC, who served in [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korea]], and [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]]. He is currently President of [[Birmingham-Southern College]] after his stint as a non-executive director of [[England|English]] [[association football]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

==Early years; education==
Charles Chandler Krulak was born in 1942 in [[Quantico, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/951/000128567/ NNDB Name Mapper]&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], Krulak attended the [[United States Naval Academy]], graduating in 1964 with a bachelor's degree. Krulak also holds a master's degree in labor relations from [[George Washington University]] (1973). He is a graduate of the [[Amphibious Warfare School]] (1968); the Army Command and General Staff College (1976); and the [[National War College]] (1982).

==Marine Corps career==
After his commissioning and graduation from [[The Basic School]] at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]], Krulak held a variety of command and staff positions. His command positions included: [[Commanding Officer]] of a platoon and two rifle companies during two tours of duty in [[Vietnam]]; Commanding Officer of Special Training Branch and Recruit Series at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]], [[California]] (1966–1968); Commanding Officer of Counter-Guerilla Warfare School, [[Camp Gonsalves|Northern Training Area]] on [[Okinawa]] (1970), Company Officer at the United States Naval Academy (1970–1973); Commanding Officer of the Marine Barracks at [[Naval Air Station North Island]], California (1973–1976), and Commanding Officer, [[3rd Battalion 3rd Marines]] (1983–1985). 

Krulak's staff assignments included: Operations Officer, [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines]] (1977–1978); Chief of the Combat Arms Monitor Section at [[Headquarters Marine Corps]], [[Washington, D.C.]] (1978–1979); Executive Assistant to the Director of Personnel Management, Headquarters Marine Corps (1979–1981); Plans Office, Fleet Marine Forces Pacific, [[Camp H.M. Smith]], [[Hawaii]] (1982–1983); Executive Officer, [[3rd Marine Regiment]], [[1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade]]; Assistant Chief of Staff, Maritime Pre-positioning Ships, 1st MEB; Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, 1st MEB; and the Military Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Office of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. 

He was assigned duty as the Deputy Director of the [[White House Military Office]] in September 1987. While serving in this capacity, he was selected for promotion to [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in November 1988. He was advanced to that grade on June 5, 1989, and assigned duties as the Commanding General, 10th &lt;nowiki&gt;MEB/Assistant&lt;/nowiki&gt; Division Commander, [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]], FMF Atlantic, at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]] on July 10, 1989. On June 1, 1990, he assumed duties as the Commanding General, [[2nd Marine Logistics Group|2nd Force Service Support Group]] &lt;nowiki&gt;Group/Commanding&lt;/nowiki&gt; General, 6th MEB, FMF Atlantic and commanded the 2d FSSG during the [[Gulf War]]. He served in this capacity until July 12, 1991, and was assigned duty as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (Personnel &lt;nowiki&gt;Management/Personnel&lt;/nowiki&gt; Procurement), Headquarters Marine Corps on August 5, 1991. He was advanced to [[major general (United States)|major general]] on March 20, 1992. General Krulak was assigned as Commanding General, [[Marine Corps Combat Development Command]], Quantico, on August 24, 1992, and was promoted to [[lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] on September 1, 1992. On July 22, 1994, he was assigned as Commander of Marine Forces &lt;nowiki&gt;Pacific/Commanding&lt;/nowiki&gt; General, FMF Pacific, and in March 1995 he was nominated to serve as the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]]. On June, 29, he was promoted to [[General (United States)|general]] and assumed duties as the 31st Commandant on June 30, 1995. He was relieved on June 30, 1999, by General [[James L. Jones]].

General Krulak attracted some attention during his tenure as commandant by his custom of delivering Christmas cookies to each marine duty post in the Washington area. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stripes.com/blogs/the-rumor-doctor/the-rumor-doctor-1.104348/did-gen-mattis-pull-duty-on-christmas-so-a-marine-could-be-with-his-family-1.134995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Marine Corps career==
General Krulak joined [[MBNA]] America in September 1999 as chief administrative officer, responsible for personnel, benefits, compensation, education, and other administrative services. Krulak has served as the Senior Vice Chairman and [[Chief Executive Officer]] of MBNA Europe (2001–2005) and was based at the Chester campus in the UK. He was the executive vice chairman and chief administration officer of MBNA Corporation (2004–2005). He retired from MBNA in 2005.

Following the takeover of English Football Club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] by MBNA Chairman [[Randy Lerner]] in August 2006 and as of September 19, 2006, General Krulak joined the Board of Aston Villa as non-executive director, where he quickly earned the approval of the fans by taking the time to post on various Aston Villa [[messageboards]]. Krulak is generally referred to as &quot;The General&quot; by fans on these boards.

Krulak also serves on the boards of [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Freeport-McMoran]] (formerly known as Phelps Dodge Corporation) and [[Union Pacific Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Legacy==
General Krulak famously referred to the [[Strategic Corporal]] and the [[Three Block War]] as two of the key lessons identified from the deployments in [[Somalia]], [[Haiti]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. These concepts are still considered vital in understanding the increasing complexity of modern [[battle]]fields.

General Krulak explained some of his warfighting philosophy in an interview with [[Tom Clancy]] in Clancy's nonfiction book ''[[Marine (book)|Marine]]''. Clancy referred to General Krulak as &quot;Warrior Prince of the Corps&quot;.

General Krulak also rewrote the Marine Corps' basic combat study text, ''MCDP-1: Warfighting'', incorporating his theories on operations in the modern battlefield.

==Family==
General Krulak is married to Zandi Meyers from Annapolis. They have two sons, David and Todd.
He is the son of LtGen [[Victor H. Krulak]], Sr., and the younger brother of Commander Victor H. Krulak Jr, [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|Navy Chaplain Corps]] and Colonel William Krulak, USMCR&lt;ref&gt;Coram, Robert (2010). Brute: The Life of Victor Krulak, U.S. Marine. Little, Brown &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Compaq Computer Corporation''' is an American [[personal computer]] company founded in 1982. Once the [[Market share of leading PC vendors|largest supplier of personal computing systems]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, Jan W. and Porter, Michael E. Matching Dell, Harvard Business School Case 9-799-158, June 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Compaq existed as an independent corporation until 2002, when it was acquired for US$25 billion by [[Hewlett-Packard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compaq a&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Agree to Merge, Creating $87 Billion Global Technology Leader |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |date=September 3, 2001  |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2001/010904a.html |accessdate =October 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;compaq b&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7DE1739F937A3575AC0A9679C8B63|title=Hewlett-Packard in Deal to Buy Compaq for $25 Billion in Stock  |date=2001-09-04|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate =October 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company was formed by [[Rod Canion]], [[Jim Harris (Compaq)|Jim Harris]] and [[Bill Murto]] &amp;mdash; former [[Texas Instruments]] senior managers.

Accessed September 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Check the address and you will see it is outside of the Houston city limits--&gt;

==History==
===1980s===
[[Image:Compaq logo old.svg|220px|thumbnail|Early Compaq logo.]]
Compaq was founded in February 1982 by [[Rod Canion]], [[Jim Harris (Compaq)|Jim Harris]] and [[Bill Murto]], three senior managers from semiconductor manufacturer [[Texas Instruments]]. Each invested $1,000 to form the company. Their first venture capital came from [[Benjamin M. Rosen]] and [[Sevin Rosen Funds]]. The original Compaq PC was first sketched out on a placemat by Ted Papajohn while dining with the founders in a local Houston restaurant, [[House of Pies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/2001-09-04-compaq-history.htm|title=Compaq: From place mat sketch to PC giant|date=09/04/2001|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company was founded with the temporary name Gateway Technology. The name &quot;COMPAQ&quot; was said to be derived from &quot;Compatibility and Quality&quot; but this explanation was an afterthought. The name was chosen from many suggested on several occasions by a name consulting company. It being the one that was not rejected from the list on several occasions.
Two key marketing executives in Compaq's early years, Jim D'Arezzo and Sparky Sparks, had come from [[IBM PC|IBM's PC Group]]. Other key executives responsible for the company's meteoric growth in the late 80s and early 90s were Ross A. Cooley, another former IBMer, who served for many years as SVP of GM North America; Michael Swavely, who was the company's chief marketing officer in the early years, and eventually ran the North America organization, later passing along that responsibility to Mr. Cooley, when Swavely retired. In the United States, Brendan A. &quot;Mac&quot; McLoughlin (another long time IBM executive) led the company's field sales organization after starting up the Western U.S. Area of Operations. These gifted executives, along with other key contributors, including Kevin Ellington, Douglas Johns, Steven Flannigan, and Gary Stimac, helped the company with the IBM Corporation in all personal computer sales categories, after many predicted that none could compete with the behemoth.

====Compaq Portable====
[[Image:Compaq portable.jpg|thumb|right|[[Compaq Portable]]]]In November 1982 Compaq announced their first product, the [[Compaq Portable]], a portable [[IBM PC compatible]] [[personal computer]]. It was released in March 1983 at $2995, considerably more affordable than the Canadian [[Hyperion (computer)|Hyperion]]. The Compaq Portable was one of the progenitors of today's [[laptop]]; some called it a &quot;suitcase computer&quot; for its size and the look of its case. It was the second IBM PC compatible, being capable of running all software that would run on an [[IBM PC]]. It was a commercial success, selling 53,000 units in its first year and generating $111 million in sales revenue. The Compaq Portable was the first in the range of the [[Compaq Portable series]]. Compaq was able to market a legal IBM clone because [[IBM]] mostly used &quot;off the shelf&quot; parts for their [[IBM PC|PC]]. Furthermore, [[Microsoft]] had kept the right to license [[MS-DOS|the operating system]] to other computer manufacturers. The only part which had to be duplicated was the [[BIOS]], which Compaq did legally by using [[Clean room design|clean room reverse engineering]] at a cost of $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,21218,00.asp |title=Loyd Case: A Trip Down Memory Lane with Hewlett-Packard &amp; Compaq |accessdate=2008-01-31 |work=extremetech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/1999/pulpit_19990930_000400.html |title=Real Trouble: How Reverse Engineering May Yet Kill Real Networks |accessdate=2008-01-31 |author=Robert X. Cringely |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/comphist/comp1982.htm |title=Chronology of Personal Computers (1982) |accessdate=2008-01-31 |author=Ken Polsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoenix Technologies]] would shortly follow their lead, but soon &quot;clone BIOSes&quot; were available from many other companies who reverse engineered IBM's design, then sold their version to the PC clone manufacturers.

====Deskpro====
On June 28, 1984 Compaq released the Compaq Deskpro, a 16-bit desktop computer using an [[Intel 8086]] microprocessor running at 7.14&amp;nbsp;MHz. It was considerably faster than an [[IBM PC]] and was, like the [[Compaq Portable]], also capable of running IBM software. This was the first of the [[Compaq Deskpro]] line of computers.

====Deskpro 386====
When Compaq introduced the first PC based on [[Intel]]'s new [[Intel 80386|80386]] microprocessor, the Compaq Deskpro 386, in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,9-c,systems/article.html |title=PC World - The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time |accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; they began a period of increasing performance leadership over IBM, who were not yet using this processor. An IBM machine eventually reached the market seven months later, but by that time Compaq was the 386 supplier of choice and IBM had lost its image of technical leadership.

For the first three months after announcement the Deskpro 386 shipped with Windows/386. This was a version of Windows 2.1 adapted for the 80386 processor. Support for the virtual 8086 mode was added by Compaq engineers.

====Systempro====
This technical leadership and the rivalry with IBM was emphasized when the [[Compaq Systempro|Systempro]] server was launched in late 1989 - this was a true server product with standard support for a second CPU and [[RAID]], but also the first product to feature the [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] bus, designed in reaction to IBM's MCA ([[MicroChannel Architecture]]). Prior to developing EISA, Compaq invested significant resources into reverse engineering MCA. After significant research, Compaq shelved the idea of cloning MCA and formed an alliance with HP and seven others to develop EISA.

===1990s===
[[File:HewlettPackardCampusHarrisCoTX.png|thumb|Aerial map of the Compaq headquarters, now the [[Hewlett-Packard]] USA campus in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Harris County, Texas]]]]
At the same time as they began to dominate the server market, in the early 1990s Compaq entered the retail computer market with the [[Presario]], and was one of the first manufacturers in the mid-1990s to market a sub-$1000 PC. In order to maintain the prices it wanted, Compaq became the first top-tier computer manufacturer to utilize CPUs from [[AMD]] and [[Cyrix]]. The price war resulting from Compaq's actions ultimately drove numerous competitors, most notably [[IBM]] and [[Packard Bell]], from this market{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

In 1997, Compaq bought [[Tandem Computers]], known for their [[NonStop]] server line. This acquisition instantly gave Compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market. In 1998, Compaq acquired [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], the leading company in the previous generation of [[minicomputer]]s during the 1970s and early 1980s. This acquisition made Compaq, at the time, the second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue. Unfortunately for the company, CEO [[Eckhard Pfeiffer]], who engineered both mergers, had little vision for what the combined companies should do, or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity, and Compaq struggled as a result. Pfeiffer was forced out as CEO in 1999 in a coup led by board chairman Ben Rosen and was succeeded by [[Michael Capellas]], who had been serving as Compaq's CIO. Capellas was able to restore some of the luster lost in the latter part of the Pfeiffer era, but the company still struggled against lower-cost competitors such as [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]].

During November 1999, Compaq began to work with [[Microsoft]] to create the first in a line of small-scale, web-based computer systems called [[MSN Companion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MSN Web Companion
  | url = http://www.wince.ne.jp/review/okamon/20000107.htm
  | accessdate = 2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Compaq also signed new sales and equipment alliance with [[NaviSite]]. Under the pact, Compaq agreed to promote and sell NaviSite Web hosting services. In return, NaviSite took Compaq as a preferred provider for its storage and [[Intel]]-based servers.

Compaq's headquarters complex consisted of {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of land in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] northwest [[Harris County, Texas]]. The land had 15 office buildings, seven manufacturing buildings, a product conference center, an employee cafeteria, mechanical laboratories, warehouses, and chemical handling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.matrixdesigncompanies.com/MatrixSpencer/Compaq-Houston.html Compaq Computer Corporation — World Headquarters].&quot; Matrix Spencer - Matrix Design Companies.

==Merger with HP==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2009}}
[[Image:HPComputerHoustonISD.jpg|thumb|An HP Compaq computer and an HP Deskjet 5740 printer owned by the [[Houston Independent School District]]]]
In 2001, Compaq engaged in a merger with [[Hewlett-Packard Company|Hewlett-Packard]]. Numerous large HP shareholders, including [[Walter Hewlett]], publicly opposed the deal, which resulted in an impassioned public proxy battle between those for and against the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18817715;jsessionid=D1MDU4QZ5SOHBQE1GHPCKHWATMY32JVN].&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger was approved only after the narrowest of margins, and allegations of vote buying (primarily involving an alleged last-second back-room deal with [[Deutsche Bank]]) haunted the new company.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

It was subsequently disclosed that HP had retained Deutsche Bank's investment banking division in January 2002 to assist in the merger. HP had agreed to pay Deutsche Bank $1 million guaranteed, and another $1 million contingent upon approval of the merger. On August 19, 2003, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] charged Deutsche Bank with failing to disclose a material conflict of interest in its voting of client proxies for the merger and imposed a civil penalty of $750,000. Deutsche Bank consented without admitting or denying the findings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-100.htm SEC Press Release:] &quot;SEC Brings Settled Enforcement Action Against Deutsche Bank Investment Advisory Unit in Connection with Its Voting of Client Proxies for Merger Transaction; Imposes $750,000 Penalty&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the merger, Compaq's [[ticker symbol]] was CPQ. This was melded with Hewlett-Packard's previous symbol (HWP) to create the current symbol of HPQ.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Post merger===
[[File:HewlettPackardHarrisCoTX.JPG|thumb|right|Former Compaq headquarters, now the [[Hewlett-Packard]] United States offices]]
Capellas left the company after serving less than a year as President of HP to become CEO of [[MCI Communications|MCI Worldcom]], leading to its purchase by [[Verizon]]. [[Carly Fiorina]], the Chairman and CEO of HP, added Capellas's responsibilities to her own.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Fiorina helmed HP for nearly three years after Capellas left. HP laid off thousands of former Compaq, DEC, HP, and Tandem employees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061226/news_1b26hp.html &quot;HP hires workers as it lets others go&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/technology/ci_4893866 &quot;What's 150,000 minus 45,--~~~~000? In Hewlett-Packard's world, the answer is still roughly 150,000.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; its stock price generally declined and profits did not perk up. Though the merger initially made it the number one PC maker, it soon lost the lead and further market share to [[Dell Inc.|Dell]]. In addition, the merging of the stagnant Compaq computer manufacturer with HP's lucrative printing and imaging division was criticized as that overshadowed the latter's profitability. In February 2005, the Board of Directors ousted Fiorina. Former Compaq CEO Capellas was mentioned by some as a potential successor, but several months afterwards, [[Mark Hurd]] was hired as CEO. 

In late 2005, HPQ seemed to find its feet under the new leadership of Mark Hurd. At this same time Dell seemed to be faltering and HPQ took back the #1 sales position. Hurd separated the PC division from the imaging and printing division. HP's PC segment has since been reinvigorated and now generates more revenue than the traditionally more profitable printers{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

Most Compaq products have been re-branded with the HP nameplate, such as the company's market leading ProLiant server line, while the Compaq brand remains on only some consumer-oriented and budget products, notably [[Compaq Presario]] [[IBM PC|PC]]s. HP's business computers line was discontinued in favour of the Compaq Evo line, which was rebranded HP Compaq. HP's Jornada PDAs were replaced by Compaq iPAQ PDAs, which were renamed HP iPAQ.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} All Compaq computers now ship with HP software.

In May 2007, HP in a press release announced a new logo for their Compaq Division to be placed on the new model Compaq Presarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/feature_stories/2007/07mobility.html |title=Connect at the speed of business: HP Feature story (May 2007) |accessdate=2008-01-31 |publisher=Hewlett-Packard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, HP reshuffled its business line notebooks.  The &quot;Compaq&quot; name from its &quot;HP Compaq&quot; series was originally used for all of HP's business and budget notebooks. However, the &quot;[[HP EliteBook]]&quot; line became the top of the business notebook lineup while the &quot;HP Compaq b series&quot; became its middle business line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://h41131.www4.hp.com/uk/en/press/hp-debuts-hp-elitebook--expands-business-notebook-portfolio.html |title=HP Debuts HP EliteBook, Expands Business Notebook Portfolio |accessdate=2008-06-17 |publisher=Hewlett-Packard}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2009, the &quot;HP ProBook&quot; filled out HP's low end business lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2009/090428xa.html |title=HP Unveils HP ProBook Notebook PC Line |accessdate=2008-06-17 |publisher=Hewlett-Packard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, HP sold part of Compaq's former headquarters to the [[Lone Star College System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://old.lonestar.edu/156806/ |title=LSCS purchases center core of HP north campus |accessdate=2009-07-21 |publisher=Lone Star College System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorship==
Compaq sponsored [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers Football Club]] from 1994 to 1996, during their most recent two seasons as a [[Premier League]] club. Compaq sponsored [[Bradford Bulls]] [[Rugby League]] club. Before its merger with HP, it also sponsored the [[WilliamsF1|Williams Formula One team]] when it was still powered by BMW engines.

==Competitors==
Compaq originally competed directly against IBM, manufacturing [[IBM PC Compatible|computer systems]] equivalent with the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], and later against other IBM PC Compatible machines.

As a subsidiary of HP, Compaq primarily competes against other budget-oriented personal computer series from manufacturers including [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[ASUS]], [[Dell]], [[Lenovo]], and [[Toshiba]].

'''Cluny''' or '''Clugny''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Saône-et-Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Bourgogne]] in eastern [[France]]. It is 20&amp;nbsp;km north west of [[Mâcon]].

The town grew up around the [[Benedictine]] [[Cluny Abbey]], founded by Duke [[William I of Aquitaine]] in AD 910. The height of Cluniac influence was from the second half of the 10th century through the early 12th.

The abbey was sacked by the [[Huguenots]] in 1562 and many of the valuable manuscripts were destroyed or removed.

'''Chester Burton Atkins''' (June 20, 1924 – June 30, 2001), better known as '''Chet Atkins''', was an American [[guitarist]] and [[record producer]] who created, along with [[Owen Bradley]], the smoother [[country music]] style known as the [[Nashville sound]], which expanded country's appeal to adult pop music fans as well. 

Atkins's picking style, inspired by [[Merle Travis]], [[Django Reinhardt]], [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]] and [[Les Paul]], brought him admirers within and outside the country scene, both in the United States and internationally. Atkins produced records for [[Perry Como]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[Everly Brothers]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Don Gibson]], [[Jim Reeves]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Waylon Jennings]] and others. 

Among many honors, Atkins received 14 [[Grammy Award]]s as well as the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]], nine [[Country Music Association]] Instrumentalist of the Year awards, and was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]].

==Biography==
===Childhood and early life===
Chet Atkins was born on June 20, 1924, in [[Luttrell, Tennessee]], near [[Clinch Mountain]], and grew up with his mother, two brothers and a sister—he was the youngest. His parents divorced when he was six. He started out on the [[ukulele]], later moving on to the fiddle, but traded his brother Lowell an old pistol and some chores for a guitar when he was nine.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMT&quot;&gt;[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/atkins_chet/bio.jhtml Country Music Television biography. Accessed on March 28, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in his 1974 autobiography, &quot;We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the forties before anyone even knew there had been a depression.&quot; Forced to relocate to Fortson, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to live with his father because of a near-fatal [[asthma]] condition, Atkins was a sensitive youth who made music his obsession. Because of his illness, he was forced to sleep in a straight-back chair in order to breathe comfortably. On those nights, he would play his guitar until he fell asleep holding it, a habit which lasted his whole life.&lt;ref name=&quot;CG&quot;&gt;Atkins, Chet and Neely, Bill. (1974). &quot;Country Gentleman&quot;. Chicago. Harry Regnery Company. ISBN 0-8092-9051-0.&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Fortson, he attended historic Mountain Hill School. He would return in the 1990s to play a series of charity concerts to save the school from demolition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Stories have been told about the very young Chet who, when a friend or relative would come to visit, and if that person played a guitar, would crowd in and put his ear so very close to the instrument that it became difficult for that person to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;CG&quot; /&gt;

Atkins became an accomplished guitarist while he was in high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMT&quot; /&gt; He would use the restroom in the school to practice, because it gave better acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Chet and Neely, Bill. (1974). &quot;Country Gentleman&quot;. Chicago. Harry Regnery Company. ISBN 0-8092-9051-0. Pg 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chet Atkins' Workshop, [[RCA Victor]] LSP-2232 liner notes. 1961. [[David Halberstam]]&lt;/ref&gt; His first guitar had a nail for a nut and was so bowed that only the first few frets could be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot;&gt;Atkins, Chet and Cochran, Russ. (2003). &quot;Me and My Guitars&quot;. Milwaukee. Hal Leonard Corporation. ISBN 0-634-05565-8.&lt;/ref&gt; He later purchased a semi-acoustic electric guitar and amp, but he had to travel many miles to find an electrical outlet since his home had no electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Chet and Neely, Bill. (1974). &quot;Country Gentleman&quot;. Chicago. Harry Regnery Company. ISBN 0-8092-9051-0. Pg 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life he lightheartedly gave himself (along with [[John Knowles (guitarist)|John Knowles]], [[Tommy Emmanuel]], [[Steve Wariner]] and [[Jerry Reed]]) the honorary degree CGP, standing for &quot;Certified Guitar Player&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot; /&gt; His half-brother Jim was a successful guitarist who worked with the [[Les Paul#The Les Paul Trio|Les Paul Trio]] in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;CG&quot; /&gt;

Atkins did not have a strong style of his own until 1939 when (while still living in Georgia) he heard [[Merle Travis]] picking over [[WLW]] radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;CG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=99 Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; This early influence dramatically shaped his unique playing style. Whereas Travis's right hand used his index finger for the melody and thumb for bass notes, Atkins expanded his right hand style to include picking with his first three fingers, with the thumb on bass.

Chet Atkins was a [[Ham Radio]] General class licensee. Formerly using the call-sign, WA4CZD, he obtained the vanity call sign W4CGP in 1998 to reflect the C.G.P. name. He was an [[American Radio Relay League|ARRL]] member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2001/07/02/1/?nc=1 ARRLWeb: 'Mister Guitar,' Chet Atkins, W4CGP, SK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early musical career===
After dropping out of high school in 1942, Atkins landed a job at [[WNOX|WNOX-AM]] radio in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. There he played fiddle and guitar with singer [[Bill Carlisle]] and comic [[Archie Campbell]] as well as becoming a member of the station's Dixieland Swingsters, a small swing instrumental combo. After three years, he moved to [[WLW|WLW-AM]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where Merle Travis had formerly worked. 

After six months he moved to Raleigh and worked with [[Johnnie and Jack]] before heading for [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he performed with Sunshine Sue Workman. Atkins's shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly &quot;country.&quot; He was fired often but was soon able to land another job at another radio station due to his unique playing ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;CG&quot; /&gt;

Traveling to Chicago, Atkins auditioned for [[Red Foley]], who was leaving his star position on [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]]'s ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RollingStone&quot;&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5931727/chet_atkins_dies/print Rolling Stone Magazine. Accessed on March 28, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based Bullet Records that year. That single, &quot;Guitar Blues&quot;, was fairly progressive, including as it did, a clarinet solo by Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan with [[Owen Bradley]] on piano. He had a solo spot on the Opry; but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to [[KWTO|KWTO-AM]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Despite the support of executive [[Si Siman]], however, he was soon was fired for not sounding &quot;country enough.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CG&quot; /&gt;

===Signing with RCA Victor===
While working with a Western band in [[Denver, Colorado]], Atkins came to the attention of [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]]. Siman had been encouraging [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] to sign Atkins, as his style (with the success of [[Merle Travis]] as a hit recording artist) was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A&amp;R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down to Denver. 

He made his first RCA recordings in Chicago in 1947. They did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with [[Homer and Jethro]] on WNOX's new Saturday night radio show ''The Tennessee Barn Dance'' and the popular ''Midday Merry Go Round''.

In 1949 he left WNOX to join [[June Carter#With Mother Maybelle &amp; the Carter Sisters|Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters]] back on KWTO. This incarnation of the old [[Carter Family]] featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in mid-1950. Atkins began working on recording sessions, performing on [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]] and the Opry.&lt;ref name=&quot;CG&quot; /&gt;

While he hadn't yet had a hit record on RCA his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a Session Leader when the New York–based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA artists. Atkins's first hit single was &quot;[[Mr. Sandman]]&quot;, followed by &quot;Silver Bell&quot;, which he did as a duet with [[Hank Snow]]. His albums also became more popular, and he was featured on ABC-TV's ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]'' during the summer of 1956; as well as on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Country Music Jubilee]]'' in 1957 and 58 (by then renamed ''Jubilee USA''). 
[[File:Gretsch G6122-1958.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins's [[Gretsch]] ''Country Gentleman'', model G6122-1962]]

In addition to recording, Atkins became a design consultant for [[Gretsch]], who manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955–1980. Atkins also became manager of RCA's Nashville studio, eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary [[RCA Studio B]], the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the now-famous [[Music Row]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot; /&gt;

===Performer and producer===
When Sholes took over pop production in 1957—a result of his success with [[Elvis Presley]]—he put Atkins in charge of RCA's Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll took over, Atkins and [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] took their cue from [[Owen Bradley]] and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans. This became known as the [[Nashville sound]] which Atkins said was a label created by the media attached to a style of recording done during that period to keep country (and their jobs) viable. 

Atkins used the [[Jordanaires]] and a rhythm section on hits like [[Jim Reeves]]' &quot;[[Four Walls (song)|Four Walls]]&quot; and &quot;[[He'll Have to Go]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r245817|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic entry for ''Welcome to My World'', Jim Reeves 1996 box-set from Bear Family Records]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Don Gibson]]'s &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; and &quot;Blue Blue Day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1624|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography entry for Don Gibson]&lt;/ref&gt; The once rare phenomenon of having a country hit [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the driver's seat, guiding an artist's choice of material and the musical background.

Atkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and [[jazz]], in a sophisticated home studio, often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA but adding his solo parts at home, refining the tracks until the results satisfied him.&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot; /&gt; Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period he became known internationally as &quot;Mister Guitar&quot;, inspiring an album named ''[[Mister Guitar]]'', engineered by both Bob Ferris and [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], his replacement.

[[File:RCA Studio B - Chet Atkins, Bill Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins listening as [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]] adjusts a mix in RCA's Nashville studio]]
At the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at RCA's Nashville studio, in the space now known as &quot;Studio B&quot;. (At the time there was only one studio at RCA, with no letter designation.) Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studio's German effects device, an [[Elektro-Mess-Technik|EMT]] [[Reverberation#Plate_reverberators|plate reverb]]. With his [[golden ear]], Porter found the studio's acoustics to be problematic, and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling, then selected positions for microphones based on resonant [[room modes]]. The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more [[Dynamic range|dynamic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ballou|first=Glen|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|year=1998|publisher=Focal Press|page=1154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him &quot;it was Porter.&quot;&lt;ref name=McClellan2004&gt;{{cite book |last1=McClellan |first1=John |last2=Bratic |first2=Deyan |title=Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mmCUExOXx0MC |volume=2 |year=2004 |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |isbn=0786658770 |pages=149–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording—if someone was out of tune he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, &quot;we got a little tuning problem&amp;nbsp;... Everybody check and see what's going on.&quot;&lt;ref name=McClellan2004/&gt; If that didn't work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late 1964, Atkins said, &quot;the sound was never the same, never as great.&quot;&lt;ref name=McClellan2004/&gt;

Atkins's trademark &quot;Atkins Style&quot; of playing uses the thumb and first two—sometimes three—fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger (which was exactly how Travis played) and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers—and that was the style he pioneered and mastered. 

He enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians which led to them being asked to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1960. Although that performance was canceled due to rioting, a live recording of the group (''[[After the Riot in Newport|After the Riot at Newport]]'') was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the [[White House]] for presidents Kennedy through George H. W. Bush. Atkins was a member of the [[Million Dollar Band (country music group)|Million Dollar Band]] during the 1980s. He is also well-known for his song &quot;Yankee Doodle Dixie&quot;, in which he played &quot;[[Yankee Doodle]]&quot; at the same time as &quot;[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]&quot; simultaneously on the same guitar. 

Before his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCA's country division. In 1987 he told [[Nine-O-One Network Magazine]] that he was &quot;ashamed&quot; of his promotion: &quot;I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know, too, that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nine-O-One Interview, Nine-O-One Network Magazine,December 1987, p.10-11&lt;/ref&gt; He had brought [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Bobby Bare]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Jerry Reed]] and [[John Hartford]] to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others.&lt;ref name=&quot;RockHall&quot;&gt;[http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/chet-atkins Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Accessed on March 28, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the [[Civil Rights Movement]] sparked violence throughout the South by signing country music's first African-American singer [[Charley Pride]], who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.

Atkins's own biggest hit single came in 1965, with &quot;Yakety Axe&quot;, an adaptation of his friend saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]]'s &quot;[[Yakety Sax]]&quot;. He rarely performed in those days, and eventually had to hire other RCA producers like [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]] to alleviate his workload.&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot; /&gt;

===Atkins retires from producing===
In the 1970s, Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records but could still turn out hits such as [[Perry Como]]'s pop hit &quot;[[And I Love You So]]&quot;. He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker [[Jerry Reed]], who'd become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA, to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love, the guitar, often recording with [[Jerry Reed|Reed]] or even [[Homer &amp; Jethro]]'s Jethro Burns (Atkins's brother-in-law) after Homer died in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot; /&gt;

By the end of the 1970s, Atkins's time had passed as a producer. New executives at RCA had different ideas. He first retired from his position in the company, and then began to feel stifled as an artist because RCA would not let him branch out into [[jazz]]. His mid-1970s collaborations with one of his influences, [[Les Paul]], ''Chester &amp; Lester'' and ''Guitar Monsters'', had already reflected that interest; ''Chester &amp; Lester'' was one of the best-selling recordings of Atkins's career. At the same time he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch (no longer family-owned) was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]. He left RCA in 1982 and signed with [[Columbia Records]], for whom he produced a debut album in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;RollingStone&quot; /&gt; 

Jazz had always been a strong love of his, and often in his career he was criticized by &quot;pure&quot; country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being called a &quot;country guitarist&quot;, insisting that he was a guitarist, period. Although he played 'by ear' and was a masterful improviser he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When [[Roger C. Field]], a friend, suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer he did so with [[Suzy Bogguss]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot;/&gt; 

He returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with [[Mark Knopfler]] and [[Jerry Reed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot; /&gt; Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend [[Tommy Emmanuel]]. On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the 20th century, he named [[Django Reinhardt]] to the first position on the list, and placed himself at fifth position.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialSite&quot;&gt;[http://www.misterguitar.com/news/chetsten.html Official Web Site of Chet Atkins. Accessed on March 31, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years he even went back to radio, appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio program, on [[American Public Media]] radio, even picking up a fiddle from time to time.&lt;ref name=&quot;mamg&quot; /&gt;

==Legacy==
Atkins received numerous awards, including 14 Grammy Awards and nine Country Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;RollingStone&quot; /&gt; In 1993 he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine awarded him their Century Award, their &quot;highest honor for distinguished creative achievement&quot;, in December 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chetatkins/biography Rolling Stone Chet Atkins biography. Accessed on May 10, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of stride-pianist [[James P. Johnson]]'s &quot;Johnson Rag,&quot; all the way to the rock stylings of [[Eric Johnson]], an invited guest on Atkins's recording sessions who, when Chet attempted to copy his influential rocker &quot;[[Cliffs of Dover (song)|Cliffs of Dover]]&quot;, led to Atkins's creation of a unique arrangement of &quot;Londonderry Air (Danny Boy).&quot; 

Chet's recordings of &quot;Malaguena&quot; inspired a new generation of [[Flamenco]] guitarists; the classical guitar selections included on almost all his albums were, for many American artists working in the field today, the first classical guitar they ever heard. He recorded [[smooth jazz]] guitar still played on American airwaves today.

While he did more performing in the 1990s his health grew frail as he was diagnosed with cancer again in 1996. He died on June 30, 2001 at his home in Nashville.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/02/obit.chet.atkins/index.html CNN Obituary, July 2, 2001.] Accessed June 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins was laid to rest at Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens in Nashville.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=23366 Chet Atkins at Find A Grave.] Accessed November 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Atkins was quoted many times throughout his career, and of his own legacy he once said: 

{{quote|Years from now, after I'm gone, someone will listen to what I've done and know I was here. They may not know or care who I was, but they'll hear my guitars speaking for me.}}

A stretch of [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|Interstate 185]] in southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (between [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] and [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]) is named &quot;Chet Atkins Parkway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganet.org/services/leg/ShowBillPre.cgi?year=1997&amp;filename=1997/HR245.passed Chet Atkins Parkway bill resolution.] Accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This stretch of interstate runs through Fortson, GA where Atkins spent much of his childhood.

In 2002, Atkins was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RockHall&quot; /&gt; His award was presented by [[Marty Stuart]] and [[Brian Setzer]] and accepted by Atkins's grandson, Jonathan Russell. The following year, Atkins ranked #28 in ''[[CMT]]'s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music''.

At the age of 13, jazz guitarist [[Earl Klugh]] was captivated watching Atkins's guitar playing on ''The [[Perry Como]] Show.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalostate.edu/pac/season/klugh.asp Performing Arts Center, Buffalo State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins also inspired Drexl Jonez and [[Tommy Emmanuel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tommyemmanuel.com/about/ Tommy Emmanuel official website biography.] Retrieved September, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clint Black]]'s album &quot;[[Nothin' but the Taillights]]&quot; includes the song &quot;Ode to Chet,&quot; which includes the lines &quot;'Cause I can win her over like Romeo did Juliet, if I can only show her I can almost pick that legato lick like '''Chet'''&quot; and &quot;It'll take more than [[Mel Bay]] 1, 2, &amp; 3 if I'm ever gonna play like '''CGP'''.&quot; Atkins plays guitar on the track. At the end of the song Black and Atkins have a brief conversation.

'''''Cahiers du Cinéma''''' ({{IPA-fr|kaje dy sinema}}, ''Notebooks on Cinema'') is an influential [[France|French]] [[film]] [[magazine]] founded in 1951 by [[André Bazin]], [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]] and [[Joseph-Marie Lo Duca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Itzkoff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian Macnab&quot;&gt;Macnab, Geoffrey (7 April 2001) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/apr/07/books.guardianreview ''Pretentious, nous?''] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; It developed from the earlier magazine ''Revue du Cinéma'' (''Review of the Cinema'') involving members of two Paris film clubs &amp;mdash; ''Objectif 49'' (''Objective 49'')  ([[Robert Bresson]], [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Alexandre Astruc]], among others) and ''Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin'' (''Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter''). Initially edited by [[Éric Rohmer]] (Maurice Scherer), it included amongst its writers [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[François Truffaut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Itzkoff&quot; /&gt;

==History==
''Cahiers'' re-invented the basic tenets of [[film criticism]] and [[film theory|theory]].  A 1954 article by Truffaut attacked ''La qualité française'' (&quot;the French Quality&quot;) and was the manifesto for 'la politique des Auteurs'&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian Macnab&quot; /&gt; which [[Andrew Sarris]] later termed the [[auteur theory]] &amp;mdash; resulting in the re-evaluation of [[Hollywood]] films and directors such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Howard Hawks]], [[Robert Aldrich]], [[Nicholas Ray]], [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Anthony Mann]]. ''Cahiers du Cinema'' authors also championed the work of directors [[Jean Renoir]], [[Roberto Rossellini]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Max Ophüls]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], by centering their critical evaluations on a film's ''[[mise en scène]]''. The magazine also was essential to the creation of the ''[[French New Wave|Nouvelle Vague]]'', or New Wave, of French cinema, which centered on films directed by ''Cahiers'' authors such as Godard and Truffaut.

Jacques Rivette replaced Rohmer as editor in 1963, shifted political and social concerns and paid more attention to the non-Hollywood cinema. The style moved through literary modernism in the early 1960s to radicalism and [[dialectical materialism]] by 1970. Moreover, during the mid-1970s the magazine was run by a [[Maoist]] editorial collective. In the mid-1970s, a review of the American movie ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' marked the magazine's return to more commercial perspectives, and an editorial turnover: ([[Serge Daney]], [[Serge Toubiana]], [[Thierry Jousse]], [[Antoine de Baecque]] and [[Charles Tesson]]). It led to the rehabilitation of some of the old ''Cahiers'' favourites, as well as some new film makers like [[Manoel de Oliveira]], [[Raoul Ruiz]], [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]], [[Youssef Chahine]], and [[Maurice Pialat]]. Recent writers have included [[Serge Daney]], Serge Toubiana, Thierry Jousse, Antoine de Baecque, Vincent Ostria, Charles Tesson and [[Franck Nouchi]], [[André Téchiné]], [[Léos Carax]], [[Olivier Assayas]], [[Danièle Dubroux]], and [[Serge Le Péron]].

In 1998, the Editions de l'Etoile (the company publishing ''Cahiers'') was acquired by the press group ''[[Le Monde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, Ben (10 February 2009) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/10/le-monde-sells-cahiers-du-cinema &quot;''Le Monde'' sells influential cinema magazine ''Cahiers du Cinéma''&quot;] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally losing money, the magazine attempted a make-over in 1999 to gain new readers, leading to a first split among writers and resulting in a magazine addressing all visual arts in a [[post-modernism|post-modernist]] approach. This version of the magazine printed ill-received opinion pieces on [[reality TV]] or [[video game]]s that confused the traditional readership of the magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Itzkoff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian Macnab&quot; /&gt;

''Le Monde'' took full editorial control of the magazine in 2003, appointing [[Jean-Michel Frodon]] as editor-in-chief.

In February 2009, ''Cahiers'' was acquired from ''Le Monde'' by [[Phaidon Press]], a worldwide publishing group which specialises in books on the visual arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Itzkoff&quot; /&gt; 

Phaidon appointed Stéphane Delorme editor-in-chief in July 2009.

'''Circuit Park Zandvoort''' is a [[motorsport]] [[race track]] located in Burgemeester van Alphenstraat 108, 2041 KP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.a1gp.com/Circuit/CircuitInfo.aspx?circuitId=9&amp;seasonId=4|title=Circuit Park Zandvoort, The Netherlands|publisher=a1gp.com|date=n.d.|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the dunes north of the town of [[Zandvoort]], in the [[Netherlands]], near the [[North Sea]] coast line.

== History ==
[[File:Zandvoort - Historical.svg|thumb|230px|left|Historical layout]]

There were plans for races at Zandvoort before [[World War II]]: the first street race was held on June 3, 1939. However, a permanent race track was not constructed until after the war, using communications roads built by the occupying German army. Contrary to popular belief [[John Hugenholtz]] cannot be credited with the design of the Zandvoort track, although he was involved as the Nederlandse Automobiel Ren Club chairman (the Dutch Auto Racing Club) before becoming the first track director in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.calameo.com/read/000374886fa8950ebb344|title=Grand Designs: John Hugenholtz |publisher=Grand Prix View|date=2010-10-05|accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it was 1927 Le Mans winner, [[S. C. H. &quot;Sammy&quot; Davis]] who was brought in as a track design advisor in July 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/zandvoort.html|title=The quintessential race track in the dunes|publisher=forix.autosport.com|date=Summer 2001|accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the layout was partly dictated by the existing roads.

The circuit was inaugurated on August 7, 1948. The following year the race was called the Zandvoort Grand Prix and in 1950 it became the &quot;Grote Prijs van Nederland&quot; or [[Dutch Grand Prix]]. The {{F1|1952}} Dutch Grand Prix was a round of the World Drivers Championship for the first time [but not a Formula One race, as the World Championship was for [[Formula Two]] cars that year and in 1953]. There was no GP at Zandvoort in 1954 (a sportscar-event replaced it), but 1955 saw the first proper [[Formula One]] race counting for the World Championship. After 2 more years without a race the Dutch Grand Prix was back on the World Championship(s) calendar in 1958 and from then on remained a permanent fixture (with the exception of 1972) until {{F1|1985}}, when it was held for the last time.
 
To solve a number of problems that had made it impossible to develop and upgrade the track, the most important one being noise pollution for the inhabitants of the part of Zandvoort closest to the track, the track management adopted and developed a plan to move the most southern part of the track away from the housing estate and rebuild a more compact track in the remaining former 'infield'. In January 1987 this plan got the necessary 'green light' when it was formally approved by the Noord-Holland Provincial Council. However, only a couple of months later a new problem arose: the company that commercially ran the circuit (CENAV), called in the receiver and went out of business, marking the end of &quot;Circuit van Zandvoort&quot;. 
Again the track, owned by the municipality of Zandvoort, was in danger of being permanently lost for motorsports. However, a new operating company, the Stichting Exploitatie Circuit Park, was formed and started work at the realization of the track's reconstruction plans. Circuit Park Zandvoort was born and in the summer of 1989 the track was remodeled to an interim Club Circuit of {{km to mi|2.6|precision=1}}, while the disposed southern part of the track was used to build a Vendorado Bungalow Park and new premises for the local soccer and hockey clubs. 

In 1995, CPZ got the &quot;A Status&quot; of the Dutch government and began building an international Grand Prix Circuit. This project was finished in 2001 when, after the track was redesigned to a {{km to mi|4.3|precision=1}} long circuit and a new pits building was realized (by HPG, the development company of John Hugenholtz jr, son of the former director), a new grandstand was situated along the long straight. One of the major events that is held at the circuit, along with DTM and A1GP, is the [[RTL Group|RTL]] [[Masters of Formula 3]], where [[Formula Three]] cars of several national racing series compete with each other (originally called Marlboro Masters, before tobacco advertising ban). A noise restriction order was responsible for this event moving to the Belgian [[Circuit Zolder]] for 2007 and 2008. However, the race will return to its historical home in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/72969|title=Masters to return to Zandvoort|publisher=autosport.com|date=2009-01-23|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circuit Park Zandvoort played host to the first race in the [[2006-07 A1 Grand Prix season|2006/07 season]] of [[A1 Grand Prix]] from 29 September-1 October 2006. On 21 August 2008, the official A1GP site reported that the [[2008-09 A1 Grand Prix season|2008/09 season]]'s first race has moved from the [[Mugello Circuit]], [[Italy]] to Zandvoort on the 4–5 October 2008 due to the delay in the building the new chassis for the new race cars. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] round moved to [[TT Circuit Assen]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=44472|title=Dutch delight|publisher=a1gp.com|date=2009-08-10|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A1GP bankrupted before its fifth season and the Dutch round was replaced with Superleague Formula

==The circuit==
The circuit gained popularity because of its fast, sweeping corners such as Scheivlak as well as the &quot;Tarzanbocht&quot; (Tarzan corner) hairpin at the end of the start/finish straight. Tarzanbocht is the most famous corner in the circuit. Since there is a camber in the corner, it provides excellent overtaking opportunities. It is possible to pass around the outside as well as the easier inside lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.a1gp.com/Circuit/CircuitInfo.aspx?circuitId=9&amp;seasonId=4|title=Circuit Park Zandvoort, The Netherlands|publisher=a1gp.com|date=n.d.|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corner is reportedly named after a local character who had earned the nickname of [[Tarzan]] and only wanted to give up his vegetable garden in the dunes if the track's designers named a nearby corner after him. On the other hand, many different stories about Tarzan Corner are known. 

The circuit design has been modified and altered several times over time:
* 1948-1971: length {{km to mi|4.193|precision=3}}
* 1972-1979: length {{km to mi|4.226|precision=3}}
* 1980-1989: length {{km to mi|4.252|precision=3}}
* 1990-1998: length {{km to mi|2.526|precision=3}}
* 1999–present: length {{km to mi|4.300|precision=3}}

The corners are named as follows (the numbers correspond to the image above, starting at the start/finish line):
* Tarzan corner (1)
* Gerlach corner (2)
* Hugenholtz corner (3)
* Hunzerug (4)
* Rob Slotemaker corner (5)
* Scheivlak (6)
* Masters corner (formerly Marlboro corner) (7)
* Renault corner (8)
* Vodafone (9)
* Audi S corner (10 + 11)
* Kumho corner (12)
* Arie Luyendyk (13)

The elevation difference is {{m to ft|15}}.

==Fatal accidents==
In the history of the circuit, several fatal accidents have occurred.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Name !! Date !! Description
|-
| [[Wim Gerlach]] || June 10, 1957 || The corner in which he died was named after him. First fatality on the circuit.  
|-
| [[Werner Engel]] || May 1, 1958 || Crashed his Mercedes 300SL cabriolet during the final stage of that year's Tulip Rally. As was usual at the time, the Tulip Rally's final stage was run as a race at the Zandvoort Racing Track, but in anti-clockwise direction, so as to counter unfair advantages for local (Dutch) drivers with racing experience of the track. Engel's car crashed and overturned on the back-stretch of the track, on the short straight leading away from Tunnel-Oost (in the direction of Scheivlak Corner) and came to rest upside down on the track.  
|-
| [[Chris Lambert (racing driver)|Chris Lambert]] || July 28, 1968 || Lambert was driving his Brabham-FVA BT-23C in the &quot;Grote Prijs van Zandvoort&quot;, the Dutch round of the European Formula 2 Championship. It all went wrong on lap 10. Lambert was trying to fend off Clay Regazzoni’s Tecno, which had started just in front of him but had stalled on the exit of Tarzan Corner just after the start, losing a lap on the complete field before restarting. Speedworld described the incident that followed in a matter-of-fact style that was typical of the old days: “Although a lap behind the whole field to start with, Regazzoni was blazing a trail through the rear of the field and came up to overtake Lambert as they approached the right-hander over the East Bridge. He tried to take the Englishman on the inside but the cars touched and Lambert shot off the track into the guard rail. Unfortunately some straw bales had been placed in front of the rail and these naturally compressed into a ramp and Lambert's car went over the top and dived onto the pedestrian path below. Lambert was killed instantly along with a woman spectator. Regazzoni's car was inverted, but the driver crawled out almost unscathed 
|-
| [[Piers Courage]] || June 21, 1970 || His car's suspension or steering broke on the flatout 'Tunnel Oost'-bump. Instead of rounding the bend, the car went straight on into the steep dunes, disintegrated on impact and caught fire as the engine broke away from the monocoque; automatic fuel-sealing equipment was not yet being used. During the impact one of the front wheels broke loose and hit Courage's head, taking off his helmet (wheel and helmet came rolling out of the cloud of dust simultaneously). It may safely be assumed that Courage was killed instantly (or at least severely wounded and knocked unconscious) when the wheel hit him, moments before the car burst into flames (instead of being killed by the fire). This is in accordance with the fact that the monocoque was upright [not upside down, as is often stated by those who confuse the Courage and Williamson accidents) when it came to rest and did not seem to trap its driver in any way.
|-
| [[Roger Williamson]] || July 29, 1973 || He lost control of his car during the [[1973 Dutch Grand Prix|F1 Dutch Grand Prix]] and crashed into the barriers, spun upside-down and caught fire. [[David Purley]] stopped his own race and tried unsuccessfully to save Williamson. The circuit was poorly prepared and not enough extinguishers were on hand.
|-
| [[Rob Slotemaker]] || July 29, 1979 || He broke his neck and died during a non-F1 event. 
|-
| [[Hans-Georg Bürger]] || July 20, 1980 || Crashed fatally in his Tiga F280-BMW at Scheivlak-Corner during the warm-up for the Grote Prijs van Zandvoort, the Dutch round of the European Formula 2 Championship. He succumbed to his head injuries in hospital two days later.

== Use in simulations / games ==

In 1998, the older &quot;classic&quot; Zandvoort circuit layout from 1967 was modeled in detail and can be driven in the ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'' racing simulation for X86-based PCs. This was later converted to NASCAR 4, NASCAR 2002, 2003 and other simulations using a converter from website 'The Pits'. The current layout is used in the [[SimBin]] game ''[[RACE 07 - Official WTCC Game]]'', ''[[TOCA Race Driver 3]]'', ''[[Race Pro]]'' and the online simulation ''[[iRacing]]'' where it is laser scanned for millimeter accuracy.
The layout from 1973 to 1980 can be driven in the [[Image Space Incorporated|ISI]] game ''[[Rfactor]]'': it is included in the &quot;Grand Prix 1979&quot; mod.

==Running competition==
Since 2008, the course has been used as the venue for the [[Runner's World Zandvoort Circuit Run]], a 5-kilometre [[road running]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwcircuitrun.nl/ Runner's World Zandvoort Circuit Run]. Runner's World Zandvoort Circuit Run. Retrieved on 2010-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 edition of the race attracted [[Lornah Kiplagat]], a multiple world champion, who won the ladies 5&amp;nbsp;km race.&lt;ref&gt;Laarhuis, Andra (2010-03-28).

The '''Crete Senesi''' refers to an area of the [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Tuscany]] to the south of [[Siena]]. It consists of a range of hills and woods among villages and includes  the ''[[comuni]]'' of 
[[Asciano]], 
[[Buonconvento]],
[[Monteroni d'Arbia]],
[[Rapolano Terme]] and
[[San Giovanni d'Asso]], all within the [[province of Siena]].

''Crete senesi'' are literally ‘[[Siena|Siennese]] [[clay]]s’ and the distinctive grey colouration of the soil gives the landscape an appearance often described as lunar. This characteristic clay, known as ''mattaione'', represents the sediments of the [[Pliocene]] sea which covered the area between 2.5 and 4.5 million years ago. In the nearby is also the semi-arid area known as [[Accona Desert]].  The area suffered extreme depopulation due to plagues in the [[Middle Ages]], and the attendant prolonged lack of cultivation facilitated an almost complete erosion of the topsoil.  It was later settled by Sicilian farmers adept to cultivating cereals on less than optimal conditions, and who were able to establish sustainable cultivation of [[wheat]] on the Siennese clays.

Perhaps the most notable edifice of this area is the monastery of [[Monte Oliveto Maggiore]].

The region is known for its production of [[white truffles]] and hosts a festival and a museum dedicated to the rare tuber.

The '''Christmas tree''', also known as a '''[[Yule]] tree''', is a decorated [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]], real or [[artificial Christmas tree|artificial]], and a tradition associated with the celebration of [[Christmas]]. The tradition of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas started in [[Livonia]] and [[Germany]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Russow&gt;Balthasar Russow. 1584. ''Chronica der Provinz Lyfflandt''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber-Kellermann&gt;Ingeborg Weber-Kellermann, Das Weihnachtsfest. Eine Kultur- und Sozialgeschichte der Weihnachtszeit, Luzern [u. a.] 1978, ISBN 3-7658-0273-5&lt;/ref&gt; The Christmas tree is traditionally brought into the home and decorated with [[Christmas lights (decoration)|Christmas lights]] (originally candles), [[Christmas ornament|ornaments]], [[garland]]s, [[tinsel]], and [[candy canes]] during the days around Christmas. An [[angel]] or [[star]] is placed at the top of the tree, representing the host of angels or the [[Star of Bethlehem]] from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]].

== History ==
===Origin===
Legend associates the first Christmas tree with [[St. Boniface]] and the German town of [[Geismar]]. Sometime in Boniface's lifetime (c. 672-754) he is said to have cut down the sacred tree of [[Thor]] in Geismar, replacing it with a [[fir tree]] which has been said to have been the first Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Littleton|first=C. Scott|title=Gods, Goddesses, and Mythology, Volume 4|year=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|isbn=978-0761475590|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n2FpRCam224C&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=Christmas+tree++.+Boniface+Thor&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jdMqTczDFobLhAep-s3-Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Christmas%20tree%20%20.%20Boniface%20Thor&amp;f=false|page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of erecting a Christmas tree can be historically traced to 15th century Livonia (present-day [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]) and 16th century Northern Germany. According to the first documented uses of a Christmas tree in Estonia, in 1441, 1442, and 1514 the [[Brotherhood of Blackheads]] erected a tree for the holidays in their [[House of Blackheads in Tallinn|brotherhood house]] in Reval (now [[Tallinn]]). At the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree was taken to the [[Town Hall Square, Tallinn|Town Hall Square]] where the members of the brotherhood danced around it.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Amelung, ''Geschichte der Revaler Schwarzenhäupter: von ihrem Ursprung an bis auf die Gegenwart: nach den urkundenmäßigen Quellen des Revaler Schwarzenhäupter-Archivs 1, Die erste Blütezeit von 1399–1557''. Reval: Wassermann, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1584, the pastor and chronicler [[Balthasar Russow]] wrote of an established tradition of setting up a decorated [[Norway spruce|spruce]] at the market square where the young men “went with a flock of maidens and women, first sang and danced there and then set the tree aflame”.&lt;ref name= Russow /&gt; In that period, the [[guild]]s started erecting Christmas trees in front of their guildhalls: Ingeborg Weber-Kellermann ([[Marburg]] professor of European [[ethnology]]) found a [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] guild [[chronicle]] of 1570 which reports how a small tree was decorated with &quot;apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers&quot; and erected in the guild-house, for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected the dainties on Christmas Day.&lt;ref name=Weber-Kellermann /&gt;

===18th and 19th centuries===
By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the upper [[Rhineland]], but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles are attested from the late 18th century. The Christmas tree remained confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long time. It was regarded as a Protestant custom by the Roman Catholic majority along the lower Rhine and was spread there only by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] officials who were moved there in the wake of the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Just like Christmas (Germanic Yuletide), the Christmas tree was more or less accepted by the Roman Catholic Church because it could not prevent its use.

The tradition was introduced to [[Canada]] in the winter of 1781 by [[Germans in the American Revolution|Brunswick soldiers]] stationed in the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] to garrison the colony against [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|American attack]]. General [[Friedrich Adolf Riedesel]] and his wife, the [[Frederika Charlotte Riedesel|Baroness von Riedesel]], held a Christmas party at [[Sorel-Tracy, Quebec|Sorel]], delighting their guests with a fir tree decorated with candles and fruits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chartrand311&quot;&gt;[[#Chartrand|Chartrand (2004)]], p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. [[Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg]] introduced the Christmas tree to [[Vienna]] in 1816, and the custom spread across Austria in the following years. In [[France]], the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans|duchesse d'Orléans]]. In Denmark the first attested Christmas tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to the Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] in 1865. He had published a fairy-tale called ''[[The Fir-Tree]]'' in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir-tree being used as a Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 ''Kristelig Dagblad'', &quot;Danmarks første juletræ blev tændt i 1808&quot;, December 17 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the Christmas tree was introduced in the time of the [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s Queen [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] in early 19th century, but the custom hadn't yet spread much beyond the royal family. Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with the custom. In her journal for Christmas Eve 1832, the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote, &quot;After dinner… we then went into the drawing-room near the dining-room… There were two large round tables on which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the [[presents]] being placed round the trees…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The girlhood of Queen Victoria: a selection from Her Majesty's diaries. p. 61. Longmans, Green &amp; co., 1912. University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt; After her marriage to her German cousin [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], by 1841 the custom became even more widespread throughout Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Lejeune, Marie Claire. Compendium of symbolic and ritual plants in Europe. p. 550. University of Michigan ISBN 9077135049&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Prince Albert wrote: &quot;I must now seek in the children an echo of what Ernest [his brother] and I were in the old time, of what we felt and thought; and their delight in the Christmas-trees is not less than ours used to be&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Prince Consort: man of many facets: the world and the age of Prince Albert. p. 78 Oresko Books, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The generous Prince Stuart also presented large numbers of trees to schools and army barracks at Christmas.:there was no &quot;Prince Stuart--&gt;

A woodcut of the British Royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, initially published in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' December 1848, was copied in the United States at Christmas 1850, in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'' (illustration, left). ''Godey's'' copied it exactly, except for the removal of the Queen's tiara and Prince Albert's mustache, to remake the engraving into an American scene.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Shoemaker, Alfred Lewis. (1959) Christmas in Pennsylvania: a folk-cultural study. Edition 40. p.52,53.
Stackpole Books 1999. ISBN 0811703282&lt;/ref&gt; The republished ''Godey's'' image became the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen Christmas tree in America. Art historian Karal Ann Marling called Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, shorn of their royal trappings, &quot;the first influential American Christmas tree&quot;.&lt;ref name=ADT&gt;Marling, Karal Ann. (2000) Merry Christmas! celebrating America's greatest holiday. P.4. p.244. [[Harvard University Press]] ISBN 0674003187&lt;/ref&gt; Folk-culture historian Alfred Lewis Shoemaker states, &quot;In all of America there was no more important medium in spreading the Christmas tree in the decade 1850-60 than ''Godey's Lady's Book''&quot;. The image was reprinted in 1860, and by the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become common in America.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;

Several cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to that country's first Christmas tree: [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]], claims that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at the Noden-Reed House, while the &quot;First Christmas Tree in America&quot; is also claimed by [[Easton, Pennsylvania]], where German settlers purportedly erected a Christmas tree in 1816 and In his diary, Matthew Zahm of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], recorded the use of a Christmas tree in 1821, leading Lancaster to also lay claim to the first Christmas tree in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The History of Christmas | work=Gareth Marples | url=http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-christmas.html | accessdate=December 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts credit [[Charles Follen]], a German immigrant to Boston, for being the first to introduce to America the custom of decorating a Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/12.12/ProfessorBrough.html Professor Brought Christmas Tree to New England&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; August Imgard, a German immigrant living in [[Wooster, Ohio]], is the first to popularise the practice of decorating a tree with candy canes. In 1847, Imgard cut a blue spruce tree from a woods outside town, had the Wooster village tinsmith construct a star, and placed the tree in his house, decorating it with paper ornaments and candy canes. The National Confectioners' Association officially recognises Imgard as the first ever to put candy canes on a Christmas tree; the canes were all-white, with no red stripes. Imgard is buried in the Wooster Cemetery, and every year, a large pine tree above his grave is lit with Christmas lights. German immigrant Charles Minnegerode accepted a position as a professor of humanities at the [[College of William and Mary]] in Williamsburg in 1842, where he taught Latin and Greek. Entering into the social life of the Virginia Tidewater, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St. George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 Encyclopediavirginia.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[Image:Rockefeller Center Tree.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree|Rockefeller Center tree]]]]
Many [[cities]], [[town]]s, and [[department store]]s put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as the [[Rich's Great Tree]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree in [[New York City]] and the large Christmas tree at [[Victoria Square]] in [[Adelaide]]. During most of the 1970s and 1980s, the largest decorated Christmas tree in the world was put up every year on the property of ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' in [[Lantana, Florida]]. This tradition grew into one of the most spectacular and celebrated events in the history of southern [[Florida]], but was discontinued on the death of the paper's founder in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Flashback Blog'' 'The World's Largest Decorated Christmas Tree'|publisher=Palm Beach Post|date=December 3, 2009|url=http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, a [[Festival of Trees]] is organized around the decoration and display of multiple trees as charity events. In some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]], where the City of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] presents a tree to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support of Norwegian resistance during the [[World War II|Second World War]]; in [[Boston]], where the tree is a gift from the province of [[Nova Scotia]], in thanks for rapid deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion|ammunition ship explosion]] that levelled the city of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia (former city)|Halifax]]; and in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where the 15 m-tall main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of [[Bergen, Norway]], in thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen from [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Newcastle City Council [http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/twintownbergen Town twinning: Bergen, Norway]&lt;/ref&gt; Norway also annually gifts a Christmas tree to [[Washington D.C.]] as a symbol of friendship between Norway and the US and as an expression of gratitude from Norway for the help received from the US during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Norwegian Christmas at Union Station: Tree Lighting Ceremony and Concert |curly=y |url=http://www.norway.org/xmas/signatureevents/TreeLightingCeremony.htm |work=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |publisher=Norway.org |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]]' [[National Christmas Tree]] is lit each year on the South Lawn of the [[White House]]. Today, the lighting of the National Christmas Tree is part of what has become a major holiday event at the White House. President [[Jimmy Carter]] lit only the crowning star atop the Tree in 1979 in honour of the Americans being [[Iran hostage crisis|held hostage in Iran]].&lt;ref name=npspp/&gt; The same was true in 1980, except the tree was fully lit for 417 seconds, one second for each day the hostages had been in captivity.&lt;ref name=npspp&gt;&quot;[http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/lighting-of-the-national-christmas-tree-history.htm Lighting of the National Christmas Tree - History]&quot;, President's Park - White House, ''[[National Park Service|nps.gov]]'', accessed April 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Charlie Brown Christmas tree'' is used in the United States and Canada to describe any poor-looking or malformed little tree. Some tree buyers intentionally adopt such trees, feeling sympathetic to their plights. The term comes from the appearance of [[Charlie Brown]]'s Christmas tree in the [[:Category:Christmas television specials|TV special]] ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]''.

In [[New Zealand]], [[Pōhutukawa]] trees are described as &quot;native Christmas trees&quot;, as they bloom at Christmas time, and look like Christmas trees with their red flowers and green foliage.

In [[Russia]], the Christmas tree was banned shortly after the [[October Revolution]] but then reinstated as a ''New-year fir-tree'' (Новогодняя ёлка) in 1935. It became a fully secular icon of the New year holiday, for example, the crowning star was regarded not as a symbol of Bethlehem Star, but as the [[Red Star]]. Decorations, such as figurines of airplanes, bicycles, space rockets, cosmonauts, and characters of Russian fairy tales, were produced. This tradition persists after the fall of the USSR, with the New Year holiday outweighting the Christmas (7 January) for a wide majority of Russians{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

==Dates==

Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with specific dates. Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until [[Christmas Eve]] (24 December) or, in the traditions celebrating Christmas Eve rather than [[Twelve Days of Christmas|on the first of day of Christmas]], the 23 December, and then removed the day after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|twelfth night]] (6 January); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck.
[[Image:CandleChristmas.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Christmas trees lit by candles, [[Culture of Denmark|Denmark]].]]
Many families in America will put up a Christmas tree soon after Thanksgiving and Christmas decorations can show up even earlier in retail stores. Some households in the U.S. do not put up the tree until the second week of December, and leave it up until the 6th of January ([[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]). In Germany, traditionally the tree is put up on the 24th of December and taken down on the 7th of January, though many start one or two weeks earlier, and in Roman Catholic homes the tree may be kept until late January. In Australia, the Christmas tree is usually put up on the 1st of December{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}, which occurs about a week before the school summer holidays; except for South Australia, where most people put up their tree after the Adelaide Credit Union Christmas Pageant in late November{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Some traditions suggest that Christmas trees may be kept up until no later than the 2nd of February, the feast of the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple ([[Purification of the Virgin|Candlemas]]), when the Christmas season effectively closes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holytrinitygerman.org/postepiphanycustoms.html Customs of the Weeks after Epiphany]&lt;/ref&gt; Superstitions say that it is a bad sign if Christmas greenery is not removed by Candle mas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/superstitions.asp Christmas Superstitions], December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;]

==Types of trees used==

===Natural trees===
{{See also|Christmas tree cultivation}}
The most commonly used [[species]] are [[fir]] (''Abies''), which have the benefit of not shedding their needles when they dry out, as well as retaining good foliage colour and scent; but species in other [[genus|genera]] are also used.

In northern [[Europe]] most commonly used are:

* [[Silver Fir]] ''Abies alba'' (the original species)
* [[Nordmann Fir]] ''Abies nordmanniana'' (as in the photo)
* [[Noble Fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Norway Spruce]] ''Picea abies'' (generally the cheapest)
* [[Serbian Spruce]] ''Picea omorika''
* [[Scots Pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone Pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Swiss Pine]] ''Pinus cembra''

In [[North America]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]] most commonly used are:

* [[Douglas-fir]] ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''
* [[Balsam Fir]] ''Abies balsamea''
* [[Fraser Fir]] ''Abies fraseri''
* [[Grand Fir]] ''Abies grandis''
* [[Guatemalan Fir]] ''Abies guatemalensis''
* Noble Fir ''Abies procera''
* [[Red Fir]] ''Abies magnifica''
* [[White Fir]] ''Abies concolor''
* [[Colorado Pinyon|Pinyon Pine]] ''Pinus edulis''
* [[Jeffrey Pine]] ''Pinus jeffreyi''
* Scots Pine ''Pinus sylvestris''
* Stone Pine ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island Pine]] ''Araucaria heterophylla''

Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Sequoiadendron|Giant Sequoia]], [[Leyland Cypress]], [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey Cypress]] and [[Juniperus virginiana|Eastern Juniper]]. Various types of [[spruce]] tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the [[Blue Spruce]] and, less commonly, the [[White Spruce]]); but spruces (unlike firs) begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. [[Virginia Pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States, however its winter colour is faded. The long-needled [[Eastern White Pine]] is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island Pine is sometimes used, particularly in [[Oceania]], and in [[Australia]] some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees but by far the most common tree is the [[Monterey Pine]]. ''[[Adenanthos sericeus]]'' or Albany Woolly Bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.

Some trees, frequently referred to as Living Christmas trees, are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]], to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high [[temperature]] and low [[humidity]] is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter [[dormancy]], leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html|title= Living Christmas Trees|publisher=[[Clemson University]]|accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, replanting when done properly provides higher survival rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm For.msu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally-grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands&lt;ref&gt;US Bureau of Land Management: [http://www.co.blm.gov/news/2004/wsctrees.htm Christmas tree permits]&lt;/ref&gt;) there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.

In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s. Almost all Christmas trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) agriculture census for 2002 (the census is done every five years), 21,904 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree market in America, {{convert|180897|ha|acre|0}} were planted in Christmas trees, and 13,849 farms harvested cut trees. The top 5 percent of the farms (40 hectares / 100 acres or more) sold 61 percent of the trees. The top 26 percent of the farms (8 hectares / 20 acres or more) sold 84 percent of the trees. Farms less than 0.8 hectare (two acres) comprised 21 percent of the farms, and sold an average of 115 trees per farm.&lt;ref&gt;US National Christmas Tree Association: [http://www.christmastree.org/statistics_industry.cfm#findings Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fiber-optic Christmas tree.jpg|thumb|right|A tree with fibre optic lights]]
The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a {{convert|2|m|ft|0|sing=on}} tree takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between 8 and 12 years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold to Christmas tree farms at an age of 3–4 years. The remaining development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as well as the cultivation and tendance by the Christmas tree farmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weihnachtsbaumversand.de MK Weihnachtsbaumkulturen]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial trees===
{{Main|Artificial Christmas trees}}
The first artificial Christmas trees were developed in Germany during the 19th century,&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=hewitt&gt;Hewitt, pp. 33-36.&lt;/ref&gt; though earlier examples exist.&lt;ref name=perkins/&gt; These &quot;trees&quot; were made using goose [[feathers]] that were dyed green.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Forbes, Bruce David.

''Merry Christmas!: Celebrating America's Greatest Holiday'', ([http://books.google.com/books?id=EUc13_ourtYC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=feather+christmas+trees+germany&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA58,M1 Google Books]), Harvard University Press, 2000, pp. 58-62, (ISBN 0674003187).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, other styles of artificial Christmas trees have evolved and become popular. In 1930, the U.S.-based Addis Brush Company created the first artificial Christmas tree made from [[brush]] bristles.&lt;ref name=cole&gt;Cole, Peter, et al. ''Christmas Trees: Fun and Festive Ideas'', ([http://books.google.com/books?id=Gbk3SvTZxDsC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=artificial+christmas+tree+addis+brush&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), Chronicle Books, 2002, p. 23, (ISBN 0811835774).&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of tree, the [[aluminum Christmas tree]], is made from [[aluminum]].&lt;ref name=hewitt/&gt; The trees were manufactured in the United States, first in [[Chicago]] in 1958,&lt;ref name=baltsun&gt;Fortin, Cassandra A. &quot;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/services/newspaper/printedition/sunday/harfordcounty/bal-ha.trees26oct26,0,204546.story It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (1958)]&quot;, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', October 26, 2008, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]], where the majority of the trees were produced.&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;Andrews, Candice Gaukel.

Other gimmicks have developed as well. [[Fiber optic]] Christmas trees come in two major varieties, one resembles a traditional Christmas tree.&lt;ref name=howstuff&gt;Neer, Katherine. &quot;[http://christmas.howstuffworks.com/christmas-tree7.htm How Christmas Trees Work]&quot;, ''[[howstuffworks.com]]'', December 2006, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Dallas]]-based company offers &quot;holographic mylar&quot; trees in many hues.&lt;ref name=perkins&gt;Perkins, Broderick. &quot;[http://realtytimes.com/rtpages/20031212_fauxtree.htm Faux Christmas Tree Crop Yields Special Concerns]&quot;, ''Realty Times'', December 12, 2003, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Tree-shaped objects made from such materials as cardboard,&lt;ref name=popmech&gt;&quot;Table-top Christmas Tree&quot;, ([http://books.google.com/books?id=-9oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=tabletop+christmas+trees&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA117,M1 Google Books]), ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' January 1937, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; glass,&lt;ref name=diablo&gt;&quot;[http://www.diabloglassschool.com/hotshopclassdetails/holidaytrees.htm Glass Christmas Tree]&quot;, ''Diablo Glass School'', one-day course listing, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ceramic or other materials can be found in use as tabletop decorations. Upside-down artificial Christmas trees became popular for a short time and were originally introduced as a marketing gimmick; they allowed consumers to get closer to ornaments for sale in retail stores and opened up floor space for more products.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;&quot;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5006258 Demand Grows for Upside Down Christmas Tree]&quot;, (Audio), ''[[National Public Radio]]'', &quot;[[All Things Considered]]&quot;, November 9, 2005, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artificial trees became increasingly popular during the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=hewitt/&gt; Users of artificial Christmas trees assert that they are more convenient, and, because they are reusable, much cheaper than their natural alternative.&lt;ref name=hewitt/&gt; Between 2001 and 2007 artificial Christmas tree sales in the U.S. jumped from 7.3 million to 17.4 million.&lt;ref name=hayes&gt;Hayes, Sharon Caskey. &quot;[http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9009208 Grower says real Christmas trees are better for environment than artificial ones]&quot;, ''Kingsport Times-News'' ([[Kingsport, Tennessee]]), November 26, 2008, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental issues==
===Artificial===
[[Image:Balsam-Hill-artificial-Christmas-tree.jpg|right|thumb|An artificial Christmas tree.]]

The debate about the environmental impact of artificial trees is ongoing. Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more environmentally harmful than their natural counterpart.&lt;ref name=&quot;hayes&quot;/&gt; On the other side of the debate, trade groups such as the [[American Christmas Tree Association]], continue to refute that artificial trees are more harmful to the environment and maintain that the PVC used in Christmas trees has excellent recyclable properties.&lt;ref name=acta&gt;&quot;[http://www.christmastreeassociation.org/Article%20Pages/facts-on-pvc-used-in-artificial-christmas-trees Facts on PVC Used in Artificial Christmas Trees]&quot;, ''American Christmas Tree Association'', official site, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, [[lead]] was often used as a stabilizer in PVC, but is now banned by Chinese laws. Most trees are made of recycled PVC rigid sheets using Tin stabilizer in the recent years. Its use of Lead stabilizer in the old Chinese imported trees has been an issue of concern among politicians and scientists over recent years. A 2004 study found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from [[Lead poisoning|lead contamination]], there do exist &quot;worst-case scenarios&quot; where major health risks to young children exist.&lt;ref name=maas&gt;Maas, Richard P. et al. ''Artificial Christmas trees: how real are the lead exposure risks?'' ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15628192 Abstract] via [[PubMed]]) ''Journal of Environmental Health'', December 2004; 67(5): 20-4, 32, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another report, this time a 2008 [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] report, found that as the PVC in artificial Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.&lt;ref name=eparept/&gt; The report determined that of the 50 million artificial trees in the United States approximately 20 million were 9 or more years old, the point where dangerous lead contamination levels are reached.&lt;ref name=eparept&gt;Levin, Ronnie, et al. &quot;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2569084 Lead Exposures in U.S. Children, 2008: Implications for Prevention]&quot;, ''Environmental Health Perspective'' October 2008; 116(10): 1285–1293, accessed December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A professional study on the [[Life Cycle Assessment]] (LCA) of both real and fake Christmas trees revealed that one must use its artificial Christmas tree at least during 20 years to leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas tree.&lt;ref name=LifeCycleAssessment&gt;Ellipsos Inc. &quot;[http://www.ellipsos.ca/modules/news/article.php?storyid=9&amp;lang=english Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Christmas trees, A study ends the debate over which Christmas tree, natural or artificial, is most ecological]&quot;, December 16, 2008; accessed online September 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A small amount of real-tree material is used in some artificial trees. For instance, the [[bark]] of a real tree can be used to surface an artificial trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Grist environmental commentary: [http://www.grist.org/advice/ask/2004/12/08/umbra-tree/ Christmas trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural===
[[Image:Recycletree.jpg|Christmas tree [[recycling]] point in [[Paris]], France|thumb|right]]
Natural Christmas trees on the other hand are entirely biodegradable and are generally disposed of in landfills.

Real or Cut trees are used only for a short time, but can be recycled and used as [[mulch]] or used to prevent [[erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Engineer Update: [http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/CEPA/PUBS/mar07/story8.htm Old Christmas trees protect town beach]&lt;/ref&gt; Real trees are carbon-neutral, they emit no more carbon dioxide by being cut down and disposed of than they absorb while growing.&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;Biello, David.&quot;[http://www.sciam.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=im-dreaming-of-a-green-christmas-tr-08-12-05 I'm Dreaming of a Green Christmas (Tree)]&quot;, ''[[Scientific American]]'', transcript, [[podcast]], December 4, 2008, accessed December 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An independent Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study, conducted by a firm of experts in sustainable development, states that a natural tree will generate 3.1&amp;nbsp;kg of [[greenhouse gases]] every year (based on purchasing 5&amp;nbsp;km from home) whereas the artificial tree will produce 48.3&amp;nbsp;kg over its lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;LifeCycleAssessment&quot;/&gt; Some people use Living Christmas or potted trees for several seasons, providing a longer life cycle for each tree. Living Christmas trees can be purchased or rented in by local market growers. Rentals are picked up after the holidays, while purchased trees can be planted by the owner after use or donated to local tree adoption/urban reforestation services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christmastree.org/statistics_consumer.cfm#type Christmastree.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Live trees are typically grown as a [[Crop (agriculture)|crop]] and replanted in rotation after cutting, often providing suitable [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for wildlife.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In some cases management of Christmas tree crops can result in poor habitat since it sometimes involves heavy input of [[pesticide]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Concerns have been raised about people cutting down old and rare conifers, such as the [[Keteleeria evelyniana]], for Christmas trees.

==Decoration and ornaments==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

===Tree trimming decorations===
[[Image:Christmas tree bauble.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bauble]] decorating a Christmas tree]]
[[Image:ChristmasTree.JPG|thumb|right|A [[LED]] lit Christmas tree]]

Tinsel and several types of [[garland (decoration)|garland]] or [[ribbon]] are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Delicate mould-blown and painted coloured glass Christmas ornaments were a speciality of the glass factories in the [[Thuringian Forest]] especially in [[Lauscha]] in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Lighting with [[candle]]s or electric lights ([[fairy lights]]) is commonly done and a [[tree topper]], traditionally either an angel or a star, completes the ensemble.

Silvered [[Saran (plastic)|saran]] based tinsel was introduced later, although its inability to drape as well as metal tinsel led to the demise of tinsel in tree decorating in the United States (it remains popular in European countries). Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide colouration. [[Image:Christmas Tree Bear Decoration.png|right|150px|thumb|A toy bear Christmas decoration.]]

Individuals' decorations typically include a mix of family traditions and personal tastes; even a small unattractive ornament, if passed down from a parent or grandparent, may come to carry considerable emotional value and be given a place of pride on the tree. Conversely, trees decorated by professional designers for department stores and other institutions will usually have a &quot;theme&quot;; a set of predominant colours, multiple instances of each type of ornament, and larger decorations that may be more complicated to set up correctly. Some churches decorate with [[Chrismon Trees|Chrismon trees]], which use handmade ornaments depicting various [[Chrismon]] symbols.

Many people also decorate outdoor trees with food that [[bird]]s and other [[wildlife]] will enjoy, such as garlands made from unsalted [[popcorn]] or [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]] halves, and seed-covered [[suet]] cakes.

===Tree mats and skirts===
[[Image:Poinsettia tree.jpg|thumb|right|A tree of [[poinsettia]]s in [[San Diego]]]]
Since candles were used to light trees until electric bulbs came about, a [[mat]] (UK) or [[skirt]] ([[US]]) was often placed on the floor below the tree to protect it by catching the dripping candle [[wax]], and also to collect any needles that fall. Even when dripless candles, electric lights and artificial trees have been used, a skirt is still usually used as a decorative feature: among other things, it hides the [[Christmas tree stand]], which may be unsightly but which is an important safety feature of home trees. What began as ordinary [[cloth]] has now often become much more ornate, some having [[embroidery]] or being put together like a [[quilt]].

A [[nativity scene]], [[model train]], or [[Christmas village]] may be placed on the mat or skirt. As Christmas presents arrive, they are generally placed underneath the tree on the tree skirt (depending on tradition, all Christmas gifts, or those too large to be hung on the tree, as in &quot;presents on the tree&quot; of the song &quot;[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]&quot;).

Generally, the difference between a mat and skirt is simply that a mat is placed ''under'' the Christmas tree stand, while a skirt is placed ''over'' it, having a hole in the middle for the trunk, with a slot cut to the outside edge so that it can be placed around the tree (beneath the branches) easily. A plain mat of fabric or plastic may also be placed under the stand and skirt to protect the floor from scratches or [[water]].

===Christmas tree stand===
A Christmas tree stand is an object designed to support a cut, natural Christmas tree or an artificial Christmas tree. Christmas tree stands appeared as early as 1876 and have had various designs over the years. Those stands designed for natural trees have a water reservoir to hydrate the live tree. Artificial Christmas trees usually have a plastic or metal stand, with 3 legs shaping like a Y.

===Flocking===
In the 1940s and 1950s flocking was very popular on the West Coast of the United States. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the 1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]] to simulate snow. Typically it would be sprayed all over the tree from the sides, which produced a look different from real snow, which settles in clumps atop branches. Flocking can be done with a professional sprayer at a tree lot (or the manufacturer if it is artificial), or at home from a spray can, and either can be rather messy. This tradition seems to be most popular on the West Coast and Southern parts of the United States.

Because flock contains flame retardants, a flocked tree can be placed in a public building in accordance with local fire codes.

In the late 1800s and, most probably, long before, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree. This family tradition eliminated killing and care of a live tree and needle drop in the house while providing a beautiful way of displaying ornaments. After Christmas, the cotton batting was unwrapped and stored with the Christmas presents and the branches were burnt or discarded. It is thought these home-made white trees at least, in part, inspired flocking popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s.

==Controversy==
The Christmas tree has seen an amount of controversy, mainly involving [[separation of church and state]], the secular and non-secular usage of the tree as well as groups who oppose usage of the tree on the grounds of interpretation of scripture and pagan origins or pagan character of the custom.

In 2005, the [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]] removed all of its Christmas trees in the middle of the night rather than allow a rabbi to put up a [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] near the largest tree display.&lt;ref name=&quot;Capitol&quot;&gt;&quot;Nativity to be Allowed in Capitol Rotunda: Lawsuit Settlement Calls for Fair Treatment for Christian Beliefs&quot;. WorldNetDaily.com, October 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials feared that one display would open the door for other religious displays,&lt;ref name=&quot;Capitol&quot; /&gt; and, in 2006, they opted to display a grove of birches in [[polyethylene terephthalate]] snow rather than religious symbols or Christmas trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Capitol&quot; /&gt;

In 2005, the city of Boston renamed the spruce tree used to decorate the Boston Common a &quot;Holiday Tree&quot; rather than a &quot;Christmas Tree&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston's &quot;Holiday Tree&quot; Sparks Controversy|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=510132|publisher=TheHarvardCrimson.com|year=2005|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change drew a poor response from the public and was changed back to &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; after being threatened with several lawsuits by Rev. [[Jerry Falwell]] and the Alliance Defense Fund. In the same year, Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., asked that the tree that decorates the Capitol grounds to be renamed back to &quot;Christmas tree&quot;.

[[Image:KharkovDzerghinskySquareNewYearNight.JPG|thumb|220px||In [[Kharkov]]]]
{{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|10:1-5|}} in the Bible says the following (King James Version):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[1] Hear what the Lord says to you , O house of Israel. 
[2] This is what the Lord says: &quot;Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the sky, though the nations are terrified by them.
[3] For the customs of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.
[4] They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.
[5] Like a scarecrow in a melon patch, their idols cannot speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them; they can do no harm nor can they do any good.&quot;
-NIV Translation
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is interpreted by some [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christians as referring to a Christmas tree, and that therefore the Bible would explicitly forbid the practice. However, the context of this passage refers to [[Idolatry|idol]] worship, and it is the practice of making an object out of wood, silver, and gold, and then worshiping that idol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourtribune.com/article.php?id=8934 Ourtribune.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Others feel that since &quot;Christmas Trees&quot; are not biblically ordained, they should not be used. Such individuals and [[Christian denomination]]s, such as the United Church of God, who are not to be confused with Church of God, are unlikely to celebrate Christmas at all, for the same reason. The original celebration of Christmas however was the birth of Christ. The implementation of the Christmas tree was established as a tradition, not the reason for Christmas.

Also, Isaiah 55:13, refers to the evergreen tree as a joyful sign to the Lord in celebration of life everlasting, that shall not be cut off, though some apologists feel this is saying that the Messiah will live forever just like an evergreen tree never dies, (it doesn't lose its leaves when Autumn comes).

Some churches however use Christmas trees as decoration at Christmas time. Others use the same stripped Christmas tree as a [[Christian cross]] at [[Easter]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} See the poem [[The Dream of the Rood]]. Both [[Ezekiel]] 47:12 and the [[Book of Revelation]] 22:2 use trees as a symbol of new fruitful life, compared to the Tree of life denied [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:22-23. Paul makes the link between Adam and Christ clear in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] chapter 5:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adam is '' a [[Type (theology)|type]] of the one who was to come. (v. 14)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same way the Christmas tree can be seen as mirroring the tree of life, a symbol or type of the [[Crucifix]] which brings redemption.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Image:Noelentzero.jpg|thumb|Syncretising traditions in Northern Spain, the Bilbao airport displays the foreign tree and the [[Basque people|Basque]] [[Olentzero]].]]
In some Catholic countries, the tree is seen as a recent Protestant or [[Cultural colonialism|American influence]] detracting from the Mediterranean traditions of the [[Christmas crib]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} However in many Catholic homes, both types of decoration coexist.

{{See also|Christmas tree production}}
Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and 50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000 growers in America (a third of them &quot;choose and cut&quot; farms). In that same year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Christmas Tree | url=http://www.apsnet.org/education/feature/1225tree/top.htm | accessdate=2006-12-08 | author=Chastagner, Gary A. and Benson, D.

[[Image:Abraham-Lincoln-battlegroup.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The USS ''Abraham Lincoln'' battle group during the 2000 [[RIMPAC]] exercises]]
A '''carrier battle group''' ('''CVBG''') consists of an [[aircraft carrier]] (designated CV) and its escorts, together comprising the group. The first naval task forces built around carriers appeared just prior to and during World War II. The Imperial Japanese Navy was the first to assemble a large number of carriers into a single task force, known as [[Kido Butai]]. This task force was used with devastating effect during the [[Pearl Harbor Attack]]. [[Kido Butai]] operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]]. In contrast, the United States Navy deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own cruiser and destroyer escorts. These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and Midway. By 1943 however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers. These carrier groups eventually formed the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], which became the primary battle force of the U.S. Fifth and Third Fleets.

With the construction of the large supercarriers of the Cold War era, the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived. During the [[Cold War]], the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect Atlantic supply routes between the United States and Europe, while the role of the [[Soviet Navy]] would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task. Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely. However, a primary mission of the Soviet Navy's [[attack submarine]]s was to shadow every CVBG and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers. Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own [[anti-submarine warfare]] mission.

==Carrier battle groups in crises==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:HMS Bulwark (Commando carrier).jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Bulwark (R08)|HMS ''Bulwark'']], which took part in the [[Suez Crisis]].]] --&gt;
[[File:HMS Invincible (R05) Norfolk.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']], which took part in the [[Falklands War]].]]
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, most of the uses of CVBGs by the United States as well as that of other nations have been in situations in which their use has been uncontested by other comparable forces.

===Carriers in the 1956 Suez Crisis===
British and French carrier battle groups were involved in the [[1956 Suez Crisis]].

===Carriers in the 1982 Falklands War===
During the later part of the Cold War, an important battle scenario was an attack against a CVBG using large number of anti-ship [[cruise missile]]s. The first attempted use of anti-ship missiles against a carrier group was part of [[Argentina]]'s efforts against [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the [[Falklands War]]. Interestingly, this was the last conflict in which two belligerents employed aircraft carriers, although Argentina would make little use of [[ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)|its sole carrier]], ironically supplied originally by Britain.

===Lebanon===
The [[United States Sixth Fleet]] assembled a force of three carrier battle groups and a [[battleship]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1983. Daily reconnaissance flights were flown over the [[Bekaa Valley]] and a strike was flown against targets in the area resulting in loss of an [[A-6 Intruder]] and an [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair]].

===Gulf of Sidra===
Carrier battle groups routinely operated in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] inside the &quot;[[Line of Death]]&quot; proclaimed by [[Libya]] resulting in aerial engagements in 1981, 1986 and 1989 between U.S. Navy Tomcats and Libyan [[Su-22]] aircraft, [[SA-5 Gammon|SA-5]] surface-to-air missiles and [[MiG-23]] fighters. During the 1986 clashes, three carrier battle groups deployed to the Gulf of Sidra and ultimately two of them conducted strikes against Libya in [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].

==The U.S. Navy carrier strike group==
{{Main|Carrier Strike Group}}
[[Image:George Washington Carrier Strike Group.jpg|thumb|right|The USS ''George Washington'' Carrier Strike Group sails in formation for a strike group photo in the [[Caribbean Sea]] April 29, 2006. Such a formation, referred to derisively as the &quot;bullseye&quot; formation, would not be used in combat.]]
In [[modern US Navy carrier air operations]], [[Carrier strike group]] (CSG) has replaced the traditional term of carrier battle group (CVBG or CARBATGRU). The Navy maintains 11 carrier strike groups, 10 of which are based in the United States and one that is forward deployed in Japan. CSG or CVBG normally consist of 1 Aircraft Carrier, 2 Guided Missile Cruisers, 2 Anti Aircraft Warships, and 1-2 Anti Submarine Destroyers or Frigates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=39259&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of CSGs used by the United States reflects, in part, a division of roles and missions allotted during the Cold War, in which the United States assumed primary responsibility for [[blue-water navy|blue water]] operations and for safeguarding supply lines between the United States and [[Europe]], while the [[NATO]] allies assumed responsibility for [[brown-water navy|brown]] and [[green-water navy|green water]] operations. Their existence is an important part of the [[power projection]] capability of the [[United States]] in that they provide the ability to strike quickly almost anywhere in the world.

===Battleship battle group===
During the period when the American navy recommissioned all four of its [[Iowa class|''Iowa'' class]] battleships, it sometimes used a similar formation centered on a [[battleship]], referred to as a battleship battle group (BBBG). It was alternately referred to as a Surface Action Group (SAG).

==Carrier battle groups==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2008}}

===British carrier battle groups===
The [[Royal Navy]] did maintain two task forces concurrently (one based on an aircraft carrier and one based on an Amphibious Command Ship). At least one task group would be deployed at any one time. There is currently one [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class aircraft carrier]] in operation with the Royal Navy although due to the retirement of the [[BAE Harrier]] it will serve as a [[helicopter carrier]], the other two are now [[decommissioned]]. The Royal Navy also utilises the [[HMS Ocean (L12)|''Ocean'' Class]] [[Landing Platform, Helicopter|LPH]] as well as the two [[Albion class landing platform dock|''Albion'' Class]] [[Amphibious transport dock|LPDs]] as Amphibious Command Ships at the centre of a task group.
The two new [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier|''Queen Elizabeth'' class]] are currently under construction and will operate the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]], replacing the ageing Invincible class in 2019.

===French carrier battle groups===
The only serving French carrier is the [[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']], which also serves as the flagship of the Marine Nationale.

The Carrier Battle Group (Groupe Aéronaval, GAN, in French) of the [[Force d'Action Navale]] is usually composed, in addition to the aircraft carrier, of :
*a [[carrier air wing]] (Groupe Aérien Embarqué, GAE, in French), a complement composed of about 40 aircraft :
**[[Rafale]] (up to 24)
**[[Dassault Super Étendard|Super Étendard]] (up to 36)
**[[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] (2)
**[[Eurocopter Dauphin|SA365 Dauphin]] (3 or more)
*one [[Rubis class submarine|Rubis Class SSN]]
*two anti-submarine destroyers (currently [[Tourville class frigate|F67]] or [[Georges Leygues class frigate|F70]] class)
*one or two anti-air destroyers (currently [[Cassard class frigate|''Cassard'' class destroyers]], soon helped by [[Horizon class frigate|Horizon class destroyers]])
*one frigate in forward patrol (usually a [[La Fayette class frigate|''La Fayette'' class]])
*one supply ship

This group is commanded by a rear admiral ([[Counter Admiral|contre-amiral]], in French) onboard the aircraft carrier. The commanding officer of the air group (usually a capitaine de frégate—equivalent to commander) is subordinate to the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier, a senior captain. The escort destroyers (called frigates in the French denomination) are commanded by more junior captains. The ''Charles de Gaulle'' is likely to be joined by the [[future French aircraft carrier]] at some point in the future.

===Italian carrier battle group===
The CVS–ASW (Aircraft Carrier with Anti-Submarine Warfare) [[Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']] is Italy's first carrier. The battle group based in Taranto called COMFORAL is formed by the carrier Garibaldi, two &quot;Durand de La Penne&quot; class destroyers, two support ships Etna and Elettra, and three amphibious/support ships (San Giusto, San Marco and San Giorgio).

After 2010 the Italian battle group will be formed by the new carrier [[Cavour (550)|Cavour]], 5-6 new warships (including destroyers Horizon and frigates FREMM), one new support ship, some minehunters and new submarines (the COMFORAL will be a reserve group).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.it/cartellecomuni/leg15/RapportoAttivitaCommissioni/commissioni/allegati/04/04_all_appnavi.pdf New ships of the Italian battle group (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish carrier battle group===
The Spanish Navy currently operates one carrier, the [[Principe de Asturias (R11)|''Principe de Asturias'']]. It will soon be joined by the ''[[Buque de Proyección Estratégica]],'' designed as a multi-purpose warship that can be used as a second carrier.

The group includes two escort squadrons: the 41st, with ASW [[Santa Maria class frigate|''Santa Maria'' class frigate]]s, and the 31st, with [[Aegis Combat System|AEGIS]] [[Álvaro de Bazán class frigate|''Álvaro de Bazán'' class]] AAW frigates.

===Indian carrier battle group===
The centrepiece of the Indian carrier battle group is currently the [[INS Viraat|INS ''Viraat'']], an updated Centaur class light carrier originally built for the Royal Navy as [[HMS Hermes (R12)|HMS ''Hermes'']], which was laid down in 1944 and commissioned in 1959. It was purchased by India in 1986. India will commission a second aircraft carrier, [[INS Vikramaditya|INS ''Vikramaditya'']], in 2012 and will follow this with a third carrier, [[Vikrant class aircraft carrier|INS ''Vikrant 2'']], in 2015. Whilst INS ''Vikramaditya'' is a former Soviet [[Kiev class|''Kiev'' class]] carrier, the [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov|''Admiral Gorshkov'']], the ''Vikrant'' will be the first indigenous Indian aircraft carrier. India eventually will have 2 Carrier battle groups by 2017.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The [[Indian Navy]]'s CBG usually consists of two destroyers (usually of the [[Delhi class destroyer|Delhi]] Class, previously [[Kashin class destroyer|Kashins]] were used) and two or more frigates, (usually a combination of [[Brahmaputra class frigate|Brahmaputra]], [[Talwar class frigate|Talwar]] or [[Shivalik class frigate|Shivalik]] class) and one support ship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Soviet and Russian carrier battle groups===
The sole former Soviet and now Russian carrier, the [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']] is rarely out to sea. Of the few sorties the carrier has conducted, most have been solo missions and without a large escort. However, the ''Kuznetsov'' has been observed sailing together with a [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirov'' class cruiser (CGN)]], [[Slava class cruiser|''Slava class'' CG]], [[Sovremenny class destroyer|''Sovremenny'' class DDG (ASuW)]], [[Udaloy class destroyer|''Udaloy'' class DDG (ASW)]] and [[Krivak class frigate|Krivak I/II FFG (ASW)]]. These escorts, especially the heavily armed ''Kirov'' class cruiser, use advanced sensors and carry a variety of weaponry. However, ships like the ''Kirov'' would likely be used in offensive operations rather than fleet escort in the event of war. Carrier escort would then be conducted by smaller vessels such as a ''Slava'' class accompanied by several Sovremenny, Udaloy and Krivak vessels.

The ''Admiral Kuznetsov'' is designed specifically to sail alone and carries greater firepower than its U.S. counterparts. This includes 12x SS-N-19 'Shipwreck' (long range, high speed, sea-skimming) SSMs, 24x VLS units loaded with 192 SA-N-9 'Gauntlet' SAMs, and 8x Kashtan CIWS with dual 30&amp;nbsp;mm guns, and 8x AK-630 CIWS. Compared to the 4x Phalanx CIWS and 4x Sea Sparrow launchers, each with 6 missiles carried by the ''Nimitz'' class, the ''Kuznetsov'' is well armed for both air-defence and offensive operations against hostile shipping.

===Brazilian carrier battle group===
The [[NAe São Paulo|NAe ''São Paulo'']] forms Brazil's only carrier battle group, together with 4 Frigates from Type-22/1 Class Frigates and Vosper Mk.10 Class Frigates (know as Niteroi Class), 1 or 2 Tupi Class Submarine, and one NT Almirante Gastão Motta Replenishment Oiler, with VF-1 &quot;Falcão&quot; Air Wing equipped with 6 to 9 Attack Aircraft AF-1 SkyHawk (A-4Ku), and 3 more Helicopters Squadrons for Attack, ASW and Multi-Mission (between AS332 Super Puma, AS532 Cougar, Super Lynx, Esquilo, EC 725 (16 ordered) SH-3 (being replaced by 4 ex-USN SH-70B)) and 2 more Fixed Wings Squadrons for AEW, COD and REVO (C-1A Trader and S-2 Tracker ordered). The [[NAe São Paulo|NAe ''São Paulo'']] was formerly [[Clemenceau class aircraft carrier|''Clemenceau'' class aircraft carrier]] ''Foch'', a design used by the French Navy until 1997.

===Thai carrier battle group===
[[HTMS Chakri Naruebet|HTMS ''Chakri Naruebet'']] is Thailand's only aircraft carrier, and is based upon the [[Principe de Asturias (R11)|''Principe de Asturias'']] of the Spanish Navy.

===Planned Chinese carrier group===
China is planning an aircraft carrier group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= O'Brien, Rachel |title= Strained US-Sino ties loom at Asia forum  |url= http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/strained-ussino-ties-loom-at-asia-forum-20100722-10m0x.html |date= July 22, 2010 |work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |agency= [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |accessdate= August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underway replenishment==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Reagan CSG 060520-N-7130B-135.jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Ronald Reagan'' conducting underway replenishment at same time as an ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer]] --&gt;
Since its origins, the viability of the carrier battle group has been dependent on its ability to remain at sea for extended periods. Specialized ships were developed to provide underway replenishment of fuel (for the carrier and its aircraft), ordnance, and other supplies necessary to sustain operations. Carrier battle groups devote a great deal of planning to efficiently conduct [[underway replenishment]] to minimize the time spent conducting replenishment. The carrier can also provide replenishment on a limited basis to its escorts, but typically a replenishment ship such as a [[fast combat support ship]] (AOE) or [[replenishment oiler]] (AOR) pulls alongside a carrier and conducts simultaneous operations with the carrier on its port side and one of the escorts on its starboard side. The advent of the helicopter provides the ability to speed replenishment by lifting supplies at the same time that fuelling hoses and lines are delivering other goods.

==Debate on future viability==
There is debate in naval warfare circles as to the viability of carrier battle groups in 21st century naval warfare. Proponents of the CVBG argue that it provides unmatched fire power and force projection capabilities. Opponents argue that CVBGs are increasingly vulnerable to [[arsenal ship]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, especially those with [[supersonic]] flight and the ability to perform radical trajectory changes to avoid anti-missile systems. It is also noted that that CVBGs were designed for Cold War scenarios, and are less useful in establishing control of areas close to shore. It is argued however that such missiles and arsenal ships pose no serious threat as they would be eliminated due to increasing improvement in ship defenses such as CEC ([[cooperative engagement capability]]), DEW technology and missile technology.

However, carriers have been called upon to be first responders even when conventional land based aircraft were employed. During Desert Shield, the U.S. Navy sortied additional carriers to augment the on station assets eventually maintaining six carriers for [[Desert Storm]]. Although the U.S. Air Force sent fighters such as the [[F-16]] to theater in Desert Shield, they had to carry bombs with them as no stores were in place for sustained operations whereas the carriers arrived on scene with full magazines and had support ships to allow them to conduct strikes indefinitely.

The [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]] (GWOT) has shown the flexibility and responsiveness of the carrier on multiple occasions when land based air was not feasible or able to respond in a timely fashion. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the U.S., carriers immediately headed to the Arabian Sea to support [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and took up station, building to a force of three carriers. Their steaming location was closer to the targets in Afghanistan than any land based assets and thereby more responsive. The [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']] was adapted to be a support base for [[special operations]] helicopters. Carriers were used again in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and even provided aircraft to be based ashore on occasion and have done so periodically when special capabilities are needed. This precedent was established during [[World War II]] in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] and still remains viable today.

Regardless of the debate over viability, the United States has made a major investment in the development of a new carrier class—the [[Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier|''Ford''-class carriers]] (formerly designated CVN-X, or the X Carrier)—to replace the existing [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class carriers]]. The new ''Ford''-class carriers are designed to be modular and are easily adaptable as technology and equipment needed on board changes.&lt;ref&gt;GlobalSecurity.org - http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cvx.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight''' is a medium-lift [[tandem rotor]] transport [[helicopter]], used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC) to provide all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment. [[Assault Support]] is its primary function, and the movement of supplies and equipment is secondary. Additional tasks include combat support, search and rescue, support for forward refueling and rearming points, [[CASEVAC]] and Tactical Recovery of [[Aircraft]] and Personnel (TRAP). The commercial version is the '''BV 107-II''', commonly referred to as simply the &quot;Vertol&quot;.

==Development==
Piasecki was a pioneering developer of tandem-rotor helicopters, with the most famous previous helicopter being the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] &quot;Flying Banana&quot;. Piasecki's former company [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol]] began work on a new tandem rotor helicopter designated the ''Vertol Model 107'' or V-107 in 1956. The V-107 prototype had two [[Lycoming T53]] [[turboshaft]] engines, producing 877 shp (640&amp;nbsp;kW) each.&lt;ref name=Apostolo&gt;Apostolo, Giorgio. &quot;Boeing Vertol Model 107&quot;. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters''. New York: Bonanza Books. 1984. ISBN 978-0-517-43935-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The first flight of the V-107 took place on 22 April 1958.&lt;ref name=Donald_V-107&gt;Donald, David ed. &quot;Boeing Vertol Model 107 (H-46 Sea Knight)&quot;, ''The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft''. Barnes &amp; Nobel Books, 1997. ISBN 0-7607-0592-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The V-107 was then put through a flight demonstration tour in the US and overseas. In June 1958, the US Army awarded a contract to Vertol for ten production aircraft designated &quot;YHC-1A&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;whirly&quot;&gt;Spenser, Jay P.

[[File:CH-46 Machine Gun.jpg|thumb|right|A door gunner manning a pintle-mounted .50-caliber machine gun aboard a [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] CH-46.]]

The order was later decreased to three, so the Army could divert funds to the V-114, also a turbine powered tandem, but larger than the V-107.&lt;ref name=&quot;whirly&quot;/&gt; The Army's three YHC-1As were powered by [[General Electric T58|GE-T-58]] engines. The YHC-1As first flew in August 1959, and were followed by an improved commercial/export model, the 107-II.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm CH-46 history page], US Navy, 16 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1960, the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] (USMC) evolved a requirement for a twin-turbine troop/cargo assault helicopter to replace the piston engine types then in use. Following a design competition, Boeing Vertol was selected to build its model 107M as the HRB-1, early in 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt; Boeing had acquired Vertol in 1960 and renamed the group [[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Vertol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whirly&quot;/&gt;

The helicopter was first procured in 1961&lt;ref name=&quot;vert_Tandom&quot;&gt;&quot;Tandem Twosome&quot;, ''Vertical Magazine'', February–March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to meet the medium-lift requirements of the Marine Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CH-46 Sea Knight (H-49) &quot;Phrog&quot; |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/ch-46.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first flight in August 1962 was followed by a change in designation to CH-46A. Fleet introduction of CH-46As with the Marines and the Navy's UH-46As in November 1964. The UH-46A variant was modified for use in the vertical replenishment role.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt; The CH-46A was equipped with a pair of T58-GE8-8B turboshaft engines rated at 1,250 shp (930&amp;nbsp;kW) each and could carry 17 passengers or 4,000 pounds (1,815&amp;nbsp;kg) of cargo.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Marines CH-46 Helicopter.jpg|thumb|right|US Marines from the [[24th MEU]] prepare to board a CH-46.]]

Production of the improved CH-46D followed with deliveries beginning in 1966. Its improvements included modified rotor blades and more powerful T58-GE-10 turboshaft engines&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt; rated at {{convert|1400|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each. The increased power allowed the D-model to carry 25 troop or {{convert|7000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=off}} of cargo.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt; Along with the USMC CH-46Ds, the Navy received a small number of UH-46Ds for ship resupply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eden&quot;&gt;Eden, Paul, ed. &quot;Boeing-Vertol H-46 Sea Knight&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. Amber Books, 2004. ISBN 1-904687-84-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, approximately 33 CH-46As were upgraded to CH-46Ds.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt;

The Marines also received CH-46Fs from 1968 to 1971. The F-model retained the D-model's T58-GE-10 engines but revised the avionics and included other modifications. The CH-46F was the final production model.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt; The Sea Knight has undergone upgrades and modifications. Most USMC Sea Knights were upgraded to CH-46E standard. The CH-46E features fiberglass rotor blades, airframe reinforcement, and further uprated T58-GE-16 engines producing {{convert|1870|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each. Some CH-46Es have been given doubled fuel capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt; The Dynamic Component Upgrade (DCU) incorporated starting in the mid-1990s provides for increased capabilities through strengthened drive systems and rotor controls.

The commercial variant, the ''BV 107-II'', was first ordered by [[New York Airways]] in 1960. They took delivery of their first three aircraft, configured for 25 passengers, in July 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;vert_Tandom&quot;/&gt; In 1965, Boeing Vertol sold the manufacturing rights of the 107 to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]. Under this arrangement, all Model 107 civilian and military aircraft [[CH-46 Sea Knight#Japanese versions|built in Japan]] are known as ''KV 107''.&lt;ref name=&quot;vert_Tandom&quot;/&gt;

On 15 December 2006, [[Columbia Helicopters, Inc]] acquired the [[type certificate]] for the Boeing Vertol 107-II, and is in the process of acquiring a Production Certificate from the FAA. Plans for actual production of the aircraft have not been announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;vert_Tandom&quot;/&gt;

==Design==
The CH-46 has tandem contrarotating rotors powered by two [[General Electric T58|GE T58]] turboshaft engines. The engines are mounted on each side of the rear rotor pedestal with a driveshaft to the forward rotor. The engines are coupled so either could power both rotors in an emergency. The rotors feature three blades and can be folded for on-ship operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;&gt;[http://www.vectorsite.net/avch47.html Boeing Sea Knight], Vectorsite.net, July 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CH-46 has a cargo bay with a rear loading ramp that could be removed or left open in flight for extended cargo or for parachute drops. An internal winch is mounted in the forward cabin and can be used to pull external cargo on pallets into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers. A belly sling hook (cargo hook) which is usually rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}. could be attached for carrying external cargo. Although the hook is rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}., the limited power produced by the engines preclude the lifting of such weight. It usually has a crew of three, but can accommodate a larger crew depending on mission specifics. For example, a Search and Rescue variant will usually carry a crew of five (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Crew Chief, Swimmer, and Medic) to facilitate all aspects of such a mission. A pintle-mounted 0.50 in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) Browning machine gun is mounted on each side of the helicopter for self-defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt; Service in southeast Asia resulted in the addition of armor with the guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt;

The CH-46 has fixed tricycle landing gear, with twin wheels on all three units. The gear configuration causes a nose-up stance to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. The main gear are fitted in rear sponsons that also contain fuel tanks with a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt;

CH-46E Sea Knights were used by the USMC during its [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. CH-46Es transported personnel, brought supplies to forward arming and refueling points (FARP), carried ammunition and various tasks. Marine CH-46Es and CH-53Es carried US Army Rangers and Special Operations troops in a mission to extract captured Army Private [[Jessica Lynch]] from an Iraqi hospital on 1 April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Stout, Jay A.

The '''Chief of Naval Operations''' ('''CNO''') is typically the highest ranking officer in the [[United States Navy]] (unless the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|chairman]] or [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|vice chairman]] of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] is a naval officer) and is a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000151----000-.html] 10 USC 151. Joint Chiefs of Staff: composition; functions&lt;/ref&gt; The CNO reports directly to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] for the command, utilization of resources and operating efficiency of the operating forces of the Navy and of the Navy shore activities assigned by the Secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The US Navy|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/leadership/cno_resp.asp|accessdate= September 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy, the CNO also designates naval personnel and naval resources to the commanders of [[Unified Combatant Command]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;authority&quot;&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00005013----000-.html#f] 10 USC 5013(f). Secretary of the Navy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000165----000-.html] 10 USC 165. Combatant commands: administration and support&lt;/ref&gt; The CNO also performs all other functions prescribed under {{UnitedStatesCode|10|5033}} and those assigned by the secretary&lt;ref name=&quot;authority&quot;/&gt; or delegates those duties and responsibilities to other officers in his administration under his name. Like the other joint chiefs, the CNO is an administrative position and has no operational command authority over United States naval forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt; The position of CNO replaced the position of Aide for Naval Operations, which was a position established by administrative law rather than statute.

The CNO is the principal adviser to the [[President of the United States]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] and to the Secretary of the Navy on the conduct of naval warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt; The Chief of Naval Operations is nominated by the President for appointment and must be confirmed via majority vote by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=10 USC 5033. Chief of Naval Operations|url= http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00005033----000-.html|accessdate=September 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement for being Chief of Naval Operations is having significant experience in joint duty assignments, which includes at least one full tour of duty in a joint duty assignment as a flag officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNO&quot;/&gt; However, the president may waive those requirements if he determines the officer is necessary for national interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNO&quot;/&gt; By statute, the CNO is appointed as a four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNO&quot;/&gt; The Chief of Naval Operations is also the head of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav).&lt;ref&gt;[https://navcms.news.navy.mil/navydata/leadership/cno_resp.asp navy.mil] Chief of Naval Operations − Responsibilities. Retrieved 2010-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1923, the CNO lived at [[Number One Observatory Circle]] on the grounds of [[United States Naval Observatory]]. This arrangement continued until 1974, when Congress made it the official residence of the Vice President.

'''Clara Petacci''' ('''Claretta Petacci''') (28 February 1912{{ndash}} 28 April 1945) was an upper class [[Rome|Roman]] whose father had been the personal physician to the [[Pope]].  She became the mistress of the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], who was twenty-eight years her senior.  On 27 April 1945, when a convoy of escaping [[Italian Social Republic]] members, including Mussolini, was captured by [[Italian resistance movement|Communist partisans]], it is said that Petacci was offered the opportunity to go unmolested.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}  On 28 April, she and Mussolini were taken to [[Mezzegra]] where she and the [[Duce]] were shot.  On the following day, 29 April, Mussolini and Petacci's bodies were taken to the Piazzale Loreto in [[Milan]] and hung upside down in front of an [[Esso]] petrol station.  The bodies were photographed as a crowd vented their rage upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cidc.library.cornell.edu/dof/italy/captioned/hanging.htm | title = Death of the Father-Mussolini &amp; Fascist Italy: the 'infamous' exhibit | publisher = [[Cornell Institute for Digital Collections]] | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Costa Smeralda''' ({{lang-en|Emerald Coast}}, {{lang-sc|Monti di Mola}}) is a coastal area and tourist destination in northern [[Sardinia]], 55&amp;nbsp;km long and covering more than 30&amp;nbsp;km². With  white sand beaches, a golf club, private jet and helicopter service, and hotels costing up to [[US$]]2,000 - 3,000 per night in the peak season, the area has drawn celebrities, business leaders and other affluent visitors.

The main towns and villages in the area, built according to a detailed [[urban planning|urban plan]], are [[Arzachena]], [[Porto Cervo]], [[Liscia di Vacca]], [[Capriccioli]] and [[Romazzino]]. [[archaeology|Archaeological]] sites include the Li Muri “[[Tomba dei Giganti]]” (Giants’ Grave).

Each September the ''Sardinia Cup'' [[sailing]] [[regatta]] is held off the coast. Polo matches are held between April and October at Gershan near Arzachena. Other attractions include a film festival in Tavolara and a vintage car rally. 

The development of the area started in 1961, and was financed by a consortium of companies led by Prince [[Aga Khan IV|Karim Aga Khan]]. Spiaggia del Principe, one of the beaches along the Costa Smeralda, was named after this Ishmaelite Prince.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharmingSardinia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Olbia-Costa%20Smeralda-Badesi.pdf | format=web | title=Guide to Olbia, Costa Smeralda, Badesi | work=CharmingSardinia.com |date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects involved in the project included Busiri-Vici, [[Jacques Couëlle]], Savin Couëlle and Vietti.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Fiasco di chianti monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|right|Chianti wine in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]''.]]
'''Chianti''' is a red [[Italian wine]] produced in [[Tuscany (wine)|Tuscany]]. It was historically associated with a squat [[bottle]] enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'' (&quot;flask&quot;; ''pl. fiaschi''); however, the ''fiasco'' is only used by a few makers of the wine now; most Chianti is bottled in traditionally shaped wine bottles. [[Baron]] [[Bettino Ricasoli]] (later [[Prime Minister]] in the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]) created the Chianti recipe of 70% [[Sangiovese]], 15% [[Canaiolo]] and 15% [[Malvasia bianca]] in the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 162-163&quot;&gt; J. Robinson (ed) ''&quot;The Oxford Companion to Wine&quot;'' Third Edition  pg 162-163 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0198609906 &lt;/ref&gt;

The first definition of a wine-area called ''Chianti'' was made in 1716. It described the area near the villages of [[Gaiole (Chianti)|Gaiole]], [[Castellina (Chianti)|Castellina]] and [[Radda (Chianti)|Radda]]; the so-called ''Lega del Chianti'' and later ''Provincia del Chianti'' (Chianti province). In 1932 the Chianti area was completely re-drawn and divided in seven sub-areas: Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and Rùfina. Most of the villages that in 1932 were suddenly included in the new Chianti Classico area added ''in Chianti'' to their name-such as [[Greve in Chianti]] which amended its name in 1972. Wines labeled Chianti Classico come from the biggest sub-area of Chianti, that sub-area that includes the old Chianti area. The other variants, with the exception of Rufina from the north-east side of [[Florence]] and Montalbano in the south of [[Pistoia]], originate in the respective named provinces: [[Province of Siena|Siena]] for the Colli Senesi, [[Province of Florence|Florence]] for the Colli Fiorentini, [[Province of Arezzo|Arezzo]] for the Colli Aretini and [[Province of Pisa|Pisa]] for the Colline Pisane. In 1996 part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-area was renamed ''Montespertoli''.

During the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese.  For a wine to retain the name of Chianti, it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies pg 147-159&quot;&gt; M. Ewing-Mulligan &amp; E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 147-159 Hungry Minds 2001 ISBN 0764553550 &lt;/ref&gt; A Chianti may have a picture of a black rooster (known in Italian as a ''gallo nero'') on the neck of the bottle, which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the Gallo Nero Consortium, an association of producers of the Classico sub-area sharing marketing costs.&lt;ref&gt;Consorzio del Marchio Storico&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005 the black rooster has been the emblem of the Chianti Classico producers association.&lt;ref&gt;Consorzio del vino Chianti Classico&lt;/ref&gt; Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4-7), may be labelled as Riserva. Chianti that meets more stringent requirements (lower yield, higher alcohol content and dry extract) may be labelled as [[Chianti Superiore]], although Chianti from the &quot;Classico&quot; sub-area is not allowed in any event to be labelled as &quot;Superiore&quot;.

==History==
{{Main|History of Chianti}}
The earliest documentation of a &quot;Chianti wine&quot; dates back to the thirteenth century when viticulture was known to flourish in the ''&quot;Chianti Mountains&quot;'' around Florence. The merchants in the nearby townships of Castellina, Gaiole and Radda formed the ''Lega del Chianti'' (League of Chianti) to produce and promote the local wine. In 1398, records note that the earliest incarnation of Chianti was as a white wine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 162-163&quot;/&gt; In 1716 [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] issued an edict legislating that the three villages of the ''Lega del Chianti'' as well as the village of [[Greve (Chianti)|Greve]] and a 2 mile (3 km) hillside north of Greve near [[Spedaluzza]] as the only officially recognized producers of Chianti. This delineation existed until the 1930s when the Italian government expanded the zone. Subsequent expansions throughout the twentieth century would eventually bring the Chianti zone to cover almost all of Tuscany. The original zone dictated by the edict of Cosimo III de' Medici would eventually be considered the heart of the Chianti Classico region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;&gt; A. Domine (ed.) ''Wine'', pp. 402-411, Ullmann Publishing, 2008 ISBN 9783833146114 &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bettino Ricasoli.jpg|left|thumb|The Italian statesman [[Bettino Ricasoli]] developed the first &quot;modern&quot; Chianti recipe that was Sangiovese based.]]
By the eighteenth century, Chianti was widely recognized as a red wine, but the exact composition and grape varieties used to make Chianti at this point is unknown. [[Ampelographer]]s find clues about which grape varieties were popular at the time in the writings of Italian writer [[Cosimo Villifranchi]] who noted that [[Canaiolo]] was widely planted variety in the area along with Sangiovese, [[Mammolo]] and [[Marzemino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 162-163&quot;/&gt; It was not until the work of the Italian statesman [[Bettino Ricasoli]] that the modern &quot;Chianti recipe&quot; as a Sangiovese-based wine would take shape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson pg 414-420&quot;&gt; H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 414-420 Simon and Schuster 1989 ISBN 0671687026 &lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Ricasoli, Canaiolo was emerging as the dominant variety in the Chianti blend with Sangiovese and [[Malvasia]] playing supporting roles. In the mid-nineteenth century, Ricasoli developed a recipe for Chianti that was based primarily on Sangiovese. His recipe called for 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo, 10% Malvasia (later amended to include [[Trebbiano]]) and 5% other local red varieties. In 1967, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulation set by the Italian government firmly established the &quot;Ricasoli formula&quot; of a Sangiovese-based blend with 10-30% Malvasia and Trebbiano.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt;

The late nineteenth century saw a period of economic and political upheaval. First came [[oidium]] and then the [[phylloxera epidemic]] would take it toll on the vineyards of Chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across the rest of Europe. The chaos and poverty following the ''[[Risorgimento]]'' heralded the beginning of the [[Italian diaspora]] that would take Italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson pg 414-420&quot;/&gt; Those that stayed behind and replanted choose high-yielding varieties like [[Trebbiano]] and Sangiovese clones such as the ''Sangiovese di Romagna'' from the nearby [[Romagna]] region. Following [[World War II]], the general trend in the world wine market for cheap, easy-drinking wine saw a brief boom for the region. With over-cropping and an emphasis on quantity over quality, the reputation of Chianti among consumers eventually plummeted. By the 1950s, Trebbiano (which is known for its neutral flavours) made up to 30% of many mass-market Chiantis.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacNeil pg 376-379&quot;&gt; K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 376-379 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1563054345 &lt;/ref&gt; By the late twentieth century, Chianti was often associated with basic Chianti sold in a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''fiasco''. However, during the same period, a group of ambitious producers began working outside the boundaries of DOC regulations to make what they believed would be a higher quality style of Chianti. These wines eventually became known as the &quot;[[Super Tuscans]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 162-163&quot;/&gt;

Many of the producers behind the Super Tuscan movement were originally Chianti producers who were rebelling against what they felt were antiquated DOC regulations. Some of these producers wanted to make Chiantis that were 100% [[varietal]] Sangiovese. Others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending [[French (wine)|French]] grape varieties such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]] or to not be required to blend in any white grape varieties. The late twentieth century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the Chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern wine-making techniques such as the use of new [[oak barrels (wine)|oak barrels]]. The prices and [[wine ratings]] of some Super Tuscans would regularly eclipse those of DOC sanctioned Chiantis. The success of the Super Tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the DOC regulations in order to bring some of these wines back into the fold labelled as Chianti.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt;

==Wine regions==
[[Image:sottozone chianti.jpg|right|thumb|550px|Chianti wine area within Tuscany]]
The Chianti region covers a vast area of Tuscany and includes within its boundaries several overlapping ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) and ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita]]'' (DOCG) regions. Other well known Sangiovese-based [[Tuscan wines]] such as [[Brunello di Montalcino]] and [[Vino Nobile di Montepulciano]] could be bottled and labeled under the most basic designation of &quot;Chianti&quot; if their producers chose to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sotheby pg 282-286&quot;&gt; T. Stevenson ''&quot;The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia&quot;'' pg 282-286 Dorling Kindersley 2005 ISBN 0756613248 &lt;/ref&gt; Within the collective Chianti region more than 8 million cases of wines classified as DOC level or above are produced each year. Today, most Chianti falls under two major designations of Chianti DOCG, which includes basic level Chianti, as well as that from seven designated sub-zones, and Chianti Classico DOCG.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies pg 147-159&quot;/&gt; Together, these two Chianti zones produce the largest volume of DOC/G wines in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt;

===Chianti Classico===
In 1716 Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany issued an edict legislating that the three villages of the ''Lega del Chianti'' ([[Castellina in Chianti]], [[Gaiole in Chianti]], and [[Radda in Chianti]]) as well as the village of [[Greve (Chianti)|Greve]] and a 2-mile (3-km) stretch of hillside north of Greve near [[Spedaluzza]] as the only officially recognized producers of Chianti. This delineation existed until July 1932, when the Italian government expanded the Chianti zone to include the outlying areas of [[Barberino Val d'Elsa]], [[Chiocchio]], [[Robbiano]], [[San Casciano in Val di Pesa]] and [[Strada (Chianti)|Strada]]. The 1932 expansion was canonized into DOC regulations in 1966. Since the mid 1980s, the Chianti Classico zone has had its own DOCG recognized area separate from the greater Chianti region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt; As of 2006, there were 17,640 acres (7,142 hectares) of vineyards in the Chianti Classico region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 162-163&quot;/&gt;

The Chianti Classico region covers an area of approximate 100 square miles (259 square kilometers) between the city of [[Florence]] to the north and [[Siena]] to the south. The four communes of Castellina in Chianti, Gaiole in Chianti, Greve in Chianti and Radda in Chianti are located entirely within the boundaries of the Classico region with parts of Barberino Val d'Elsa, San Casciano in Val di Pesa and [[Tavarnelle Val di Pesa]] in the [[province of Florence]] as well as [[Castelnuovo Berardenga]] and [[Poggibonsi]] in the [[province of Siena]] included within the permitted boundaries of Chianti Classico. The soil and geography of this region can be quite varied, with altitudes ranging from 820 feet (250 meters) to 2000 feet (610 meters), and rolling hills producing differing [[macroclimate]]s. There are two main soil types in the region: a weathered sandstone known as ''[[albarese]]'' and a bluish-gray [[chalk]]y [[marlstone]] known as ''[[galestro]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt; The soil in the north is richer and more fertile with more ''galestro'', with the soil gradually becoming harder and stonier with more ''albarese'' in the south. In the north, the [[Arno river]] can have an influence on the climate, keeping the temperatures slightly cooler, an influence that diminishes further south in the warmer Classico territory towards Castelnuovo Berardenga.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies pg 147-159&quot;/&gt;

====Regional differences====
[[Image:Chianti-colline2-2.jpg|thumb|left|Vineyards in [[Gaiole in Chianti]] in the Chianti Classico region]]
Chianti Classico wines tend to be medium-bodied with firm [[tannins (wine)|tannin]]s and medium-high to high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]]. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic [[aromas (wine)|aromas]] with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-[[palate]] and [[finish (wine)|finish]] than at the front of the mouth. As with [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]], the different regions of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some wines from those areas. According to [[Master of Wine]] [[Mary Ewing-Mulligan]], Chianti Classico wines from the Castellina region tend to have a very delicate aroma and flavor, Castelnuovo Berardegna region wines tend to be the [[most ripe (wine)|most ripe]] and richest tasting, wines from Gaiole tend to have be characterized by their structure and firm tannins while wines from the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies pg 147-159&quot;/&gt;

===Chianti===
The Chianti DOCG covers all the Chianti wine and includes a large stretch of land encompassing the western reaches of the [[province of Pisa]] near the coast of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the Florentine hills in the province of Florence to the north, to the [[province of Arezzo]] in the east and the Siena hills to the south. Within this regions are vineyards that overlap the DOCG regions of Brunello di Montalcino, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and [[Vernaccia di San Gimignano]]. Any Sangiovese-based wine made according to the Chianti guidelines from these vineyards can be labelled and marked under the basic Chianti DOCG should the producer wish to use the designation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies pg 147-159&quot;/&gt;

Within the Chianti DOCG there are eight defined sub-zones that are permitted to affix their name to the [[wine label]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sotheby pg 282-286&quot;/&gt;  Wines that are labeled as simply Chianti are made either from a blend from these sub-zones or include grapes from peripheral areas not within the boundaries of a sub-zone. The sub-zones are (clockwise from the north): the Colli Fiorentini which is located south of the city of Florence; Chianti Rufina in the northeastern part of the zone located around the commune of [[Rufina]]; Classico in the centre of Chianti, across the provinces of Florence and Siena; Colli Aretini in the Arezzo province to the east; Colli Senesi south of Chianti Classico in the Siena hills, which is the largest of the sub-zones and includes the Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano areas; Colline Pisane, the westernmost sub-zone in the province of Pisa; Montespertoli located within the Colli Fiorentini around the commune of [[Montespertoli]]; Montalbano in the north-west part of the zone which includes the [[Carmignano (wine)|Carmignano]] DOCG.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies pg 147-159&quot;/&gt; As of 2006, there were 786 acres (318 hectares) under production in Montalbano, 2,236 (905 hectares) in the Colli Fiorentini, 140 (57 hectares) in Montespertoli, 1,840 (745 hectares) in Rufina, 8,780 (3,553 hectares) in the Colli Senesi, 380 (154 hectares) in Colline Pisane, 1,603 (649 hectares) in the Colli Aretini, and an additional 25,511 (10,324 hectares) in the peripheral areas that do not fall within one of the sub-zone classifications. Wines produced from these vineyards are labelled simply &quot;Chianti&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 162-163&quot;/&gt;

====Sub-zone differences====
[[File:Chianti Riserva BMK.jpg|right|thumb|A bottle of basic DOCG Chianti Riserva that does not specify a sub-zone on the label. This wine may be a blend from several zones.]]
Outside of Chianto Classico, the wines of the Chianti sub-zone of Rufina are among the most widely recognized and exported from the Chianti region. Located in the [[Arno]] valley near the town of [[Pontassieve]], the Rufina region includes much area in the [[Pomino]] region, an area that has a long history of wine production. The area is noted for the cool climate of its elevated vineyards located up to 2,950 feet (900 meters). The [[vineyard soil]]s of the region are predominately [[marl]] and [[chalk]]. The Florentine merchant families of the [[Antinori]] and [[Frescobaldi]] own the majority of the vineyards in Rufina. Chianti from the Rufina area is characterized by its multi-layered [[complexity (wine)|complexity]] and elegance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt;

The Colli Fiorentini has seen an influx of activity and new vineyard development in recent years as wealthy Florentine business people move to the country to plant vineyards and open wineries. Many foreign &quot;[[flying winemaker]]s&quot; have had a hand in this development, bringing global [[viticulture]] and [[winemaking]] techniques to the Colli Fiorentini. Located in the hills between the Chianti Classico area and Arno valley, the wines of the Colli Fiorentini vary widely depending on producer, but tend to have a simple structure with strong character and fruit notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt; The Montespertoli sub-zone was part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-zone until 2002 when it became its own tiny enclave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 162-163&quot;/&gt;

The Montalbano region is located in the shadow of the Carmignano DOCG, with much of the best Sangiovese going to that wine. A similar situation exists in the Colli Senesi which includes the well known DOCG region of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Both regions rarely appear on wine labels that are exported out of Tuscany. The Colli Pisane area produces typical Chiantis with the lightest body and color. The Colli Aretini is a relatively new and emerging area that has seen an influx of investment and new winemaking in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt;

==Chianti blend and requirements==
Since 1996 the blend for Chianti and Chianti Classico has been 75-100% Sangiovese, up to 10% Canaiolo and up to 20% of any other approved red grape variety such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot or Syrah. Since 2006, the use of white grape varieties such as Malvasia and Trebbiano have been prohibited in Chianti Classico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson.com&quot;&gt; Jancis Robinson ''&quot;[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/20080701.html Chianti Classico - thoroughly red now]&quot;'' 5 July 2008 &lt;/ref&gt; Chianti Classico must have a minimum [[alcohol level]] of at least 12% with a minimum of 7 months aging in oak, while Chianti Classico's labeled ''[[riserva]]'' must be aged at least 27 months at the winery, with a minimum alcohol level of at least 12.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies pg 147-159&quot;/&gt; The [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] [[yields (wine)|yields]] for Chianti Classico are restricted to no more than 3 tonnes per acre (7.5 tonnes/hectare). For basic Chianti, the minimum alcohol level is 11.5% with yields restricted to 4 tonnes per acre (9 tonnes/hectare).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt;

The aging for basic Chianti DOCG is much less stringent with most varieties allowed to be released to the market on 1 March following the [[vintage]] year. The sub-zones of Colli Fiorentini, Montespertoli and Rufina must be aged for a further three months and not released until 1 June. All Chianti Classicos must be held back until 1 October in the year following the vintage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 162-163&quot;/&gt;

[[Jancis Robinson]] notes that Chianti is sometimes called the &quot;[[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]] of [[Italy (wine)|Italy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson.com&quot;/&gt; The flexibility in the blending recipe for Chianti accounts for some of the variability in styles among Chiantis. Lighter [[body (wine)|bodied]] styles will generally have a higher proportion of white grape varieties blended in, while Chiantis that have only red grape varieties will be fuller and richer. While only 15% of Cabernet Sauvignon is permitted in the blend, the nature of the grape variety can have a dominant personality in the Chianti blend and be a strong influence in the wine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies pg 147-159&quot;/&gt;

Chianti Classico wines are characterized in their youth by their predominantly floral and [[cinnamon]] spicy bouquet. As the wine [[ages (wine)|ages]], aromas of [[tobacco]] and [[leather]] can emerge. Chiantis tend to have medium-high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]] and medium [[tannins (wine)|tannins]].

===Chianti Superiore===
Chianti Superiore is an Italian DOCG wine produced in the provinces of Arezzo, Florence, Pisa, Pistoia, Prato and Siena, in Tuscany. Superiore is a specification for wines produced with a stricter rule of production than other Chianti wines. Chianti Superiore has been authorized since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;D.M. 5.08.1996&lt;/ref&gt; Chianti Superiore wines can be produced only from grapes cultivated in the Chianti wine areas except from those vineyards that are registered in the Chianti Classico sub-zone. Vineyards registered in Chianti sub-zones[2] other than Classico can produce Chianti Superiore wines but must omit the sub-zone name on the label. Ageing is calculated from 1 January after the picking. Chianti Superiore cannot be sold to the consumer before nine months of ageing, of which three must be in the bottle. Therefore it cannot be bottled before the June after picking or sold to consumers before the next September.

Chianti Superiore wines must be produced with the following grapes:
* Sangiovese: min. 75%
* Canaiolo Nero: max. 10%
* Trebbiano Toscano and Malvasia del Chianti: max. 10%
* Other authorized red grapes: max. 20%
* As of 2007 white grapes were eliminated

[[File:Chianti Classico.jpg|right|thumb|The ''gallo nero'' seal of the Consorzio Chianti Classico]]
The black rooster (''gallo nero'' in [[Italian (language)|Italian]]) that appears on the neck labels of many Chianti Classico is the symbol of the [[Consorzio Chianti Classico]], a foundation of producers in the Chianti Classico region. The foundation was founded with the aim of promoting the wines of the region, improving quality and preventing [[wine fraud]]. Since the 1980s, the foundation has sponsored extensive research into the viticultural and winemaking practice of the Chianti Classic area, particularly in the area of clonal research. In the last quarter of a century more than 50% of the vineyards in the Chianti Classic region have been replanted with improved Sangioves clones and to modern vineyard schematics as part of the Consorzio Chianti Classico's project &quot;Chianti 2000&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine pg 402-411&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Corioliskraftanimation.gif|frame|right|Figure 1: In the inertial frame of reference (upper part of the picture), the black object moves in a straight line, without significant friction with the disc. However, the observer (red dot) who is standing in the rotating (non-inertial) frame of reference (lower part of the picture) sees the object as following a curved path due to the Coriolis and centrifugal forces present in this frame.]]

In physics, the '''Coriolis effect''' is a deflection of moving objects when they are viewed in a [[rotating reference frame]].  In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the deflection is to the left of the motion of the object; in one with anti-clockwise rotation, the deflection is to the right. The mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by a French scientist [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] in connection with the theory of water wheels, and also in the [[Theory of tides|tidal equations]] of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1778. Early in the 20th century, the term ''Coriolis force'' began to be used in connection with [[meteorology]].{{fact|date=February 2011}}

The Coriolis effect is caused by the rotation of the [[Earth]] and the [[inertia]] of the mass experiencing the effect. [[Newton's laws of motion]] govern the motion of an object in a (non accelerating) [[inertial frame of reference]].  When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis and [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] forces appear. Both forces are proportional to the [[mass]] of the object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to its square. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame. The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame.  These additional forces are termed either inertial forces, [[fictitious force]]s or ''pseudo forces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Classical Mechanics: With introduction to Nonlinear Oscillations and Chaos|last = Bhatia|first = V.B.|publisher = Narosa Publishing House|year = 1997|page = 201|isbn = 81-7319-105-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They allow the application of simple Newtonian laws to a rotating system. They are correction factors that do not exist in a true non-accelerating &quot;inertial&quot; system.

Perhaps the most commonly encountered rotating reference frame is the Earth. Because the Earth completes only one rotation per day, the Coriolis force is quite small, and its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean.  Such motions are constrained by the 2-dimensional surface of the earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects on the surface of the Earth to appear to veer to the right in the [[northern hemisphere]], and to the left in the [[southern hemisphere|southern]].  Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would on a non-rotating planet, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the [[equator]], and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large [[Cyclone#Structure|cyclones]] &lt;!--Don't add tornadoes here; the Coriolis effect is not directly responsible for tornadoes--&gt;(see [[#Meteorology|Coriolis effects in meteorology]]).

==History==
[[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts, such as waterwheels.&lt;ref name=corps&gt;{{Cite journal|author=G-G Coriolis |title=Sur les équations du mouvement relatif des systèmes de corps |journal= J. de l'Ecole royale polytechnique |volume=15 |pages= 144–154 |year=1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; That paper considered the supplementary forces that are detected in a rotating frame of reference. Coriolis divided these supplementary forces into two categories. The second category contained a force that arises from the [[cross product]] of the [[angular velocity]] of a [[coordinate system]] and the projection of a particle's [[velocity]] into a plane [[perpendicular]] to the system's [[axis of rotation]]. Coriolis referred to this force as the &quot;compound centrifugal force&quot; due to its analogies with the [[centrifugal force]] already considered in category one.&lt;ref&gt;Dugas, René and J. R.

==Formula==
{{See also|Fictitious force}}
In non-vector terms: at a given rate of rotation of the observer, the magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration of the object is proportional to the velocity of the object and also to the sine of the angle between the direction of movement of the object and the axis of rotation.

The vector formula for the magnitude and direction of the Coriolis acceleration is

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C = -2 \, \boldsymbol{ \Omega \times v}&lt;/math&gt;

where (here and below) &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the particle in the rotating system, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle in the rotating system, and '''Ω''' is the [[angular velocity]] vector which has magnitude equal to the rotation rate ω and is directed along the axis of rotation of the rotating reference frame, and the '''×''' symbol represents the [[cross product]] operator.

The equation may be multiplied by the mass of the relevant object to produce the Coriolis force:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ F}_C = -2 \, m \, \boldsymbol{\Omega \times v}&lt;/math&gt;.

See ''[[fictitious force]]'' for a derivation.

The ''Coriolis effect'' is the behavior added by the ''Coriolis acceleration''. The formula implies that the Coriolis acceleration is perpendicular both to the direction of the velocity of the moving mass and to the frame's rotation axis. So in particular:
*if the velocity is parallel to the rotation axis, the Coriolis acceleration is zero.
*if the velocity is straight inward to the axis, the acceleration is in the direction of local rotation.
*if the velocity is straight outward from the axis, the acceleration is against the direction of local rotation.
*if the velocity is in the direction of local rotation, the acceleration is outward from the axis.
*if the velocity is against the direction of local rotation, the acceleration is inward to the axis.

The vector cross product can be evaluated as the [[Cross product#Matrix notation|determinant of a matrix]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega \times v} = \begin{vmatrix} \boldsymbol{i}&amp;\boldsymbol{j}&amp;\boldsymbol{k} \\ \Omega_x &amp; \Omega_y &amp; \Omega_z \\ v_x &amp; v_y &amp; v_z \end{vmatrix}\ = \begin{pmatrix} \Omega_y v_z - \Omega_z v_y \\ \Omega_z v_x - \Omega_x v_z \\ \Omega_x v_y - \Omega_y v_x \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the vectors '''''i''''', '''''j''''', '''''k''''' are unit vectors in the ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' directions.

==Causes==
The Coriolis effect exists only when one uses a rotating reference frame. In the rotating frame it behaves exactly like a real force (that is to say, it causes acceleration and has real effects). However, Coriolis force is a consequence of [[inertia]], and is not attributable to an identifiable originating body, as is the case for electromagnetic or nuclear forces, for example. From an analytical viewpoint, to use [[Newton's second law]] in a rotating system, Coriolis force is mathematically necessary, but it disappears in a non-accelerating, inertial frame of reference. For example, consider two children on opposite sides of a spinning roundabout ([[carousel]]), who are throwing a ball to each other (see Figure 1).  From the children's point of view, this ball's path is curved sideways by the Coriolis effect.  Suppose the roundabout spins counter-clockwise when viewed from above.  From the thrower's perspective, the deflection is to the right.&lt;ref name=&quot;CalvinandHobbs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey|author=John M. Wallace and Peter V. Hobbs|pages=368-371|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|ISBN=0127329501}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the non-thrower's perspective, deflection is to left.  ''For a mathematical formulation see [[Fictitious force#Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces|Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces]].''

A denizen of a rotating frame, such as an astronaut in a rotating space station, very probably will find the interpretation of everyday life in terms of the Coriolis force accords more simply with intuition and experience than a cerebral reinterpretation of events from an inertial standpoint. For example, nausea due to an experienced push may be more instinctively explained by Coriolis force than by the law of inertia.&lt;ref name=Ebenholtz&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oculomotor Systems and Perception |author=Sheldon M.

The acceleration entering the Coriolis force arises from two sources of change in velocity that result from rotation: the first is the change of the velocity of an object in time. The same velocity (in an inertial frame of reference where the normal laws of physics apply) will be seen as different velocities at different times in a rotating frame of reference. The apparent acceleration is proportional to the angular velocity of the reference frame (the rate at which the coordinate axes change direction), and to the component of velocity of the object in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This gives a term &lt;math&gt;-\boldsymbol\Omega\times\boldsymbol v&lt;/math&gt;.
The minus sign arises from the traditional definition of the cross product ([[right hand rule]]), and from the sign convention for angular velocity vectors.

The second is the change of velocity in space. Different positions in a rotating frame of reference have different velocities (as seen from an inertial frame of reference). In order for an object to move in a straight line it must therefore be accelerated so that its velocity changes from point to point by the same amount as the velocities of the frame of reference. The effect is proportional to the angular velocity (which determines the relative speed of two different points in the rotating frame of reference), and to the component of the velocity of the object in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (which determines how quickly it moves between those points). This also gives a term &lt;math&gt;-\boldsymbol\Omega\times\boldsymbol v&lt;/math&gt;.

==Length scales and the Rossby number==
{{See|Rossby number}}
The time, space and velocity scales are important in determining the importance of the Coriolis effect. Whether rotation is important in a system can be determined by its [[Rossby number]], which is the ratio of the velocity, ''U'', of a system to the product of the [[Coriolis parameter]],&lt;math&gt;f = 2 \omega \sin \varphi \,&lt;/math&gt;, and the length scale, ''L'', of the motion:
:&lt;math&gt;Ro = \frac{U}{fL}&lt;/math&gt;.
The Rossby number is the ratio of inertial to Coriolis forces. A small Rossby number signifies a system which is strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number signifies a system in which inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large, in low-pressure systems it is low and in oceanic systems it is of the order of unity. As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.&lt;ref name=Lakshmi&gt;{{Cite book|title=Numerical Models of Oceans and Oceanic Processes |author=Lakshmi H. Kantha &amp; Carol Anne Clayson |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0124340687 |year=2000 |page=103 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Gps9JXtd3owC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Coriolis+cyclostrophic+%22low+pressure+%22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An atmospheric system moving at ''U'' = 10 m/s occupying a spatial distance of ''L'' = {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}}, has a Rossby number of approximately 0.1.
A man playing catch may throw the ball at ''U'' = 30 m/s in a garden of length ''L'' = 50 m. The Rossby number in this case would be about = 6000.
Needless to say, one does not worry about which hemisphere one is in when playing catch in the garden. However, an unguided missile obeys exactly the same physics as a baseball, but may travel far enough and be in the air long enough to notice the effect of Coriolis. Long-range shells in the Northern Hemisphere landed close to, but to the right of, where they were aimed until this was noted. (Those fired in the southern hemisphere landed to the left.) In fact, it was this effect that first got the attention of Coriolis himself.&lt;ref name=Butz&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science of Earth Systems |author=Stephen D.

==Applied to Earth==
An important case where the Coriolis force is observed is the rotating Earth.

===Intuitive explanation===
The Earth's rotation causes the surface to move fastest at the [[equator]], and not at all at the poles. A bird flying away from the equator carries this faster motion with it—or, equivalently, the surface under the bird is rotating more slowly than it was—and the bird's flight curves eastward slightly. In general: objects moving away from the equator curve eastward; objects moving towards the equator curve westward.

===Rotating sphere===
[[Image:Earth coordinates.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Coordinate system at latitude φ with ''x''-axis east, ''y''-axis north and ''z''-axis upward (that is, radially outward from center of sphere).]]

Consider a location with latitude ''φ'' on a sphere that is rotating around the north-south axis.&lt;ref name=Menke&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geophysical Theory |author=William Menke &amp; Dallas Abbott |pages=124–126 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=XP3R_pVnOoEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=spheres+rotating++Coriolis
|isbn=0231067925 |year=1990 |publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local coordinate system is set up with the ''x'' axis horizontally due east, the ''y'' axis horizontally due north and the ''z'' axis vertically upwards. The rotation vector, velocity of movement and Coriolis acceleration expressed in this local coordinate system (listing components in the order East (''e''), North (''n'') and Upward (''u'')) are:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ \Omega} = \omega \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \cos \varphi \\ \sin \varphi \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n \\ v_u \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C =-2\boldsymbol{\Omega \times v}= 2\,\omega\, \begin{pmatrix} v_n \sin \varphi-v_u \cos \varphi \\ -v_e \sin \varphi \\ v_e \cos\varphi\end{pmatrix}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

When considering atmospheric or oceanic dynamics, the vertical velocity is small and the vertical component of the Coriolis acceleration is small compared to gravity. For such cases, only the horizontal (East and North) components matter. The restriction of the above to the horizontal plane is (setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''=0):

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n\end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_c = \begin{pmatrix} v_n \\ -v_e\end{pmatrix}\ f\ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f = 2 \omega \sin \varphi \,&lt;/math&gt; is called the Coriolis parameter.

By setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, it can be seen immediately that (for positive φ and ω) a movement due east results in an acceleration due south. Similarly, setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, it is seen that a movement due north results in an acceleration due east. In general, observed horizontally, looking along the direction of the movement causing the acceleration, the acceleration always is turned 90° to the right and of the same size regardless of the horizontal orientation.

As a different case, consider equatorial motion setting φ = 0°. In this case, '''Ω''' is parallel to the North or ''n''-axis, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ \Omega} = \omega \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n \\ v_u \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C =-2\boldsymbol{\Omega \times v}= 2\,\omega\, \begin{pmatrix}-v_u \\0 \\ v_e \end{pmatrix}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, an eastward motion (that is, in the same direction as the rotation of the sphere) provides an upward acceleration known as the [[Eötvös effect]], and an upward motion produces an acceleration due west.

===The Sun and distant stars===
The motion of the Sun as seen from Earth is dominated by the Coriolis and centrifugal forces. Consider the situation of a distant star (with mass m) located over the equator, at position '''r''', perpendicular to the rotation vector '''Ω''' so '''Ω·r''' = 0. It is observed to rotate in the opposite direction as the Earth's rotation once a day, making its velocity '''v = –Ω × r'''. The fictitious force consisting of Coriolis and centrifugal forces is:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol {F_f} = -2 \, m \, \boldsymbol{\Omega \times v} - m \, \boldsymbol{\Omega \times { (\Omega \times r)}}&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = +2 \, m \, \boldsymbol{\Omega \times (\Omega \times r)} - m \, \boldsymbol{\Omega \times {(\Omega \times r)}}&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = m \, \boldsymbol{\Omega \times (\Omega \times r)}&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = m \, (\boldsymbol{\Omega (\Omega \cdot r) - r (\Omega \cdot \Omega))}&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = - m \, \Omega^2 \, \boldsymbol r&lt;/math&gt;

This can be recognised as the centripetal force that will keep the star in a circular movement around the observer.

The general situation for a star, not above the equator is more complicated. Just as for air flows on Earth's surface, on the northern hemisphere a star's trajectory will be deflected to the right. After rising at a certain angle, it will bend to the right, culminate and start setting.

===Meteorology===

Perhaps the most important instance of the Coriolis effect is in the large-scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere. In meteorology and [[oceanography]], it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary. In accommodation of that provisional postulation, the otherwise fictitious centrifugal and Coriolis forces are introduced. Their relative importance is determined by the applicable [[#Length scales and Rossby number|Rossby number]]s.  [[Tornado]]s have high Rossby numbers, so, while tornado-associated centrifugal forces are quite substantial, Coriolis forces associated with tornados are for practical purposes negligible.&lt;ref name=Holton2&gt;{{Cite book|edition=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology |year=2004 |author=James R. Holton |url=http://books.google.com/?id=fhW5oDv3EPsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=tornado+rossby

High pressure systems rotate in a direction such that the Coriolis force will be directed radially inwards, and nearly balanced by the outwardly radial pressure gradient.  This direction is clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Low pressure systems rotate in the opposite direction, so that the Coriolis force is directed radially outward and nearly balances an inwardly radial pressure gradient.  In each case a slight imbalance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient accounts for the radially inward acceleration of the system's [[circular motion]].

====Flow around a low-pressure area====
{{Main|Low-pressure area}}
If a low-pressure area forms in the atmosphere, air will tend to flow in towards it, but will be deflected perpendicular to its velocity by the Coriolis force. A system of equilibrium can then establish itself creating circular movement, or a cyclonic flow. Because the Rossby number is low, the force balance is largely between the [[pressure gradient force]] acting towards the low-pressure area and the Coriolis force acting away from the center of the low pressure.

Instead of flowing down the gradient, large scale motions in the atmosphere and ocean tend to occur perpendicular to the pressure gradient. This is known as [[geostrophic flow]].&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atmosphere, Weather and Climate |author=Roger Graham Barry &amp; Richard J. Chorley |url=http://books.google.com/?id=MUQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=Coriolis++%22low+pressure%22
|page=115 |isbn=0415271711 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a non-rotating planet fluid would flow along the straightest possible line, quickly eliminating pressure gradients. Note that the geostrophic balance is thus very different from the case of &quot;inertial motions&quot; (see below) which explains why mid-latitude cyclones are larger by an order of magnitude than inertial circle flow would be.

This pattern of deflection, and the direction of movement, is called [[Buys-Ballot's law]]. In the atmosphere, the pattern of flow is called a [[cyclone]]. In the Northern Hemisphere the direction of movement around a low-pressure area is anticlockwise. In the Southern Hemisphere, the direction of movement is clockwise because the rotational dynamics is a mirror image there. At high altitudes, outward-spreading air rotates in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17026 Cloud Spirals and Outflow in Tropical Storm Katrina] from [[Earth Observatory]] ([[NASA]])&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclones rarely form along the equator due to the weak Coriolis effect present in this region.

====Inertial circles====
An air or water mass moving with speed &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; subject only to the Coriolis force travels in a circular trajectory called an 'inertial circle'. Since the force is directed at right angles to the motion of the particle, it will move with a constant speed, and perform a complete circle with frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The magnitude of the Coriolis force also determines the radius of this circle:
: &lt;math&gt;R= \frac {v}{2 \pi f}\,&lt;/math&gt;

On the Earth, a typical mid-latitude value for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; hence for a typical atmospheric speed of 10&amp;nbsp;m/s the radius is {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}}, with a period of about 14&amp;nbsp;hours. In the ocean, where a typical speed is closer to 10&amp;nbsp;cm/s, the radius of an inertial circle is {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}}. These inertial circles are clockwise in the northern hemisphere (where trajectories are bent to the right) and anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere.

If the rotating system is a parabolic turntable, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant and the trajectories are exact circles. On a rotating planet, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; varies with latitude and the paths of particles do not form exact circles. Since the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; varies as the sine of the latitude, the radius of the oscillations associated with a given speed are smallest at the poles (latitude = ±90°), and increase toward the equator.&lt;ref name=Marshall2&gt;{{Cite book|title=p. 98 |author=John Marshall &amp; R.

====Other terrestrial effects====
The Coriolis effect strongly affects the large-scale oceanic and [[atmospheric circulation]], leading to the formation of robust features like [[jet stream]]s and [[western boundary current]]s. Such features are in [[geostrophic]] balance, meaning that the Coriolis and ''pressure gradient'' forces balance each other. Coriolis acceleration is also responsible for the propagation of many types of waves in the ocean and atmosphere, including [[Rossby wave]]s and [[Kelvin wave]]s. It is also instrumental in the so-called [[Ekman layer|Ekman]] dynamics in the ocean, and in the establishment of the large-scale ocean flow pattern called the [[Sverdrup balance]].

===Eötvös effect===
The practical impact of the ''Coriolis effect'' is mostly caused by the horizontal acceleration component produced by horizontal motion.

There are other components of the Coriolis effect. Eastward-traveling objects will be deflected upwards (feel lighter), while westward-traveling objects will be deflected downwards (feel heavier). This is known as the [[Eötvös effect]]. This aspect of the Coriolis effect is greatest near the equator. The force produced by this effect is similar to the horizontal component, but the much larger vertical forces due to gravity and pressure mean that it is generally unimportant dynamically.

In addition, objects traveling upwards or downwards will be deflected to the west or east respectively. This effect is also the greatest near the equator. Since vertical movement is usually of limited extent and duration, the size of the effect is smaller and requires precise instruments to detect.

===Draining in bathtubs and toilets===
In 1908, the Austrian physicist [[Otto Tumlirz]] described careful and effective experiments which demonstrated the effect of the rotation of the Earth on the outflow of water through a central aperture.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Tumlirz [http://stud4.tuwien.ac.at/~e0325551/zeugs/WirbelInDerBadewanne.pdf &quot;A new physical evidence of the axis of rotation of the earth&quot;] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was later popularized in a famous article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', which described an experiment in which all other forces to the system were removed by filling a {{convert|6|ft|adj=on}} tank with {{convert|300|USgal|l}} of water and allowing it to settle for 24 hours  (to allow any movement due to filling the tank to die away), in a room where the temperature had stabilized. The drain plug was then very slowly removed, and tiny pieces of floating wood were used to observe rotation. During the first 12 to 15 minutes, no rotation was observed. Then, a vortex appeared and consistently began to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction (the experiment was performed in the Northern hemisphere, in Boston, MA). This was repeated and the results averaged to make sure the effect was real. The report noted that the vortex rotated, &quot;about 30,000 times faster than the effective rotation of the earth in 42° North (the experiment's location)&quot;.  This shows that the small initial rotation due to the earth is amplified by gravitational draining and conservation of angular momentum to become a rapid vortex and may be observed under carefully controlled [[laboratory]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/1961080b0|title=Bath-Tub Vortex|year=1962|last1=Shapiro|first1=Ascher H.|journal=Nature|volume=196|pages=1080|bibcode = 1962Natur.196.1080S|issue=4859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/fluids/www/Shapiro/ncfmf.html (Vorticity, Part 1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of a vortex over the plug hole may be explained by the conservation of [[angular momentum]]. The radius of rotation decreases as water approaches the plug hole so the rate of rotation increases, for the same reason that an ice skater's rate of spin increases as she pulls her arms in.  Any rotation around the plug hole that is initially present accelerates as water moves inward.  If the water is so still that the effective rotation rate of the earth (once per day at the poles, once every 2 days at 30 degrees of latitude) is faster than that of the water relative to its container, and if externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) are small enough, the Coriolis effect may determine the direction of the vortex. Without such careful preparation, the Coriolis effect may be much smaller than various other influences on drain direction, such as any residual rotation of the water and the geometry of the container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8hOLs-bmiYYC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=earth%27s+rotation+speed+land+equator+pole+book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L8j4VEe1p-&amp;sig=WEd1u0F1fHFLya-H-xipNxBwnog&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2FWWTb8EkoLRAZHy4fwL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=earth%27s%20rotation%20speed%20land%20equator%20pole%20book&amp;f=false|page=169|title=Physics: A World View|author=Larry D.

Despite this, the idea that toilets and bathtubs drain differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres has been popularized by several television programs, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Bart vs. Australia]]&quot; and ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode &quot;[[Die Hand Die Verletzt]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16836639.html &quot;''X-Files'' coriolis error leaves viewers wondering&quot;] from ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Several science broadcasts and publications, including at least one college-level physics textbook, have also stated this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fraser|first=Alistair|title=Bad Coriolis|url=http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadCoriolis.html|work=Bad Meteorology|publisher=Pennsylvania State College of Earth and Mineral Science|accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tipler|first=Paul|title=Physics for Engineers and Scientists|year=1998|publisher=W.H.Freeman, Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1572596160|edition=4th|page=128|quote=...on a smaller scale, the coriolis effect causes water draining out a bathtub to rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ballistic missiles and satellites===
Ballistic missiles and satellites appear to follow curved paths when plotted on common world maps mainly because the Earth is spherical and the shortest distance between two points on the Earth's surface (called a [[great circle]]) is usually not a straight line on those maps. Every two-dimensional (flat) map necessarily distorts the Earth's curved (three-dimensional) surface in some way. Typically (as in the commonly used [[Mercator projection]], for example), this distortion increases with proximity to the poles. In the northern hemisphere for example, a ballistic missile fired toward a distant target using the shortest possible route (a great circle) will appear on such maps to follow a path north of the straight line from target to destination, and then curve back toward the equator. This occurs because the latitudes, which are projected as straight horizontal lines on most world maps, are in fact circles on the surface of a sphere, which get smaller as they get closer to the pole. Being simply a consequence of the sphericity of the Earth, this would be true even if the Earth didn't rotate. The Coriolis effect is of course also present, but its effect on the plotted path is much smaller.

The Coriolis effects became important in [[External ballistics#Coriolis drift|external ballistics]] for calculating the trajectories of very long-range [[artillery]] shells. The most famous historical example was the [[Paris gun]], used by the Germans during [[World War I]] to bombard [[Paris]] from a range of about {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}}.

===Cannon on turntable===
{{Technical|section|date=June 2010}}

{{See also|Fictitious force#Crossing a carousel}}
[[Image:Target on turntable.PNG|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Cannon at the center of a rotating turntable. To hit the target located at position 1 on the perimeter at time ''t'' = 0s, the cannon must be aimed ahead of the target at angle θ. That way, by the time the cannonball reaches position 3 on the periphery, the target also will be at that position. In an inertial frame of reference, the cannonball travels a straight radial path to the target (curve ''y''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). However, in the frame of the turntable, the path is arched (curve ''y''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;), as also shown in the figure.]]
[[Image:Trajectory for three angles of launch.PNG|thumb|300px|Figure 4: Successful trajectory of cannonball as seen from the turntable for three angles of launch θ. Plotted points are for the same equally spaced times steps on each curve. Cannonball speed ''v'' is held constant and angular rate of rotation ω is varied to achieve a successful &quot;hit&quot; for selected θ. For example, for a radius of 1 m and a cannonball speed of 1 m/s, the time of flight ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1 s, and ω''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = θ → ω and θ have the same numerical value if θ is expressed in radians. The wider spacing of the plotted points as the target is approached show the speed of the cannonball is accelerating as seen on the turntable, due to fictitious Coriolis and centrifugal forces.]]
[[Image:Vector relationships.PNG|thumb|300px|Figure 5: Acceleration components at an earlier time (top) and at arrival time at the target (bottom)]]
[[Image:Cannon force components.PNG|thumb|300px|Figure 6: Coriolis acceleration, centrifugal acceleration and net acceleration vectors at three selected points on the trajectory as seen on the turntable.]]

Figure 1 is an animation of the classic illustration of Coriolis force. Another visualization of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49JwbrXcPjc this animation clip]. Figure 3 is a graphical version.

Here is a question: given the radius of the turntable ''R'', the rate of angular rotation ω, and the speed of the cannonball (assumed constant) ''v'', what is the correct angle θ to aim so as to hit the target at the edge of the turntable?

The inertial frame of reference provides one way to handle the question: calculate the time to interception, which is ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R'' / ''v'' . Then, the turntable revolves an angle ω ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' in this time. If the cannon is pointed an angle θ = ω ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ω ''R'' / ''v'', then the cannonball arrives at the periphery at position number 3 at the same time as the target.

No discussion of Coriolis force can arrive at this solution as simply, so the reason to treat this problem is to demonstrate Coriolis formalism in an easily visualized situation.

The trajectory in the inertial frame (denoted ''A'') is a straight line radial path at angle θ. The position of the cannonball in (''x'', ''y'') coordinates at time ''t'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_A (t) &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= vt\ \left( \cos (\theta ),\right.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left. {\color{white}..}\ \sin (\theta )\right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
In the turntable frame (denoted ''B''), the ''x''- ''y'' axes rotate at angular rate ω, so the trajectory becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_B (t) &lt;/math&gt; &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt;= vt\ \left( \cos ( \theta - \omega t),\right.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left. {\color{white}..} \sin ( \theta - \omega t)\right) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and three examples of this result are plotted in Figure 4.

To determine the components of acceleration, a general expression is used from the article [[fictitious force]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a}_{B} =
\mathbf{a}_A &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;- 2 \boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{v}_{B} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;- \boldsymbol\Omega \times (\boldsymbol\Omega \times \mathbf{r}_B ) &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;- \frac{d \boldsymbol\Omega}{dt} \times \mathbf{r}_B \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
in which the term in '''Ω × v&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the Coriolis acceleration and the term in '''Ω × ( Ω × r&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;)''' is the centrifugal acceleration. The results are (let α = θ − ω''t''):
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\Omega} \mathbf{\times r_B} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= \begin{vmatrix} \boldsymbol{i}&amp;\boldsymbol{j}&amp;\boldsymbol{k} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \omega \\ v t \cos \alpha &amp; vt \sin \alpha &amp; 0 \end{vmatrix}\ &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= \omega t v \left(-\sin\alpha, \cos\alpha\right )\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega \ \times} \left( \boldsymbol{\Omega} \mathbf{\times r_B}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt; = \begin{vmatrix} \boldsymbol{i}&amp;\boldsymbol{j}&amp;\boldsymbol{k} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \omega \\ -\omega t v \sin\alpha &amp; \omega t v \cos\alpha &amp; 0 \end{vmatrix}\ \ , &lt;/math&gt;
producing a centrifugal acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a_{\mathrm{Cfgl}}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= \omega^2 v t \left(\cos\alpha, \sin\alpha\right )=\omega^2 \mathbf{r_B}(t) \ .&lt;/math&gt;
Also:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_B} = \frac{d\mathbf{r_B}(t)}{dt}=(v \cos \alpha + \omega t \ v \sin \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;emsp;&lt;math&gt;\ v \sin \alpha -\omega t \ v \cos \alpha ,\ 0)\ \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\Omega} \mathbf{\times v_B} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= \begin{vmatrix}\! \boldsymbol{i}&amp; \! \boldsymbol{j}&amp; \! \boldsymbol{k} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \omega \\v \cos \alpha\quad &amp;v \sin \alpha\quad &amp;\quad \\ \; + \omega t \ v \sin \alpha &amp; \; -\omega t \ v \cos \alpha &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix}\ \ , &lt;/math&gt;
producing a Coriolis acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_{\mathrm{Cor}}} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= -2\left[ -\omega v \left( \sin\alpha - \omega t \cos\alpha\right),\right.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left. {\color{white}...}\ \omega v \left(\cos\alpha + \omega t \sin \alpha \right) \right]\ &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=2\omega v \left(\sin\alpha,\ - \cos\alpha \right) &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;-2\omega^2 \mathbf{r_B}(t) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
Figure 5 and Figure 6 show these accelerations for a particular example.

It is seen that the Coriolis acceleration not only cancels the centrifugal acceleration, but together they provide a net &quot;centripetal&quot;, radially inward component of acceleration (that is, directed toward the center of rotation):&lt;ref name=caution&gt;Here the description &quot;radially inward&quot; means &quot;toward the axis of rotation&quot;. That direction is ''not'' toward the [[osculating circle|center of curvature]] of the path, however, which is the direction of the true centripetal force. Hence, the quotation marks on &quot;centripetal&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_{\mathrm{Cptl}}} = -\omega^2 \mathbf{r_B}(t) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and an additional component of acceleration perpendicular to '''r&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''(t)'':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_{C\perp}} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp;&lt;math&gt;= 2\omega v \left(\sin\alpha,\ -\cos\alpha \right) \ .&lt;/math&gt;
The &quot;centripetal&quot; component of acceleration resembles that for [[circular motion]] at radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, while the perpendicular component is velocity dependent, increasing with the radial velocity ''v'' and directed to the right of the velocity. The situation could be described as a circular motion combined with an &quot;apparent Coriolis acceleration&quot; of 2ω''v''. However, this is a rough labeling: a careful designation of the true centripetal force refers to a [[Centripetal force#Local coordinates|local reference frame]] that employs the directions normal and tangential to the path, not coordinates referred to the axis of rotation.

These results also can be obtained directly by two time differentiations of '''r&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''(t)''. Agreement of the two approaches demonstrates that one could start from the general expression for fictitious acceleration above and derive the trajectories of Figure 4. However, working from the acceleration to the trajectory is more complicated than the reverse procedure used here, which, of course, is made possible in this example by knowing the answer in advance.

As a result of this analysis an important point appears: ''all'' the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the Coriolis acceleration, the [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] plays an essential role. It is easy to get the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which are focussed on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is the only factor that must be considered;&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Scientific Mathematics |author=George E.

===Tossed ball on a rotating carousel===
[[Image:Coriolis construction.JPG|thumb|300px|Figure 7: A carousel is rotating counterclockwise. ''Left panel'': a ball is tossed by a thrower at 12:00 o'clock and travels in a straight line to the center of the carousel. While it travels, the thrower circles in a counterclockwise direction. ''Right panel'': The ball's motion as seen by the thrower, who now remains at 12:00 o'clock, because there is no rotation from their viewpoint.]]

Figure 7 illustrates a ball tossed from 12:00 o'clock toward the center of a counterclockwise rotating carousel. On the left, the ball is seen by a stationary observer above the carousel, and the ball travels in a straight line to the center, while the ball-thrower rotates counterclockwise with the carousel. On the right the ball is seen by an observer rotating with the carousel, so the ball-thrower appears to stay at 12:00 o'clock. The figure shows how the trajectory of the ball as seen by the rotating observer can be constructed.

On the left, two arrows locate the ball relative to the ball-thrower. One of these arrows is from the thrower to the center of the carousel (providing the ball-thrower's line of sight), and the other points from the center of the carousel to the ball.(This arrow gets shorter as the ball approaches the center.) A shifted version of the two arrows is shown dotted.

On the right is shown this same dotted pair of arrows, but now the pair are rigidly rotated so the arrow corresponding to the line of sight of the ball-thrower toward the center of the carousel is aligned with 12:00 o'clock. The other arrow of the pair locates the ball relative to the center of the carousel, providing the position of the ball as seen by the rotating observer. By following this procedure for several positions, the trajectory in the rotating frame of reference is established as shown by the curved path in the right-hand panel.

The ball travels in the air, and there is no net force upon it. To the stationary observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so there is no problem squaring this trajectory with zero net force. However, the rotating observer sees a ''curved'' path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing to the ''right'' of the instantaneous direction of travel for a ''counterclockwise'' rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and Coriolis forces to provide the net force required to cause the curved trajectory.

===Bounced ball===
[[Image:Points of view.PNG|thumb|300px|Figure 8: Bird's-eye view of carousel. The carousel rotates clockwise. Two viewpoints are illustrated: that of the camera at the center of rotation rotating with the carousel (left panel) and that of the inertial (stationary) observer (right panel). Both observers agree at any given time just how far the ball is from the center of the carousel, but not on its orientation. Time intervals are 1/10 of time from launch to bounce.]]

Figure 8 describes a more complex situation where the tossed ball on a turntable bounces off the edge of the carousel and then returns to the tosser, who catches the ball. The effect of Coriolis force on its trajectory is shown again as seen by two observers: an observer (referred to as the &quot;camera&quot;) that rotates with the carousel, and an inertial observer. Figure 8 shows a bird's-eye view based upon the same ball speed on forward and return paths. Within each circle, plotted dots show the same time points. In the left panel, from the camera's viewpoint at the center of rotation, the tosser (smiley face) and the rail both are at fixed locations, and the ball makes a very considerable arc on its travel toward the rail, and takes a more direct route on the way back. From the ball tosser's viewpoint, the ball seems to return more quickly than it went (because the tosser is rotating toward the ball on the return flight).

On the carousel, instead of tossing the ball straight at a rail to bounce back, the tosser must throw the ball toward the right of the target and the ball then seems to the camera to bear continuously to the left of its direction of travel to hit the rail (''left'' because the carousel is turning ''clockwise''). The ball appears to bear to the left from direction of travel on both inward and return trajectories. The curved path demands this observer to recognize a leftward net force on the ball. (This force is &quot;fictitious&quot; because it disappears for a stationary observer, as is discussed shortly.) For some angles of launch, a path has portions where the trajectory is approximately radial, and Coriolis force is primarily responsible for the apparent deflection of the ball (centrifugal force is radial from the center of rotation, and causes little deflection on these segments). When a path curves away from radial, however, centrifugal force contributes significantly to deflection.

The ball's path through the air is straight when viewed by observers standing on the ground (right panel). In the right panel (stationary observer), the ball tosser (smiley face) is at 12 o'clock and the rail the ball bounces from is at position one (1). From the inertial viewer's standpoint, positions one (1), two (2), three (3) are occupied in sequence. At position 2 the ball strikes the rail, and at position 3 the ball returns to the tosser. Straight-line paths are followed because the ball is in free flight, so this observer requires that no net force is applied.

A video clip of the tossed ball and other experiments are found at [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcPs_OdQOYU youtube: coriolis effect (2-11)], [http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/fw/crls.rxml University of Illinois WW2010 Project] (some clips repeat only a fraction of a full rotation), and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAX3ALdienQ&amp;feature=related youtube].

==Visualization of the Coriolis effect==
[[Image:Coriolis effect11.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 9: A fluid assuming a parabolic shape as it is rotating]]
[[Image:Forces parabolic dish.png|thumb|right|Figure 10: The forces at play in the case of a curved surface.&lt;br /&gt;''Red'': gravity&lt;br /&gt;''Green'': the [[normal force]]&lt;br /&gt;''Blue'': the resultant [[centripetal force]].]]

{{anchor|parabolic turntable}}To demonstrate the Coriolis effect, a parabolic turntable can be used. On a flat turntable, the inertia of a co-rotating object would force it off the edge. But if the surface of the turntable has the correct parabolic bowl shape (see Figure 9) and is rotated at the correct rate, the force components shown in Figure 10 are arranged so the component of gravity tangential to the bowl surface will exactly equal the centripetal force necessary to keep the object rotating at its velocity and radius of curvature (assuming no friction). (See [[Centripetal_force#Example:_The_banked_turn|banked turn]].) This carefully contoured surface allows the Coriolis force to be displayed in isolation.&lt;ref name=parabola&gt;When a container of fluid is rotating on a turntable, the surface of the fluid naturally assumes the correct [[parabola|parabolic]] shape. This fact may be exploited to make a parabolic turntable by using a fluid that sets after several hours, such as a synthetic [[resin]]. For a video of the Coriolis effect on such a parabolic surface, see [http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb/lab5/gfd_v.htm Geophysical fluid dynamics lab demonstration] John Marshall, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=animation&gt;For a java applet of the Coriolis effect on such a parabolic surface, see [http://mensch.org/physlets/inosc.html Brian Fiedler] School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discs cut from cylinders of [[dry ice]] can be used as pucks, moving around almost frictionlessly over the surface of the parabolic turntable, allowing effects of Coriolis on dynamic phenomena to show themselves. To get a view of the motions as seen from the reference frame rotating with the turntable, a video camera is attached to the turntable so as to co-rotate with the turntable, with results as shown in Figure 11. In the left panel of Figure 11, which is the viewpoint of a stationary observer, the gravitational force in the inertial frame pulling the object toward the center (bottom ) of the dish is proportional to the distance of the object from the center. A centripetal force of this form causes the elliptical motion. In the right panel, which shows the viewpoint of the rotating frame, the inward gravitational force in the rotating frame (the same force as in the inertial frame) is balanced by the outward centrifugal force (present only in the rotating frame). With these two forces balanced, in the rotating frame the only unbalanced force is Coriolis (also present only in the rotating frame), and the motion is an ''[[#Inertial circles|inertial circle]]''. Analysis and observation of circular motion in the rotating frame is a simplification compared to analysis or observation of elliptical motion in the inertial frame.

Because this reference frame rotates several times a minute, rather than only once a day like the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger, and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales, than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by the rotation of the Earth.

In a manner of speaking, the Earth is analogous to such a turntable.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics: An Introductory Text|author=John Marshall &amp; R. Alan Plumb |page=101 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=aTGYbmVaA_gC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=Coriolis+%22parabolic+turntable%22|isbn=0125586914|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rotation has caused the planet to settle on a spheroid shape, such that the normal force, the gravitational force and the centrifugal force exactly balance each other on a &quot;horizontal&quot; surface. (See [[equatorial bulge]].)

The Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of the Earth can be seen indirectly through the motion of a [[Foucault pendulum]].

==Coriolis effects in other areas==
===Coriolis flow meter===
[[Image:Parabolic dish ellipse oscill.gif|frame|right|Figure 11: Object moving frictionlessly over the surface of a very shallow parabolic dish. The object has been released in such a way that it follows an ellipse-shaped trajectory.&lt;br /&gt;''Left'': The inertial point of view.&lt;br /&gt;''Right'': The co-rotating point of view.]]

A practical application of the Coriolis effect is the [[mass flow meter]], an instrument that measures the [[mass flow rate]] and [[density]] of a fluid flowing through a tube. The operating principle involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though it is not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame which gives rise to the Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the mass flow rate and density of the fluid.

===Molecular physics===
In polyatomic molecules, the molecule motion can be described by a rigid body rotation and internal vibration of atoms about their equilibrium position. As a result of the vibrations of the atoms, the atoms are in motion relative to the rotating coordinate system of the molecule. Coriolis effects will therefore be present and will cause the atoms to move in a direction perpendicular to the original oscillations. This leads to a mixing in molecular spectra between the rotational and vibrational [[energy level|levels]].

===Insect flight===
Flies ([[Diptera]]) and moths ([[Lepidoptera]]) utilize the Coriolis effect when flying: their [[halteres]], or antennae in the case of moths, oscillate rapidly and are used as vibrational gyroscopes.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Antennae as Gyroscopes&quot;, Science, Vol. 315, 9 February 2007, p. 771&lt;/ref&gt; See ''Coriolis effect in insect stability''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1013339 Halteres for the micromechanical flying insect (Wu, W.C.; Wood, R.J.; Fearing, R.S.)

Birds could theoretically use the Earth's Coriolis effect to partly determine their direction over time (although the sensory precision required would be extraordinary).  &lt;!--add as citation (from Bird Migration by Griffin).--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Marianatrenchmap.png|right|300px|thumb|Location of Challenger Deep within the Western Pacific Ocean]]
The '''Challenger Deep''' is the deepest known point in the oceans, with a depth of 10,911 m (35,797&amp;nbsp;ft). It is located at the southern end of the [[Mariana Trench]] near the [[Mariana Islands]] group. The Challenger Deep is a relatively small slot-shaped depression in the bottom of a considerably larger crescent-shaped trench, which itself is an unusually deep feature in the ocean floor.  The closest land to the Challenger Deep is [[Fais Island]] (one of the outer islands of [[Yap]]), {{convert|289|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest, and [[Guam]], {{convert|500|km|0|abbr=on}} to the northeast. The depression is named after the British [[Royal Navy]] survey ship [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']], whose [[Challenger expedition|expedition of 1872–76]] made the first recordings of its depth.

The most recent (1 June 2009) sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for 300–11,000&amp;nbsp;m deep water mapping aboard the [[RV Kilo Moana|RV ''Kilo Moana'']], has indicated a spot with a depth of {{convert|10971|m|0|abbr=on}} (6.82 miles). The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth (this is an error of about {{convert|22|m|0|abbr=on}} at this depth).&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/Reports/Archives/KMreportJuneJuly2009.html|title=Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA June and July 2009|date=2009-06-04|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scientic Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/KM/scienceequipment.htm|title=Inventory of Scientific Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA|date=2009-06-04|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three descents have ever been achieved. The first and only manned descent was by [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']] in 1960.  This was followed by the unmanned [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]] ''[[Kaikō]]'' in 1995 and [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|''Nereus'']] in 2009. These expeditions have measured very similar depths of 10,902 to 10,916 meters. In January 2010, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the ''Trieste'' descent, the [[X Prize Foundation]] announced a $10 million prize for the first privately funded craft to make two repeat manned descents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/earth-environment/article6998764.ece &quot;Ocean 'X Factor' to reach deepest point will net £6m&quot;], ''The Times'', January 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of depth mapping from the surface==
*The [[Challenger expedition|HMS ''Challenger'' expedition]] (December 1872 – May 1876) first [[Sounding line|sounded]] the depths now known as the Challenger Deep. This first sounding was made on 23 March 1875 at station 225.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1895-Summary/htm/doc877.html&lt;/ref&gt; The reported depth was 4,475 [[fathom]]s (26,850&amp;nbsp;ft, 8,184 m), based on two separate soundings.

*A 1912 book, ''The Depths of the Ocean'' by Sir John Murray, records the depth of the Challenger Deep as {{convert|31614|ft|0|abbr=on}}, reporting the sounding taken by the converted navy collier, [[USS Nero (AC-17)|USS Nero]], in 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theberge&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydro-international.com/issues/articles/id1049-Thirty_Years_of_Discovering_the_Mariana_Trench.html|title=Thirty Years of Discovering the Mariana Trench|last=Theberge|first=A.|date=24 March 2009|work=Hydro International|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was one of the expedition scientists, a young man at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1912-Murray/htm/doc131.html Page 131] of Murray's book refers to the Challenger Deep.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1951, about 75 years after its original discovery, the entire Mariana Trench was surveyed by a second [[Royal Navy]] vessel, captained by [[George Stephen Ritchie]] (later [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] Ritchie); this vessel was also named [[HMS Challenger (1931)|HMS ''Challenger'']], after the original expedition ship. This survey recorded the deepest part of the trench using [[echo sounding]], a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition.  A depth of 5,960 [[fathom]]s (10,900 m, 35,761&amp;nbsp;ft) was measured at {{Coord|11|19|N|142|15|E}}.

*The maximum surveyed depth of the Challenger Deep was reported in 1957 by the Soviet vessel Vityaz recording a spot 11,034 m (36,201&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. It was dubbed the ''Mariana Hollow'' and is listed in many reference sources, including the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Mariana Trench | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Britannica | volume = | pages = | publisher = Encyclopedia Britannica | date = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; articles in ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;ngnews&quot;&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html &quot;Life Is Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point&quot;], National Geographic News, February 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and on maps. It equals 6.86 miles. The pressure at this depth is approximately 1,099 times that at the surface, or 111 [[Pascal (pressure)|MPa]], roughly 16,155 [[Pounds_per_square_inch|psi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Akimoto&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Akimoto et al. | title=The deepest living foraminifera, Challenger Deep, Mariana Trench | journal=Marine Micropaleontology | volume=42 | year=2001 | pages=95 | doi=10.1016/S0377-8398(01)00012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depth figure has not been confirmed by any later expedition. Considering that even in the early 21st century, the error margin for sounding out depressions in the sea floor at these depths is about 20 m, it is, however, reasonably close to a recent (2009, see below) measurement.

*In 1984, a Japanese survey vessel used a narrow, multi-beam [[echo sounder]] to take a measurement of {{convert|10924|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;deepestdepth&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/OTHERS/CSMS/OCHAL/deep.htm|title=The deepest depths|last=Ritchie|first=Steve|accessdate=2007-07-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071027092319/http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/OTHERS/CSMS/OCHAL/deep.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On 1 June 2009 sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water (300 - 11,000 meters) mapping aboard the ''[[RV Kilo Moana]]'' (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), has indicated a spot with a depth of {{convert|10971|m|0|abbr=on}}. The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scientic Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA&quot;/&gt;

The latter maximal depths were not confirmed by the series of dives ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' made to the bottom during the [[Challenger Deep Nereus May/June 2009 Expedition]]. The direct descent measurements by the three expeditions which have reported from the bottom, have fixed depths in a narrow range from 10,916 m (''Trieste'') to 10,911 m (''[[Kaikō]]''), to 10,902 m ([[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|''Nereus'']]). However, although an attempt was made to correlate locations, it could not be absolutely certain that Nereus (or the other two descents) reached exactly the same points found to be maximally deep by the sonar/echo sounders of previous mapping expeditions, even though the last of these echo soundings was made by the Nereus mothership.

==Descents==
===''Trieste''===
{{Main|Bathyscaphe Trieste}}
On 23 January 1960, the Swiss-designed, Italian-built [[bathyscaphe]] ''Trieste'', acquired by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], descended to the ocean floor in the trench manned by [[Jacques Piccard]] (who co-designed the submersible along with his father, [[Auguste Piccard]]) and USN Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]].  The descent took almost five hours and the two men spent barely twenty minutes on the ocean floor before undertaking the three-hour-and-fifteen-minute ascent. Their early departure from the ocean floor was due to their concern over a crack in the window caused by the intense pressure of their descent, and also because their landing on the sea bed had stirred up a cloud of [[silt]] which reduced visibility to zero and showed no sign of settling. They measured the depth as {{convert|10916|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=usn1960&gt;{{Cite web

===''Kaikō''===
{{Main|Kaikō}}
On 24 March 1995, the Japanese robotic deep-sea probe ''Kaikō'' broke the depth record for unmanned probes when it reached close to the surveyed bottom of the Challenger Deep. Created by the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center [http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec-e/index-e.html (JAMSTEC)], it was one of the few unmanned deep-sea probes in operation that could dive deeper than {{convert|6000|m}}. Its recorded depth of {{convert|10911|m|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/about/equipment/ships/kaiko7000.html Official depth in meters: 10911.4&lt;/ref&gt; for the Challenger Deep is believed to be the most accurate measurement taken yet. ''Kaikō'' also collected sediment cores containing marine organisms from the bottom of the deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;ngnews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Akimoto&quot;/&gt; ''Kaikō'' made many unmanned descents to the Mariana Trench during three expeditions between 1995 and 1998.

===''Nereus''===

On 31 May 2009 the United States sent the ''Nereus'' hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) to the Challenger Deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot sub reaches deepest ocean&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8080324.stm|title=Robot sub reaches deepest ocean|date=2009-06-03|accessdate=2009-06-03|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nereus thus became the first vehicle to reach the Mariana Trench since 1998 and the deepest-diving vehicle currently in operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot sub reaches deepest ocean&quot;/&gt; Project manager and developer Andy Bowen heralded the achievement as &quot;the start of a new era in ocean exploration&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot sub reaches deepest ocean&quot;/&gt; ''Nereus'', unlike ''Kaikō'', did not need to be powered or controlled by a cable connected to a ship on the ocean surface.&lt;ref name='Nereus' reaches deepest part of the ocean&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news163167519.html|title='Nereus' reaches deepest part of the ocean|date=2009-06-02|accessdate=2009-06-02|publisher=physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifeforms==
The Summary Report of the HMS ''Challenger'' expedition lists [[radiolaria]] from the two dredged samples taken when the Challenger Deep was first discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1895-Summary/htm/doc878.html],  entry on March 23, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; These (Nassellaria and Spumellaria) were reported in the Report on Radiolaria (1887) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/Zool-40/README.htm], Report on the Radiolaria collected by H.M.S. Challenger
by Ernst Haeckel.&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Ernst Haeckel]].

On their 1960 descent, the crew of the ''Trieste'' noted that the floor consisted of [[diatom]]aceous ooze and reported observing &quot;some type of flatfish, resembling a [[Sole (fish)|sole]], about 1 foot long and 6 inches across&quot; lying on the seabed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1992/1/1992_1_28.shtml &quot;To the bottom of the sea&quot;], T. A. Heppenheimer, AmericanHeritage.com&lt;/ref&gt; The report has since been questioned, with suggestions that it may have been a [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]].  The video camera on board the ''Kaiko'' probe spotted a sea cucumber, a [[Polynoidae|scale worm]] and a [[shrimp]] at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg15220548.100-mission-to-marianas--if-mount-everest-was-dropped-into-the-worlds-deepest-trench-it-woulddrown-kaiko-hit-bottom----and-came-back-to-tell-the-tale.html &quot;Mission to Marianas&quot;], ''New Scientist'', 2 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983295-6,00.html &quot;The last frontier&quot;], ''Time'', August 14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; At the bottom of the Challenger deep, the ''Nereus'' probe spotted one [[polychaete]] worm (a multi-legged predator) about an inch long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns.gov.gu/geography.html Accessed Oct. 8, 2009] Geography of the ocean floor near Guam with some notes on exploration of the Challenger Deep.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the sediment samples collected by ''Kaiko'' found large numbers of simple organisms at {{convert|10900|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todo |first=Yuko |authorlink= |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2005 |month= |title=Simple Foraminifera Flourish at the Ocean's Deepest Point |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=307 |issue=5710 |pages=689 |doi=10.1126/science.1105407 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=15692042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower ocean trenches (&gt; 7,000 m) and on the [[abyssal plain]], the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep possibly represent [[taxon|taxa]] distinct from those in shallower ecosystems.

The overwhelming majority of the organisms collected were simple, soft-shelled [[foraminifera]] (432 species according to National Geographic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John |last=Roach |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Life Is Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html |work=National Geographic News |publisher= |date=February 3, 2005 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), with four of the others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera ''[[Leptohalysis]]'' and ''[[Reophax]]''.

As small organisms with hard, calcareous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because of the high solubility of [[calcium carbonate]] in the pressurized water, scientists theorize that the preponderance of soft-shelled organisms in the Challenger Deep may have resulted from the typical [[biosphere]] present when the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the course of six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment died out or were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The species that survived the change in depth were the ancestors of the Challenger Deep's current denizens.

'''Claude Louis Berthollet''' (9 December 1748 &amp;ndash; 6 November 1822) was a [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]]ard-French [[chemist]] who became vice president of the [[French Senate]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R. |last=Po-chia Hsia|coauthors=Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein and Bonnie G. Smith|title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Culture, A Concise History, Volume II: Since 1340|edition=2nd|location=New York|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin’s|year=2007|page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Claude Louis Berthollet was born in  [[Talloires]], near [[Annecy]], then part of the [[Duchy of Savoy]], in 1749.

Berthollet, along with [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and others, devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names, which serves as the basis of the modern system of naming chemical compounds. He also carried out research into [[dye]]s and [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]es (introducing the use of [[chlorine]] as a bleach) and determined the composition of [[ammonia]]. Berthollet was one of the first chemists to recognize the characteristics of a reverse reaction, and hence, [[chemical equilibrium]]. [[Potassium chlorate]] (KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a strong oxidizer, is known as ''Berthollet's Salt''. 

Berthollet was engaged in a long-term battle with another French chemist [[Joseph Proust]] on the validity of the [[law of definite proportions]]. While Proust believed that chemical compounds are composed of a fixed ratio of their constituent elements irrespective of the methods of production, Berthollet believed that this ratio can change according to the ratio of the reactants initially taken. Although Proust proved his theory by accurate measurements, his theory was not immediately accepted partially due to Berthollet's authority. His law was finally accepted when [[Berzelius]] confirmed it in 1811. But it was found later that Berthollet was not completely wrong because there exists a class of compounds that do not obey the law of definite proportions. These [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s are also named ''berthollides'' in his honor.

Berthollet was one of several scientists who went with [[Napoleon]] to Egypt, and was a member of the physics and natural history section of the [[Institut d'Égypte]].

In April, 1789 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London. &lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27berthollet%27%29 | title = Library and Archive Catalogue | publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 13 December 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. 

He died in [[Arcueil]], France in 1822.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__{{Politics of Chile}}The current '''Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile''', approved by [[Chile]]an voters in a controversial and tightly controlled [[Chilean constitutional referendum, 1980|plebiscite]] on September 11, 1980, under the military dictatorship of [[Augusto Pinochet]], partially effective March 11, 1981, fully effective 11 March 1990 and amended considerably on August 17, 1989 (via [[Chilean political reform referendum, 1989|referendum]]) and on September 22, 2005 (legislatively), and also in 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, replaced the earlier [[Chilean Constitution of 1925|constitution of 1925]]. In its original permanent dispositions, it gave the President of the Republic a large amount of power; however, some of these dispositions, such as the power of dissolving the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Lower Chamber]] of Congress and serving eight year terms with possibility of reelection, were modified or eliminated after 1990, when the country regained its democracy and the Congress was reestablished. It created some new institutions, such as the Constitutional Tribunal and the controversial National Security Council (COSENA).

In its temporary dispositions, the document ordered the transition from the former [[military]] government, with [[Augusto Pinochet]] as President of the Republic, and the Legislative Power of the [[Military dictatorship|Military Junta]] (formed by the heads of the [[Navy of Chile|navy]], [[Chilean Air Force|air force]], National Police, and a representative of the [[Chilean Army|army]], the head of the Army being president of the republic), to a civil one, with a time frame of eight years, during which the Legislative Power would still be the Military Junta. It set the first eight year presidential term for Pinochet, with a [[plebiscite]] in the eighth year, in which only one candidate, nominated by the Junta, would be accepted or not. The candidate, as expected, was Pinochet himself. While the steps to follow in the case of a triumph of the &quot;yes&quot; option, which the document obviously anticipated, were clearly delineated, the steps for the &quot;no&quot; triumph were less so, but still clear enough that no serious doubt emerged when the &quot;no&quot; option actually was victorious in the 1988 plebiscite.

After the plebiscite, several [[Constitutional amendment|modifications]] to the Constitution were agreed and subjected to referendum, among them a simplification on the mechanism of future modification.

In 2005 over 50 reforms were approved, which eliminated some of the remaining undemocratic areas of the text, such as the existence of non-elected Senators (appointed senators, or [[senators for life]]) and the inability of the President to remove the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. These reforms led the President to controversially declare Chile's transition to democracy as complete. However, the [[anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorist measures]] of it remained in force.

[[File:Stohrem.jpg|thumb| A crystalline solid: atomic resolution image of [[strontium titanate]]. Brighter atoms are [[Strontium|Sr]] and darker ones are Ti.]]

'''Crystallography''' is the experimental science of the arrangement of [[atom]]s in [[solid]]s. The word &quot;crystallography&quot; derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''crystallon'' = cold drop / frozen drop, with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and ''grapho'' = write.

Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of crystals was based on their geometry. This involves measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to theoretical reference axes ([[crystallographic axes]]), and establishing the [[symmetry]] of the crystal in question. The former is carried out using a [[goniometer]]. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net, e.g. [[Wulff net]] or [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|Lambert net]]. In fact, the [[pole figure|pole]] to each face is plotted on the net. Each point is labelled with its [[Miller index]]. The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established. 

Crystallographic methods now depend on the analysis of the [[diffraction]] patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type.   Although [[X-ray]]s are most commonly used, the beam is not always [[electromagnetic radiation]]. For some purposes [[electron]]s or [[neutron]]s are used.  This is facilitated by the wave properties of the particles. Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of illumination used when referring to a method, as with the terms ''[[X-ray diffraction]], [[neutron diffraction]]'' and ''[[electron diffraction]].'' 

These three types of radiation interact with the specimen in different ways. [[X-ray]]s interact with the spatial distribution of the [[valence electrons]], while [[electron]]s are [[charged particle]]s and therefore feel the total charge distribution of both the [[atomic nuclei]] and the surrounding electrons. [[Neutron]]s are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the [[strong nuclear force]]s, but in addition, the [[magnetic moment]] of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by [[magnetic field]]s. When neutrons are scattered from hydrogen-containing materials, they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels. However, the material can sometimes be treated to substitute [[hydrogen]] for [[deuterium]]. Because of these different forms of interaction, the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies.

==Theory==
{{Condensed matter physics}}


Generally,  an image of a small object is made using a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] to focus the illuminating radiation, as is done with the rays of the [[optical spectrum|visible spectrum]] in light [[microscope|microscopy]]. However, the wavelength of visible light (about 4000 to 7000 [[angstrom]]s) is three [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] longer than the length of typical [[chemical bond|atomic bonds]] and [[atom]]s themselves (about 1 to 2 angstroms). Therefore, obtaining information about the spatial arrangement of atoms requires the use of radiation with shorter wavelengths, such as X-rays or neutrons beam. Employing shorter wavelengths implied abandoning microscopy and true imaging, however, because there exists no material from which a lens capable of focusing this type of radiation can be created. (That said, scientists have had some success focusing X-rays with microscopic [[Fresnel zone plate]]s made from gold, and by critical-angle reflection inside long tapered capillaries.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Synchrotron Radiation
|volume=14|year=2007|pages=326–330|doi=10.1107/S0909049507025174|title=Two-step hard X-ray focusing combining Fresnel zone plate and single-bounce ellipsoidal capillary|author=A. Snigirev ''et al.''|pmid=17587657|issue=Pt 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diffracted x-ray or neutrons beams cannot be focused to produce images, so the sample structure must be reconstructed from the diffraction pattern. Sharp features in the diffraction pattern arise from periodic, repeating structure in the sample, which are often very strong due to coherent reflection of many photons from many regularly spaced instances of similar structure, while non-periodic components of the structure result in diffuse (and usually weak) diffraction features.

Because of their highly ordered and repetitive structure, crystals give diffraction patterns of sharp [[Bragg reflection]] spots, and are ideal for analyzing the structure of solids.

==Notation==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ion implantation]] --&gt;
{{Main|Miller index}}

*Coordinates in ''square [[bracket]]s'' such as '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[100]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' denote a direction vector (in real space).

*Coordinates in ''angle brackets'' or ''chevrons'' such as '''&amp;lt;100&amp;gt;''' denote a ''family'' of directions which are related by symmetry operations. In the cubic crystal system for example, '''&lt;100&gt;''' would mean &lt;nowiki&gt;[100], [010], [001]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or the negative of any of those directions.

*Miller indices in ''parentheses'' such as '''(100)''' denote a plane of the crystal structure, and regular repetitions of that plane with a particular spacing. In the cubic system, the [[surface normal|normal]] to the (hkl) plane is the direction [hkl], but in lower-symmetry cases, the normal to (hkl) is not parallel to [hkl].

*Indices in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{100}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' denote a family of planes and their normals which are equivalent in cubic materials due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions. In non-cubic materials, &lt;hkl&gt; is not necessarily perpendicular to {hkl}.

==Technique==

Some materials studied using crystallography, [[protein]]s for example, do not occur naturally as crystals. Typically, such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to crystallize over days, weeks, or months through vapor [[diffusion]]. A drop of solution containing the molecule, buffer, and precipitants is sealed in a container with a reservoir containing a [[hygroscopic]] solution. Water in the drop diffuses to the reservoir, slowly increasing the concentration and allowing a crystal to form. If the concentration were to rise more quickly, the molecule would simply [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, resulting in disorderly granules rather than an orderly and hence usable crystal.

Once a crystal is obtained, data can be collected using a beam of radiation. Although many universities that engage in crystallographic research have their own X-ray producing equipment, [[Synchrotron light|synchrotron]]s are often used as X-ray sources, because of the purer and more complete patterns such sources can generate. Synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of X-ray beams, so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources. Complementary neutron crystallography techniques are used to enhance hydrogen atoms positions. Such techniques are available in [[Neutron facilities]]. 

Producing an image from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated [[mathematics]] and often an iterative process of '''modelling and refinement.''' In this process, the mathematically predicted diffraction patterns of an hypothesized or &quot;model&quot; structure are compared to the actual pattern generated by the crystalline sample. Ideally, researchers make several initial guesses, which through refinement all converge on the same answer. Models are refined until their predicted patterns match to as great a degree as can be achieved without radical revision of the model. This is a painstaking process, made much easier today by computers. 

The mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to ''patterns,'' which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays. Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals, or to molecules which can be coaxed to crystallize for the sake of measurement. In spite of this, a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from the patterns that are generated by fibers and [[powder diffraction|powders]], which while not as perfect as a solid crystal, may exhibit a degree of order. This level of order can be sufficient to deduce the structure of simple molecules, or to determine the coarse features of more complicated molecules.  For example, the double-helical structure of [[DNA]] was deduced from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample).

==Crystallography in materials engineering==
[[File:Fcc lattice 4.JPG|190px|thumb|An example of a cubic lattice]]
Crystallography is a tool that is often employed by materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. In addition, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding [[crystallographic defect]]s. Mostly, materials do not occur in a single crystalline, but poly-crystalline form, such that the [[powder diffraction]] method plays a most important role in structural determination.

A number of other physical properties are linked to crystallography.  For example, the minerals in [[clay]] form small, flat, platelike structures. Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates, yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates. Such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] measurements.

In another example, [[iron]] transforms from a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) structure to a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) structure called [[austenite]] when it is heated. The fcc structure is a close-packed structure, and the bcc structure is not, which explains why the volume of the iron decreases when this transformation occurs. 

Crystallography is useful in phase identification. When performing any process on a material, it may be desired to find out what compounds and what phases are present in the material. Each phase has a characteristic arrangement of atoms. Techniques like X-ray or [[Neutron_diffraction|neutron]] diffraction can be used to identify which patterns are present in the material, and thus which compounds are present.

Crystallography covers the enumeration of the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal and for this reason has a relation to group theory and geometry. See [[symmetry group]].

==Biology==
[[X-ray crystallography]] is the primary method for determining the molecular conformations of biological [[macromolecule]]s, particularly [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. In fact, the double-helical structure of DNA was deduced from crystallographic data. The first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in 1958 &lt;ref&gt;Kendrew, J.C. et al. (1958) &lt;/ref&gt; A three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by X-ray analysis.&lt;ref&gt;([[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] 181, 662–666). [http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/kendrew/kendrew.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) is a freely accessible repository for the structures of [[protein]]s and other biological macromolecules. Computer programs like [[RasMol]] or [[Pymol]] can be used to visualize biological molecular structures.
[[Neutron crystallography]] is often used to help refine structures obtained by x-ray methods or to solve a specific bond; the methods are often viewed as complementary, as x-rays are sensitive to electron positions and scatter most strongly off heavy atoms, while neutrons are sensitive to nucleus positions and scatter strongly off many light isotopes, including hydrogen and deuterium.
[[Electron crystallography]] has been used to determine some protein structures, most notably [[membrane protein]]s and [[viral capsid]]s.

[[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]] '''Sir Claude John Eyre Auchinleck''', [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|GCIE]], [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (21 June 1884 &amp;ndash; 23 March 1981), nicknamed &quot;[[List of military figures by nickname|The Auk]]&quot;, was a British army commander during [[World War II]]. He was a career soldier who spent much of his military career in [[India]], where he developed a love of the country and a lasting affinity for the soldiers he commanded. In July 1941 he was appointed Commander in Chief of the Middle East theatre; after initial succeses the war in North Africa turned against the British, and he was relieved of the post in 1942 during the crucial Alamein campaign. He served thereafter as C-in-C India until his resignation in 1947. He passed his retirement in [[Marrakesh]], dying there at the age of 96.

==Early life and career==
The Auchinlecks were an [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] family from [[County Fermanagh]], where they had settled in the 17th century. Claude Auchinleck was born in [[Aldershot]], son of Colonel John and Mary Auchinleck, while his father's regiment was stationed there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulsterscotsagency.com/famousulstergenerals.asp Ulster Scot Newsletter: Famous Ulster Generals]&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1892, when he was eight years old, and Auchinleck grew up in impoverished circumstances, but he was able, through hard work and scholarships, to graduate from [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst]]. 

Auchinleck applied to join the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] and, having achieved a qualifying position in the entrance examination joined as an unattached second lieutenant in January 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=27517| date=20 January 1903| startpage=390| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1904 joined the [[62nd Punjabis]]. He was able to learn [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] rapidly and, able to speak fluently with his soldiers, he absorbed a knowledge of local dialects and customs. This familiarity engendered a lasting mutual respect, enhanced by his own personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During [[World War I]], he served in the [[Middle East]] in [[Egypt]], [[Palestine]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Auchinleck's division was the last of four offered by the Indian government and, while en route for France, it was reassigned to defend the [[Suez Canal]] from a potential [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] attack. When the attack occurred in February 1915, Auchinleck's regiment prevented the Turks from crossing the canal and he led a counter-attack which defeated them. The Turks subsequently surrendered.

The [[Indian 6th Infantry Division|6th Indian Division]], of which the 62nd Punjabis were a part, was landed at [[Basra]] on 31 December 1915 for the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]. In July 1916 Auchinleck was promoted Acting Major and made second in command of the regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=30138| startpage=6058| endpage=| date=19 June 1917| Supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; North of Basra, the Punjabis were in heavy action in dreadful conditions: cold, rain and mud as well as determined Turkish defence reduced the regiment to 247 men and Auchinleck took temporary command when his regimental commander was wounded. Further hard fighting ensued: the Turkish army inflicted a humiliating reversal on the British and eventual success was hard won. Auchinleck was [[mentioned in despatches]] and received the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1917 for his service in Mesopotamia, promoted to major in January 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=31123| date=14 January 1919| startpage=719| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also appointed [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] lieutenant-colonel in 1919 for his &quot;distinguished service in Southern and Central Kurdistan&quot; on the recommendation of the C-in-C of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=31777| date=10 February 1920| startpage=1802| endpage=| supp=y| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auchinleck took a number of practical lessons from his experiences in Mesopotamia. Firstly, soldiers' health and well-being was critical to an army's effectiveness and he became convinced of the need of adequate rest, hygiene, good food and medical supplies for the troops. Secondly, he had seen the futility of inadequately prepared attacks against dug-in, well-armed defenders and this fuelled his later reluctance to initiate precipitate actions advocated by his political and military superiors.

Between the wars, Auchinleck served in India. He was both a student and an instructor (1930–1933)&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33604| date=9 May 1930| startpage=2870| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33952| date=23 June 1933| startpage=4206| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College]] at [[Quetta]] and also attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]]. In January 1929 he had been promoted to lieutenant-colonel&lt;ref&gt;{{london Gazette| issue=33475| date=8 March 1929| startpage=1678| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed to command his regiment which had become in the 1923 reorganisation of the [[British Indian Army]] the 1st battalion, [[1st Punjab Regiment]]. In 1930 he was promoted to full colonel, with seniority backdated to 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33600| date=25 April 1930| startpage=2596| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1933, he was appointed temporary brigadier&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33976| date=8 September 1933| startpage=5864| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to command of the [[Peshawar Brigade]], which was active in the pacification of the adjacent tribal areas. A serious operation in the [[Mohmand]] area in 1935, led to the first use of tanks in India. Auchinleck was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] and received the [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]] and [[Order of the Bath|CB]] for his skill in managing the operation.

In November 1935 Auchinleck was promoted to major-general&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34239| date=3 January 1936| startpage=53| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on leaving his brigade command in the following April was on the unemployed list&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34275| date=17 April
1936| startpage=2490| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (on half pay) until September 1936 when he was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff and Director of Staff Duties in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34338| date=6 November 1936| startpage=7127| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this he was appointed to command the Meerut District in India in July 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34536| date=29 July 1938| startpage=4884| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 Major-General Auchinleck was appointed to chair a committee to consider the modernisation, composition and re-equipment of the [[British Indian Army]]. The committee's recommendations formed the basis of the 1939 [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Chatfield Report]] which outlined the transformation of the Indian Army which grew to over 2,250,000 men by the end of the war from 183,000 in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Compton|last= Mackenzie |authorlink=Compton Mackenzie| title=Eastern Epic| publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus, London | year=1951 | pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
===Norway 1940===
On the outbreak of war Auchinleck was appointed to command the [[Indian 3rd Infantry Division]] but in January 1940 was summoned to the United Kingdom to command [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]], the only time in the war that a wholly British corps was commanded by an Indian Army officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead52&quot;&gt;Mead, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1940 Auchinleck took over command of the Anglo-French ground forces in [[Norway]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead52&quot;/&gt; a military operation that was doomed to fail. After the fall of Norway, in July 1940 he briefly commanded [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] before becoming General Officer Commander-in-Chief, [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34902| date=19 July 1940| startpage=4493| endpage=| supp=y| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; where  he had an uneasy relationship with his subordinate [[Bernard Montgomery]], the new V Corps commander. Montgomery later wrote&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Bernard ''Memoirs of a Field Marshal'', p.71&lt;/ref&gt; {{blockquote|&quot;In the 5th Corps I first served under Auchinleck.....I cannot recall that we ever agreed on anything&quot;}}

===India and Iraq January–May 1941===
In January 1941 Auchinleck was recalled to India to become Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] in which position he also was appointed to the Executive Council of the [[Governor-General of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35037| date=7 January 1941| startpage=158| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April appointed [[Aide-de-Camp General|ADC General to the King]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35183| date=6 June 1941| startpage=3243| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ceremonial position he held until January 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37875| date=7 February 1947| startpage=662| endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after his promotion to field marshal.

In April 1941 [[RAF Habbaniya]] was threatened by the new pro-Axis regime of [[Rashid Ali]].  This large Royal Air Force station was west of Baghdad in [[Iraq]] and General [[Archibald Wavell]], C-in-C [[Middle East Command]], was reluctant to intervene, despite the urgings of [[Winston Churchill]], because of his pressing commitments in the Western Desert and Greece.  Auchinleck, however, acted decisively, sending a battalion of the [[King's Own Royal Regiment]] by air to Habbaniya and shipping [[Indian 10th Infantry Division]] by sea to [[Basra]]. Wavell was prevailed upon by London to send ''[[Habforce]]'', a relief column, from the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] but by the time it arrived in Habbaniya on 18 May the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] was virtually over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead53&quot;&gt;Mead, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Africa July 1941-August 1942===
Following the see-saw of Allied and Axis successes and reverses in North Africa, Auchinleck was appointed to succeed General (later Field Marshal) Sir [[Archibald Wavell]] as C-in-C [[Middle East Command]] in July 1941;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35218| date=11 July 1941| startpage=4048| endpage=| supp=y| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wavell took up Auchinleck's post as C-in-C of the Indian Army, swapping jobs with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35247| date=15 August 1941| startpage=4740| supp=| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As C-in-C Middle East Auchinleck, based in [[Cairo]], held responsibility not just for North Africa but also for [[Iran|Persia]] and the Middle East; the [[British Eighth Army|Eighth Army]] confronting the [[Afrika Korps|German Afrika Corps]] and the [[Italian Army]] was commanded successively by Sir [[Alan Gordon Cunningham|Alan Cunningham]] and [[Neil Ritchie]]. The first major offensive by Eighth Army following Auchinleck's appointment, [[Operation Crusader]] in November 1941 resulted in the defeat of much of the British armour and the breakdown of Cunningham. Auchinleck relieved Cunningham, and ordered the battle to continue. Despite heavy losses, the Eighth Army drove the Axis forces back to El Agheila. Auchinleck then appointed Ritchie to command Eighth Army. While Auchinleck resumed overall strategic direction of the Middle East theatre, he continued to dictate operational matters to Ritchie. 

Auchinleck appears to have believed that enemy had been defeated, writing on 12 January 1942 that the Axis forces were &quot;beginning to feel the strain&quot; and were &quot;hard pressed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart46&quot;&gt;Stewart.A, ''The Early Battle of Eighth Army: crusader to the Alamein Line 1941-1942'', p.46&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Afrika Korps had been reinforced, and a few days after Auchinleck's wildly optimistic appreciation, struck at the dispersed and weakened British forces, driving them back to the Gazala positions near [[Tobruk]]. The British Chief of Imperial General staff, [[Alan Brooke]], was compelled to write in his diary that it was &quot;Nothing less than bad generalship on the part of Auchinleck&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB19420130&quot;&gt;Alanbrooke Diaries, 30 January 1942&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rommel]]'s attack at the [[Battle of Gazala]] of 26 May 1942 resulted in a significant defeat for the British. Once more, Auchinleck's appreciation of the situation was faulty (Auchinleck had believed the Axis forces would attack the centre of the British line, whereas Rommel's attack outflanked the British from the south). The Eighth Army retreated into [[Egypt]]; [[Tobruk]] fell on 21 June. 

Once more Auchinleck stepped in to take direct command of the Eighth Army, having lost confidence in Ritchie's ability to control and direct his forces. Auchinleck discarded Ritchie's plan to stand at [[Mersa Matruh]], deciding to fight only a delaying action there, while withdrawing to the more easily defendable position at [[El Alamein]]. Here Auchinleck tailored a defence that took advantage of the terrain and the fresh troops at his disposal, stopping the exhausted German/Italian advance in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. Enjoying a considerable superiority of material and men over the weak German/Italian forces, Auchinleck organised a series of counter-attacks. Poorly conceived and badly coordinated, these attacks achieved little.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr83-184&quot;&gt;Barr.N, ''Pendulum of War: The Three Battles of Alamein'', pp.83-184&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The Auk&quot;, as he was known, appointed a number of senior commanders who proved to be unsuitable for their positions, and command arrangements were often characterised by bitter personality clashes. Auchinleck was an Indian Army officer and was criticised for apparently having little direct experience or understanding of British and Dominion troops. His controversial chief of operations, Major-General [[Eric Dorman-Smith|Dorman-Smith]], was regarded with considerable distrust by many of the senior commanders in Eighth Army. By July 1942 Auchinleck had lost the confidence of Dominion commanders and relations with his British commanders had become strained.{{#tag:ref|Alanbrooke in a footnote to his diary entry of 30 January wrote: &quot;Auchinleck, to my mind, had most of the qualifications to make him one of the finest of commanders, but unfortunately he lacked the most important of all - the ability to select the men to serve him. The selection of Corbett as his Chief of Staff, Dorman-Smith as his chief advisor, and Shearer as his head of intelligence service contributed most of all to his downfall&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AB19420130&quot;/&gt;|group=nb}}

Like his foe Rommel (and his predecessor Wavell and successor Montgomery), Auchinleck was subjected to constant political interference, having to weather a barrage of hectoring telegrams and instructions from Prime Minister Churchill throughout late 1941 and the spring and summer of 1942. Churchill constantly sought an offensive from Auchinleck, and was (understandably) downcast at the military reverses in Egypt and Cyrenaica. Churchill was desperate for some sort of British victory before the planned Allied landings in North Africa, [[Operation Torch]], scheduled for November 1942. He badgered Auchinleck immediately after the Eighth Army had all but exhausted itself after the first battle of El Alamein. Churchill and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, [[Alan Brooke]], flew to Cairo in early August 1942, to meet Auchinleck, but it was now obvious that he had lost the confidence of both men. 

He was replaced as C-in-C [[Middle East Command]] by General Sir [[Harold Alexander]] (later Field Marshal Earl Alexander of Tunis) and as GOC Eighth Army by Lieutenant-General [[William Gott]], who was killed in Egypt before taking up command. On Gott's death,  Lieutenant-General (later Field Marshal Viscount) [[Bernard Montgomery]] was appointed commander of the Eighth Army.

===India 1942-1945===
[[File:AuchinleckNepal.jpg|thumb|200px|Auchinleck receiving the [[Star of Nepal]] in October 1945 from the King of Nepal, Tribhubana Bir Vikram Sah]]Churchill offered Auchinleck command of the newly created [[Persia and Iraq Command]] (this having been hived off Alexander's command), but Auchinleck declined this post, as he believed that separating the area from the Middle East Command was not good policy and the new arrangements would not be workable. He set his reasons out in his letter to the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] dated 14 August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette| issue=38177| date=15 January 1948| startpage=398|endpage=400| supp=Supplement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post was accepted in his stead by General Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]]. Instead he returned to India, where he spent almost a year &quot;unemployed&quot; before in 1943 being again appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette| issue=36133| linkeddate=1943-08-13| startpage=3653|endpage=| supp=| accessdate=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Wavell meanwhile having been appointed [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]]. C-in-C India had become a rear area appointment with the prosecution of the [[Burma Campaign]] the responsibility of the Supreme Commander, Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]]. Nevertheless, Auchinleck played an important role and made the supply of Fourteenth Army, with probably the worst lines of communication of the war, his immediate priority;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead57&quot;&gt;Mead, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; as [[William Slim]], commander of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] was later to write:&lt;ref&gt;Slim, ''Defeat into Victory'', p.176&lt;/ref&gt;{{blockquote|&quot;It was a good day for us when he [Auchinleck] took command of India, our main base, recruiting area and training ground. The Fourteenth Army, from its birth to its final victory, owed much to his unselfish support and never-failing understanding. Without him and what he and the Army of India did for us we could not have existed, let alone conquered&quot;}}

==Role in Partition of India==
Auchinleck continued as Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army after the end of the war&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37586| date=28 May 1946| startpage=2617| endpage| supp=y| accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  helping, though much against his own convictions, to prepare the future Indian and Pakistani armies for the [[Partition of India]] (August 1947). In November 1945 he was forced to commute the sentence of transportation for life awarded to three officers of the [[Indian National Army]] in face of growing unease and unrest both within the Indian population, and the [[British Indian Army]]. In June 1946 he was promoted to field marshal but refused to accept a peerage, lest he be thought associated with a policy (i.e. Partition) that he thought fundamentally dishonourable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead57&quot;/&gt; Having disagreed sharply with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]], the last [[Viceroy of India]], he resigned as C-in-C and retired in 1947.

==Retirement==

Although a somewhat dour character, he was known as a generous and welcoming host. Despite being a general for longer than almost any other soldier, he was never pompous, and hated all forms of display and affectation. Above all, he was a soldier of the utmost integrity, whose reputation, unlike that of many Allied officers, has grown with passing years. 

In 1948 Sir Claude returned to Britain before moving to [[Marrakech]]. There he lived quietly and alone in a modest flat for many years, his wife having left him for Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Richard Peirse]] in 1946, taking his morning coffee at the La Renaissance Café in the new part of the city where he was known by all simply as ''le marechal''. He was befriended and aided by Corporal Malcolm James Millward, a serving soldier in the Queen's Regiment, for three and a half years up until the death of Sir Claude on 23 March 1981 aged 96.  He was buried in Ben M'Sik European Cemetery, [[Casablanca]], in the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] plot in the cemetery, coincidentally next to the grave of [[Raymond Steed]] who was the second youngest non-civilian Commonwealth casualty of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/search/cemetery_details.aspx?cemetery=2022403&amp;mode=1 Cemetery details—Ben M'Sik European Cemetery], [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].

A memorial plaque was erected in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]].  The tour guides relate how in 1979, as plaques for the other great Second World War military leaders were being installed, no one in the establishment had been in contact with his family for some years.  Cathedral officials telephoned to enquire the date of his death only to be told &quot;Auchinleck here - but I won't be keeping you much longer!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Source of quote, Richard Palmer of St Paul's cathedral.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camilla Christine Hall''' (March 24, 1945 - May 17, 1974) was an artist, college trained social worker, and an early member of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]].

==Early life==
[[File:Camilla Hall as a child.jpg|thumb|left|border|225px|Camilla Hall as a child.]]
On March 24, 1945, Camilla Christine Hall was born in [[Saint Peter, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;''O'Brien, Susan. Research Files on Camilla Hall, 1967-1976.'' CAMC Collection 30. Gustavus Adolphus Archives, St. Peter, Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, George and Lorena Hall worked at [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] in [[Saint Peter, Minnesota]]from 1938-1952. In addition, her father was a minister in the [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]], [[Lutheran Church in America]], and later the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]. Her mother, Lorena (Daeschner) Hall, helped found Gustavus Adolphus College's Art Department and served as the department head.&lt;ref name=&quot;gustavus.edu&quot;&gt;Biographical Notes from ''Hall Family. Papers Concerning Camilla Hall and George F. and Lorena Hall, 1938-1995.'' CAMC Collection 13. Gustavus Adolphus College Archives, St. Peter, Minnesota. [http://gustavus.edu/academics/library/archives/CAMC0013.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Camilla Hall was the only surviving child of four; two of her siblings died of a [[kidney]] disorder, Peter and Nan, and a third, Terry, of congenital [[heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Camilla Hall Ends Her Long Journey Home&quot;. ''People'' magazine, August 19, 1974, pp 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien, Susan 1976&quot;&gt;''O'Brien, Susan. Research Files on Camilla Hall, 1967-1976.'' CAMC Collection 30. Gustavus Adolphus Archives, St. Peter, Minnesota. http://gustavus.edu/academics/library/archives/CAMC0030.php&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1952, the Hall family moved to what is now [[Tanzania]] in East Africa. George and Lorena Hall taught in schools and did mission work, while Camilla and Nan played with the native children.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Camilla Hall's Place in the Symbionese Liberation Army'' by Rachel Hanel, Minnesota State University, Mankato, Minnesota 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, when Camilla was nine, the family moved back to Saint Peter, because of seven-year-old Nan's poor health. While Camilla Hall attended elementary school in Minnesota, the family moved to [[Montclair, New Jersey]] until Hall was to start high school.

After moving back to Minnesota, Hall went to [[Washburn High School]] in Minneapolis where she was involved in many activities. The 1963 Washburn Yearbook says, &quot;Candy was a member of Blue Tri, Class Play, Poplars Staff, Quill Club, Forensics, Pep Club, and Hall of Fame&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gustavus.edu&quot;/&gt; Blue Tri club was an organization that encouraged Christian ideals and put together service projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In addition, Camilla Hall was voted class clown in High School.&lt;ref name=&quot;gustavus.edu&quot;/&gt; In 1963, she graduated from Washburn High School.

==College Life==

Then, Camilla Hall attended Gustavus Adolphus College in [[St. Peter, Minnesota]]. She transferred to the University of Minnesota after her freshman year at Gustavus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Hall attended special lectures, exhibits, and concerts at the University(THESIS). On June 10, 1967, Hall graduated with a humanities degree from the University of Minnesota.&lt;ref name=&quot;gustavus.edu&quot;/&gt;

==Post College==

After college graduation, Hall moved to [[Duluth, Minnesota]] where she was a [[Caseworker (social work)|caseworker]] for [[St. Louis County, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Her distrust of the government showed in early 1968 when she was elected to carry the Eugene McCarthy banner, in support of the [[Eugene McCarthy presidential campaign, 1968|Eugene McCarthy Presidential Campaign]], for her St. Louis County precinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Even though Hall enjoyed helping people in her work, she found it difficult to separate her feelings while being a caseworker.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; For her job in Duluth, Minnesota, Hall used her musical and poetic talents in an advertising campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;&quot;Camilla Hall's Place in the Symbionese Liberation Army&quot; by Rachel Hanel, Minnesota State University, Mankato, Minnesota 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June, [[1968]], Hall returned to Minneapolis, Minnesota and worked as a caseworker for the [[Hennepin County, Minnesota]] welfare office in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Co-workers and friends of Hall described her as witty, sympathetic, helpful, and compassionate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Also, she had an outgoing personality and had a passion for literature. At the same time, Hall frequently talked with family and friends about philosophy and how she was disappointed with the state of welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Hall Family. Papers Concerning Camilla Hall and George F. and Lorena Hall, 1938-1995. CAMC Collection 13. Gustavus Adolphus College Archives, St. Peter, Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Hall was 23 years old and carefully monitored the political situation in America, like the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; She was active in the peace movement and food boycotts, including the Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Despite her active participation in urging social change and working as a caseworker, Hall's mother says Camilla became dissatisfied with her work.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==In California==

[[File:Camilla Hall with her art.jpg|thumb|right|border|275px|Camilla Hall with her art.]]
In November 1969, Hall moved to Topanga, a northern suburb of Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In March, she moved into Los Angeles proper in west Los Angeles. According to Rachael Hanel, &quot;She lived off her savings, interest income from a trust, money from her parents, and selling her simple, Rubenesque line drawings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Page 55 in ''Camilla Hall's Place in the Symbionese Liberation Army'' by Rachel Hanel, Minnesota State University, Mankato, Minnesota 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Hall didn't express dissatisfaction as being an artist, she decided to move again.

Hall moved to Berkeley in February 1971. In May 1971, Hall moved into an apartment complex on Channing Way where she met [[Patricia Soltysik]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Previous to this relationship, Hall had not lived publicly in a lesbian relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Patricia Soltysik was the object of Hall's love poem named &quot;Mizmoon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien, Susan 1976&quot;/&gt;

In Berkeley, Hall continued being politically active. She was one of the activists who took over Berkley park in the People's Park demonstration, summer 1972. In October 1972, Hall travelled to Europe and stayed with friends while she traveled for three months. Once she returned, she continued being politically active and was involved with the Symbionese Liberation Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==LA Shootout==

[[Image:Camilla Hall.jpg|thumb|left|border|170px|Camilla Hall takes part in the April 1974 Hibernia bank raid with other Symbionese Liberation Army members.]]
Hall died in a shootout (May 17, 1974) with police in which five other SLA members were killed. As their hideout burned, Hall and fellow SLA member [[Nancy Ling Perry]] exited out of the back door. Police claimed that Perry came out firing a revolver while Hall fired an automatic pistol. Police shot them both immediately. Perry was shot twice; one shot hit her right [[lung]], the other shot severing her [[Vertebral column|spine]]. Hall was shot once in the forehead. Investigators working for Hall's parents claimed that Perry had come walking out of the house intending to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, John.

'''Critical psychology''' is an approach to psychology that takes a [[critical theory]]-based perspective. Critical psychology is aimed at critiquing mainstream [[psychology]] and attempts to apply psychology in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology.  

One of critical psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is how it fails to consider or deliberately ignores the way power differences between social classes and groups can impact the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people.

==Origins==
Criticisms of mainstream psychology consistent with current critical psychology usage have existed since psychology's modern development in the late 19th century. Use of the term &quot;critical psychology&quot; started in the 1970s in Berlin at [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]].  The German branch of critical psychology predates and has developed largely separately from the rest of the field.  As of May 2007, only a few works have been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1992): ''On Doing Psychology Critically''. Theory and Psychology 2, S.193-204; for further references see also Charles Tolman (1994): ''Psychology, Society and Subjectivity: An Introduction to German Critical Psychology'', London: Routledge and Thomas Teo (1998): ''Klaus Holzkamp and the Rise and Fall of German Critical Psychology''. History of Psychology 1998, Vol. 1, Nr. 3; Wolfgang Maiers (1999): ''Critical Psychology - An Unfinished Modern Project''. In: Wolfgang Maiers et al. (Eds.): ''Challenges to Theoretical Psychology'', 457-466&lt;/ref&gt; The German Critical Psychology movement is rooted in the post-war babyboomers' student revolt of the late 60s; see [[German student movement]].  [[Marx]]'s ''[[Critique of Political Economy]]'' played an important role in the German branch of the student revolt, which was centered in [[Berlin]]. Then Berlin was a free city surrounded by communist-ruled [[East Germany]], represented a &quot;hot spot&quot; of political and ideological controversy for the revolting German students. The sociological foundations of critical psychology are decidedly Marxist.

===Klaus Holzkamp===
One of the most important and sophisticated books in the field is the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1983): ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; (''Foundations of Psychology'') by [[Klaus Holzkamp]], who might be considered the theoretical founder of critical psychology. Holzkamp, who had written 2 books on theory of science&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1964), ''Theorie und Experiment in der Psychologie''. Berlin: de Gruyter (''Theory and Experiment in Psychology''); Klaus Holzkamp(1968): ''Wissenschaft als Handlung. Versuch einer neuen Grundlegung der Wissenschaftslehre''. Berlin: de Gruyter (''Science as Action - A new Approach to the Theory of Science'')&lt;/ref&gt; and one on sensory perception&lt;ref name = &quot;ekoart&quot;&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1973): ''Sinnliche Erkenntnis. Historischer Ursprung und gesellschaftliche Funktion der Wahrnehmung''. Frankfurt/M.: Athenäum (''Sensory Perception: Historical Origins and Social Functions of Perception''&lt;/ref&gt; before publishing the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie'' in 1983, thought this major work provided a solid [[paradigm]] for psychological research, as he viewed psychology as a pre-paradigmatic scientific discipline ([[T.S. Kuhn]] had used the term &quot;pre-paradigmatic&quot; for [[social science]]). 

Holzkamp mostly based his sophisticated attempt to provide a comprehensive and integrated set of categories defining the field of psychological research on [[Aleksey Leontyev]]'s approach to [[cultural-historical psychology]] and [[activity theory]]. Leontyev had seen human action as a result of biological as well as cultural evolution and, drawing on Marx's materialist conception of culture, stressed that individual cognition always is part of social action which in turn is mediated by man-made tools (cultural artifacts), language and other man-made systems of symbols, which he viewed as a major distinguishing feature of human culture and, thus, human cognition. Another important source was Lucien Séve's theory of personality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/seve/index.htm Lucien Seve&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which provided the concept of &quot;social activity matrices&quot; as mediating structure between individual and social reproduction. At the same time, the ''Grundlegung'' systematically integrated previous specialized work done at Free University of Berlin in the 70s by critical psychologists who also had been influenced by Marx, Leontyev and Seve. This included books on [[animal behavior]]/[[ethology]],&lt;ref&gt;Volker Schurig (1975): ''Naturgeschichte des Psychischen 1: Psychogenese und elementare Formen der Tierkommunikation''. (''Natural History of the Psyche 1: Psychogenesis and Elementary Forms of Animal Communication''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus; Volker Schurig (1975): ''Naturgeschichte des Psychischen 2: Lernen und Abstraktionsleistungen bei Tieren'' (''Natural History of the Psyche 2: Learning and Abstraction Capabilities in Animals''. Frankfurt/M. Campus; Volker Schurig (1976): ''Die Entstehung des Bewußtseins'' (''The Emergence of Consciousness''). Frankfurt/M.: Campus; . Frankfurt/M.: Campus;&lt;/ref&gt; [[sensory perception]],&lt;ref name = &quot;ekoart&quot;/&gt; [[motivation]]&lt;ref&gt;Ute Osterkamp (1975/1976): ''Grundlagen der Psychologischen Motivationsforschung'' (''Foundations of Psychological Research of Motivation'', Frankfurt/M: Campus (2 Volumes)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Seidel (1976): ''Denken. Psychologische Analyse der Entstehung und Lösung von Problemen''. (''Cognition. Psychological Analysis of Formulating and Solving Problems''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; He also incorporated ideas from Freud's [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] into his approach. 

One core result of Holzkamp's historical and comparative analysis of human reproductive action, perception and cognition is a very specific concept of meaning that identifies symbolical meaning as historically and culturally constructed, purposeful conceptual structures that humans create in close relationship to material culture and within the context of historically specific formations of social reproduction. 

Coming from this phenomenological perspective on culturally mediated and socially situated action, Holzkamp launched a devastating and original methodological attack on behaviorism (which he termed S-R (stimulus-response) psychology) based on linguistic analysis, showing in minute detail the rhetorical patterns by which this approach to psychology creates the illusion of &quot;scientific objectivity&quot; while at the same time losing relevance for understanding culturally situated, intentional human actions.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1987): ''Die Verkennung von Handlungsbegründungen als empirische Zusammenhangsannahmen in sozialpsychologischen Theorien: Methodologische Fehlorientierung infolge von Begriffsverwirrung'' (''Mistaking Reasons for Causes in Theories of Social Psychology:  Methodological Errors as a Result of Conceptual Confusion''), Forum Kritische Psychologie 19, Berlin: Argument Verlag, p. 23-59 and Klaus Holzkamp (1993): ''Lernen: Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus, Chapter 1: &quot;Hinführung auf das Verfahren der Problementwicklung&quot; (''Introduction to the Sequence of Presentation''), pp. 17-39&lt;/ref&gt; Against this approach, he developed his own approach to generalization and objectivity, drawing on ideas from [[Kurt Lewin]] in Chapter 9 of ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''.

His last major publication before his death in 1995 was about learning.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1993): ''Lernen: Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung'' (''&quot;Learning: Subject-Scientific Foundations&quot;''). Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in 1993 and contained a phenomenological theory of learning from the standpoint of the subject. One important concept Holzkamp developed was &quot;reinterpretation&quot; of theories developed by conventional psychology. This meant to look at these concepts from the standpoint of the paradigm of critical psychology, thereby integrating their useful insights into critical psychology while at the same time identifying and criticizing their limiting implications while (which in the case of S-R-psychology were the rhetorical elimination of the subject and intentional action, and in the case of cognitive psychology which did take into account subjective motives and intentional actions, [[methodological individualism]]). The first part of the book thus contains an extensive look at the history of psychological theories of learning and a minute re-interpretation of those concepts from the perspective of the paradigm of critical psychology, which focuses on intentional action situated in specific socio-historical/cultural contexts. The conceptions of learning he found most useful in his own detailed analysis of &quot;classroom learning&quot; came from cognitive anthropologists [[Jean Lave]] ([[situated learning]]) and [[Edwin Hutchins]] ([[distributed cognition]]).  The book's second part contained an extensive analysis on the modern state's institutionalized forms of &quot;classroom learning&quot; as the cultural-historical context that shapes much of modern learning and [[socialization]]. In this analysis, he heavily drew upon [[Michel Foucault]]'s '''''[[Discipline and Punish]]'''''. Holzkamp felt that classroom learning as the historically specific form of learning does not make full use of student's potentials, but rather limits her or his learning potentials by a number of &quot;teaching strategies.&quot; Part of his motivation for the book was to look for alternative forms of learning that made use of the enormous potential of the human psyche in more fruitful ways. Consequently, in the last section of the book, Holzkamp discusses forms of &quot;expansive learning&quot; that seem to avoid the limitations of classroom learning, such as apprenticeship and learning in contexts other than classrooms.   

This search culminated in plans to write a major work on [[life leadership]] in the specific historical context of modern (capitalist) society. Due to his death in 1995, this work never got past the stage of early (and premature) conceptualizations, some of which were published in the journals &quot;Forum Kritische Psychologie&quot; and &quot;Argument&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1995): ''Alltägliche Lebensführung als subjektwissenschaftliches Grundkonzept'' ''(Everyday Life Leadership as Basic Concept of a Scientific Theory of the Subject)''. Das Argument, 37. Jahrgang, Heft 6, November/December 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960 through 1970===
In the 1960s and 1970s the term ''radical psychology'' was used by psychologists to denote a branch of the field which rejected conventional psychology's focus on the individual as the basic unit of analysis and sole source of psychopathology.  Instead, radical psychologists examined the role of society in causing and treating problems and looked towards social change as an alternative to therapy to treat mental illness and as a means of preventing psychopathology.  Within psychiatry the term ''anti-psychiatry'' was often used and now British activists prefer the term ''[[critical psychiatry]]''. ''Critical Psychology'' is currently the preferred term for the discipline of psychology keen to find alternatives to the way the discipline of psychology reduces human experience to the level of the individual and thereby strips away possibilities for radical social change.

===In the 1990s===
Starting in the 1990s a new wave of books started to appear on critical psychology, the most influential being the edited book ''Critical Psychology'' by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky. Various introductory texts to critical psychology written in the United Kingdom have tended to focus on discourse, but this has been seen by some proponents of critical psychology as a reduction of human experience to language which is as politically dangerous as the way mainstream psychology reduces experience to the individual mind.

===Ian Parker===
In 1999 [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]] published an influential manifesto in both the online journal Radical Psychology and the [[Annual Review of Critical Psychology]]. This manifesto argues that Critical Psychology should include the following four components: 
# Systematic examination of how some varieties of psychological action and experience are privileged over others, how dominant accounts of ‘psychology’ operate ideologically and in the service of power;
# Study of the ways in which all varieties of psychology are culturally historically constructed, and how alternative varieties of psychology may confirm or resist ideological assumptions in mainstream models;
# Study of forms of surveillance and self-regulation in everyday life and the ways in which psychological culture operates beyond the boundaries of academic and professional practice; and
# Exploration of the way everyday ‘ordinary psychology’ structures academic and professional work in psychology and how everyday activities might provide the basis for resistance to contemporary disciplinary practices.

===Critical Psychology today===
There are a few international journals devoted to critical psychology, including the no longer published ''International Journal of Critical Psychology'' and the ''Annual Review of Critical Psychology''.  The journals still tend to be directed to an academic audience, though the Annual Review of Critical Psychology runs as an open-access online journal.  There are close links between critical psychologists and critical psychiatrists in Britain through the [http://www.asylumonline.net Asylum Collective].  Critical psychology courses and research concentrations are available at [http://www.psychology.mmu.ac.uk/research/research_discourse.htm Manchester Metropolitan University], [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/schoolsanddivisions/academicschools/socsi/courses/pg/taughtdegrees/critpsych/index.html Cardiff University], the [http://science.uwe.ac.uk/psychology/TheCriticalPsychologyResearchGroup.htm University of the West of England in Bristol], the [http://www.uel.ac.uk/psychology/research/critical.htm University of East London] and the [http://psychology.adelaide.edu.au/psychology/research/daru.html University of Adelaide] and the University of Auckland.

==Extensions==
Like many critical applications, critical psychology has expanded beyond Marxist roots to benefit from other critical approaches.  Consider ecopsychology and [[transpersonal psychology]]. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled [[radical psychology]] and [[liberation psychology]]. In the field of developmental psychology, the work of [[Erica Burman]] has been influential.

Various sub-disciplines within psychology have begun to establish their own critical orientations.  Perhaps the most extensive are [[International Society of Critical Health Psychology|Critical Health Psychology]] and [[Community Psychology]].

== Critical psychology internationally ==
===Germany===
At FU-Berlin, critical psychology was not really seen as a division of psychology and followed its own methodology, trying to reformulate traditional psychology on an unorthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]] base and drawing from Soviet ideas of [[cultural-historical psychology]], particularly [[Aleksey Leontyev]]. Some years ago the department of critical psychology at the FU-Berlin was merged into the traditional psychology department.

An [http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol19/issue2/?etoc April 2009 issue of the Sage journal ''Theory &amp; Psychology''] (edited by Desmond Painter, Athanasios Marvakis, and Leendert Mos) is devoted to an examination of German Critical Psychology.

{{Unreferenced|date=October 2007}}

[[Image:Crossfireguns.svg|thumb|Depiction of crossfire]]A '''crossfire''' (also known as '''interlocking fire''') is a military term for the siting of weapons (often [[automatic weapon]]s such as [[assault rifle]]s or [[sub-machine gun]]s) so that their arcs of fire overlap. This tactic came to prominence in [[World War I]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Siting weapons this way is an example of the application of the defensive principle of ''mutual support''. The advantage of siting weapons that mutually support one another is that it is difficult for an attacker to find a covered approach to any one defensive position.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  

Use of armour, air support, indirect fire support, and stealth are tactics that may be used to assault a defensive position. However when combined with [[land mine]]s, [[sniper]]s, [[barbed wire]], and air cover, crossfire became a difficult tactic to counter in the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Trench warfare==
The tactic of using overlapping arcs of fire came to prominence during World War I where it was a feature of [[trench warfare]]. [[Machine gun]]s were placed in groups, called [[machine-gun nest]]s, and they protected the front of the trenches. Many lives were lost in futile attempts to charge across the [[no man's land]] where these crossfires were set up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==&quot;Caught in the crossfire&quot;==
To be &quot;caught in the crossfire&quot; is an expression that often refers to unintended casualties ([[bystander]]s, etc) who were killed or wounded by being exposed to the gunfire of a battle or gun fight, such as in a position to be hit by bullets of either side.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

'''Cruising''' by boat is a lifestyle that involves living for extended time on a boat while traveling from place to place for pleasure.  Cruising generally refers to trips of a few days or more, and can extend to round-the-world voyages. 
 
== History ==
Boats were almost exclusively used for work prior to the nineteenth century. In 1857, the philosopher [[Henry David Thoreau]], with his book ''Canoeing in Wilderness'' chronicling his canoe voyaging in the wilderness of Maine, was the first to convey the enjoyment of spiritual and lifestyle aspects of cruising.  The concept of cruising for pleasure was popularized in the nineteenth century, by several widely read authors and books:   [[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]], 1866, ''A Thousand Miles in a Rob Roy Canoe'';  [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], 1877, ''An Inland Voyage''; and [[Nathaniel H. Bishop]], 1879, ''Four Months in a Sneakbox''.

[[Image:Dugout in San Blas Islands.jpg|thumb|right|Cruisers can see traditional life in remote areas of the world; here, a [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] paddles a dugout canoe in the [[San Blas Islands]].]]

[[Joshua Slocum]] was one of the first people to carry out a long-distance sailing voyage for pleasure, [[circumnavigation|circumnavigating]] the world between 1895 and 1898.  Despite opinion that such a voyage was impossible and his having retired, Slocum rebuilt a derelict {{convert|37|ft|m|sing=on}} sloop ''Spray'' and sailed her [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] around the world.  His book ''Sailing Alone Around the World'' is a classic adventure, and inspired many others to take to the seas.&lt;ref&gt;''Sailing Alone Around the World'', Captain Joshua Slocum; Sheridan House, 1954. ISBN 0-911378-20-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cruising authors have provided both inspiration and instruction to prospective cruisers.  Key among these during the post World War II period are Electa and [[Irving Johnson]], [[Miles and Beryl Smeeton]], [[Bernard Moitessier]], [[Peter Pye]], and Eric and Susan Hiscock. During the 1970s - 1990s [[Robin Lee Graham]], [[Lin and Larry Pardey]], [[Annie Hill]], Herb Payson, Linda and Steve Dashew, Margaret and [[Hal Roth]], and Beth Leonard &amp; [[Evans Starzinger]] have provided inspiration for people to set off voyaging.

The dawn of the personal web page in the 1990s, and more recently the blog site spawned thousands of cruising websites detailing the adventures of cruising sailors around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanjoanhere.com Cruising Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  These provide both a means for cruising sailors to stay in touch with families and loved ones and equally serve to propagate the lifestyle and share information between cruisers and 'want-to-be' cruisers.

The development of ocean crossing rallies, most notably the ARC ([[Atlantic Rally for Cruisers]]), have encouraged less experienced sailors to undertake ocean crossings.  These rallies provide a group of sailors crossing the same ocean at the same time with safety inspections, weather information and social functions. But there are very mixed feelings among the cruising community about the effect of these rallies. There are concerns that they lower the level of self-sufficiency and seamanship and create social clique which divide the community.

==Types of boats used==
Cruising is done on both [[sailboat|sail]] and [[motorboat|power]] boats, although sail predominates over longer distances, as ocean-going power boats are considerably more expensive to purchase and operate. The size of the typical cruising boat has increased over the years and is currently in the range of 10 to 15 metres although&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yachtcouncil.com/boating-stories.asp?t=stories&amp;news_id=248 Around the world boat yachts and equipment]&lt;/ref&gt; smaller boats have been used in around-the-world trips, but are generally not recommended given the dangers involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dixdesign.com/steward.htm Anthony Steward sailing around the world in small boat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthepresentsea.com/escape.html Webb Chiles giving advice on sailing the globe]&lt;/ref&gt; Many cruisers are &quot;long term&quot; and travel for many years, the most adventurous among them [[Circumnavigation|circle the globe]] over a period of three to ten years. Many others take a year or two off from work and school for shorter trips and the chance to experience the cruising lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnianddavid.com Our year of adventure]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cruise Lines==
A company or corporation works the luxury cruise ships. Cruise companies are thought to possess two reasons. The very first is transportation, and 2nd, the leisure entertainment business.

Besides the administration officials and based employees, cruise line personnel includes the crew, that is headed through the ship’s captain. The ship's crew, performs the technical responsibilities for example operating the ship, engineering,  etc., after which there's a hospitality staff, that is headed by something like a hotel manager.

One of the cruise companies presently operating, a number of them are direct descendants from the traditional passenger shipping lines. Others were one of the original cruising companies established in early 1960’s.

==Sailing near shore and at sea==
Sailing at sea is totally different from sailing near shore. Before embarking on a sea voyage, planning and preparation will include studying charts, almanacs and navigation books and recent weather conditions of the route to be followed. In addition, food needs to be stocked, navigation instruments and the ship itself needs to be revised and the crew needs to be given exact directions on the jobs they need to perform (e.g. the watch; which is generally 4 hours on and 4 hours off, navigation, steering, rigging sails, ...). In addition, the crew needs to be well trained at working together and with the ship in question. Finally, the sailor must be mentally prepared for dealing with harsh situations. An alternative for those people may however be sailing near the coast, which still gives a certain amount of safety. Sailing near the coast can be done as a ship is always granted '[[innocent passage]]' through the country (most countries usually [[Territorial waters|claim up to {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}} off the coast]]). When this method is practiced however, one must still remember that if the ship needs to stop (e.g. for repairs), you will probably first need to go to a customs checkpoint to have your [[passport]] checked.

== Equipment ==
Cruisers use a variety of equipment and techniques to make their voyages possible, or simply more comfortable. 
The use of wind vane [[Self-steering gear|self steering]] was common on long distance cruising yachts but is increasingly being supplemented or replaced by electrical auto-pilots.

[[Image:Solar panels on yacht at sea.jpg|thumb|right|The solar panels on this {{convert|28|ft|m|sing=on}} yacht can keep her self-sufficient in electrical power.]]

Though in the past many cruisers had no means of generating electricity on board and depended on kerosene and dry-cell batteries, today electrical demands are much higher and nearly all cruisers have electrical devices such as lights, communications equipment and refrigeration.  Although most boats can generate power from their inboard engines, an increasing number carry auxiliary generators. Carrying sufficient fuel to power engine and generator over a long voyage can be a problem, so many cruising boats are equipped with other ancillary generating devices such as [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, [[wind turbine]]s and towed turbines.

Satellite communications are becoming more common on cruising boats.  Many boats are now equipped with [[satellite telephone]] systems; however, these systems can be expensive to use, and may operate only in certain areas. Many cruisers still use [[High frequency|short wave]] maritime [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] and [[amateur radio]], which has no running costs. These radios provide two-way voice communications, can receive weather fax graphics or GRIB files via a laptop computer, and with a compatible modem (e.g. [[PACTOR]]) can send and receive email at very slow speed. Such emails are usually limited to basic communication using plain text, without [[HTML]] formatting or attachments.

Awareness of impending weather conditions is particularly important to cruising sailors who are often far from safe harbours and need to steer clear of dangerous weather conditions.  Most cruising boats are equipped with a barometer or a weather station that records barometric pressure as well as temperature and provides rudimentary forecasting.  For more sophisticated weather forecasting, cruisers rely on their ability to receive forecasts by radio, phone or satellite.  

Cruisers navigate using paper charts and [[radar]].  Modern yachts are often also equipped with a [[chartplotter]] which enables the use of electronic charts and is linked to [[GPS]] satellites that provide position reports.  Some chartplotters have the ability to interface charts and radar images.  Those that still wish to work with traditional charts as well as with GPS may do so using a [[Yeoman Plotter]]. Certain advanced sailing vessels have a completely [[automated sailing system]] which includes a plotter, as well as course correcting through a link with the ship's steering organs (e.g. sails, propeller). One such device can be found at the [[The Maltese Falcon (yacht)|Maltese Falcon]]. 

[[Watermaker]]s which turn seawater into potable water are increasingly common on ocean-crossing yachts.

==Cost==
Purchasing and maintaining a yacht can be costly. Most cruising sailors do not own a house and consider their boat their home during the duration of their cruise. Many cruisers find they spend, on average, 4% of their boat's purchase price annually on boat maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yachtsurvey.com/boatbuying.htm Costs of boats and maintenance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like living a conventional life on land, the cost of cruising is variable. How much you end up spending depends largely on your spending habits (do you eat out a lot and frequent marinas, or do you prepare local foods aboard and anchor out?) and the size and condition of your boat (larger boats are more expensive to maintain because their systems are larger and more expensive). Cruisers rarely ask this question, because they already know the answer to how much they are spending. It is want-to-be cruisers who are most eager to know the cost of living the dream. Probably the best way to approximate how much cruising will cost you is to look at the actual costs of cruisers out there today and determine from that information how much you are likely to spend. The following blogs by active cruisers feature detailed accountings of monthly expenditures:

An alternative solution is to [[Boat sharing|sail on someone else's yacht]]. This may be done by working on the boat as an extra crewmember, yet can still be quite costly. Finding a yacht may be done by a [[yacht club|yachting club]] or through a crew finder website.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Safety ==
Travel by water brings hazards: collision, weather, and equipment failure can lead to dangerous situations such as a sinking or severely disabled and dangerous vessel.  For this reason many long distance cruising yachts carry with them emergency equipment such as [[SART]]s, [[EPIRB]]s and [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|liferaft]]s.

Medical emergencies are also of concern, as a medical emergency can occur on a long passage when the closest port is over a week away.  For this reason before going cruising many people go through first aid training and carry medical kits.

== Other kinds of maritime cruising ==
*'''Camp cruising''', also known as '''beach cruising''' or '''gunkhole cruising''', is a form of cruising in which sailors sail from point to point in an open or semi-enclosed boat, generally remaining within sight of land.  Camp cruisers either camp ashore (&quot;camp cruising&quot; or &quot;beach cruising&quot;), or aboard the boat at anchor.  The boats used may be specialized cruising [[dinghies]], small [[keelboats]], [[trailer sailer]]s or general purpose daysailing or racing boats pressed into service for the purpose.

*'''Daysailing''' is recreational sailing that does not involve [[Dinghy racing|racing]] or cruising.   Many [[Dinghy racing|racers]] refer to all non-racers as &quot;cruisers,&quot; including [[Dinghy sailing|dinghy]] and small keelboat sailors who primarily focus on daysailing.

*Travel on '''[[cruise ship]]s''' may be referred to as ''cruising''. Those who take frequent cruise ship vacations may be called ''cruisers''.

* '''Expedition cruising''', where the trips can be a combination of scientists working and tourists along for the adventure, or where scientists lead a group of tourists in order for the tourists to observe animals, plants or natural phenomena.

'''Cavitation''' is the formation of empty cavities in a liquid by high forces and the immediate implosion of them. (A liquid is a continuum and repairs itself if it is torn apart.) Cavitation occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of pressure causing the formation of cavities in the lower pressure regions of the liquid.

Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some engineering contexts – when entering high pressure areas these bubbles collapse on a metal surface continuously, causing cyclic stressing of the metal surface. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear called cavitation. The most common examples of this kind of wear are pump impellers and bends when a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behaviour: inertial (or transient) cavitation, and non-inertial cavitation.

Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]]. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the vascular tissues of plants. In [[artifact]]s, it can occur in [[control valves]], pumps, propellers and [[impeller]]s.

Non inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.

Since the shock waves formed by cavitation are strong enough to significantly damage moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]].

==Inertial cavitation==
Inertial cavitation was first studied by [[Lord Rayleigh]] in the late 19th century, when he considered the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is termed ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.

Other ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. Vapor gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure cavitation bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid via a rather violent mechanism, which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Inertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a [[Rayleigh]] like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.

The physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid rises above its local ambient pressure and sufficient energy is present to cause the [[phase change]] to a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid.  

In order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation &quot;bubbles&quot; generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed [[Blake's threshold]].

The [[vapour pressure]] here differs from the meteorological definition of vapour pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapour pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapour pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) vapour pressure.

==Noninertial cavitation==
Noninertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.

==Cavitation damage{{anchor|Cavitation erosion}}==
[[Image:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cavitation damage to a [[Francis turbine]].]]

Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency.

When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].

Although the collapse of a cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller or pump's lifetime. 

After a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevasses that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Stachowiak, G.W.; Batchelor, A.W. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Engineering tribology | year=2001 | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann | location=Boston  | isbn=0750673044 | page=525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrodynamic cavitation==
Hydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapour pressure]] of the liquid. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific velocity or by mechanical rotation through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can be created when the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles. 

The process of bubble generation, subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles results in very high energy densities, resulting in very high temperatures and pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; however, by controlling the flow of the cavitation the power is harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapours trapped in the cavitating bubbles {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

Orifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi, because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, has an inherent advantage, over the orifice, that it can generate a higher velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate more number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behaviour in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChe Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641-1648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrodynamic cavitation can improve industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry show higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapours trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P. R. |last2=Kabadi |first2=A. M. |year=2009 |title=A review of applications of cavitation in biochemical engineering/biotechnology |journal=Biochemical Engineering Journal |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=60–72 |doi=10.1016/j.bej.2008.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical engineering applications==
In industry, cavitation is often used to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenize]], or mix and break down, suspended particles in a [[colloidal]] liquid compound such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD). 

Cavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminesence]].

Hydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together. This effect may assist in [[protein folding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/snap.html | work = Sandia National Laboratories | date = 2006-08-02 | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | title = Sandia researchers solve mystery of attractive surfaces }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomedical application==
Cavitation plays an important role for the destruction of [[kidney stone]]s in shock wave [[lithotriptor|lithotripsy]]. Currently, tests are being conducted as to whether cavitation can be used to transfer large molecules into biological [[cell (biology)|cell]]s ([[sonoporation]]). [[Nitrogen cavitation]] is a method used in research to [[lysis|lyse]] cell membranes while leaving organelles intact.
Cavitation plays a key role in non-thermal  non-invasive fractionation of tissue for treatment of a variety of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histotripsy.umich.edu/ University of Michigan. ''Therapeutic Ultrasound Group, Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Michigan''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cavitation also probably plays a role in [[HIFU]], a thermal noninvasive treatment methodology for [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibme.ox.ac.uk/bubl/research/hifu University of Oxford. ''Biomedical Ultrasonics &amp; Biotherapy Laboratory, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrasound is sometimes used to increase bone formation, for instance post-surgical applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physiomontreal.com/Ultrasound.pdf PhisioMontreal Artical &quot;Ultrasound&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ultrasound treatments and/or exposure can create cavitation that can potentially &quot;result in a syndrome involving manifestations of nausea, headache, tinnitus, pain, dizziness, and fatigue.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php Health Canada &quot;Guidelines for the Safe Use of Ultrasound: Part II - Industrial &amp; Commercial Applications - Safety Code 24&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleaning application==
In industrial cleaning applications, cavitation has sufficient power to overcome the particle-to-substrate adhesion forces, loosening contaminants. The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input. This method works by generating controlled acoustic cavitation in the cleaning fluid, picking up and carrying contaminant particles away so that they do not reattach to the material being cleaned.

==Pumps and propellers==
Major places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.

As an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blades move, the lower the pressure around it can become. As it reaches [[vapour pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.

Cavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:

===Suction cavitation===
[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapour at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapour is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.

In automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.

===Discharge cavitation===
Discharge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high [[velocity]]. This velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.

Discharge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.

==Control valves==

Cavitation can occur in [[control valves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136&lt;/ref&gt;  If the upstream pressure is just above the vapour pressure, then it is possible that the pressure will drop below the vapour pressure as the fluid flows through the valve.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then cavitation will occur.

==Cavitation on spillways==
When water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapour pressure of the water and vapour bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into high pressure region the bubble collapses giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.

Experimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water velocities of between 12 to 15&amp;nbsp;m/s, and, up to velocities of 20&amp;nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkart_Rutschmann_1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Vokart, P., and Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors - A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc. Intl. Symp. on Scale Effects in Modelling Hydraulic Structures, IAHR, Esslingen, Germany, H. KOBUS editor, paper 4.5 |year=1984 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When some air is present in the water the resulting mixture is compressible and this damps the high pressure caused 
by the bubble collapses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterka_1953&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Peterka, A.J. |title= The Effect of Entrained Air on Cavitation Pitting.&quot; Joint Meeting Paper, IAHR/ASCE, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Aug. 1953, pp. 507-518 |year=1953 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the velocities near the spillway invert are sufficiently high, aerators (or aeration devices) must be introduced to prevent cavitation. Although these have been installed for some years, the mechanisms of air entrainment at the aerators and the slow movement of the air away from the spillway surface are still challenging.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chanson_1989a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view.php?pid=UQ:9385 Study of Air Entrainment and Aeration Devices], Journal of Hydraulic Research, IAHR, Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 301-319 (ISSN 0022-1686) |year=1989 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chanson_1989b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view.php?pid=UQ:9386 Flow downstream of an Aerator.

The spillway aeration device design is based upon a small deflection of the spillway bed (or sidewall) such as a ramp and offset to deflect the high velocity flow away from the spillway surface. In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.

==Cavitation in engines==
Some larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.

It is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.

From about the 1980s, new designs of smaller petrol ([[gasoline]]) engines also displayed cavitation phenomenon. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapour bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.

==Vascular plants==
Cavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem becomes so great that dissolved air within the water expands to fill either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s. Plants are generally able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve air. For larger plants, they must repair cavitation by importing solutes into the xylem; this causes water to enter as well, which can then redissolve the air. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is clearly audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Deciduous trees shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.

==Marine life==
Just as cavitation bubbles form on a fast-spinning boat propeller, they may also form on the tails and fins of aquatic animals. The effects of cavitation are especially important near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is relatively low and cavitation is more likely to occur. 

For powerful swimming animals like [[dolphins]] and [[tuna]], cavitation may be detrimental, because it limits their maximum swimming speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brahic | first = Catherine | title = Dolphins swim so fast it hurts   | publisher = NewScientist | date = 2008-03-28 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn13553-dolphins-swim-so-fast-it-hurts.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the painful bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create an air film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage. 

Cavitation is not always a limitation for sea life; some animals have found ways to use it to their advantage when hunting prey. The [[pistol shrimp]] snaps a specialized claw to create cavitation, which can kill small fish. The [[mantis shrimp]] (of the ''smasher'' variety) uses cavitation as well in order to stun, smash open, or kill the shellfish that it feasts upon. Their knees do wear out as a result, which is not a problem because the animal [[Moulting|moults]] every three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patek|first=Sheila|title=Sheila Patek clocks the fastest animals|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sheila_patek_clocks_the_fastest_animals.html|publisher=TED|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coastal erosion==
In the last half-decade, coastal erosion in the form of inertial cavitation has been generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Geomorphology |last=Panizza |first=Mario  |year=1996 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam; New York |isbn=0444898301 |pages=112–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Air pockets in an incoming wave are forced into cracks in the cliff being eroded, then the force of the wave compresses the air pockets until the bubble implodes, becoming liquid, giving off various forms of energy that blast apart the rock.

The '''Cyprinodontiformes''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|s|aɪ|p|r|ɨ|n|ɵ|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|t|ɨ|ˈ|f|ɔr|m|iː|z}}) is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], comprising mostly small, fresh-water fish.  Many popular aquarium fish, such as [[killifish]] and [[Poeciliidae|live-bearers]], are included.  They are closely related to the [[Atheriniformes]] and are occasionally included with them.  A colloquial term for the order as a whole is '''toothcarps''', though they are not actually close relatives of the true [[carp]]s &amp;ndash; the latter belong to the [[superorder]] [[Ostariophysi]], while the toothcarps are [[Acanthopterygii]].

The families of Cyprinodontiformes can be divided into three groups: [[Vivipary|viviparous]] and [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] (all species give [[live birth]]), and [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (all species egg-laying). The live-bearing groups differ in whether the young are carried to term within (ovoviviparous) or without (viviparous) an enclosing eggshell. [[Phylogenetical]]ly however, one of the two [[suborders]] &amp;ndash; the [[Aplocheiloidei]] &amp;ndash; contains oviparous species exclusively, as do two of the four [[superfamilies]] of the other suborder (the [[Cyprinodontoidea]] and [[Valencioidea]] of the [[Cyprinodontoidei]]). Vivipary and ovovivipary have [[evolved]] independently from oviparous ancestors, the latter possibly twice.

==Description==
[[Image:Fundulopanchax scheeli.png|thumb|left|''[[Fundulopanchax scheeli]]'', a killifish of the [[Aplocheilidae]].]]
Members of this order are notable for inhabiting harsh environments, such as [[saline water|saline]] or very warm waters, water of poor quality, or isolated situations where no other types of fish occur. They are typically [[omnivore]]s, and often live near the surface, where the oxygen-rich water compensates for environmental disadvantages.

They are small to medium fish, with small mouths, large eyes, a single [[dorsal fin]], and a rounded [[caudal fin]]. The largest species is the cuatro ojos (''[[Anableps dowi]]''), which measures {{convert|34|cm|in}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Anableps+dowi&amp;flags=col3:&amp;res=320&lt;/ref&gt; in length, while the smallest, the least killifish (''[[Heterandia formosa]]''), is just {{convert|8|mm|in}} long as an adult.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. &amp; Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Parenti, Lynne R.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 148–151|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of the Holy Sepulchre''', also called the '''Church of the Resurrection''' by [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]]s, is a  [[Church (building)|church]] within the walled [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]]. It is a few steps away from the [[Muristan]].

The site is venerated as [[Calvary|Golgotha]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-church-of-holy-sepulchre.htm Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (the Hill of Calvary), where [[Jesus]] was [[crucifixion|crucified]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy| wstitle=Holy Sepulchre| title =Holy Sepulchre| first =Arthur .L.| last = McMahon| authorlink = | accessdate =2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is said to also contain the place where Jesus was buried (the [[sepulchre]]). The church has been an important [[Christian pilgrimage]] destination since at least the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], as the purported site of the [[resurrection of Jesus]]. Today it also serves as the headquarters of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], while control of the building is [[Simultaneum|shared between several Christian churches]] and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for centuries. Today, the church is home to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and [[Roman Catholicism]]. [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian]]s have no permanent presence in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-191046_ITM The search for a Protestant Holy Sepulchre: the Garden Tomb in nineteenth-century Jerusalem], The Journal of Ecclesiastical History, April 01, 1995, Kochav, Sarah&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Construction===
In the early 2nd century, the site of the present Church had been a temple of [[Aphrodite]]; several ancient writers alternatively describe it as a temple to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Interpretatio graeca#Roman version|Roman equivalent]] to Aphrodite. [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] claims, in his ''Life of Constantine'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-29.htm#P7646_3165242 NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine | Christian Classics Ethereal Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that the site of the Church had originally been a Christian place of veneration, but that [[Hadrian]] had deliberately covered these Christian sites with earth, and built his own temple on top, due to his hatred for Christianity&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine'', 3:26&lt;/ref&gt; (the authenticity/inaccuracy of this claim is [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#Challenges_to_authenticity|discussed below]]). Although Eusebius does not say as much, the temple of Aphrodite was probably built as part of [[Hadrian]]'s reconstruction of Jerusalem as [[Aelia Capitolina]] in 135, following the destruction of the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] of 70 and [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] of 132–135.

Emperor [[Constantine I]] ordered in about 325/326 that the temple be demolished and the soil - which had provided a flat surface for the temple - be removed, instructing [[Macarius of Jerusalem]], the local Bishop, to build a church on the site. The [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Pilgrim of Bordeaux]] reports in 333: ''There, at present, by the command of the Emperor Constantine, has been built a basilica, that is to say, a church of wondrous beauty''.&lt;ref&gt;''Itinerarium Burdigalense'', page 594&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine directed his mother, [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], to build churches upon sites which commemorated the life of Jesus Christ; she was present in 326 at the construction of the church on the site, and involved herself in the excavations and construction.

During the excavation, Helena is alleged to have rediscovered the [[True Cross]], and a tomb, though Eusebius' account makes no mention of Helena's presence at the excavation, nor of the finding of the cross but only the tomb. According to Eusebius, the tomb exhibited ''a clear and visible proof'' that it was the [[tomb of Jesus]];&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine'', Chapter 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-29.htm#P7655_3169703 NPNF2-01.

Constantine's church was built as two connected churches over the two different holy sites, including a great [[basilica]] (the ''Martyrium'' visited by the nun [[Egeria]] in the 380s), an enclosed [[colonnade]]d [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] (the ''Triportico'') with the traditional site of ''Golgotha'' in one corner, and a [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], called the ''Anastasis'' (&quot;Resurrection&quot;), which contained the remains of a [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut room]] that Helena and Macarius identified as the burial site of Jesus. The rockface at the west end of the building was cut away, although it is unclear how much remained in Constantine's time, as archaeological investigation has revealed that the temple of Aphrodite reached far into the current rotunda area,&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbo&quot;&gt;[[Virgilio Canio Corbo|Virgilio Corbo]], ''The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; and the temple enclosure would therefore have reached even further to the west.

According to tradition, Constantine arranged for the rockface to be removed from around the tomb, without harming it, in order to isolate the tomb; in the centre of the rotunda is a small building called the ''Kouvouklion'' (Kουβούκλιον; Modern Greek for small compartment) or ''Aedicule''&lt;ref&gt;Americans spell this as ''Edicule''&lt;/ref&gt; (from Latin: ''aediculum'', small building), which supposedly encloses this tomb, although it is not currently possible to verify the claim, as the remains are completely enveloped by a marble sheath. The discovery of the [[kokhim]] tombs just beyond the west end of the Church, and more recent archaeological investigation of the rotunda floor, suggest that a narrow [[Spur (mountain)|spur]] of at least ten yards length would have had to jut out from the rock face if the contents of the Aedicule were once inside it. The [[dome]] of the rotunda was completed by the end of the 4th century.

Each year, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates the anniversary of the [[consecration]] of the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) on September 13 (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], September 13 currently falls on September 26 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]).

===Damage and destruction===
[[Image:Anastasia Rotonda 4th century floor plan 2.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the site in the 4th Century]]

This building was damaged by fire in 614 when the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]] under [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrau II]] invaded Jerusalem and captured the Cross. In 630, Emperor [[Heraclius]] marched triumphantly into Jerusalem and restored the [[True Cross]] to the rebuilt Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Under the [[Jerusalem#Arab Caliphates.2C Christian Crusaders.2C and early Ottoman rule .28638-1800s.29|Muslims]] it remained a Christian church. The early Muslim rulers protected the city's Christian sites, prohibiting their destruction and their use as living quarters. In 966 the doors and roof were burnt during a riot.

On October 18, 1009, under [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], orders for the complete destruction of the Church were carried out. It is believed that Al-Hakim &quot;was aggrieved by the scale of the [[Easter]] pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which was caused specially by the annual miracle of the [[Holy Fire]] within the Sepulchre. The measures against the church were part of a more general campaign against Christian places of worship in Palestine and Egypt, which involved a great deal of other damage: Adhemar of Chabannes recorded that the church of St George at [[Lod|Lydda]] 'with many other churches of the saints' had been attacked, and the 'basilica of the Lord's Sepulchre destroyed down to the ground'. ...The Christian writer Yahya ibn Sa'id reported that everything was razed 'except those parts which were impossible to destroy or would have been too difficult to carry away'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's foundations were hacked down to bedrock. The Edicule and the east and west walls and the roof of the cut-rock tomb it encased were destroyed or damaged (contemporary accounts vary), but the north and south walls were likely protected by rubble from further damage. The &quot;mighty pillars resisted destruction up to the height of the gallery pavement, and are now effectively the only remnant of the fourth-century buildings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot; /&gt;   Some minor repairs were done to the section believed to be the tomb of Jesus almost immediately after 1009, but a true attempt at restoration would have to wait for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot;/&gt;

European reaction was of shock and dismay, with far-reaching and intense consequences.  For example, [[Abbey of Cluny|Clunaic]] [[monk]] [[Raoul Glaber]] blamed the [[Jew]]s, with the result that Jews were expelled from [[Limoges]] and other [[France|French]] towns. Ultimately, this destruction provided an impetus to the later [[Crusade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Bokenkotter |2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
In wide ranging negotiations between the Fatimids and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1027-8 an agreement was reached whereby the new Caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]] (Al-Hakim's son) agreed to allowing the rebuilding and redecoration of the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev 1991&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lev|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding was finally completed with the financing of the huge expense by Emperor [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] and Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople in 1048.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foakes-Jackson|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a concession, the mosque in [[Constantinople]] was re-opened and sermons were to be pronounced in az-Zahir's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev 1991&quot;/&gt; Muslim sources say a by-product of the agreement was the recanting of Islam by many Christians who had been forced to convert under Al-Hakim's persecutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev 1991&quot;/&gt; In addition the Byzantines, while releasing 5,000 Muslim prisoners, made demands for the restoration of other churches destroyed by Al-Hakim and the re-establishment of a [[Patriarch]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev 1991&quot;/&gt; Contemporary sources credit the emperor with spending vast sums in an effort to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after this agreement was made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev 1991&quot;/&gt; Despite the Byzantines spending vast sums on the project, &quot;a total replacement was far beyond available resources. The new construction was concentrated on the rotunda and its surrounding buildings: the great basilica remained in ruins.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot;/&gt;   The rebuilt church site consisted of &quot;a court open to the sky, with five small chapels attached to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fergusson|1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapels were &quot;to the east of the court of resurrection, where the wall of the great church had been. They commemorated scenes from the passion, such as the location of the prison of Christ and of his flagellation, and presumably were so placed because of the difficulties for free movement among shrines in the streets of the city. The dedication of these chapels indicates the importance of the pilgrims' devotion to the suffering of Christ. They have been described as 'a sort of [[Via Dolorosa]] in miniature'...&amp;nbsp;since little or no rebuilding took place on the site of the great basilica. Western pilgrims to Jerusalem during the eleventh century found much of the sacred site in ruins.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot;/&gt;   Control of Jerusalem, and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, continued to change hands several times between the Fatimids and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] (loyal to the [[Abbasid]] caliph in [[Baghdad]]) until the arrival of the Crusaders in 1099.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gold|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusader period===
[[Image:Prise de Jérusalem par les Croisés, le 15 juillet 1099 Emil Signol, Musée du Château Versailles.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The capture of [[Jerusalem]] by the [[Crusaders]] on 15 July 1099&lt;br /&gt;1. The Holy Sepulcher&lt;br /&gt; 2. The [[Dome of the Rock]]&lt;br /&gt; 3. Ramparts]]
Many historians still maintain that the main concern of Pope [[Urban II]], when calling for the [[First Crusade]], was the threat to Constantinople from the Turkish invasion of Asia Minor in response to the appeal of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Still, historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was of concern if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abassids) by the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]] on 15 July 1099.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Crest of holy sepulchre.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Arms of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]]]]
The First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. Crusader Prince [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who became the first [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader monarch of Jerusalem]], decided not to use [[King of Jerusalem|the title &quot;king&quot;]] during his lifetime, and declared himself ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (''Protector (or Defender) of the Holy Sepulchre''). By the crusader period, a [[cistern]] under the former basilica was rumoured to have been the location that Helena had found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; although the cistern later became the ''Chapel of the Invention of the Cross'', there is no evidence for the rumour prior to the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to the 11th century repairs by Monomachos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbo&quot; /&gt;

The chronicler [[William of Tyre]] reports on the renovation of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the original ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they decided to transform this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]]), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style and added a bell tower. These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarchs]], and was also the site of the kingdom's [[scriptorium]]. The church was lost to [[Saladin]], along with the rest of the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the [[Third Crusade]] allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century, while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, leading to the curious result of the holiest church in Christianity being laid under [[Interdict (Roman Catholic Church)|interdict]]. Both city and church were captured by the [[Khwarezm]]ians in 1244.

===Later periods===

[[Image:ChurchOfTheHolySepulcher1885.png|left|thumb|Church of the Holy Sepulchre (1885). Other than some restoration work, its appearance has essentially not changed since 1854. The same small ladder below the top-right window is also visible in recent photographs; this has remained in the same position since 1854 over a disagreement to move it.]]
The [[Franciscan]] friars renovated it further in 1555, as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. The Franciscans rebuilt the Aedicule, extending the structure to create an ante-chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy56&quot;&gt;[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], ''The Holy Land'', (2008), page 56&lt;/ref&gt; After the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favorable ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' from the ''[[Sublime Porte]]'' at a particular time, often through outright bribery, and violent clashes were not uncommon. There was no agreement about this question, although it was talked about it at the negotiations to the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Geschichte der europäischen Staaten, Geschichte des östreichischen Kaiserstaates, János Nepomuk Jozsef Mailáth (gróf), Band 4, Seite 262, F. Perthes, Hamburg 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, weary of the squabbling, the ''Porte'' issued a ''firman'' that divided the church among the claimants.

A fire severely damaged the structure again in 1808, causing the dome of the Rotunda to collapse and smashing the Edicule's exterior decoration. The Rotunda and the Edicule's exterior were rebuilt in 1809–1810 by architect Komminos of [[Mytilene]] in the then current Ottoman [[Baroque]] style. The fire did not reach the interior of the Aedicule, and the marble decoration of the Tomb dates mainly to the 1555 restoration, although the interior of the ante-chamber, now known as the ''Chapel of the Angel'', was partly re-built to a square ground-plan, in place of the previously semi-circular western end.  Another [[firman (decree)|decree]] in 1853 from the sultan solidified the existing territorial division among the communities and set a ''[[status quo]]'' for arrangements to &quot;remain forever&quot;, caused differences of opinion about upkeep and even minor changes, including disagreement on the removal of an exterior ladder under one of the windows; this ladder has remained in the same position since then.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/sepulchre.shtm The Church of the Holy Sepulchre:A Work in Progress&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Floorplan of the CotHS.JPG|thumb|right|The church, after its 1808 restoration.]]
The cladding of red marble applied to the Aedicule by Komminos has deteriorated badly and is detaching from the underlying structure; since 1947 it has been held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate]]. No plans have been agreed upon for its renovation.

The current dome dates from 1870, although it was restored during 1994–1997, as part of extensive modern renovations to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which have been ongoing since 1959. During 1973–1978 restoration works and excavations inside the building, and under the nearby Muristan, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white ''[[meleke]]'' [[limestone]] was struck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesemann170&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Michael|last=Hesemann|title=Die Jesus-Tafel|publisher=Freiburg|year=1999|pages=170|isbn=3-451-27092-7}} {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the east of the ''Chapel of St. Helena'', the excavators discovered a void containing a 2nd century drawing of a roman ship,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091028063401/http://www.geocities.com/jim_lancaster.geo/ship_drawing.jpg]{{Citation broken|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; two low walls which supported the platform of Hadrian's 2nd century temple, and a higher 4th century wall built to support Constantine's basilica;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], ''The Holy Land'', (1998), page 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;the height difference can be easily seen - [http://web.archive.org/web/20091028063409/http://www.geocities.com/jim_lancaster.geo/chapel.jpg the yellowish wall on the left is the 4th century wall, the pinkish wall on the right is the 2nd century wall]&lt;/ref&gt; the Armenian authorities have recently{{when|date=January 2011}} converted this archaeological space into the ''Chapel of [[Vartan Mamikonian|Saint Vartan]]'', and created an artificial walkway over the quarry on the north of the chapel, so that the new Chapel could be accessed (by permission) from the ''Chapel of St. Helena''.

There was some controversy in 2010, when the Jerusalem City Council threatened to cut off water to the site due to disputed water bills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Israel-threatens-to-cut-off-water-supply-to-Church-of-the-Holy-Sepulchre-19074.html Israel threatens to cut off water supply to Church of the Holy Sepulchre], AsiaNews.it&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern arrangement of the church==
[[File:Anastasia Rotonda sketch 1.svg|right|thumb|400px|Floor plan of the present church]]
The entrance to the church is through a single door in the south [[transept]]. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death. In 1999 the communities agreed to install a new exit door in the church, but there was never any report of this door being completed.

===Calvary (Golgotha)===
[[File:Jerusalem Holy Sepulchre BW 4.JPG|The Altar of the Crucifixion. There, according to the tradition, Jesus was crucified.|thumb|left]]
[[File:Cracked rock at Church Holy Sepulchre .JPG|'''The Rock of Calvary''' seen under glass.|thumb|right]]
On the south side of the altar via the [[ambulatory]](an aisle surrounding the end of the choir or chancel of a church)is a stairway climbing to '''Calvary (Golgotha)''', traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The main altar there belongs to the Greek Orthodox, which contains '''The Rock of Calvary''' (12th Station of the Cross). The rock can be seen under glass on both sides of the altar, and beneath the altar there is a hole said to be the place where the cross was raised. The Roman Catholics ([[Franciscan]]s) have an altar to the side, '''The Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross''' (11th Station of the Cross). On the left of the altar, towards the Eastern Orthodox chapel, there is a statue of Mary, believed to be working wonders (the 13th Station of the Cross, where Jesus' body was removed from the cross and given to his family).

Beneath the Calvary and the two chapels there, on the main floor, there is '''The Chapel of Adam'''. According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried. The Rock of Calvary is seen cracked through a window on the altar wall, the crack traditionally being said to be caused by the earthquake that occurred when Jesus died on the cross, and being said by more critical scholars to be the result of quarrying against a natural flaw in the rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080524035048/http://monastery.org/sephist.html] (archived from [http://www.holyplacesinisrael.com/church_holy_sepulchre.html the original])&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stone of Anointing===
[[Image:Holy sepulchre stone of the anoiting.jpg|thumb|The Stone of the Anointing.]]
[[File:Christ after death,photo Jerusalam.JPG|thumb|Painting of Christ after death, opposite the stone of Anointing]]
Just inside the entrance is '''The Stone of Anointing''', also known as '''The Stone of Unction''', which tradition claims to be the spot where Jesus' body was prepared for burial by [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. However, this tradition is only attested since the crusader era, and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy56&quot; /&gt; The wall behind the stone was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; the wall blocks the view of the rotunda, sits on top of the graves of four 12th century kings, and is no longer structurally necessary. There is a difference of opinion as to whether it is [[Stations of the Cross|the 13th Station of the Cross]], which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and locate between the 11th and 12th station up on Calvary. The lamps that hang over the stone are contributed by Armenians, Copts, Greeks and Latins.

===The Rotunda and the Aedicule===
'''The [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]]''' is located in the centre of the Anastasis, beneath the larger of the church's two domes. In the centre of the Rotunda is the chapel called '''The Edicule''', which  contains the Holy Sepulchre itself. The Edicule has two rooms. The first one holds '''The Angel's Stone''', a fragment of the stone believed to have sealed the tomb after Jesus' burial. The second one is the tomb itself.

====The Status Quo in the Rotunda====
Under the ''[[status quo]]'' the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] or Holy [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the [[Holy Saturday]] ceremony of the [[Holy Fire]] celebrated by the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]]. To its rear, within a chapel constructed of iron [[latticework]] upon a stone base semicircular in plan, lies the altar used by the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic Orthodox]].

&lt;gallery widths=&quot;150px&quot; heights=&quot;150px&quot; perrow=&quot;4&quot;&gt;

File:Ikons In Tomb Of Jesus.jpg|The Icons in Jesus' Tomb
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Beyond that to the rear of the Rotunda is a very rough hewn chapel, containing an opening to a rock-cut chamber, from which several [[kokhim|kokh]]-tombs radiate. Although this space was discovered comparatively recently, and contains no identifying marks, many Christians believe it to be '''the tomb of [[Joseph of Arimathea]]''' in which the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays. To the right of the sepulchre on the southeastern side of the Rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition which is reserved for Roman Catholic use.

===The Catholicon and the Ambulatory===
* '''The Catholicon''' - On the east side opposite the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today ''the Greek Orthodox [[catholicon]]''. The second, smaller dome sits directly over the centre of the [[crossing (architecture)|transept crossing]] of the [[quire (architecture)|choir]] where the ''compas'', an '''[[omphalos]]''' once thought to be the centre of the world (associated to the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection), is situated. East of this is a large [[iconostasis]] demarcating the Orthodox sanctuary before which is set the  throne of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] on the south side facing the throne of the Greek Orthodox [[Patriarch of Antioch]] on the north side.

[[Image:Church of the Holy Sepulchre-08-Prison of Christ.jpg|thumb|The &quot;Holy Prison&quot;, or Prison of Christ]]
* '''Prison of Christ''' - In the north-east side of the complex there is ''The Prison of Christ'', alleged by the Franciscans to be where Jesus was held. The Greek Orthodox allege that the real place that Jesus was held was the similarly named ''Prison of Christ'', within their ''Monastery of the Praetorium'', located near the [[Ecce Homo (church)|Church of Ecce Homo]], at the ''first station'' on the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The Armenians regard a recess in the ''Monastery of the Flagellation'', a building near the ''second station'' on the Via Dolorosa, as the ''Prison of Christ''. A cistern among the ruins near the [[Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu]] is also alleged to have been the ''Prison of Christ''.

Further to the east in the ambulatory are three chapels (from south to north):
* '''Greek Chapel of St. Longinus''' -  The Orthodox Greek chapel is dedicated to St. Longinus, a Roman soldier which according the [[New Testament]] pierced Jesus with a spear.
* '''Armenian Chapel of Division of Robes''' -
* '''Greek Chapel of the Derision''' - the southernmost chapel in the ambulatory.

===Armenian compound===
[[Image:Church of the Holy Sepulchre-07-St Helen Chapel.jpg|200px|right|thumb|St. Helena's Chapel]]
[[Image:Dome of the Holy Sepulchre.jpg|thumb|280px|left|The &quot;Pantokrator&quot; mosaic in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre]]
* '''The Chapel of St. Helena''' - between the first two chapels are stairs descending to [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|''The Chapel of St. Helena'']], belonging to the Armenians.
* '''Chapel of [[Mamikonian#Vartan_Mamikonian|St. Vartan]]''' - on the north side of the Chapel of St. Helena is an ornate [[wrought iron]] door, beyond which a raised artificial platform affords views of the '''[[Quarry]]''', and which leads to the ''Chapel of [[Mamikonian#Vartan_Mamikonian|St. Vartan]]''. The latter Chapel contains archaeological remains from Hadrian's temple and Constantine's basilica. These areas are usually closed.
* '''Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross''' - another set of 22 stairs from the Chapel of St. Helena leads down to the Roman Catholic ''Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross'' believed to be the place where the [[True Cross]] was found.

===North of the Aedicule===
* '''Chapel of Mary Magdalene''' - The chapel indicates the place where [[Mary Magdalene]] met Jesus after his resurrection.
* '''The Franciscan Church''' -

===South of the Aedicule===
The three Greek Orthodox chapels of [[St. James the Just]], [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]], south of the rotunda and on the west side of the front courtyard originally formed the [[baptistery]] complex of the Constantinean church, the southern most chapel being the vestibule, the middle chapel being the actual [[baptistery]] and the north chapel being the chamber in which the patriarch [[chrism]]ated the newly baptized before leading them into the rotunda north of this complex.

===The roof of the church===
One can access to the roof of the church from the courtyard of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]].

==Status quo==
[[Image:Holy sepulchre ladder.jpg|thumb|right|The immovable ladder. Detail from photograph of main entrance above, 2005]]
[[Image:Catholic monks in Jerusalem 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franciscans]] during the procession on The Calvary, 2006]]

The primary custodians are the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Churches, with the Greek Orthodox Church having the lion's share. In the 19th century, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures within and around the building. Times and places of worship for each community are strictly regulated in common areas.

Establishment of the 1853 status quo did not halt the violence, which continues to break out every so often even in modern times. On a hot summer day in 2002, a Coptic monk moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians, and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fracas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/129/52.0.html Christian History Corner: Divvying up the Most Sacred Place | Christianity Today | A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In another incident in 2004 during Orthodox celebrations of the [[Feast of the Cross|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out. Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,1314466,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Punch-up at tomb of Jesus | date=September 28, 2004 | accessdate=April 18, 2010 | first=Allyn | last=Fisher-Ilan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Palm Sunday]], in April 2008, a brawl broke out when a Greek [[monk]] was ejected from the building by a rival faction. Police were called to the scene but were also attacked by the enraged brawlers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/976409.html Armenian, Greek worshippers come to blows at Jesus' tomb - Haaretz - Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A clash erupted between Armenian and Greek monks on Sunday 9 November 2008, during celebrations for the [[Feast of the Holy Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Times Online|date=November 10, 2008|title=Riot police called as monks clash in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5121217.ece|accessdate=2008-11-11 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1035666.html|date=10/11/2008|title=Once again, monks come to blows at Church of Holy Sepulcher|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ''status quo'', no part of what is designated as common territory may be so much as rearranged without consent from all communities. This often leads to the neglect of badly needed repairs when the communities cannot come to an agreement among themselves about the final shape of a project. Just such a disagreement has delayed the renovation of the ''[[edicule]]'', where the need is now dire, but also where any change in the structure might result in a change to the ''status quo'' disagreeable to one or more of the communities.

A less grave sign of this state of affairs is located on a window ledge over the church's entrance. Someone placed a wooden ladder there sometime before 1852, when the ''status quo'' defined both the doors and the window ledges as common ground. The ladder remains there to this day, in almost exactly the same position it can be seen to occupy in century-old photographs and engravings.&lt;ref&gt;http://coastdaylight.com/ladder.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An unusual and rare location of the ladder was documented by an Israeli tour guide in February 2009 [http://www.dannythedigger.com/newsletter/who-moved-thy-ladder]&lt;/ref&gt;

No controls the main entrance. In 1192, [[Saladin]] assigned responsibility for it to two neighboring Muslim families. The [[Joudeh]] were entrusted with the key, and the [[Nusseibeh]], who had been the custodians of the church since the days of [[Caliph Omar]] in 637, retained the position of keeping the door. This arrangement has persisted into modern times. Twice each day, a Joudeh family member brings the key to the door, which is locked and unlocked by a Nusseibeh.

==Challenges to authenticity==
===Relationship to the Temple of Aphrodite===
[[File:Roman Jerusalem.PNG|thumb|right|Jerusalem after being rebuilt by Hadrian. Two main east-west roads were built rather than the typical one, due to the awkward location of the Temple Mount, blocking the central east-west route]]
As noted above, the site had been a temple of Aphrodite prior to Constantine's aedifice being built, a detail that Christian tradition puts down to Hadrian deliberately siting the temple over Jesus' tomb as a slight against Christianity. However, Hadrian's temple had actually been located there simply because it was the junction of the [[Cardo|main north-south road]] (which is now the Suq Khan-ez-Zeit) with one of the two [[Decumanus Maximus|main east-west roads]] (which is now the [[Via Dolorosa]]),{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} and directly adjacent to the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (which is now the location of the (smaller) [[Muristan]]); the forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the (other) main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the ''[[Russia]]n Mission in Exile'').

From the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the ''Triportico'' and ''Rotunda'' roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbo&quot; /&gt; [[Virgilio Canio Corbo]], a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall, of the temple itself, would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbo&quot; /&gt; if the wall had been any further west any ''tomb'' would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.

Other archaeologists have criticised Corbo's reconstructions. [[Dan Bahat]], the former official City Archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known Temple of Aphrodite matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the Temple Building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now;&lt;ref name=&quot;BahatBAR&quot;&gt;Dan Bahat, ''Does the Holy Sepulchre Church Mark the Burial of Jesus?'', in ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' May/June 1986&lt;/ref&gt; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda wasn't based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;BahatBAR&quot;/&gt;

===Relationship of the site to the city===
The Bible describes Jesus' tomb as being outside the city wall,&lt;ref&gt;for example, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|13:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is in the heart of Hadrian's city, well within [[Jerusalem's Old City Walls|the Old City walls]], which were built by Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1538. Some{{Who|date=May 2010}} have claimed that the city had been much narrower in Jesus' time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since [[Herod Agrippa]] (41–44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well.

[[File:BasicJerusalemCrossSection.PNG|thumb|left|If the western city wall was originally to the east of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, then the western hill, on which it is sited, would have been advantageous to an enemy]]
However, a wall would imply the existence of a defensive ditch outside it, so an earlier wall could not be immediately adjacent to site of the tomb, which combined with the presence of the [[Temple Mount]] would make the city inside the wall quite thin; essentially for the traditional site to have been outside the wall, the city would have had to be limited to the lower parts of the [[Tyropoeon Valley]], rather than including the defensively advantageous western hill. Since these geographic considerations imply that, not including the hill within, the walls would be willfully making the city prone to attack from it, some scholars, including the late 19th century surveyors of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]], consider it unlikely that a wall would ever have been built that would cut the hill off from the city in the valley;&lt;ref&gt;Colonel [[Claude R. Conder]], ''The City of Jerusalem'' (1909), (republished 2004); for details about Conder himself, see [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener#Survey of Western Palestine]]&lt;/ref&gt; archaeological evidence for the existence of an earlier city wall in such a location has never been found.  The area immediately to the south and east of the sepulchre was a quarry&lt;ref&gt;See Discoveries at Archaeological excavations at [[Meleke]].&lt;/ref&gt; and outside the city during the early 1st century as excavations under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer across the street demonstrated.  This obviated the need for a defensive ditch or fosse since the line of the city wall would follow the south lip of the quarry. The quarry and tombs associated with it are north, not west of the main city and west only of the merchant area in the Tyropoeon Valley, which was enclosed by the Second Wall.

Although, in 2007, Dan Bahat stated that ''Six graves from the first century were found on the area of the ''Church of the Holy Sepulchre''. That means, this place [was] outside of the city, without any doubt, ....'',&lt;ref name=&quot;ZDF&quot;&gt;[[Dan Bahat]] [http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/17/0,1872,5262833,00.html in German television ZDF, April 11, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; the dating of the tombs is based on the fact that they are in the ''[[Kokhim|kokh]]'' style, which was common in 1st century; however, the ''kokh'' style of tomb was also common in the first to 3rd centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Hachlili, (2005) ''Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period''&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of a 1st century tomb being built to the west of the city is questionable, as according to the late 1st century Rabbinic leader, [[Akiba ben Joseph]], quoted in the [[Mishnah]], tombs should not built to the west of the city, as the wind in Jerusalem generally blows from the west, and would blow the smell of the corpses and their ''impurity'' over the city, and the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baba Batra&quot;&gt;''[[Baba Batra]]'' 25a&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Aedicule would be quite close to the city even the west wall of the city had been to its east; yet Akiba remarks that Jewish law insists that tombs should not be built within 50 cubits of a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baba Batra&quot; /&gt; The archaeological record indicates that the instructions reported by Akiba, for choosing a burial location, were rigidly adhered to; almost all of the tombs from classical Jerusalem are to the east of the city, on the [[Mount of Olives]], except for a few located over a kilometre to the west, and those in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre&lt;ref&gt;Ephraim Stern, (editor), ''New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

One might note, however, that what is assumed to be a niche for the Torah scroll in the building probably originally built as a Judeo-Christian synagogue between AD 70 and AD 135 on the traditional site of the [[Cenacle]] or upper room of the [[Last Supper]] and now identified as the site of the [[King David's Tomb]] is oriented not towards the [[Temple Mount]], but towards the site of the Holy Sepulchre,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html&lt;/ref&gt; which would seem to indicate that the Christian community that had built it had already began to transfer many of the religious traditions originally associated with the Temple to the sites they associated with Christ's death and resurrection (such as the burial place of Adam and the centre of the world)

===Other possible sites===
Although the identification of the Aedicule as the site of Jesus' tomb is not a tenet of faith for any major Christian denomination, many Catholic and Orthodox Christians hold fast to this traditional location. However, due to the many issues the site raises, several scholars have rejected its validity.{{who|date=January 2011}} Additionally many [[Protestant]]s have often opposed the traditional location because it has previously received support from [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia]]'', entry on ''Jerusalem''&lt;/ref&gt;

After time spent in Palestine in 1882–83, General [[Charles George Gordon]] found a location outside the old city walls that he suggested to have been the real location of Golgotha. Although the Church of the Holy Sepulchre has its tomb just a few yards away from its Golgotha, there is no particular reason to regard this close juxtaposition as a necessity; however, Gordon followed this principle, concluding that his site for Golgotha must also be the approximate location for Jesus' burial, identifying a nearby tomb, now called the ''[[Garden Tomb]]'', as the location for the event. Pottery and archaeological findings in the area have subsequently been dated to the 7th century BC so, in the opinion of archaeologists the Garden Tomb site would have been abandoned by the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Barkay, ''The Garden Tomb'', published in ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' March/April 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Biblically this does not match three of the Gospel accounts (Matthew, Luke, and John) which specifically state the tomb was new and no one had ever been laid inside. Despite the archaeological discoveries, the Garden Tomb has become a popular place of pilgrimage among Protestants. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] leaders have been more hesitant to formally commit to the identification even though many [[Mormon]]s regard the Garden Tomb as the correct location of Jesus' tomb.

Currently, no other potential site for the tomb has received much attention or academic support.

Several churches and monasteries in [[Russia]] have been modelled on the Church of the Resurrection, some even reproducing other [[Holy Places]] for the benefit of pilgrims who could not travel to the Holy Land.

'''Cernunnos''' is the conventional name given in [[Celtic studies]] to depictions of the '''horned god''' of [[Celtic polytheism]]. The name itself is only attested once, on the 1st-century [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], but depictions of a horned or antlered figure, often seated in a &quot;[[lotus position]]&quot; and often associated with animals and holding or wearing [[torc]]s, are known from other instances.

Nothing is known about the god from literary sources, and details about his name, his cult or his significance in Celtic religion are unknown. Speculative interpretations identify him as a god of nature or fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Miranda |title=Animals in Celtic Life and Myth |pages=227–8 |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
[[File:Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|Cernunnos on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]]]]
The theonym ''[C]ernunnos''  appears on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], a [[Gallo-Roman]] monument dating to the early 1st century CE, to label a god depicted with stag's antlers in their early stage of annual growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Kingsley Porter 1934 p. 227&quot;&gt;A. Kingsley Porter, &quot;A Sculpture at Tandragee,&quot; ''Burlington Magazine'' 65 (1934), p. 227, pointing out the relative maturation of the antlers.&lt;/ref&gt; Both antlers have [[torc]]s hanging from them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maier&quot;/&gt;

The name has been compared to a divine epithet ''Carnonos'' in a Celtic inscription written in [[Greek alphabet|Greek characters]] at [[Montagnac, Hérault|Montagnac]], [[Hérault]] (as καρνονου, ''karnonou'', in the [[dative case]]).&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Vulgar Latin|Gallo-Latin]] [[adjective]] ''carnuātus'', &quot;horned,&quot; is also found.&lt;ref&gt;Equivalent to Latin ''cornutus'', &quot;horned&quot;; Delamarre, citing J. Vendryes, ''Revue Celtique'' 42 (1925) 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Proto-Celtic]] form of the theonym is reconstructed as either *''Cerno-on-os''{{dubious|date=October 2010}} or *''Carno-on-os''. The [[augmentative]] ''-on-'' is characteristic of theonyms, as in [[Maponos]], [[Epona]], [[Matronae]], and [[Sirona]].&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, citing M. Lejeune, ''Lepontica'' (Paris 1971), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;
Maier (2010) states that the etymology of ''Cernunnos'' is unknown, as the Celtic word for &quot;horn&quot; has an ''a'' (as in ''Carnonos'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Maier&quot;&gt;Bernard Maier, ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'' (Alfred Kröner, 1994; Boydell, 2000), p. 69 [http://books.google.com/books?id=7AvdTqwucfwC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22the+etymology+of+whose+name+is+unclear%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2E3ETPjlFcWOnwfrmpHZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20etymology%20of%20whose%20name%20is%20unclear%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaulish ''karnon'' &quot;horn&quot; is  cognate with Latin ''cornu'' and Germanic ''*hurnaz'', English ''[[:wikt:horn|horn]]'', ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European *ḱer-|*k̑r̥no-]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pokorny (1959)]] &quot;k̑er-, k̑erə-; k̑rā-, k̑erei-, k̑ereu&quot;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0929.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The etymon ''karn-'' &quot;horn&quot; appears in both [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Galatian language|Galatian]] branches of [[Continental Celtic]]. [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] glosses the Galatian word ''karnon'' (κάρνον) as &quot;Gallic trumpet&quot;, that is, the Celtic military horn listed as the [[carnyx]] (κάρνυξ) by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], who notes the instrument's animal-shaped bell.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre; Greek text and English translation of the passage from Eustathius' [[Homeric epics|Homeric]] [[commentary (philology)|commentaries]] given by Edward Wigan, &quot;Account of a Collection of Roman Gold Coins,&quot; ''Numismatic Chronicle'' 5 (1865), p. 11 [http://books.google.com/books?id=0VwUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=carnyx+Eustathius&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yEPDTMPmA4SfnAf__a3UCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=carnyx%20Eustathius&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The root also appears in the names of [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic polities]], most prominent among them the [[Carnutes]], meaning something like &quot;the Horned Ones,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Also ''[[Carni]]'' and ''[[Carnonacae]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in several  [[personal name]]s found in inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Such as ''Carnarus, Carnatus, Carneolus, Carnius'' and ''Carnicus''; Altay Coşkun with Jürgen Zeidler, &quot;'Cover Names' and Nomenclature in Late Roman Gaul: The Evidence of the Bordelaise Poet Ausonius&quot; (2003), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigraphic evidence==
The name ''Cernunnos'' occurs only on the &quot;[[Pillar of the Boatmen]]&quot; (''Pilier des nautes''),&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''Celtic Culture'', p. 396 [http://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=Cernunnos+inauthor:Koch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cj7ETMaaO8yRnwfE6dz1CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cernunnos%20inauthor%3AKoch&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; now displayed in the [[Musée National du Moyen Age]] in [[Paris]].

[[File:Cernunnos - Naquane R 70 - Capo di Ponte.jpg|thumb|Rock carving of an antlered figure in the [[rock drawings in Valcamonica|National park of Naquane]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=cernunnos&gt;Umberto Sansoni-Silvana Gavaldo, ''L'arte rupestre del Pià d'Ort: la vicenda di un santuario preistorico alpino'', p. 156; {{cite web|url=http://www.voli.bs.it/Itinera/02/senza_itinerario/piancogno/des_piancogno.html|title=Ausilio Priuli, ''Piancogno'' su &quot;Itinera&quot;|accessdate=02-04-2009|language=italian}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The god  labelled ''[C]ernunnos'' on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]] is  depicted with stag's antlers in their early stage of annual growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Kingsley Porter 1934 p. 227&quot;/&gt; Both antlers have [[torc]]s hanging from them. The lower part of the relief is lost, but the dimensions suggest that the god was sitting in the &quot;Buddha position&quot;, providing a direct parallel to the antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].

In spite of the name ''Cernunnos'' being attested nowhere else, it is commonly used in Celtological literature as describing all comparable depictions of horned deities.

This &quot;Cernunnos&quot; type in Celtic iconography is often portrayed with animals, in particular the [[stag]], and also frequently associated with a the [[ram-horned serpent]], besides association with other beasts with less frequency, including [[bull]]s (at [[Rheims]]), [[dog]]s, and [[rat]]s. Because of his frequent association with creatures, scholars often describe Cernunnos as the &quot;[[Lord of the Animals]]&quot; or the &quot;Lord of Wild Things&quot;, and Miranda Green describes him as a &quot;peaceful god of nature and fruitfulness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda (1992) ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pilier des nautes'' links him with sailors and with commerce, suggesting that he was also associated with material wealth as does the coin pouch from the Cernunnos of Rheims (Marne, Champagne, France)—in antiquity, Durocortorum, the ''civitas'' capital of the [[Remi]] tribe—and the stag vomiting coins from Niedercorn-Turbelslach (Luxembourg) in the lands of the [[Treveri]]. The god may have symbolised the fecundity of the [[Red Deer#Distribution_and_habitat|stag-inhabited forest]].

Other examples of &quot;Cernunnos&quot; images include a [[petroglyph]] in [[Val Camonica]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. The antlered human figure has been dated as early as the 7th century BCE or as late as the 4th.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, &quot;Creolizing the Roman Provinces,&quot; p. 221, especially note 103.&lt;/ref&gt; An antlered child appears on a relief from [[Vendeuvres]], flanked by serpents and holding a purse and a torc.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Ross, &quot;Chain Symbolism in Pagan Celtic Religion,&quot; ''Speculum'' 34 (1959), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known image appears on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]] found on [[Jutland]], dating to the 1st century BC, thought to depict Celtic subject matter though usually regarded as of Thracian workmanship.

Among the [[Celtiberians]], horned or antlered figures of the Cernunnos type include a &quot;[[Janus]]-like&quot; god from [[Candelario]] ([[Salamanca]]) with two faces and two small horns; a horned god from the hills of [[Ríotinto]] ([[Huelva]]); and a possible representation of the deity Vestius Aloniecus near his altars in [[Lourizán]] ([[Pontevedra]]). The horns are taken to represent &quot;aggressive power, genetic vigor and fecundity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Marco Simón, &quot;Religion and Religious Practices of the Ancient Celts of the Iberian Peninsula,&quot; ''e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies'' 6 (2005), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine representations of the Cernunnos type are exceptions to the often-expressed view that the Celts only began to picture their gods in human form after the [[Gallic Wars|Roman conquest of Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, &quot;Creolizing the Roman Provinces,&quot; p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Celtic &quot;horned god&quot;, while well attested in iconography, cannot be identified in description of Celtic religion in [[Roman ethnography]] and does not appear to have been given any ''[[interpretatio romana]]'', perhaps due to being too distinctive to be translatable into the Roman pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Webster, &quot;Creolizing the Roman Provinces,&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 105 (2001), p. 222; distinctiveness of Cernunnos also in William Van Andringa, &quot;Religions and the Integration of Cities in the Empire in the Second Century AD: The Creation of a Common Religious Language,&quot; in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;
While Cernunnos was never assimilated, scholars have sometimes compared him functionally to Greek and Roman divine figures such as [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]],&lt;ref&gt;David M. Robinson and Elizabeth Pierce Belgen, &quot;Archaeological Notes and Discussions,&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 41 (1937), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Actaeon]], specialized forms of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Dis Pater]], the latter of whom [[Julius Caesar]] said was considered the ancestor of the Gauls.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Fray Bober, “Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity,” ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 55 (1951), p. 15ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible reflexes in Insular Celtic==
There have been attempts to find the ''cern'' root in the name of [[Conall Cernach]], the foster brother of the Irish hero [[Cuchulainn]]&lt;ref&gt;Porter, &quot;A Sculpture at Tandragee,&quot; p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Ulster Cycle]]. In this line of interpretation, ''Cernach'' is taken as an epithet with a wide semantic field — &quot;angular; victorious; bearing a prominent growth&quot; — and Conall is seen as &quot;the same figure&quot; as the ancient Cernunnos.&lt;ref&gt;John Koch, entry on &quot;Cernunnos,&quot; ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible connection to Saint Ciarán==
Some see the qualities of Cernunnos subsumed into the ''life'' of [[Ciarán|Saint Ciarán of Saighir]], one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]].  When he was building his first tiny cell, as his [[Hagiography|hagiograph]] goes, his first disciple and monk was a boar that had been rendered gentle by God.  This was followed by a fox, a badger, a wolf and a stag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mac Cana| first = Proinsias| title = Celtic Mythology| origyear = 1970| year = 1973| publisher = The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited| location = London| isbn = 0 600 00647 6| pages = 47–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
In [[Wicca]] and other forms of [[Neopaganism]] a [[Horned God]] is revered; this divinity syncretises a number of horned or antlered gods from various cultures, including Cernunnos. The Horned God reflects the seasons of the year in an annual cycle of life, death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Stewart &amp; Janet, ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tradition of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], the Horned God is sometimes specifically referred to as Cernunnos, or sometimes also as Kernunno.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Manner of articulation}}
'''Clicks''' are speech sounds found as [[consonants]] in many languages of southern Africa, and in three languages of East Africa.  Examples of these sounds familiar to English speakers are the [[dental click|''tsk! tsk!'']] (American spelling) or ''tut-tut'' (British spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the [[lateral click|''tchick!'']] used to spur on a horse, and the [[alveolar click|''clip-clop!'']] sound children make to imitate a horse trotting.

Technically, clicks are [[obstruent]]s articulated with two closures (points of contact) in the mouth, one forward and one at the back. The pocket of air enclosed between is [[rarefaction|rarefied]] by a sucking action of the tongue (i.e. clicks have a [[Airstream mechanism|lingual ingressive airstream mechanism]]). The forward closure is then released, producing what may be the loudest consonants in the language, although in some languages such as [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], clicks can be more subtle and may even be mistaken for [[ejective consonant|ejective stops]].

==What clicks sound like==
:''For several sound samples see articles [[bilabial clicks]], [[dental clicks]], [[alveolar clicks]], [[lateral clicks]], and [[palatal clicks]].''

There are five places of articulation at which click consonants occur. In IPA, a click is symbolized by placing the assigned symbol for the place of click articulation adjacent to a symbol for a nonclick sound at the rear place of articulation. The IPA symbols are used in writing most Khoisan languages, but Bantu languages such as Zulu typically use Latin c, x and q for dental, lateral, and alveolar clicks respectively.

* The easiest clicks for English speakers are the [[dental click]]s written with a single pipe, {{IPA|ǀ}}. They are all sharp (high-pitched) squeaky sounds made by sucking on the front teeth. A simple dental click is used in English to express pity or to shame someone, and sometimes to call an animal, and is written ''tsk!'' in American English, or ''tut-tut!'' in British English.

* Next most familiar to English speakers are the [[lateral click]]s written with a double pipe, {{IPA|ǁ}}. They are also squeaky sounds, though less sharp than {{IPA|ǀ}}, made by sucking on the molars on either side (or both sides) of the mouth. A simple lateral click is made in English to get a horse moving, and is conventionally written ''tchick!''

* Then there are the [[bilabial click]]s, written with a bull's eye, {{IPA|ʘ}}. These are lip-smacking sounds, but without the pursing of the lips found in a kiss.

The above clicks sound like [[affricate]]s, in that they involve a lot of friction. The other two families are more abrupt sounds that do not have this friction.

* With the [[alveolar click]]s, written with an exclamation mark, {{IPA|ǃ}}, the tip of the tongue is pulled down abruptly and forcefully from the roof of the mouth, sometimes using a lot of jaw motion, and making a hollow ''pop!'' like a cork being pulled from an empty bottle. These sounds can be quite loud.

* Finally, the [[palatal click]]s, {{IPA|ǂ}}, are made with a flat tongue, and are softer popping sounds than the {{IPA|ǃ}} clicks.

==Languages with clicks==
Clicks occur in all three [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language families]] of southern Africa, where they may be the most numerous consonants. To a lesser extent they are found in two groups of neighbouring [[Bantu languages]] which [[Sprachbund|borrowed them]], directly or indirectly, from Khoisan. In the southeast, in eastern [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]], and southern [[Mozambique]], they were adopted from a [[Tuu languages|Tuu language]] or languages by the languages of the Nguni cluster (especially [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], and [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], but also to a lesser extent [[Swati language|Swazi]] and [[Ndebele language|Ndebele]]), and spread from them in a reduced fashion to the Zulu-based [[pidgin]] [[Fanagalo]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], and [[Ronga language|Ronga]], and more recently to [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and urban varieties of [[Pedi language|Pedi]], where the spread of clicks is an ongoing process. The second point of transfer was near the [[Caprivi Strip]] and the [[Okavango River]], where it was apparently the [[Yeyi language]] which borrowed the clicks from a [[Khoe languages|West Kalihari Khoe language]], and which in turn passed on a reduced click inventory to the neighboring [[Mbukushu language|Mbukushu]], [[Kwangali language|Kwangali]], [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], [[Kuhane language|Kuhane]], and [[Fwe language|Fwe]] languages in [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], and [[Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;Derek Nurse &amp; Gérard Philippson (2003) ''The Bantu languages,'' pp 31&amp;ndash;32&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three minority languages in East Africa which use clicks: [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] of [[Tanzania]], as well as [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], an endangered South [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic language]] of [[Kenya]] which has clicks in only a few dozen words. It is thought these may remain from an episode of [[language shift]].

The only non-African language known to employ clicks as regular speech sounds is [[Damin]], a ritual code used by speakers of [[Lardil]] in [[Australia]]. One of the clicks in Damin is actually an ''egressive'' click, using the tongue to compress the air in the mouth for an outward (egressive) &quot;spurt&quot;.

The Southern African Khoisan languages only utilize [[root word|root]]-initial clicks. [[Hadza]], [[Sandawe]], and several of the [[Bantu language]]s also allow [[syllable]]-initial clicks within roots, but in no known language does a click close a syllable or end a word.

English and many other languages may use clicks in [[interjection]]s, such as the dental &quot;tsk-tsk&quot; sound used to express disapproval, or the lateral ''tchick'' used with horses. In [[Ningdu]] Chinese, flapped nasal clicks are used in nursery rhymes.  In [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Turkic language|Turkic]] and [[Levantine Arabic]] as well as southern Italian dialects such as Sicilian, a click accompanied by tipping the head upwards signifies &quot;no&quot;. Clicks occasionally turn up elsewhere, as in the special [[register (linguistics)|register]]s twins sometimes develop with each other, and in onomatopoeic usages. In West Africa, clicks have been reported allophonically, and similarly in German, faint clicks have been recorded in rapid speech where the consonants {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} overlap between words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icphs2007.de/conference/Papers/1678/1678.pdf Weak Clicks in German?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional native language of the [[Tenctonese]] in the film and television series ''[[Alien Nation]]'' incorporates some soft click consonants.

==The airstream==
The essence of a click is a lingual ingressive airstream mechanism. However, in nasal clicks the nasalization involves a separate nasal airstream, generally [[pulmonic egressive]] but occasionally [[pulmonic ingressive]]. Similarly, voiced clicks also require a simultaneous pulmonic egressive airstream to power the voiced [[phonation]].

The front articulation may be [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] or, rarely, [[Labial consonant|labial]]. The front and rear articulations are interdependent, with the rear contact being [[uvular consonant|uvular]] or [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] depending on the shape of the front of the tongue.

The rear articulation had been thought to be [[Velar consonant|velar]], with a few languages contrasting a uvular place of articulation. However, recent investigations of languages with very complex click systems such as [[Nǀu language|Nǀuu]] have revealed that the supposed velar–uvular contrast is actually a contrast of a simple clicks versus click–plosive [[contour (linguistics)|airstream contours]] or [[consonant clusters]]. Even in languages without such a distinction, such as [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], experiments have shown that when the click release is removed from a recording, the resulting sound is judged to be uvular, not velar. Therefore, although not all languages have been investigated on this point, phoneticians have recently come to use the term ''lingual'' (made with the tongue) as being more accurate for this airstream mechanism than ''velaric'' (made with the velum).

==Types of clicks==
As noted above, clicks necessarily involve at least two closures: an anterior articulation which has traditionally been represented by the special click symbol in the IPA, and a posterior articulation which has been traditionally described as oral or [[nasal consonant|nasal]], voiced or voiceless, etc. The literature also describes a contrast between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] rear articulations for some languages. However, recent work has shown that for languages which make this distinction, all clicks have a uvular, or even pharyngeal, rear closure, and that the clicks explicitly described as uvular are in fact clusters/contours of a click plus a pulmonic consonant, in which the clusters/contour has two release bursts, the click itself and then a uvular consonant. In the case of &quot;velar&quot; clicks in these languages, on the other hand, there is only a single release burst, that of the forward click release, and the release of the rear articulation isn't audible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Nonetheless, in most of the literature the stated place of the click is the anterior articulation (called the ''release'' or ''influx),'' while the manner is ascribed to the posterior articulation (called the ''accompaniment'' or ''efflux),'' as in a &quot;nasal dental click&quot;.

There are numerous manners of clicks. These include what has been described as voiceless, voiced, aspirate, breathy voiced, nasal, voiceless nasal, breathy voiced nasal, glottalized, voiceless nasal glottalized, affricate, ejective affricate, prevoiced, prenasalized. In a few of the Khoisan languages, clicks cluster with other obstruents. Examples of such clusters in ǃXóõ a voiced velar click followed by voiceless affricated ejective, {{IPA|[ɡǃkxʼ]}}, and a velar ejective click followed by uvular ejective, {{IPA|[kǃʼqʼ]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;qyuylz&quot;&gt;L&amp;M 1996, p 266&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of click inventories ranges from as few as three (in [[Sesotho_phonology#Consonants|Sesotho]]) or four (in [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]]), to dozens in the [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]] and [[Tuu languages]] (Northern and Southern Khoisan). [[Taa language|ǃXoon]], a Tuu language, has fifty click phonemes&lt;ref name=&quot;qyuylz&quot;/&gt; and over 70% of words in the dictionary of this language begin with a click.&lt;ref&gt;L&amp;M 1996, p 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Clicks appear more [[stop consonant|stop]]-like or more [[affricate]]-like depending on their place of articulation: In southern Africa, clicks involving an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] closure are acoustically abrupt and sharp, like stops, while [[labial consonant|bilabial]], [[dental consonant|dental]], and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] clicks typically have longer and acoustically noisier releases that are more like affricates. In East Africa, however, the alveolar clicks tend to be [[flap consonant|flapped]], while the lateral clicks tend to be more sharp and abrupt.

==Transcription==
The five click releases with dedicated symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) are [[bilabial click|bilabial]] {{IPA|ʘ}}, [[dental click|dental]] {{IPA|ǀ}}, [[palatal click|palato-alveolar]] or &quot;palatal&quot; {{IPA|ǂ}}, [[postalveolar click|(post)alveolar]] or &quot;retroflex&quot; {{IPA|ǃ}}, and [[alveolar lateral click|alveolar lateral]] {{IPA|ǁ}}. In most languages, the retroflex and palatal releases are &quot;abrupt&quot;; that is, they are sharp popping sounds with little frication (turbulent airflow). The bilabial, dental, and lateral releases, on the other hand, are typically &quot;noisy&quot;: they are longer, lip- or tooth-sucking sounds with turbulent airflow, and are sometimes called affricates. (This applies to the forward articulation; both may also have either an affricate or non-affricate rear articulation as well.) The [[apical consonant|apical]] releases, {{IPA|ǃ}} and {{IPA|ǁ}}, are sometimes called &quot;grave&quot;, because their pitch is dominated by low frequencies; while the [[laminal consonant|laminal]] releases, {{IPA|ǀ}} and {{IPA|ǂ}}, are sometimes called &quot;acute&quot;, because they are dominated by high frequencies. (At least in the [[Nǀu language]] and [[Juǀʼhoan language|Juǀʼhoan]], this is associated with a difference in the placement of the rear articulation: &quot;grave&quot; clicks are [[uvular consonant|uvular]], whereas &quot;acute&quot; clicks are [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]].) Thus the alveolar click {{IPA|/ǃ/}} sounds something like a cork pulled from a bottle (a low-pitch pop), at least in Xhosa; while the dental click {{IPA|/ǀ/}} is like English ''tsk! tsk!,'' a high-pitched sucking on the incisors. The lateral clicks are pronounced by sucking on the molars of one or both sides. The bilabial click {{IPA|/ʘ/}} is different from what many people associate with a kiss: the lips are pressed more-or-less flat together, as they are for a {{IPA|[p]}} or an {{IPA|[m]}}, not rounded as they are for a {{IPA|[w]}}.

The most populous languages with clicks, Zulu and Xhosa, use the letters ''c, q, x,'' by themselves and in [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], to write click consonants. Most Khoisan languages, on the other hand (with the notable exceptions of [[Naro language|Naro]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]), use a more iconic system based on the [[Vertical bar|pipe]] ‹|›. (The exclamation point for the &quot;retroflex&quot; click was originally a pipe with a subscript dot, along the lines of ''ṭ, ḍ, ṇ'' used to transcribe the retroflex consonants of India.)

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The bilabial and palatal clicks do not occur in written Bantu languages. However, the palatal clicks have been romanized in Naron and [[Juǀʼhoan language|Juǀʼhõasi]], where they are transcribed with ''tc'' and ''ç'' respectively.

There are a few less well attested articulations, such as a noisy laminal denti-alveolar lateral release ({{IPA|‹Ⅲ›}} [triple pipe] in an ''ad hoc'' transcription), which contrasts with an apical postalveolar lateral in Mangetti Dune ǃKung; an abrupt sub-apical retroflex release {{IPA|‹‼›}} in Angolan ǃKung; and a &quot;slapped&quot; alveolar click {{IPA|‹ǃ¡›}} in Hadza and Sandawe, where the tongue slaps the bottom of the mouth after the release. (These distinctions may suffice for the Damin releases as well.) However, the Khoisan languages are poorly attested, and it is quite possible that, as they become better described, more click releases will be found.

In the literature, the places not directly supported by the IPA are transcribed with ''ad hoc'' digraphs:

Typically when a click consonant is transcribed, two symbols are used, one for each articulation, connected with a tie bar. This is because a click such as {{IPA|[ŋ͡ǂ]}} has been traditionally been analysed as a nasal velar rear articulation {{IPA|[ŋ]}} pronounced simultaneously with the forward ingressive release {{IPA|[ǂ]}}. The symbols may be written in either order, depending on the analysis. However, a tie bar is not often used in practice, and when the manner is a simple {{IPA|[k]}}, it will often be omitted as well. That is, {{IPA|‹ǂ›}} = {{IPA|‹kǂ›}} = {{IPA|‹ǂk›}} = {{IPA|‹k͡ǂ›}} = {{IPA|‹ǂ͡k›}}. This may be theoretically motivated as well, since recent research has shown that the front and rear articulations are not independent, and so any click symbol will necessarily cover the rear articulation as well.

The manner of a click is generally written before the release: {{IPA|‹ŋ͡ǂ›}} or {{IPA|‹ŋǂ›}}, and this is preferred by the IPA. However, many Khoisanists prefer to write the manner second: {{IPA|‹ǂ͡ŋ›}} or {{IPA|‹ǂŋ›}}. This is because any diacritics which follow belong to the manner rather than to the forward release, and they are more easily understood when they are made diacritics of the manner. Regardless, elements which do not overlap with the release are always written according to their temporal order: Prenasalization is always written first in {{IPA|‹ŋɡ͡ǂ›}} = {{IPA|‹ŋǂ͡ɡ›}}, and the second ejective is always written second in {{IPA|‹k͡ǂʼqʼ›}} = {{IPA|‹ǂ͡kʼqʼ›}}.

Some linguists analyze clicks as simplex segments, and use superscripts rather than digraphs for the accompaniments. Thus {{IPA|‹ǂ, ᶢǂ, ᵑǂ›}} = {{IPA|‹k͡ǂ, ɡ͡ǂ, ŋ͡ǂ›}}.

While the [[SAMPA]] encoding for IPA into [[ASCII]] doesn't have symbols for transcribing clicks, the proposed [[X-SAMPA]] standard does: &lt;tt&gt; O\&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;|\&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;|\|\&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;=\&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;.  Some instead suggest &lt;tt&gt;||\&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;#\&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&quot;\&lt;/tt&gt; for the alveolar lateral click. The [[Kirshenbaum]] system uses a different method: clicks are denoted by digraphs, with the click symbol (always &quot;!&quot;) added to the stop homorganic to the release, but with the manner of the accompaniment. For example, /t!/ is a voiceless dental click, and /m!/ is a nasal bilabial click. (This transcription is used in the literature on Damin.) However, the International Phonetic Association recommends using the IPA symbols in [[Unicode]], or using the number codes which they have assigned to each symbol.

==Places of articulation==
These are often called click ''types, releases,'' or ''influxes.'' There are seven or eight known releases, not counting slapped or egressive clicks. These are ''bilabial affricated'' {{IPA|ʘ}}, or &quot;bilabial&quot;; ''laminal denti-alveolar affricated'' {{IPA|ǀ}}, or &quot;dental&quot;; ''apical (post)alveolar plosive'' {{IPA|ǃ}}, or &quot;alveolar&quot;; ''laminal postalveolar (palato-alveolar) plosive'' {{IPA|ǂ}}, or &quot;palatal&quot;; ''subapical postalveolar ([[Retroflex click|retroflex]])'' {{IPA|ǃ˞}} (in central Ju, generally written {{unicode|‼}}); and two lateral clicks, which in the only dialects known to distinguish them (northern Ju) are ''[[Dental lateral click|laminal denti-alveolar lateral]]'' {{IPA|ǁ̻}} with a forward release, and ''apical postalveolar lateral'' {{IPA|ǁ̺}} with a rear release. There may be an additional [[palatal lateral click]] (a palatal click with a lateral release), provisionally transcribed {{IPA|ǂǂ}}, in another Ju lect which is currently (2008) being investigated. Given the poor state of documentation of Khoisan languages, it is quite possible that additional releases will turn up. However, no language is known to contrast more than five places of articulation.

Extra-linguistically, [[Coatlán Zapotec]] of [[Mexico]] uses a [[linguolabial]] click, {{IPA|[ǀ̼ʔ]}}, as mimesis for a pig drinking water.&lt;ref name=Azcona&gt;Rosemary Beam de Azcona, ''Sound Symbolism.''

===Names found in the literature===

The terms for the click releases were originally developed by Bleek in 1911. Since then there has been some conflicting variation. Here are the terms used in some of the main references.

==The back-vowel constraint==
[[Image:Clicks and the BVC.svg|thumb|The shape of the tongue in Nama when articulating an alveolar click (blue) and a palatal click (red) [throat to the right]. The articulation of the vowel [i] is slightly forward of the red line, with its peak coinciding with the dip of the blue line.]]In several languages, including Nama and Ju|’hoansi, the alveolar and lateral clicks only occur, or preferentially occur, before [[back vowel]]s, while the dental and palatal clicks may occur before any vowel. The effect is most noticeable with the high front vowel {{IPA|[i]}}. In Nama, for example, the diphthong {{IPA|[əi]}} is common but {{IPA|[i]}} is rare after alveolar clicks, whereas the opposite is true after dental and palatal clicks. This is a common effect of [[uvular consonant|uvular]] or uvularized consonants on vowels in both click and non-click languages. In [[Taa language|Taa]], for example, the back-vowel constraint is triggered by both alveolar clicks and uvular stops, but not by palatal clicks or velar stops: sequences such as {{IPA|*/ǃi/}} and {{IPA|*/qi/}} are rare to non-existent, whereas sequences such as {{IPA|/ǂi/}} and {{IPA|/ki/}} are common.

Miller ''et al.'' (2003) used [[ultrasound imaging]] to show that the rear articulation of the alveolar clicks ({{IPA|[ǃ]}}) in Nama is substantially different that that of palatal and dental clicks. Specifically, the shape of the body of the tongue in palatal clicks is very similar to that of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, and involves the same tongue muscles, so that sequences such as {{IPA|[ǂi]}} involved a simple and quick transition. The rear articulation of the alveolar clicks, however, is several centimeters further back, and involves a different set of muscles in the uvular region. The part of the tongue required to approach the palate for the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is deeply retracted in {{IPA|[ǃ]}}, as it lies at the bottom of the air pocket used to create the vacuum required for click airstream. This makes the transition required for {{IPA|[ǃi]}} much more complex and the timing more difficult than the shallower and more forward tongue position of the palatal clicks. Consequently, {{IPA|[ǃi]}} takes 50 [[millisecond|ms]] longer to pronounce than {{IPA|[ǂi]}}, the same amount of time required to pronounce {{IPA|[ǃəi]}}.

==Manners of articulation==
''(Data is primarily from Ladefoged; see references at individual language articles.)''

Click manners are often called click ''accompaniments'' or ''effluxes,'' but both terms have met with objections on theoretical grounds.

There is a great variety of click manners, both simplex and complex, the latter variously analysed as consonant [[consonant cluster|clusters]] or [[contour (linguistics)|contour]]s. With so few click languages, and so little study of them, it is also unclear to what extent clicks in different languages are equivalent. For example, the {{IPA|[ǃkˀ]}} of Nama, {{IPA|[ǃkˀ ~ ŋˀǃk]}} of Sandawe, and {{IPA|[ŋ̊ǃˀ ~ ŋǃkˀ]}} of Hadza may be essentially the same phone, as may {{IPA|[ǃk͡xʼ]}} and {{IPA|[ǃq͡χʼ]}}; no one language distinguishes either set, and the differences in transcription may have more to do with the approach of the linguist than with actual differences in the sounds. Such suspected allophones/allographs are listed on a common row in the table below.

Some Khoisan languages are [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] unusual in allowing mixed [[phonation|voicing]] in non-click consonant clusters/contours, such as {{IPA|dt͡sʼk͡xʼ}}, so it is not surprising that they would allow mixed voicing in clicks as well. This may be an effect of epiglottalized voiced consonants, since voicing is incompatible with epiglottalization.

There is ongoing discussion as to which clicks are best analysed as consonant clusters. For example, some linguists feel that ejective clicks are not possible, and indeed in many Khoisan languages they appear to be clusters. However, in other languages, phonetic measurements have found that, although the ejective release follows the click release, it is the rear closure of the click that is ejective, not a subsequent consonant. This is one reason for analysing such clicks as airstream contours rather than clusters.

Of the languages illustrated below,
*[[ǃXoon language|ǃXoon]] and [[Nǀu language|Nǀu]] are [[Tuu languages]]
*[[ǂHoan language|ǂHoan]] and [[Juǀʼhoan language|Juǀʼhõasi]] are [[Kx'a languages]]
*[[Korana language|Korana]] and [[Gǀwi language|Gǀui]] are [[Khoe languages]]
(all spoken primarily in [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]]; [[Nama language|Nama]] is like Korana except it has lost {{IPA|[ǃk͡xʼ]}})
*[[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] are [[language isolate]]s spoken in [[Tanzania]]
*[[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] is a [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] language of [[Kenya]]
*[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]] are [[Bantu languages]]
*[[Damin]] was an initiation jargon in northern [[Australia]].

The four Dahalo manners occur only with a dental release. Damin has only nasal clicks, but in addition has an oral &quot;spurt&quot; that might be considered an egressive click. Yeyi also has prenasalized versions (not shown) of at least some of its clicks, which are analyzed as consonant clusters. Dahalo has labialized clicks.

A DoBeS (2008) study found several additional manners for ǃXóõ. However, these were reanalized as consonant clusters, leaving this most complex inventory in the table above with only nine manners of clicks (these are asterisked in the table): tenuis {{IPA|/kǂ/}}, voiced {{IPA|/ɡǂ/}}, aspirated {{IPA|/kǂʰ/}}, breathy voiced {{IPA|/ɡǂʱ/}} (which Traill had analyzed as a cluster {{IPA|/ɡǂqʰ/}}), ejective {{IPA|/kǂʼ/}}, creaky {{IPA|/ɡǂˀ/}}, nasal {{IPA|/ŋǂ/}}, a true voiceless nasal {{IPA|/ŋ̊ǂ/}}, and preglottalized nasal {{IPA|/ˀŋǂ/}} (which Traill had analyzed as a cluster {{IPA|/ˀnkǂ/}}). Those believed to be clusters are {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;[qǂ] = /kǂq/, [ɢǂ] = /ɡǂq/, [kǂʰ] = /kǂqʰ/, [ɡǂh] = /ɡǂqʰ ~ ɡǂɢʱ/, [qǂʼ] = /kǂqʼ/, /ɡǂqʼ/, [kǂˣ] = /kǂx/, [ɡǂx] = /ɡǂx/, [kǂʼqʼ] = /kǂqxʼ/, [ɡǂqʼ] = /ɡǂqxʼ/, [kǂˀ] = /kǂʔ/, /ɡǂʔ ~ ŋǂʔ/, [↓ŋ̊ǂʰ] = /kǂh ~ ŋ̊ǂh/, [ɢǂh] = /ɡǂh ~ ŋǂh/&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}.

Similarly, Miller (2007) found six of the ten manners in Nǀu to be simple clicks, with the other four being [[contour (linguistics)|airstream contours]].

==Click genesis and click loss==
Clicks are often portrayed as a primitive or primordial feature of human language. Recent genetic studies showed that clicks, which occur in languages of genetically divergent populations (e.g. Hadza, Sandawe, Khoisan), are very likely an ancient element of human language &lt;ref&gt;Tishkoff SA, Gonder MK, Henn BM, Mortensen H, Knight A, Gignoux C, Fernandopulle N, et al., (2007). History of click-speaking populations of Africa inferred from mtDNA and Y chromosome genetic variation. Molecular Biology and Evolution 24: 2180-95. http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/10/2180.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;. How clicks arose is not currently known. Some linguists{{Who|date=April 2011}} speculate that clicks were initially used for [[Avoidance speech|taboo avoidance]] and then borrowed into regular speech. (Compare [[Damin]].) Others{{Who|date=April 2011}} suggest that they developed from other [[complex consonant]]s. For example, the [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] word for 'horn', {{IPA|[tɬana]}}, with a lateral affricate, may be a cognate with the root {{IPA|[ŋǁaː]}} found throughout the [[Khoe languages|Khoe family]], which has a lateral click. This and other words suggests that at least some Khoe clicks may have formed from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word was lost; in this instance {{IPA|[tɬana]}} → {{IPA|[tɬna]}} → {{IPA|[ǁŋa]}} (= {{IPA|[ŋǁa]}}).

On the other side of the equation, several non-endangered languages in vigorous use demonstrate click loss. For example, the [[Khoe languages|East Kalahari languages]] have lost a large percentage of their clicks, presumably due to [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence. As a rule, a click is replaced by a consonant with the [[manner of articulation]] of the accompaniment and the [[place of articulation]] of the forward release: alveolar click releases (the {{IPA|[ǃ]}} family) tend to mutate into a velar stop or affricate, such as {{IPA|[k], [ɡ], [ŋ], [k͡x]}}; palatal clicks ({{IPA|[ǂ]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into a palatal stop such as {{IPA|[c], [ɟ], [ɲ], [cʼ]}}, or a post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|[tʃ], [dʒ]}}; and dental clicks ({{IPA|[ǀ]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into an alveolar affricate {{IPA|[ts]}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

'''''The Cider House Rules''''' is a 1985 novel by [[John Irving]]. It has been adapted into a [[The Cider House Rules (film)|film of the same name]] and a stage play by [[Peter Parnell]].

==Plot==
Homer Wells grows up in an [[orphan]]age where he spends his childhood &quot;being of use&quot; as a medical assistant to the director, Dr. Wilbur Larch, whose history is told in [[flashback (continuity)|flashbacks]]: After a traumatic misadventure with a [[prostitute]] as a young man, Wilbur turns his back on sex and love, choosing instead to help women with unwanted pregnancies give birth and then keeping the babies in an orphanage. He makes a point of maintaining an emotional distance from the orphans, so that they can more easily make the transition into an adoptive family, but when it becomes clear that Homer is going to spend his entire childhood at the orphanage, Wilbur trains the orphan as an [[obstetrician]] and then comes to love him.

Wilbur's and Homer's lives are complicated by Wilbur also secretly being an [[abortion]]ist. Wilbur came to this work reluctantly, but he is driven by having seen the horrors of back-alley operations. Homer, upon learning Wilbur's secret, considers it morally wrong.

Homer befriends a young couple, Candy Kendall and Wally Worthington, who work in an apple [[orchard]], and leaves the orphanage with them. Wally and Homer become best friends and Homer develops a secret love for Candy. Wally goes [[World War II|off to war]] and his plane is shot down over [[Burma]]. He is presumed missing by the military, but Homer and Candy both believe he is dead and move on with their lives. They have sexual relations, and Candy becomes pregnant. They go back to St. Cloud's Orphanage, where their child is born and named Angel. Candy becomes the first mother to take her own child home with her. 

Subsequently, Wally is found in Burma and returns home, paralyzed from the waist down. He is still able to have sexual intercourse but is sterile due to an infection received in Burma. They lie to the family about Angel's parentage, claiming that Homer decided to adopt him. Wally and Candy marry shortly afterward, but Candy and Homer maintain a secret affair that lasts some 15 years.

Many years later, teenaged Angel falls in love with Rose Rose, the daughter of the head [[migrant worker]] at the apple orchard. She becomes pregnant with her father's child, and Homer performs an abortion on her. Homer decides to return to the orphanage after the death of Dr. Larch, to work as the new director. Though he maintains his distaste for abortions, he continues Dr. Larch's legacy of honoring the choice of his patients, and he dreams of the day when abortions are free, legal, and safe, so he'll no longer feel obligated to offer them.

A subplot follows the character Melony, who grew up alongside Homer in the orphanage. She was Homer's first girlfriend in a relationship of circumstances. After Homer leaves the orphanage, so does she in an effort to find him. She eventually becomes an electrician and takes a female lover, Lorna. Melony is an extremely stoic woman, who refuses to press charges against a man who brutally broke her nose and arm so that she can later retaliate herself. She is the catalyst that transforms Homer from his comfortable but not entirely admirable position at the apple orchard to becoming Dr. Larch's replacement at the orphanage.

==Background==
The story about Wally being shot down over Burma was based in part on that of Irving's biological father (whom he never met), who had been shot down over Burma and survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/books/novelist-builds-fact-reach-truth-john-irving-begins-with-his-memories.html?scp=28&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=all |author=Mel Gussow |title=A Novelist Builds Out From Fact To Reach The Truth; John Irving Begins With His Memories |date=1998-04-28 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consumer''' is a broad label for any individuals or [[household]]s that use [[Good (economics)|goods and services]] generated within the [[economic system|economy]].  The concept of a consumer occurs in different contexts, so that the usage and significance of the term may vary.

==In economics and marketing==
The &quot;consumer&quot; is the one who consumes the goods and services produced.  As such, consumers plays a vital role in the economic system of a nation because in the absence of the effective demand that emanates from them, the economy virtually collapses. Mahatma Gandhi said a customer is the most important visitor in our premises.  He is not dependent on us, we are on him.  He is not an interruption to our work, he is the purpose of it.

Typically when [[business]] people and economists talk of ''consumers'' they are talking about ''person as consumer'', an aggregated [[commodity]] item with little [[individuality]] other than that expressed in the buy/not-buy decision. However there is a trend in [[marketing]] to individualize the concept. Instead of generating broad [[demographic profile]]s and [[Psychographic|psycho-graphic profiles]] of [[market segment]]s, marketers have started to engage in [[personalized marketing]], [[permission marketing]], and [[mass customization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Robert G.|title=Revenue management: hard-core tactics for market domination|publisher=Broadway Books|year=1997|pages=66–71|ISBN=978-0-553-06734-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is increasing backlash from the public over use of the label &quot;consumer&quot; rather than &quot;customer&quot;, with many finding it offensive and derogatory. &lt;ref&gt;http://mistinthegarden.com/2009/02/04/dont-call-me-a-consumer/{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In law and politics==
The law primarily uses the notion of &quot;consumer&quot; in relation to [[consumer protection]] laws, and the definition of consumer is often restricted to living persons (i.e. not corporations or businesses) and excludes commercial users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Krohn, Lauren |title=Consumer protection and the law: a dictionary |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-87436-749-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion of policing market failures and inefficiencies, such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/journals/journal/35-01/overby.htm|title=An Institutional Analysis of Consumer Law|accessdate=2007-01-29|publisher=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070302211417/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/journals/journal/35-01/overby.htm |archivedate = March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of all potential voters are also consumers, consumer protection takes on a clear political significance.

Concern over the interests of consumers has also spawned much activism, as well as incorporation of consumer education into school curricula.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} There are also various non-profit publications, such as ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' and ''[[Choice Magazine]]'', dedicated to assist in consumer education and decision making, and ''[[Consumer Direct]]'' in the UK.

In India, the Consumer Protection Act 1986 clearly differentiates a consumer as consuming a commodity or service either for his personal domestic use or to earn his livelihood. Only consumers are protected as per this act and any person, entity or organization purchasing a commodity for commercial reasons are exempted from any benefits of this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.consumerdaddy.com/a-23-consumer-customer.htm
| title=Consumer vs Customer|publisher=Consumerdaddy.com
| accessdate = 2010-03-10
| quote = The consumer protection act 1986 of India, is a little more generous with the word 'Consumer'. According to this law, consumer is not only a person who uses the product for domestic personal use, but also one who uses the product to earn his daily livelyhood.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Indian case law has quite a few references on how to distinguish a consumer from a customer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==In intelligence studies==
Within [[intelligence studies]], the concept of &quot;consumer&quot; refers to the political staff consuming and requesting intelligence.

A '''cactus''' (plural: ''cacti'', ''cactuses'' or ''cactus'') is a member of the [[plant]] family '''Cactaceae'''.  Their distinctive appearance is a result of adaptations to conserve water in dry and/or hot environments.&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Nobel. 1988. Environmental Biology of Agaves and Cacti. [[Cambridge University]] Press, [[New York]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Nobel. 1994. Remarkable Agaves and Cacti. [[Oxford University]] Press, New York. 166 pp. Spanish Translation by E. García Moya. 1998. Los Incomparables Agaves y Cactos. Editorial Trillas, Mexico City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Nobel. 2010. DESERT WISDOM/AGAVES and CACTI: CO2, Water, Climate Change. iUniverse, Bloomington, IN.&lt;/ref&gt; In most species, the stem has evolved to become [[photosynthetic]] and [[succulent]], while the leaves have evolved into spines.  Many species are used for ornamental plants, and some are also grown for fodder, forage, fruits, [[cochineal]], and other uses.

Cacti come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. The tallest is ''[[Pachycereus pringlei]]'', with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m,&lt;ref&gt;Salak, M. (2000). In search of the tallest cactus. ''Cactus and Succulent Journal'' 72 (3).&lt;/ref&gt; and the smallest is ''[[Blossfeldia liliputiana]]'', only about 1&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter at maturity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/mauseth/ResearchOnCacti/large%20photo%20Blossfeld%20liliput%20plants.htm Mauseth Cactus research: ''Blossfeldia liliputiana'']&lt;/ref&gt; Cactus [[flower]]s are large, and like the spines arise from distinctive features called [[areole]]s.

==Distribution==
The cactus family is native to the [[Americas]], where their range extends from [[Patagonia]] to southern [[Canada]], but they are densest and most diverse in the regions of northern [[Mexico]] and the [[Tropic of Cancer|southern tropics]] of [[Argentina]] and [[Bolivia]].  ''[[Rhipsalis baccifera]]'' is the one exception; it is native to both the Americas and the [[Old World]], where it is found in tropical [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. It is thought to have colonized the [[Old World]] within the last few thousand years, probably by being carried as [[seed]]s in the [[digestive tract]]s of [[Bird migration|migratory]] [[bird]]s. Many other species have become naturalized outside the Americas after having been introduced by people, especially in [[Australia]], [[Hawaii]], and the [[Mediterranean region]].  Cacti inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to high mountain areas.

== Adaptations to dry environment ==
With a few exceptions, cacti are succulent plants and, like other [[succulents]], they have a variety of adaptations that enable them to survive in hot and dry environments.

[[Image:Pereskia grandifolia3.jpg|thumb|''Pereskia grandifolia'': ''[[Pereskia]]'' is a weakly succulent genus, which also possesses leaves, and is believed to be similar to the ancestor of all cacti.]]
[[Image:Organ-pipe-cactus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stenocereus thurberi|Organ pipe cactus]] in Arizona]]
[[Image:Cactus1web.jpg|thumb|left|Many species of cactus have long, sharp [[spine (botany)|spines]].]]
In most species of cacti the leaves have evolved into [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] which not only defend the cactus against [[herbivore]]s but also provide shade that lowers the plant's water loss through [[transpiration]]. The spines grow from specialized structures called [[areole]]s, homologous to the nodes on other plants. Very few members of the family have leaves, and when present these are usually rudimentary and soon fall off; they are typically awl-shaped and only 1–3&amp;nbsp;mm. long. Two genera, ''[[Pereskia]]'' and ''[[Pereskiopsis]]'', do however retain large, non-succulent leaves 5–25&amp;nbsp;cm long, and non-succulent stems. ''Pereskia'' has now been determined to be the ancestral genus from which all other cacti evolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/uocp-hdc051206.php How did cacti evolve?]&lt;/ref&gt;
Enlarged [[Plant stem|stems]] carry out [[photosynthesis]] and store water. Unlike other succulents, the stem is the only part of many cacti where this takes place.  Cacti often have a waxy coating on their stems to prevent water loss and potentially repel water from their stems.  Because of the plants' high water-retention ability, detached parts of the plant can survive for long periods and then grow new roots from anywhere on the plant body when rain comes.

The bodies of many cacti have become thickened during the course of evolution, and form water-retentive tissue that is in the optimal shape of a sphere or cylinder (combining highest possible volume with lowest possible surface area). By reducing its surface area, the body of the plant is also protected against excessive sunlight.  The plant body itself is also capable of absorbing moisture (through the epidermis and the spines), which is especially important for plants that receive most of their moisture in the form of fog.

Most cacti have a short [[growing season]] and long dormancy. For example, a fully-grown saguaro ''([[Carnegiea gigantea]])'' can absorb up to 3,000 litres of water in ten days{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. This is helped by the ability to form new roots quickly. Two hours after rain following a relatively long drought, root formation begins in response to the moisture. Apart from a few exceptions, an extensively [[ramification (botany)|ramified]] root system is formed, which spreads out beneath the surface. The salt concentration in the root cells is relatively high,&lt;ref name=&quot;GibsonNobel1990&quot;&gt;[Arthur C. Gibson, Park S. Nobel. 1990. The cactus primer. Harvard University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; so when moisture is encountered it is quickly absorbed.

Cacti often have very shallow roots that spread out widely close to the surface to collect water, an adaptation to infrequent rains.  In one case, a young [[saguaro]] only 12&amp;nbsp;cm tall had a root system covering an area 2 m in diameter, but with no roots more than 10&amp;nbsp;cm deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;dalhousie&quot;&gt;[http://cactus.biology.dal.ca/biology.html Dalhousie University: Biology of Cacti]&lt;/ref&gt; The larger columnar cacti also develop a [[taproot]], primarily for anchoring, but also to reach deeper water supplies and mineral nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;dalhousie&quot;/&gt;

''[[Areole]]s'' are unique features to cacti. The areole appears like a cushion with a diameter of up to 15&amp;nbsp;mm, and is formed by two opposing buds in the angles of a leaf{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. The upper bud develops into either a blossom or a side shoot, while the lower bud develops into spines. The two buds of the areoles can lie very close together or be separated by several cm.

Like other types of succulents, cacti reduce water loss through transpiration by [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM).&lt;ref name=&quot;dalhousie&quot;/&gt; Here, transpiration does not take place during the day at the same time as [[photosynthesis]], but at night. The plant stores the [[carbon dioxide]], chemically linking it to [[malic acid]], until nighttime.  Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss through transpiration is significantly reduced.

==Reproductive ecology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
[[Image:Cactus flower closeup03.jpg|thumb|Closeup image of a cactus flower (''[[Echinopsis spachiana]]'') showing large number of stamens.]]
[[Image:Echinopsis - Blüte von der Seite.jpg|thumb|left|Blooming ''[[Echinopsis oxygona]]''. The sweet-smelling flower opens towards evening and dies the following morning.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}]]
Some cactus flowers form long tubes (up to 30 cm) so only certain species of moths can reach the nectar, and therefore pollinate the blossoms. There are also specializations for species of [[bat]]s, [[hummingbird]]s and [[bee]]s. The duration of flowering is highly variable. Some flowers, such as those of ''[[Selenicereus grandiflorus]]'' (''Queen of the Night''), are only fully open for two hours at night, while other species may flower for a whole week. Most cacti are [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]], and thus require a pollinator. A few are [[autogamous]] and are able to pollinate themselves. [[Frailea]]s only open their flowers completely in exceptional circumstances; they mostly pollinate themselves or others with their flowers closed (&quot;cleistogamy&quot;). The flower itself has also undergone a further development: the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] tends to be highly protected by thorns, hairs and scales. Seed formation is prolific, and the fruits are mostly fleshy, pleasant tasting and conspicuously colored. Goats, birds, ants, mice and bats may contribute to seed dispersal.

==History==
Among the remains of the [[Aztec]] civilization, cactus-like plants can be found in pictorial representations, sculpture and drawings, with many depictions resembling ''[[Echinocactus grusonii]]''. [[Tenochtitlan]] (the earlier name of [[Mexico City]]) means &quot;place of the sacred cactus.&quot; The [[coat of arms of Mexico]] to this day shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image which is at the center of the Aztec origin myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aztecs.mrdonn.org/place.html |title=The Awesome Aztecs for Kids - Place of the Prickly Pear Cactus |publisher=Aztecs.mrdonn.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]] brought the first [[melocactus]] to Europe{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

== Cultivation==
[[File:Notocactuswarasii.jpg|Notocactuswarasii|thumb|left|Cultivated ''Notocactus warasii'' on display at the San Diego County Fair, California, USA]]
With few exceptions, the vast majority of cacti in habitat almost always are found growing in mineral based soils.  Epiphytic cacti are the exception and prefer soils rich in organic materials, however, cacti in this group which prefer these types of soils produce healthier plants when allowed to dry completely between waterings.  Some species of cacti such as ''Toumaya papyracantha'' (formerly ''Pediocactus papyracantha'' -- found in the high mesas of New Mexico) are [[mycorrhiza]]l symbionts with the roots of various species of grasses{{Dubious|date=May 2011}} and grow underground on the roots of these wild grasses, only emerging above ground and initiating photosynthesis for sexual reproduction and flowering, forming deciduous cactus bodies that die back in winter or during droughts.

The vast majority of commercial &quot;cactus soil mixes&quot; which contain organic materials are unsuitable for growing most terrestrial cacti{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, and many contain pumice, which exudes traces of heavy metals which will rot the roots of cacti if grown in these medium over a period of years{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  Surprisingly, most cacti prefer a mineral based soil cut with about half sand and allowed to dry out completely between waterings.

Although cacti are adapted to hot deserts and other xerophytic environments, most cacti evolved in mountainous areas{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and require moderate cold and/or cool night temperatures for some period of the year to initiate regular flowering. Overwatering of cacti is the single biggest cause of plant loss{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  Cacti are subject to Fusarium infections in their vascular cambium (the bundle of fibers and the &quot;ring&quot; inside the center of a cactus visible when cut in cross section) when overwatered or maintained in soils with high organic content{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Fusarium mycelium typically grow into the cambium channels and plug up the plants transport system, causing tissue death and the classic rotting and collapsing observed when you overwater a cactus plant.  Cacti are easy to grow if allowed to dry completely between waterings{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  Many species have specific periods of dormancy and should not be watered during these periods.

[[Image:Pricklypearcrop.jpg|thumb|right| [[Opuntia|Prickly pear]] is one of the most common types of cacti found in North America]]
Cacti, cultivated by people worldwide, are a familiar sight as potted plants, [[houseplant]]s or in ornamental gardens in warmer climates. They often form part of [[xeriscaping|xeriphytic (dry) gardens]] in arid regions, or raised rockeries. Some countries, such as Australia, have water restrictions in many cities, so drought-resistant plants are increasing in popularity. Numerous species have entered widespread cultivation, including members of ''[[Echinopsis]]'', ''[[Mammillaria]]'' and ''[[Cereus]]'' among others.

Cacti can be used for fencing material where there is a lack of either natural resources or financial means to construct a permanent fence. This is often seen in [[arid]] and warm climates, such as the [[Maasai Mara]] in Kenya. This is known as a [[cactus fence]]. Cactus fences are often used by homeowners and [[landscape architect]]s for [[home security]] purposes. The sharp thorns of the cactus deter unauthorized persons from entering private properties, and may prevent break-ins if planted under windows and near drainpipes.

Many species of cacti have commercial uses; some cacti bear edible [[fruit]], such as the [[opuntia|prickly pear]] and ''[[Hylocereus]]'', which produces [[dragon fruit]] or [[pitaya]]. The edible cactus, or [[nopal]], industry in Mexico is worth $150 million each year and approximately 10,000 farmers cultivate the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Frank Jack Daniel |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2G28324120070219 |title=Cactus-eating moth threatens favorite Mexican food |publisher=Reuters |date= 2007-02-19|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Opuntia]]'' are also used as host plants for cochineal bugs in the [[cochineal]] dye industry in [[Central America]].  Particularly in [[South America]] dead pillar cacti can yield valuable wood for construction. Some cacti are also of pharmaceutical significance.

The [[peyote]], ''Lophophora williamsii'', is a well-known psychoactive agent used by Native Americans in the southwestern [[United States of America|United States]]. Some species of ''[[Echinopsis]]'' also have psychoactive properties. For example, the San Pedro cactus, a common specimen found in many garden centers, is known to contain [[mescaline]].

Some species have become endangered in the wild because of overharvesting for sale as an ornamental plant.  All cacti are covered by the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]], and many species, by virtue of their inclusion in Appendix 1, are fully protected.

==Etymology==
The word ''cactus'' is derived through Latin from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κάκτος ''kaktos'', which referred to the [[cardoon]] (''Cynara cardunculus''). [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1753 applied this name generically to a genus he called ''Cactus'', which was later reassigned as a family, ''Cactaceae'', and subdivided into multiple genera.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. &quot;cactus&quot;, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50030958.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cactuses'', the Latin plural ''cacti'', the Greek plural ''cactoi'' and the uninflected plural ''cactus'' are all used in English.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary'', s.v. &quot;cactus&quot;, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cactus.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Civilian Conservation Corps'''  ('''CCC''') was a public [[work relief program]] that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men from relief families, ages 18–25. A part of the [[New Deal]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], it provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of [[natural resources]] in rural lands owned by federal, state and local governments. The CCC was designed to provide employment for young men in relief families who had difficulty finding jobs during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] while at the same time implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory. Maximum enrollment at any one time was 300,000; in nine years 2.5 million young men participated. Reserve officers from the U.S. Army were in charge of the camps, but there was no military training or uniforms.  

The American public made the CCC  the most popular of all the  New Deal programs.&lt;ref&gt;Perry H. Merrill, ''Roosevelt's Forest Army, A History of the Civilian Conservation Corps'' (1981) p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Principal benefits of an individual’s enrollment in the CCC included improved physical condition, heightened morale, and increased employability. Of their pay of $30 a month, $25 went to their parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771421,00.html &quot;Conservation: Poor Young Men, ''Time'' Feb. 6, 1939 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Implicitly, the CCC also led to a greater public awareness and appreciation of the outdoors and the nation's natural resources; and the continued need for a carefully planned, comprehensive national program for the protection and development of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allen Ermentrout, &quot;Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps,&quot; (1982) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the time of the CCC, volunteers planted nearly 3 billion trees to help reforest America, constructed more than 800 parks nationwide and upgraded most state parks, updated forest fire fighting methods, and built a network of service buildings and public roadways in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccclegacy.org/ccc_legacy.htm CCC Legacy Web site April 7, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its popular support, the CCC was never a permanent agency. It depended on emergency and temporary Congressional legislation for its existence. By 1942, with the war industries booming and the draft in operation,  need declined and Congress voted to close the program.&lt;ref&gt;Wirth, pp. 105, 142-144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

As governor of New York, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]] had run a similar program on a small scale. Long interested in conservation, Roosevelt was aware of the numerous forestry programs set up in 1931-32 in the U.S. and Europe designed to relieve unemployment by sending young men to work in the woods.  An important theme was the healthy nature of outdoor work versus the debilitating environment of city slums.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Salmond, ''The Civilian Conservation Corps 1933-1942: a New Deal case study.'' (1967), ch. 1 [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ccc/salmond/chap1.htm online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;   Now, as president, he proposed to Congress a much larger national program on 21 March 1933:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Message to Congress on Unemployment Relief. March 21,&quot; ''The Presidential Papers of Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933'' (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I propose to create a civilian conservation corps to be used in simple work, not interfering with normal employment, and confining itself to forestry, the prevention of soil erosion, flood control and similar projects. I call your attention to the fact that this type of work is of definite, practical value, not only through the prevention of great present financial loss, but also as a means of creating future national wealth.}}

He promised this law would provide 250,000 young men with meals, housing, uniforms, and small wages for working in the national forests and other government properties.  FDR issued Executive Order 6101 on 5 April 1933 which established the CCC organization and appointed a director, [[Robert Fechner]], a former labor union official who served until 1939.  The organization and administration of the CCC was a new experiment in operations for a Federal government agency. The order indicated that the program was to be supervised jointly by four Cabinet departments: [[United States Department of War|War]], [[United States Department of Labor|Labor]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], by means of a CCC Advisory Council composed of a representative from each of the supervising departments. In addition, the [[Office of Education]] and [[Veterans Administration]] participated in the program. To end the opposition from labor unions (which wanted no training programs started when so many of their men were unemployed)&lt;ref&gt; Neil M. Maher, ''Nature's New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Roots of the American Environmental Movement'' (2009) p 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Roosevelt picked a union official, Fechner, and took [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]], head of the [[American Federation of Labor]], to the first camp to demonstrate that there would be no job training involved beyond simple manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;On the formation see Frank Freidel, ''Franklin D. Roosevelt: Launching the New Deal'' (1973), 255-266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Years, 1933-1934==

The legislation and mobilization of the program occurred quite rapidly. Within ten days after being introduced to Congress, the ECW Act was signed on 31 March 1933. On 5 April Director Fechner was appointed and War Department corps area commanders were given the task to commence enrollment. The first CCC [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enroll enrollee] was selected 7 April and subsequent lists of unemployed men were supplied by state and local welfare and relief agencies for immediate enrollment. On 17 April the first camp, [http://www.ccclegacy.org/camp_roosevelt_history.htm NF-1, Camp Roosevelt], was established at [[George Washington National Forest]] near Luray, Virginia. By 1 July 1933 there were 1,463 working camps with 250,000 junior enrollees (18–25 years of age), 28,000 [[veterans]], 14,000 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], and 25,000 Locally Enrolled (or Experienced) Men (LEM).&lt;ref&gt;Ermentrout, Robert Allen, &quot;Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps,&quot; (1982) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamphlet: Objectives and Results of the Civilian Conservation Corps Program, Robert Fechner, Director, Civilian Conservation Corps, Washington, D.C. 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enrollees===

The typical CCC enrollee was a U.S. citizen, unmarried, unemployed male, 18–25 years of age. Normally his family was on local relief.  Each enrollee volunteered and, upon passing a physical exam and/or a period of conditioning, was required to serve a minimum six month period with the option to serve as many as four periods, or up to two years if employment outside the Corps was not possible. Enrollees worked 40 hours a week over five days, sometimes including Saturdays if poor weather dictated. In return they received $30 a month with a compulsory allotment $22–25 sent to a family dependent, as well as food, clothing and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Wirth, Conrad L. (1980) ''Parks, Politics and the People'', University of Oklahoma Press, pp. 94-99&lt;/ref&gt; Following the second [[Bonus Army]] march on Washington D.C. a modification of the CCC program through Executive Order 6129 on 11 May now included work opportunities for veterans. Veteran qualifications differed from the junior enrollee; one needed to be certified by the Veterans Administration by application, they could be any age, and married or single as long as they were in need of work. Veterans were mostly assigned to entire veteran camps.&lt;ref&gt;Ermentrout, Robert Allen, &quot;Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps,&quot; (1982) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrollees were eligible for &quot;rated&quot; positions to help with camp administration: senior leader, mess steward, store keeper and two cooks; assistant leader, company clerk, assistant educational advisor and three second cooks. These men received additional pay ranging from $45 to $36 per month depending on their rating.

===Camps===

Each CCC camp was located in the area of particular conservation work to be performed, and organized around a complement of up to 200 civilian enrollees in a designated numbered &quot;company&quot; unit. The CCC camp was a temporary community in itself, structured to have barracks (initially Army tents) for 50 enrollees each, officer/technical staff quarters, medical dispensary, mess hall, recreation hall, educational building, lavatory and showers, technical/administrative offices, tool room/blacksmith shop and motor pool garages.  The company organization of each camp had a dual-authority supervisory staff: firstly, Department of War personnel or [[Reserve components of the United States armed forces|Reserve]] officers (until 1 July 1939), a &quot;company commander&quot; and junior officer, who were responsible for overall camp operation, logistics, education and training; and secondly, ten to fourteen technical service civilians, including a camp &quot;superintendent&quot; and &quot;foreman,&quot; employed by either the Departments of Interior or Agriculture, responsible for the particular field work. Also included in camp operation were several non-technical supervisor LEMs, who provided knowledge of the work at hand, &quot;lay of the land&quot; and paternal guidance for inexperienced enrollees.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Your CCC, A Handbook for Enrollees&quot; Happy Days Pub. Co., Inc. (1940) pp. 8-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ermentrout, Robert Allen, &quot;Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps,&quot; (1982) pp. 16, 76-77&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollees were organized into work detail units called &quot;sections&quot; of 25 men each, according to the barracks they resided in.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;United States Army Civilian Conservation Corps. Company 114th,&quot; Francis P. Waversak, Stone Walls, Spring 1990 p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Each section had an enrollee [[leadership|&quot;senior leader&quot;]] and &quot;assistant leader&quot; who were accountable for the men at work and in the barracks.

===General classifications===

The CCC performed 300 possible types of work projects within ten approved general classifications:
#Structural Improvements: bridges, [[fire lookout tower]]s, service buildings;
#Transportation: truck trails, minor roads, [[hiking trail|foot trails]] and airport landing fields;
#[[Erosion control|Erosion Control]]: check dams, terracing and vegetable covering;
#[[Flood Control]]: irrigation, drainage, dams, ditching, channel work, [[rip rap|riprapping]];
#[[Forestry|Forest Culture]]: planting trees and shrubs, timber stand improvement, seed collection, nursery work;
#[[Forest protection|Forest Protection]]: [[Wildfire|fire]] prevention, fire pre-suppression, fire fighting, [[pest control|insect and disease control]];
#[[Landscape architecture|Landscape]] and Recreation: public camp and picnic ground development, lake and pond site clearing and development;
#[[Rangeland|Range]]: stock driveways, elimination of predatory animals;
#[[Wildlife]]: stream improvement, [[fish stocking]], food and cover planting;
#Miscellaneous: [[emergency service|emergency work]], surveys, mosquito control.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Perry H. (1981) ''Roosevelt's Forest Army, A History of the Civilian Conservation Corps'' P. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses to this six month experimental conservation program were enthusiastic, and on 1 October 1933 Director Fechner was instructed to arrange for a second period of enrollment. By January 1934, the second year of the CCC program, 300,000 men were enrolled. In July 1934 this cap was increased by 50,000 to include men from drought affected states of the mid-west. The temporary tent camps had also transitioned from tents to wooden barracks. An education program had been established emphasizing job training and [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fechner, &quot;Objectives and Results of the Civilian Conservation Corps Program&quot;, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 55% of enrollees were from rural communities, a majority of which were non-farm; 45% came from urban.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Your CCC, A Handbook for Enrollees&quot;, Happy Days Pub. Co., Inc. (1940) pp. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Level of education for the enrollee averaged 3% illiterate, 38% less than eight years of school, 48% did not complete high school, 11% were high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Ermentrout, Robert Allen, &quot;Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps,&quot; (1982) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of entry, 70% of enrollees were malnourished and poorly clothed. Few had work experience beyond occasional odd jobs. Peace was maintained by the threat of &quot;dishonorable discharge&quot;.  &quot;This is a training station we're going to leave morally and physically fit to lick 'Old Man Depression,'&quot; boasted the newsletter of a [[North Carolina]] camp.

===Minorities===
The total of 200,000 African-American enrollees were segregated after 1935 but received equal pay and housing. Black leaders lobbied to secure leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin W. Gower, &quot;The Struggle of Blacks for Leadership Positions in the Civilian Conservation Corps: 1933-1942,&quot; ''Journal of Negro History,'' Vol. 61, No. 2 (April 1976), pp. 123-135 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2717266 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] pressured Director [[Robert Fechner]] to appoint prominent African-Americans to supervisory positions such as education directors in the 143 segregated camps. 

The separate Indian Division was a major relief force for Native Americans.  No women were ever enrolled.

===Indian Division===
The CCC operated an entirely separate division for members of federally recognized Indian tribes: the Indian Emergency Conservation Work, IECW, or CCC-ID. Native men from reservations worked on roads, bridges, clinics, shelters, and other public works near their reservations. Although classified as camps there were no actual permanent camps; instead, organized groups moved with their family from project to project, for which a rental allowance was issued in their pay.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin W..Gower, &quot;The CCC Indian Division: Aid for Depressed Americans, 1933-1942,&quot; ''Minnesota History,'' Apr 1972, Vol. 43 Issue 1, pp 3-13&lt;/ref&gt; The CCC often provided the only paid work in remote reservations. Enrollees had to be between the ages of 17 and 35 years. For example, during 1933 about half the male heads of households on the [[Sioux]] reservations in [[South Dakota]] were employed by the CCC-ID.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bromert, &quot;The Sioux and the Indian-CCC,&quot; ''South Dakota History,'' Fall 1978, Vol. 8 Issue 4, pp 340-356&lt;/ref&gt;  With grants from the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), the Indian Division built schools and operated an extensive road-building program in and around many reservations. The mission was to reduce erosion and improve the value of Indian lands. Crews built dams of many types on creeks, then sowed grass on the eroded areas from which the damming materials had been taken. They built roads and planted shelter-belts on federal lands. The steady income created an improved sense of self-worth for participants who used the funds to improve their lifestyles. The program also trained participants in gardening, stock raising, safety, native arts, and some academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn G. Hanneman, &quot;Baffles, Bridges, and Bermuda: Oklahoma Indians and the Civilian Conservation Corps-Indian  Division,&quot; ''Chronicles of Oklahoma,'' Dec 1999, Vol. 77 Issue 4, pp 428-449&lt;/ref&gt; IECW differed from other CCC activities in that it explicitly trained men to be carpenters, truck drivers, radio operators, mechanics, surveyors, and technicians. A total of 85,000 Indians  were enrolled. This proved valuable human capital for the 24,000 alumni who later served in the military and the 40,000 who left the reservations for war jobs in the cities.

===Program Expansion, 1935-1936===
Responding to favorable public opinion to alleviate unemployment Congress approved the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]], on 8 April 1935, which included continued funding for the CCC program through 31 March 1937. The age limit was also expanded to 18-28 to include more men.&lt;ref&gt;Pamphlet: Objectives and Results of the Civilian Conservation Corps Program, Robert Fechner, Director, Civilian Conservation Corps, Washington, D.C. 1938. p. 11 [http://digilab.browardlibrary.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ccc&amp;CISOPTR=691&amp;CISOSHOW=658]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 April 1935 to 31 March 1936 was the period of greatest activity and work accomplished by the CCC program. Enrollment had peaked at 505,782 in about 2,900 camps by 31 August 1935, followed by a reduction to 350,000 enrollees in 2,019 camps by 30 June 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Ermentrout, Robert Allen, &quot;Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps,&quot; (1982) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the public response to the CCC program was overwhelmingly popular. A [[Gallup poll]] of 18 April 1936, asked &quot;Are you in favor of the CCC camps?&quot;; 82% of respondents said yes, including 92% of [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 67% of [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref&gt;''Public Opinion, 1935-1946'' ed. by Hadley Cantril and Mildred Strunk 1951. p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change of Purpose, 1937-1938===
On 28 June 1937 the Civilian Conservation Corps was legally established, transferred from its original designation as the Emergency Conservation Work program. Funding was also extended for three more years through Public No. 163, [[75th Congress]], effective 1 July 1937. Congress changed the age limits from 17–23 years old, and eliminated the requirement that enrollees be on relief, instead ''&quot;not regularly in attendance at school, or possessing full time employment.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Civilian Conservation Corps, Standards of Eligibility and Selection for Junior Enrollees, United States Dept. of Labor, Office of the Secretary, August 1, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1937 law, in addition to providing employment and performance of useful work made the inclusion of vocational and academic training a mandatory minimum of 10 hours per week, to provide enrollees with necessary training for employment after discharge. Enrollment was also extended to those without dependents; orphans  could make an &quot;enrollee deposit&quot; with the Army finance officer earning 5% interest returned in full at discharge or in emergency. Another change allowed for those in school to be enrolled during (summer) vacation.&lt;ref&gt;Ermentrout, Robert Allen, &quot;Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps,&quot; (1982) pp. 48-49, 51&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the CCC was called in to provide disaster relief following 1937 floods in New York, Vermont and the [[Ohio River flood of 1937|Ohio]] and Mississippi River Valleys, and response and clean-up after the [[New England Hurricane of 1938|1938 hurricane in New England]].

===Conservation to Defense, 1939-1940===
On 30 June 1939 legislation ceased the CCC program to be an independent agency, transferred to the [[Federal Security Agency]] along with the [[Social Security Administration|Social Security Board]], [[National Youth Administration]], U.S. Employment Service, the Office of Education and the [[Works Progress Administration]]. About 5,000 Reserve officers for the camps were affected, transferred to Civil Service and military ranks and titles were eliminated. Despite this loss of an obvious military leadership in the camps by July 1940, with war in Europe and Asia, an increasing number of CCC projects focused on resources for national defense, developing infrastructure for military training facilities and forest protection. By 1940 the CCC was no longer wholly a relief agency, rapidly losing its non-military character, and becoming a system for work-training as its ranks had become increasingly younger, with life-inexperienced enrollees.&lt;ref&gt;Ermentrout, Robert Allen, &quot;Forgotten Men: The Civilian Conservation Corps,&quot; (1982) pp. 55, 62, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and Disbandment 1941-1942===
Although the CCC was probably the most popular New Deal program, it never became a permanent agency. The program had been reduced in operations as the Depression waned and employment opportunities improved. Fewer eligible young men were available after [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|conscription]] commenced in 1940. Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 all federal programs were revised to emphasize the war effort. Most CCC work, except for wildland firefighting, was shifted onto U.S. military bases to help with construction. The CCC disbanded one year earlier than planned, as the [[77th United States Congress]] ceased funding, causing it to conclude operations formally at the end of the federal fiscal year on June 30, 1942. The end of the CCC program and closing of the camps involved arrangements to leave the incomplete work projects in the best possible state, the separation of about 1,800 appointed employees, the transfer of CCC property to the War and Navy Departments and other agencies, and the preparation of final accountability records. Liquidation of the CCC was ordered by Congress by the Labor-Federal Security Appropriation Act (56 Stat. 569) on 2 July 1942; and virtually completed on 30 June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Wirth, Conrad L., ''Civilian Conservation Corps Program of the US Dept. of the Interior, March 1933 to 30 June 1942'', a Report to Harold L. Ickes, January 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Liquidation appropriations for the CCC continued through 20 April 1948.

Some former CCC sites in good condition were reactivated from 1941 to 1947 as [[Civilian Public Service]] camps where [[conscientious objector]]s performed &quot;work of national importance&quot; as an alternative to military service. Other camps were used to hold [[Japanese American internment|Japanese internees]] or German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. After the CCC disbanded, the federal agencies responsible for administration of [[public lands]] organized their own seasonal fire crews, modeled after the CCC, which performed a firefighting function formerly done by the CCC and provided the same sort of outdoor work experience for young people. Approximately 47 young men died while in this line of duty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[File:CCCWorkerStatueSantaFeNM.JPG|thumb|Statue of CCC worker in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]]]
In several cities where CCC workers worked, statues were erected to commemorate their presence.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.newdeallegacy.org/ccc_news.html CCC Statues].&quot; National New Deal Preservation Association. Retrieved on August 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The CCC Model==
The CCC program ended in 1942, but it became a model for conservation programs that were implemented in the period after World War II. Present day corps are national, state and local programs that engage primarily youth and young adults (ages 16–25) in community service, training and educational activities. The nation’s approximate 113 corps programs operate in 41 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. During 2004, they enrolled more than 23,000 young people. The Corps Network, known originally as the [[National Association of Service and Conservation Corps]] (NASCC) works to expand and enhance corps-type programs throughout the country. The Corps Network began during 1985, when the nation's first 24 Corps directors banded together to secure an advocate at the Federal level and a repository of information on how best to start and manage a corps. Early financial assistance from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation|Hewlett]] and [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation|Mott Foundations]] was critical to establishing the association.

Another similar program is the [[National Civilian Community Corps]], part of the AmeriCorps program, a team-based national service program to which 18- to 24-year-olds dedicate 10 months of their time annually.

===Student Conservation Association===
The CCC program became a model for the creation of team-based national service youth conservation programs such as the [[Student Conservation Association]] (SCA). The SCA, founded during 1959, is a nonprofit organization that offers conservation internships and summer trail crew opportunities to more than 4,000 people each year. The SCA mission is to build a new generation of conservation managers by inspiring lifelong [[stewardship]] of the environment and communities by engaging high school and college-age volunteers in hands-on service to the land. SCA program is active nation-wide in the USA, including national and state parks, forests, wildlife refuges, seashores and historic sites. SCA National Headquarters is located in [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]] with regional offices across the country.

===E-Corps===
Established during 1995, Environmental Corps (E-Corps) is an American YouthWorks program which allows youth, ages 17 to 28, to contribute to the restoration and preservation of parks and public lands in Texas. The only conservation corps in Texas, E-Corps is a 501(c)3 non profit corporation based in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas, which serves the entire state. Their work ranges from disaster relief to trail building to habitat restoration. E-Corps has done projects in national, state, and city parks.

===California Conservation Corps===
During 1976, [[Governor of California]] [[Jerry Brown]] established the [[California Conservation Corps]]. This new program differed drastically from the original CCC as its goal was primarily youth development rather than economic revival.

===Montana Conservation Corps===
The [[Montana Conservation Corps]] (MCC) is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to equip young people with the skills and values to be vigorous citizens who improve their communities and environment. Collectively, MCC crews contribute more than 90,000 volunteer hours each year. The MCC was established during 1991 by [[Montana]]'s Human Resource Development Councils in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] and [[Kalispell, Montana|Kalispell]]. Originally, it was a summer program for disadvantaged youth, although it has grown into an AmeriCorps-sponsored non-profit organization with six regional offices that serve Montana, [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], and [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]]. All regions also offer MontanaYES (Youth Engaged in Service) summer programs for teenagers who are 14 to 16 years old.

===Washington Conservation Corps===
The [[Washington Conservation Corps]] (WCC) is a sub-agency of the [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] State Department of Ecology. It employs men and women 18 to 25 years old in a program to protect and enhance Washington's natural resources. WCC is a part of the [[AmeriCorps]] program.

===Minnesota Conservation Corps===
The Minnesota Conservation Corps provides environmental stewardship and service-learning opportunities to youth and young adults while accomplishing conservation, natural resource management projects and emergency response work through its Young Adult Program and the Summer Youth Program. These programs emphasize the development of job and life skills by conservation and community service work.

===Vermont Youth Conservation Corps===
The Vermont Youth Conservation Corps (VYCC) is a non-profit, youth service and education organization that hires Corps Members, aged 16–24, to work on high-priority conservation projects in Vermont. Through these work projects, Corps Members develop a strong work ethic, strengthen their leadership skills, and learn how to take personal responsibility for their actions. VYCC Crews work at VT State Parks, U.S. Forest Service Campgrounds, in local communities, and throughout the state's backcountry.

===Southwest Conservation Corps===
The Southwest Conservation Corps (SCC) is a non-profit employment, job training, and education organization with locations in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] and [[Salida, Colorado]], and [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccorps.org Sccorps.org]&lt;/ref&gt; SCC formed as a merger of the Southwest Youth Corps and the Youth Corps of Southern Arizona.

SCC hires young adults ages 14 to 25 and organizes them into crews emphasizing the completion of conservation projects on public lands. Corpsmembers work, learn and commonly camp in teams of six under the supervision of two professional crew leaders.

The '''Caribbean Sea''' is a [[sea]] of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] situated in the tropics of the [[Western Hemisphere|Western hemisphere]]. It is bounded by [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] to the west and southwest, to the north by the [[Greater Antilles]], and to the east by the [[Lesser Antilles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/latin_america_and_caribbean/our_solutions/marine_turtle_programme/projects/hawksbill_caribbean_english/caribbean_sea/index.cfm The Caribbean Sea] World Wildlife Fund. Website last accessed 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire area of the Caribbean Sea, the numerous islands of the [[West Indies]], and adjacent coasts, are collectively known as the '''[[Caribbean]]'''. The Caribbean Sea is one of the largest salt water seas and has an area of about 2,754,000&amp;nbsp;km² (1,063,000 sq. mi.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allthesea.com/Caribbean-Sea.html The Caribbean Sea] All The Sea. URL last accessed May 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The sea's deepest point is the [[Cayman Trough]], between the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, at 7,686 m (25,220&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level. The Caribbean coastline has many gulfs and bays: the [[Gulf of Gonâve]], [[Gulf of Venezuela]], [[Gulf of Darién]], [[Golfo de los Mosquitos]], [[Gulf of Paria]] and [[Gulf of Honduras]].

==History==
{{main|History of the Caribbean}}

[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|left|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus]] landing on [[Hispaniola]] in 1492.]]
The name &quot;Caribbean&quot; is derived from the [[Carib people|Carib]]s, one of the dominant [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] groups in the region at the time of [[Europe]]an contact during the late 15th century. After the discovery of the [[West Indies]] by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, the Spanish term [[Antillas]] was assigned to the lands; stemming from this, &quot;Sea of the Antilles&quot; is a common alternative name for the Caribbean Sea in various European languages. During the first century of development, the Spanish dominance was undisputed.

[[File:Tulum-Seaside-2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tulum]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] city on the coast of the Caribbean in the state of [[Quintana Roo]] ([[Mexico]]).]]

The Caribbean Sea was an unknown body of water to the populations of [[Eurasia]] until 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] first sailed into Caribbean waters on a quest to find a sea route to Asia. At that time the Western Hemisphere in general was unknown to Europeans. Following the discovery of the islands by Columbus, the area was quickly colonised by several [[Western culture]]s. Following the colonisation of the Caribbean islands, the Caribbean Sea became a busy area for European-based marine trading and transport, and this commerce eventually attracted [[piracy]].

Today the area is home to 22 island territories and borders 12 continental countries. Due to the abundance of sunshine, year-round tropical temperatures moderated by the almost constant [[trade winds]], and the great variety of scenic destinations to visit, during the second half of the 20th century on into the 21st, the Caribbean Sea became a popular place for tourism. This trend has favoured the increasing development of the cruise industry in the area, see [[Cruising (maritime)|Cruising]] and [[Cruise ship]].

==Extent==
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Caribbean Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''In the [[Yucatán Channel|Yucatan Channel]].'' The same limit as that described for the [[Gulf of Mexico]] [A line joining [[Cape Catoche]] Light ({{coord|21|37|N|87|04|W|display=inline}}) with the Light on [[Cape San Antonio, Cuba|Cape San Antonio]] in [[Cuba]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;''On the North.'' In the [[Windward Passage|Windward Channel]] - a line joining Caleta Point (74°15'W) and Pearl Point (19°40'N) in [[Haiti|Haïti]]. In the [[Mona Passage]] - a line joining [[Cape Engaño (Dominican Republic)|Cape Engano]] and the extreme of Agujereada ({{coord|18|31|N|67|08|W|display=inline}}) in [[Puerto Rico]].
&lt;p&gt;''Eastern limits.'' From Point San Diego (Puerto Rico) Northward along the meridian thereof (65°39'W) to the 100 fathom line, thence Eastward and Southward, in such a manner that all islands, shoals and narrow waters of the [[Lesser Antilles]] are included in the Caribbean Sea as far as [[Galera Point]] (Northeast extremity of the island of [[Trinidad]]). From Galera Point through Trinidad to Galeota Point (Southeast extreme) and thence to Baja Point ({{coord|9|32|N|61|0|W|display=inline}}) in [[Venezuela]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Geology==
The Caribbean Sea is an oceanic sea largely situated on the [[Caribbean Plate]]. Estimates of the sea's age range from 20,000 years to 570 million years. The Caribbean sea floor is divided into five [[Oceanic basin|basins]] separated from each other by underwater ridges and mountain ranges. Atlantic Ocean enters the Caribbean through the ''Anegada Passage'' lying between the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Virgin Islands]] and the ''Windward Passage'' located between [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The [[Yucatan Channel]] between Mexico and Cuba links the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with the Caribbean. The deepest points of the sea lie in [[Cayman Trough]] with depths reaching approximately 7,686 m (25,220&amp;nbsp;ft). Despite this, the Caribbean Sea is considered a relatively shallow sea in comparison to other bodies of water.

The Caribbean sea floor is also home to two [[oceanic trench]]es: the [[Hispaniola Trench]] and [[Puerto Rico Trench]], which put the area at a higher risk of [[earthquake]]s. Underwater earthquakes pose a threat of generating [[tsunami]]s which could have a devastating effect on the Caribbean islands. Scientific data reveals that over the last 500 years the area has seen a dozen earthquakes above 7.5 magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dawicki | first = Shelley | url = http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=3964 | title = Tsunamis in the Caribbean? It's Possible. | format = | work = | publisher = Oceanus | accessdate = April 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, a 7.1 earthquake struck [[Haiti]] on January 12, 2010.

The Caribbean is home to about 9% of the world's [[coral reef]]s covering about {{convert|20000|mi2|km2}}, most of which are located off the Caribbean Islands and the [[Central America]]n coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marine.wri.org/pubs_content_text.cfm?ContentID=744 Status of coral reefs in the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean] World Resource Institute. URL accessed on April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the past ten years, unusually warm Caribbean waters have been increasingly threatening Caribbean coral reefs. Coral reefs support some of the most diverse marine habitats in the world, but they are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time, microscopic plants called [[zooxanthellae]], which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues, die off. These plants provide food for the corals, and give them their color. The result of the death and dispersal of these tiny plants is called [[coral bleaching]], and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef.

The habitats supported by the reefs are critical to such tourist activities as [[fishing]] and [[diving]], and provide an annual economic value to Caribbean nations of $3.1-$4.6 billion. Continued destruction of the reefs could severely damage the region's economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3679332.stm Alarm sounded for Caribbean coral]. BBC News. URL accessed on April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Protocol of the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region'' came in effect in 1986 to protect the various endangered marine life of the Caribbean through forbidding human activities that would advance the continued destruction of such marine life in various areas. Currently this protocol has been [[ratified]] by 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/international/spaw.htm Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (SPAW)] NOAA Fisheries:

==Weather==
[[File:NASA ASMR-E image of average SSTs of Hurricane Katrina.jpg|thumb|left|Average sea surface temperatures for the Caribbean Atlantic Ocean (25–27 August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/hurricane_record.html NASA Satellites Record a Month for the Hurricane History Books]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurricane Katrina]] is seen just above [[Cuba]].]]

The Caribbean weather is influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[Humboldt Current]] [[ocean current]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, Alvin (1998) Weather And Climate (Science Concepts); page 17. 21st Century. ISBN 0-7613-3223-5&lt;/ref&gt; The tropical location of the sea helps the water to maintain a warm temperature ranging from the low of 70 to mid-80 [[degrees Fahrenheit]] by the season.

The Caribbean is a focal area for many [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s within the Western Hemisphere. A series of low pressure systems develop off the West coast of Africa and make their way across the Atlantic Ocean. While most of these systems do not become tropical storms, some do. The tropical storms can develop into [[Atlantic hurricane]]s, often in the low pressure areas of the eastern Caribbean. The Caribbean hurricane season as a whole lasts from June through November, with the majority of hurricanes occurring during August and September. On average around 9 tropical storms form each year, with 5 reaching hurricane strength. According to the [[National Hurricane Center]] 385 hurricanes occurred in the Caribbean between 1494 and 1900.

Every year hurricanes represent a potential threat to the islands of the Caribbean, due to the extremely destructive nature of these powerful weather systems. Coral reefs can easily be damaged by violent wave action, and can be destroyed when a hurricane dumps sand or mud onto a reef. When this happens, the coral organisms are smothered and the reef dies and ultimately breaks apart.

==Economy and human activity==
[[File:Playa Puerto Cruz.JPG|thumb|right|A Caribbean beach in [[Isla Margarita]], [[Venezuela]].]]
The Caribbean region has seen a significant increase in human activity since the colonisation period. The sea is one of the largest oil production areas in the world, producing approximately 170 million tons per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;marinepollution&quot;&gt;[http://www.cep.unep.org/issues/lbsp.html An Overview of Land Based Sources of Marine Pollution] Caribbean Environment Programme. URL last accessed May 14, 1 B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The area also generates a large fishing industry for the surrounding countries, accounting for half a million metric tons of fish a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://na.nefsc.noaa.gov/lme/text/lme12.htm#fish LME 12: Caribbean Sea] NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center Narragansett Laboratory. URL last accessed May 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human activity in the area also accounts for a significant amount of pollution, The Pan American Health Organization estimated in 1993 that only about 10% of the sewage from the Central American and Caribbean Island countries is properly treated before being released into the Sea.&lt;ref name=marinepollution/&gt;

The Caribbean region supports a large tourist industry. The ''Caribbean Tourism Organization'' calculates that about 12 million people a year visit the area, including (in 1991–1992) about 8 million Cruise Ship tourists. Tourism based upon scuba diving and snorkeling on coral reefs of many Caribbean islands makes a major contribution to their economies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/publication/content/7909  Reefs at Risk in the Caribbean: Economic Valuation Methodology] World Resources Institute 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The Caribbean is the setting for countless literary efforts often related to [[piracy]] acts and [[swashbuckling]]. One memorable work of pulp fiction has in its title a geographic feature unique in its way to the islands: ''[[Fear Cay]]'', the eleventh  [[Doc Savage]] adventure by [[Lester Dent]]. Many [[James Bond]] adventures were set there. All of the action of the [[Monkey Island series]] videogames takes place within the Carribean sea area. It is also well known as the location of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean films]], featuring [[Port Royal]]. Less swashbuckling, but not lacking in man-against-the-sea exploits, is Peter Matthiessen's ''Far Tortuga'' (1975), which chronicles the adventures of a turtling crew in the late 1960s.

'''Colin Maclaurin''' (February 1698 – 14 June 1746) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[mathematician]].  Due to changes in [[orthography]] since that time (his name was originally rendered as ''e.g.'' &quot;'''M'Laurine'''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Maclaurin_EMS_notes.html &quot;Colin Maclaurin: A Biographical Note&quot; by Robin Schlapp (6 December 1946)]. (Note that the quotation in [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Turnbull_Maclaurin_1.html] has been altered.)&lt;/ref&gt;), his surname is alternatively written '''MacLaurin.'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.m-a.org.uk/docs/library/2064.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] the name is &quot;Cailean MacLabhruinn&quot;, which is literally 'Colin, the son of Laurence.'&lt;ref&gt;http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Turnbull_Maclaurin_1.html Turnbull lectures on Colin Maclaurin (4 February 1947), Part I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Maclaurin was born in [[Kilmodan]], [[Argyll]]. His father, Reverend and Minister of [[Glendaruel]] John Maclaurin, died when Maclaurin was in infancy, and his mother before he reached nine years of age. He was then educated under the care of his uncle, the Reverend Daniel Maclaurin, minister of Kilfinnan.

At eleven, Maclaurin entered the [[University of Glasgow]]. He would graduate MA three years later by defending a thesis on ''the Power of Gravity,'' and remain at Glasgow to study [[divinity]] until he was 19, when he was elected professor of [[mathematics]] in a ten-day competition at the Marischal College in the [[University of Aberdeen]]. He would hold the record as the world's youngest professor until March 2008, when the record was officially given to [[Alia Sabur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theind&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/university-appoints-child-prodigy-worlds-youngest-professor-818776.html|title=University appoints world's youngest professor|publisher=The Independent|author=David McNeill|date=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the vacations of 1719 and 1721, Maclaurin went to [[London, England|London]], where he became acquainted with Sir [[Isaac Newton]], Dr. Hoadley, Dr. [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Martin Folkes]], and other eminent philosophers. He was admitted a member of the [[Royal Society]].

In 1722, having provided a substitute for his class at Aberdeen, he traveled on the Continent as tutor to George Hume, the son of Alexander Hume, 2nd Earl of Marchmont. During their time in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], he wrote his essay on the ''Percussion of Bodies'', which would gain the prize of the [[Royal Academy of Sciences]] in 1724. Upon the death of his pupil at [[Montpellier]], Maclaurin returned to Aberdeen.

In 1725 Maclaurin was appointed deputy to the mathematical professor at [[Edinburgh]], James Gregory (brother of [[David Gregory]] and nephew of the esteemed [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]]), upon the recommendation of [[Isaac Newton]]. On November 3 of that year Maclaurin would succeed Gregory, and be credited with raising the character of that university as a school of science. Newton was so impressed with Maclaurin that he had offered to pay his salary himself.

Though [[Taylor series]] were known before Newton and Gregory {{harv|Grabiner|1997}}, and in special cases by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] in fourteenth century India, [[Maclaurin]] attributed Taylor in his work on approximating functions by series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Maclaurin was unaware and published his work in ''Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa,''  [[Maclaurin series]] which are Taylor series expanded around 0, and are not attributed to Maclaurin due to the past discoveries, but still receive credit because of his use of them.  In particular, he used these series to characterize maxima, minima, and points of inflection for infinitely differentiable functions.

Maclaurin also made significant contributions to the gravitation attraction of ellipsoids, a subject that furthermore attracted the attention of d'Alembert, A.-C. Clairaut, Euler, Laplace, Legendre, Poisson and Gauss.  Maclaurin showed that an oblate spheroid was a possible equilibrium in Newton's theory of gravity.  The subject continues to be of scientific interest, and Nobel Laureate [[Subramanyan Chandrasekhar]] dedicated a chapter of his book ''Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium'' to Maclaurin spheroids. {{harv|Grabiner|1997}}

Independently from [[Euler]] and using the same methods, Maclaurin discovered the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]].  He used it to sum powers of [[arithmetic progressions]], derive [[Stirling's formula]], and to derive the Newton-Cotes numerical integration formulas which includes [[Simpson's rule]] as a special case. {{harv|Grabiner|1997}}

Maclaurin contributed to the study of [[elliptic integrals]], reducing many intractable integrals to problems of finding arcs for hyperbolas.  His work was continued by d'Alembert and Euler, who gave a more concise approach.{{harv|Grabiner|1997}}

In 1733, Maclaurin married Anne Stewart, the daughter of [[Walter Stewart (solicitor)|Walter Stewart]], the [[Solicitor General for Scotland]], by whom he had seven children.  

Maclaurin actively opposed the  [[Jacobite Risings#The Rebellion/Rising of 1745 ('The Forty-Five')|Jacobite Rebellion of 1745]] and superintended the operations necessary for the defence of Edinburgh against the Highland army. Upon entry into the city, however, he fled to [[York]], where he was invited to stay by the [[Archbishop of York]]. 

[[Image:Maclaurin grave.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Memorial, Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh]]

On his journey south, Maclaurin fell from his horse, and the fatigue, anxiety, and cold to which he was exposed on that occasion laid the foundations of [[dropsy]]. He returned to Edinburgh after the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] army marched south, but died soon after his return. 

He is buried at [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], [[Edinburgh]].

Some of his important works are:

*''Geometria Organica'' - 1720
*''De Linearum Geometricarum Proprietatibus'' - 1720
*''Treatise on Fluxions'' - 1742 (763 pages in two volumes. The first systematic exposition of Newton's methods.)
*''Treatise on Algebra'' - 1748 (two years after his death.)
*''Account of Newton's Discoveries'' - Incomplete upon his death and published in 1750 or 1748 (sources disagree.)

Mathematician and former [[MIT]] President [[Richard Cockburn Maclaurin]] is from the same family.

Colin Maclaurin was the name used for the new Mathematics and Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics Building at [[Heriot-Watt University]], Edinburgh.

A '''Covenant-breaker''' or the act of '''Covenant-breaking''' is a term used by [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] to refer to a particular form of [[heresy]]. Being declared a Covenant-breaker by the head of the Faith &amp;mdash; which since 1963 refers to the elected nine-member [[Universal House of Justice]], the governing body of the Bahá'ís. Bahá'ís avoid association with them, even if the Covenant-breaker is a family member.  The authority to declare a Bahá'í a Covenant-breaker resides solely with the head of the Bahá'í Faith.

==Definition==
Covenant-breaking does not refer to attacks from those who are not Bahá'ís or who have left the Bahá'í Faith out of disagreement with its tenets.  Rather it is in reference to internal campaigns of opposition whereby the Covenant-breaker is seen to be as one who is challenging the internal succession of the Faith and thereby causing internal division, or by claiming or supporting an alternate succession of authority or administrative structure.

In a letter to an individual dated 23 March 1975, the Universal House of Justice wrote: 
{{quote|When a person declares his acceptance of Bahá'u'lláh as a Manifestation of God he becomes a party to the Covenant and accepts the totality of His Revelation. If he then turns round and attacks Bahá'u'lláh or the Central Institution of the Faith he violates the Covenant. If this happens every effort is made to help that person to see the illogicality and error of his actions, but if he persists he must, in accordance with the instructions of Bahá'u'lláh Himself, be shunned as a Covenant-breaker.}}

The term 'Covenant-breaker' or, in Arabic 'naqid al-mithaq' [pl. Naqidu 'l-mithaq], was first used by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] to describe the partisans of his brother [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], who challenged his leadership.  In `Abdu'l-Bahá's [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]], He appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, called for the eventual election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], and defined in the same manner opposition to these two institutions as Covenant-Breaking.  `Abdu'l-Bahá advised all Bahá'ís to shun anyone opposing the Covenant: &quot;...one of the greatest and most fundamental principles of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid entirely the Covenant-breakers, for they will utterly destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and render of no account all efforts exerted in the past.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Will And Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá'', [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/wt-2.html#gr10 p 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorization==
=== Included categories of people ===
While most Covenant-breakers are involved in schismatic groups, that is not always the case.  For example, a Bahá'í who refuses to shun Covenant-breakers is at risk of being named one. One article&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant The Covenant, and Covenant-breaker], by Moojan Momen&lt;/ref&gt; originally written for the Bahá'í Encyclopedia, characterized Covenant-breakers that have emerged in the course of Bahá'í history as belonging to one of four categories:

#Leadership challenge: These are persons who dispute the authority and legitimacy of the head of the religion and advance claims either for themselves or for another. The main examples of these are [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]] and [[Mason Remey|Charles Mason Remey]].
#Dissidence: Those who disagree with the policies and actions of the head of the religion without, however, advancing an alternative claim for leadership. This group consisted mostly of opponents of the Bahá'í administration such as [[Ruth White (Bahá'í author)|Ruth White]] and [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]].
#Disobedience: Those who disobey certain direct instructions from the head of the religion.  Mostly the instruction in question is to cease to associate with a Covenant-breaker. Examples of this type include most of the descendants of `Abdu'l-Bahá during Shoghi Effendi's time.
#Apostates who maliciously attack the Bahá'í Faith. Examples include [[Ávárih]] and [[Níkú]].

=== Excluded categories of people ===
Shoghi Effendi wrote to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada in 1957: 
{{quote|People who have withdrawn from the Cause because they no longer feel that they can support its Teachings and Institutions sincerely, are not Covenant-breakers -- they are non-Bahá'ís and should just be treated as such. Only those who ally themselves actively with known enemies of the Faith who are Covenant-breakers, and who attack the Faith in the same spirit as these people, can be considered, themselves, to be Covenant-breakers.&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi, Messages to Canada, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beyond this, many other relationships to the Bahá'í Faith exist, both positive and negative.  Covenant-breaking does not apply to most of them. The following is a partial list of those who could not rightly be termed Covenant-breakers:

* Members of other religions or no religion without any particular relationship to the Bahá'í Faith.
* Bahá'ís who simply leave the religion. (see above)
* Bahá'ís who, in the estimation of the head of the religion have insufficiently understood the nature of the covenant from the start.  These are sometimes &quot;disenrolled&quot; and are considered to have never actually been Bahá'ís, given their fundamental diversion from this core Bahá'í doctrine.
* External enemies of the Bahá'í Faith.

===Bábís===
[[Bábís]] are generally regarded as another religion altogether. Since Covenant-breaking presumes that one has submitted oneself to a covenant and then broken it, and Bábís never swore allegiance to Bahá'u'lláh, they are not subject to shunning. However, followers of [[Subh-i-Azal]], Bahá'u'lláh's half-brother who tried to poison him, were engaged in active opposition to Bahá'ís, and Shoghi Effendi did inform Bahá'ís that they should avoid contact with the descendants of Azal, writing that &quot;No intelligent and loyal Baha'i would associate with a descendant of Azal, if he traced the slightest breath of criticism of our Faith, in any aspect, from that person. In fact these people should be strenuously avoided as having an inherited spiritual disease -- the disease of Covenant-breaking!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi, From letter dated 9 December 1948 to an individual believer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Covenant-Breaking in Shoghi Effendi's immediate family==
Through the influence of [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|Bahiyyih Khanum]], the eldest daughter of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], everyone in the household initially rallied around [[Shoghi Effendi]] after the death of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]. For several years his brother Husayn and several cousins served him as secretaries. The only ones publicly opposing him were Mirza Muhammad-Ali and his followers, who had been declared Covenant-breakers by `Abdu'l-Bahá. Contrary to `Abdu'l-Bahá's specific instruction, certain family members established illicit links with those declared Covenant-breakers by `Abdu'l-Bahá after Bahiyyih Khanum died in 1932, first resulting in the marriage of Shoghi Effendi's eldest sister--Ruhangiz --to a son of [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|Siyyid Ali Afnan]], Bahá'u'lláh's son-in-law, and a long-standing enemy of `Abdu'l-Bahá who had declared him a Covenant-breaker. Through Ruhangiz's efforts, Shoghi Effendi's other sister and his cousin Thurayya also married sons of Siyyid Ali Afnan. Presumably being faced with a choice between shunning their family members and being disobedient to `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, his cousins, aunts and uncles chose the latter.

===Ruhi Afnan===
After years of silence on these developments, cables sent by [[Shoghi Effendi]] on 2 November 1941 provide background to developments among family members. Ruhi Afnan, Shoghi Effendi's cousin through [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s daughter Tuba:

* &quot;Ruhi's sister married Covenant-breaker Faydi whose mother joined and supported arch-enemy Muhammad-`Ali and whose father `Abdu'l-Bahá denounced openly and repeatedly as His deadly enemy. Ruhi's family concurred. Inform all believers all manner communication excommunicated family forbidden.&quot;

Then in a 1950 cable:

* &quot;Inform friends that Ruhi, his mother, with Ruha, his aunt, and their families, not content with years of disobedience and unworthy conduct, are now showing open defiance.&quot; (''Citadel of Faith'', p.87)

And in 1953:

* &quot;Treacherous Ruhi Afnan, not content with previous disobedience, correspondence with [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]], contact with old Covenant-breakers, sale, in conjunction with other members of family, of sacred property purchased by Founder of Faith, and allowing his sister to marry son of `Abdu'l-Bahá's enemy, is now openly lecturing on Bahá'í movement, claiming to be its exponent and is misrepresenting the teachings and deliberately causing confusion in minds of authorities and the local population. Inform National Assemblies.&quot; (''Messages to the Bahá'í World - 1950-1957'', p.48)

Later, Ruhi was presented with a copy of Sohrab's book about his excommunication:

:&quot;… under ordinary circumstances he would have been very much elated, and therefore thankful to see someone make such records of his services to the Cause, but that the references to the Guardian and the Administration changed his attitude completely. He did not wish to be defended; he felt that he must suffer in silence and be true to the Master’s last will and testament. Then Ruhi Effendi referred to Ahmad as being in the same plight as himself, but reacting differently. He thought this very regrettable.&quot; [p. 281]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol2/newhist1.html From Gaslight to Dawn 10-19&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Munib Shahid===
Concerning Munib Shahid, Shoghi Effendi's cousin through `Abdu'l-Bahá's daughter Ruha, Shoghi Effendi sent the following cable to the Bahá'í world in November 1944:

* &quot;Monib Shahid, grandson of both `Abdu'l-Bahá and the [[Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn|King of Martyrs]], married according to the Moslem rites the daughter of a political exile who is nephew of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. This treacherous act of alliance with enemies of the Faith merits condemnation of entire Bahá'í world.&quot; (''Bahá'í News'', No. 172)

===Husayn===
Concerning his own brother Husayn, Shoghi Effendi sent the following cable to the Bahá'í world in April 1945:

* &quot;My faithless brother Husayn, after long period of dishonourable conduct, has abandoned the Master's home to consort with his sister and other Covenant-breakers.&quot; (''Bahá'í News'', No. 174)

===Riaz===
Concerning his own brother Riaz, the following cable was sent in December 1951:

* &quot;With feeling profound concern, grief, indignation, am compelled disclose Bahá'í world recent developments Holy Land furnishing further incontestable proof relationship established old and new Covenant-breakers demonstrating increasing boldness, marked, tragic decline in character and spiritual condition grandchildren `Abdu'l-Bahá. Their shameful attitude and conduct receiving approbation their elders. Evidences multiplying attesting Ruhi's increasing rebelliousness, efforts exerted my eldest sister pave way fourth alliance members family Siyyid Ali involving marriage his granddaughter with Ruha's son and personal contact recently established my own treacherous, despicable brother Riaz with Majdi'd-Din, redoubtable enemy Faith, former henchman Muhammad-'Ali, Archbreaker Bahá'u'lláh's Covenant. Convey information all National Assemblies.&quot; (''Messages to the Bahá'í World - 1950-1957'', p. 16)

===Mehrangiz===
He dispatched a cable concerning his younger sister in December 1941:

* &quot;Sister Mehrangis [Mehrangiz] followed example Ruhi's [Ruhi] sister Justice demands announce believers her expulsion.&quot; (''Unfolding Destiny'', p.149)

==Resultant groups==
{{main|Bahá'í divisions}}
Most of the groups regarded by the larger group of Bahá'ís as Covenant-breakers originated in the claims of Charles Mason Remey to the Guardianship in 1960.  The [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]] states that Guardians should be [[lineal primogeniture|lineal descendant]]s of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], that each Guardian must select his successor during his lifetime, and that the nine [[Hands of the Cause of God]] permanently stationed in the [[holy land]] must approve the appointment by majority vote.  Bahá'ís interpret lineal descendency to mean physical familial relation to Bahá'u'lláh, of which Mason Remey was not.

The majority of Bahá'ís accepted the determination of the [[Hands of the Cause]] upon the death of Shoghi Effendi, that he died &quot;without having appointed his successor&quot;, owing to an absence of a valid descendant of Bahá'u'lláh who could qualify under the terms of `Abdu'l-Bahá's will. Later the [[Universal House of Justice]], first elected in 1963, made a ruling on the subject that it was not possible for another Guardian to be appointed.  

In 1960 Remey, a Hand of the Cause himself, retracted his earlier position, and claimed to have been coerced.  He claimed to be the successor to Shoghi Effendi.  He and the small number of Bahá'ís who followed him were expelled from the majority group by the Hands of the Cause. Those close to Remey claimed that he went senile in old age, and by the time of his death he was largely abandoned, with his most prominent followers fighting amongst themselves for leadership.

The largest of the remaining followers of Remey, members of the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]], believe that legitimate authority passed from Shoghi Effendi to Mason Remey to Joel Marangella. They, therefore, regard the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, Israel to be illegitimate, and its members and followers to be Covenant-breakers.

The present descendants of expelled members of Bahá'u'lláh's family have not specifically been declared Covenant-breakers, though they mostly do not associate themselves with the Bahá'í religion.  A small group of Bahá'ís in Northern New Mexico believe that these descendants are eligible for appointment to the Guardianship and are waiting for such a direct descendant of Bahá'u'lláh to arise as the rightful Guardian.

There is also a small group in Montana, originally formed around the personality of Leland Jensen, who claimed a status higher than that of the Guardian. His failed apocalyptic predictions and unsuccessful efforts to reestablish the Guardianship and the administration were apparent by his death in 1996. A dispute among Jensen's followers over the identity of the Guardian resulted in another division in 2001.

'''Concord''' is a village in [[Jackson County, Michigan|Jackson County]] in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. The population was 1,101 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The village is located at {{Coord|42|10|40|N|84|38|35|W|}}, west of [[Spring Arbor, Michigan]].

== Government ==
Concord is a general-law village incorporated within the [[Concord Township, Michigan|Township of Concord]].

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 1.5 square miles (3.8&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (6.37%) is water.

The village is located within the T3S R3W [[survey township]].

==Demographics==
As of the census{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 1,101 people, 428 households, and 308 families residing in the village.  The population density was 748.4 per square mile (289.2/km²).  There were 499 housing units at an average density of 339.2 per square mile (131.1/km²).  The racial makeup of the village was 97.91% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.09% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.27% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.73% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.64% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.36% from two or more races.  0.82% of the population were [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

There were 428 households out of which 34.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.9% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.0% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.09.

In the village the population was spread out with 28.1% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 28.2% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 14.5% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 92.8 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.7 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $46,500, and the median income for a family was $54,531. Males had a median income of $39,167 versus $23,594 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the village was $19,348.  About 4.8% of families and 5.2% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.1% of those under age 18 and 7.1% of those age 65 or over.

Concord Community Schools (Enrollment 900) participate in Class C and Division 4 of MHSAA athletics. Their teams are known as the Yellowjackets and play in the Big 8 Conference. The schools' colors are purple and gold. Most recently, the boys' cross country and track &amp; field teams both claimed MHSAA State Championships during the 2009–10 school year.

The '''Chaos Computer Club''' ('''CCC''') is an organization of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]. The CCC is based in [[Germany]] and other [[German Language|German]]-speaking countries and currently has over 9,000 members. 

The CCC describes itself as &quot;a galactic community of life forms, independent of age, sex, race or societal orientation, which strives across borders for freedom of information....&quot; In general, the CCC advocates more transparency in government, freedom of information, and [[human rights|human right]] to [[communication]]. Supporting the principles of the [[hacker ethic]], the club also fights for free access to computers and technological infrastructure for everybody.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==History==
The CCC was founded in [[Berlin]] on September 12, 1981 at the [[Kommune 1]]'s table in the rooms of the newspaper [[Die Tageszeitung]] by [[Wau Holland]] and others in anticipation of the prominent role that information technology would play in the way people live and communicate. 

The CCC became world famous when they drew public attention to the security flaws of the German [[Bildschirmtext]] computer network by causing it to debit a bank in Hamburg [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 134,000 in favor of the club. The money was returned the next day in front of the press. Prior to the incident, the system provider had failed to react to proof of the security flaw provided by the CCC, claiming to the public that their system was safe. Bildschirmtext was the biggest commercially available online system targeted at the general public in its region at that time, run and heavily advertised by the German telecommunications agency ([[Deutsche Bundespost]]) which also strove to keep up-to-date alternatives out of the market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1989, the CCC was peripherally involved in the first [[cyberespionage]] case to make international headlines.  A group of [[West Germany|German]] hackers led by [[Hagbard (Karl Koch)|Karl Koch]], who was loosely affiliated with the CCC, was arrested for breaking into US government and corporate computers and selling operating-system source code to the Soviet [[KGB]].

Several of the CCC's early exploits are documented in a paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Kent | last = Anderson | title = Hacktivism and Politically Motivated Computer Crime   | year = 2006 | url = http://www.aracnet.com/~kea/Papers/Politically%20Motivated%20Computer%20Crime.pdf | accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s lead European Investigator of the CCC's activities in the 1980s and 1990s.  These include the CCC protests against [[French nuclear tests]] and members of the CCC involved with the [[German Green Party]].

The CCC is more widely known for its public demonstrations of security risks. In 1996, CCC members demonstrated an attack against [[Microsoft]]'s [[ActiveX]] technology, changing personal data in a [[Quicken]] database. In April 1998, the CCC successfully demonstrated the cloning of a [[GSM]] customer card, breaking the COMP128 encryption algorithm used at that time by many GSM [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.de/gsm/ CCC | CCC klont D2 Kundenkarte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the CCC celebrated its twentieth birthday with an interactive light installation dubbed [[Project Blinkenlights]] that turned the building [[Haus des Lehrers]] in [[Berlin]] into a giant computer screen. A follow up installation (dubbed &quot;[[Video arcade|Arcade]]&quot;) at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] was the world's biggest light installation ever.

In March 2008, the CCC acquired and published the fingerprints of German [[Minister of the Interior (Germany)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]. The magazine also included the fingerprint on a film that readers could use to fool [[fingerprint reader]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-online.com/newsticker/news/item/CCC-publishes-fingerprints-of-German-Home-Secretary-734713.html CCC publishes fingerprints of Wolfgang Schäuble, the German Home Secretary], ''Heise Online'', published 2008-03-31, accessed 2008-04-17&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to protest the use of biometric data in German identity devices such as [[Biometric passport|e-passports]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/security/CCC-publiziert-die-Fingerabdruecke-von-Wolfgang-Schaeuble-Update--/news/meldung/105701 CCC publiziert die Fingerabdrücke von Wolfgang Schäuble [Update&amp;#93; - heise Security&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in October 2008, CCC's [[Project Blinkenlights]] went to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] with project Stereoscope.&lt;ref&gt;http://blinkenlights.net/stereoscope&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
[[Image:Ccc2003PirateTent.jpg|right|thumb|CCC 2003 camp near Berlin]]

The CCC hosts the annual [[Chaos Communication Congress]], Europe's biggest hacker congress, with up to 4,500 participants. Every four years, the [[Chaos Communication Camp]] is the outdoor alternative for hackers worldwide.

The CCC started a new yearly conference called SIGINT in May 2009 in [[Cologne]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://events.ccc.de/sigint/2009/wiki/Hauptseite Willkommen - SIGINT 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another yearly CCC event taking place on the easter weekend is the [[Easterhegg]], which is more workshop oriented than the other events.

Members of the CCC also participate in various technological and political conferences around the planet.

==Publications==
The CCC publishes the quarterly magazine [[Datenschleuder]] (''data catapult''), and the CCC in [[Berlin]] also produces a monthly radio show called [[Chaosradio]] which picks up various technical and political topics in a two-hour [[talk radio]] show. The program is aired on a local radio station named [[Fritz (radio)|Fritz]]. There is also a podcast spin-off named ''Chaosradio Express'', an international podcast called ''Chaosradio International'' (which has been inactive for a couple of years now), and other radio programs offered by some regional Chaos Groups.

==Members==
Famous members are co-founder [[Wau Holland]] and [[Andy Müller-Maguhn]], who was a member of the [[ICANN]] board of directors for Europe until 2002.

==Chaos Computer Club France==
{{split section|Chaos Computer Club France|date=March 2011}}
The '''Chaos Computer Club France''' (CCCF) was a fake hacker organization created in 1989 in [[Lyon]] (France) by [[w:fr:Jean-Bernard Condat|Jean-Bernard Condat]], under the commandment of Jean-Luc Delacour, an agent of the [[Direction de la surveillance du territoire]] governmental agency. The primary goal of the CCCF was to watch and to gather information about the French hacker community.&lt;ref&gt;{{en}} ''[[Phrack]]'' #64, [http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=64&amp;id=17 &quot;A personal view of the french underground (1992-2007)&quot;], 2007: ''&quot;A good example of this was the fake hacking meeting created in the middle 1990' so called the CCCF (Chaos Computer Club France) where a lot of hackers got busted under the active participation of a renegade hacker so called Jean-Bernard Condat.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Jean Guisnel said that this organization also worked with the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (France)|French National Gendarmerie]].

The name of the organization is directly inspired by the name of the German Chaos Computer Club organization, which in contrast is a real hacker organization.

The CCCF had a electronic magazine called ''Chaos Digest (ChaosD)''. Between January 4, 1993 and August 5, 1993, 73 issues were published ({{ISSN|1244-4901}}).

A '''convention''' is a set of [[wikt:agreement|agreed]], stipulated or generally accepted [[wikt:standard|standard]]s, [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], [[norm (sociology)|social norms]] or [[wikt:criterion|criteria]], often taking the form of a [[Custom (law)|custom]].

Certain types of rules or customs may become [[law]] and regulatory [[legislation]] may be introduced to formalize or enforce the convention (for example,, laws that define on which side of the [[road]] vehicles must be driven). In a [[social context]], a convention may retain the character of an &quot;unwritten&quot; '''law''' of custom (for example,, the manner in which people greet each other, such as by shaking each other's hands).

In [[physical science]]s, numerical values (such as constants, quantities, or scales of measurement) are called '''conventional''' if they do not represent a measured property of nature, but originate in a '''convention''', for example an average of many measurements, agreed between the scientists working with these values.

== General ==
A '''convention''' is a or a selection from among two or more alternatives, where the rule or alternative is agreed upon among participants. Often the word refers to unwritten customs shared throughout a community. For instance, it is conventional in many societies that strangers being introduced shake hands. Some conventions are explicitly legislated; for example, it is conventional in the [[United States]] and in [[Germany]] that motorists [[Driving on the left or right|drive on the right]] side of the road, whereas in [[England]], [[Australia]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Barbados]] they drive on the left. The standardization of time is a human convention based on the solar cycle or calendar. The extent to which [[justice]] is conventional (as opposed to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|natural]] or [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]) is historically an important debate among [[philosopher]]s.

The nature of conventions has raised long-lasting philosophical discussion. [[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]] and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] published influential writings on the subject. Lewis's account of convention received an extended critique in [[Margaret Gilbert]]'s ''On Social Facts'' (1989), where an alternative account is offered. Another view of convention comes from [[Ruth Millikan]]'s ''Language:  A Biological Model'' (2005), once more against Lewis.

[[Gotama Buddha|The Buddha]] described conventions — whether linguistic, social, political, moral, ethical, or even religious — as [[Dependent arising|arising dependent]] on specific conditions. According to his paradigm, when conventions are considered absolute realities, they contribute to dogmatism, which in turn leads to conflict. This does not mean that conventions should be absolutely ignored as unreal and therefore useless. Instead, according to Buddhist thought, a wise person adopts a [[middle way]] without holding conventions to be ultimate or ignoring them when they are fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.'' SUNY Press, 1986, pages 17-18. The author refers specifically to the thought of the Buddha here.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customary or social conventions ==
=== Social ===
{{Main|Norm (sociology)|Mores|Folkways (sociology)|Norm (philosophy)}}
In [[sociology]] a ''social rule'' refers to any social convention commonly adhered to in a [[society]]. These ''rules'' are not written in [[law]] or otherwise formalized. In [[social constructionism]] there is a great focus on social rules. It is argued that these rules are socially constructed, that these rules act upon every member of a society, but at the same time, are re-produced by the individuals.

Sociologists representing [[symbolic interactionism]] argue that social rules are created through the interaction between the members of a society. The focus on active interaction highlights the fluid, shifting character of social rules. These are specific to the social context, a context that varies through time and place. That means a social rule changes over time within the same society. What was acceptable in the past may no longer be the case. Similarly, rules differ across space: what is acceptable in one society may not be so in another.

Social rules reflect what is ''acceptable'' or ''normal'' behaviour in any situation. [[Michel Foucault]]'s concept of [[discourse]] is closely related to social rules as it offers a possible explanation how these rules are shaped and change. It is the social rules that tell people what is ''normal'' behaviour for any specific category. Thus, social rules tell a woman how to behave in a ''womanly'' manner, and a man, how to be ''manly''. Other such rules are as follows:

*strangers being introduced shake hands, as in Western societies, but
**[[Bowing (social)|bow]] toward each other, in [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[China]]
**''do not'' bow at each other, in the Jewish tradition
**in the US, eye contact, a nod of the head toward each other, and a smile, with no bowing; the palm of the hand faces sideways, neither upward nor downward, in a business handshake.
**present business cards to each other, in business meetings
*click heels together, in past eras of Western history
*a woman's [[curtsey]], in some societies
*in the Mideast, never displaying the sole of the foot toward another, as this would be seen as a grave insult.
*In many schools, though seats for students are not assigned they are still &quot;claimed&quot; by certain students, and sitting in someone else's seat is considered an insult

=== Others ===
'''Generic conventions''', which are very closely tied to a particular artistic ''[[genre]]'', and may even help to define what that genre is.
Other '''conventions''' that may simply be expectations are:
*[[painting]]s are rectangular or square
*stock devices (a [[comedy]] ends with a marriage, but a [[cowboy]] [[film]] can end with the hero riding off into the sunset)
* [[Mathematical notation]] follows the [[order of operations]]

== Government ==
In [[government]], '''''convention''''' is a set of unwritten rules that participants in the government must follow. These rules can be ignored only if justification is clear, or can be provided. Otherwise, consequences follow. Consequences may include ignoring some other convention that has until now been followed. According to the traditional doctrine (Dicey){{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, conventions cannot be enforced in courts, because they are non-legal sets of rules. Convention is particularly important in the [[Commonwealth realms]] and other governments using the [[Westminster System]] of government, where many of the rules of government are unwritten.

== International law ==
{{Main|International law}}
The term '''convention''' is also used in [[international law]] to refer to certain formal statements of principle such as the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. Conventions are adopted by international bodies such as the [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[United Nations]]. Conventions so adopted usually apply only to countries that ratify them, and do not automatically apply to member states of such bodies. These conventions are generally seen as having the force of international [[treaty|treaties]] for the ratifying countries. The best known of these are perhaps the several [[Geneva Conventions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{redirect|Cauchy completion|the use in category theory|Karoubi envelope}}
In [[mathematical analysis]], a [[metric space]] ''M'' is called '''complete''' (or '''Cauchy''') if every [[Cauchy sequence]] of points in ''M'' has a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] that is also in ''M'' or alternatively if every Cauchy sequence in ''M'' converges in ''M''.  

Intuitively, a space is complete if there are no &quot;points missing&quot; from it (inside or at the boundary).  Thus, a '''complete metric space''' is analogous to a [[closed set]].  For instance, the set of [[rational number]]s is not complete, because e.g. &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;missing&quot; from it, even though one can construct a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers that converges to it. (See the examples below.)  It is always possible to &quot;fill all the holes&quot;, leading to the ''completion'' of a given space, as explained below.

==Examples==
The space '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s, with the standard metric given by the [[absolute value]], is not complete.  Consider for instance the sequence defined by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; := 1 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; := ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/2 + 1/''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
This is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers, but it does not converge towards any rational limit: If the sequence did have a limit ''x'', then necessarily ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2, yet no rational number has this property. However, considered as a sequence of [[real number]]s, it does converge to the [[irrational number]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[interval (mathematics)|open interval]] (0,1), again with the absolute value metric, is not complete either.
The sequence defined by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''n'' is Cauchy, but does not have a limit in the given space.
However the closed interval [0,1] is complete; the given sequence does have a limit in this interval.

The space '''R''' of real numbers and the space '''C''' of [[complex number]]s (with the metric given by the absolute value) are complete, and so is [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, with the usual distance metric.
In contrast, infinite-dimensional [[normed vector space]]s may or may not be complete; those that are complete are [[Banach space]]s.  The space C[''a'',''b''] of [[continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space|continuous real-valued functions on a closed and bounded interval]] is a Banach space, and so a complete metric space, with respect to the [[supremum norm]].  However, the supremum norm does not give a norm on the space C(''a'',''b'') of continuous functions on (''a'',''b''), for it may contain unbounded functions.  Instead, with the topology of [[compact convergence]], C(''a'',''b'') can be given the structure of a [[Fréchet space]]: a [[locally convex topological vector space]]s whose topology can be induced by a complete translation-invariant metric.

The space '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]]s is complete for any [[prime number]] ''p''.
This space completes '''Q''' with the ''p''-adic metric in the same way that '''R''' completes '''Q''' with the usual metric.

If ''S'' is an arbitrary set, then the set ''S''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[sequence]]s in ''S'' becomes a complete metric space if we define the distance between the sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) to be 1/''N'', where ''N'' is the smallest index for which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[distinct]] from ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, or 0 if there is no such index.
This space is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of a [[countable]] number of copies of the [[discrete space]] ''S''.

A metric space ''X'' is complete if and only if every decreasing sequence of non-empty closed subsets of ''X'', with [[Diameter#Generalisations|diameters]] tending to&amp;nbsp;0, has a non-empty intersection: if ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is closed and non-empty, {{nowrap|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sub; ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for every ''n'',  and diam(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0, then there is a point ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''X'' common to all sets&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Every [[compact space|compact]] metric space is complete, though complete spaces need not be compact. In fact, a metric space is compact [[if and only if]] it is complete and [[totally bounded]]. This is a generalization of the [[Heine-Borel Theorem]], which states that any closed and bounded subspace ''S'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is compact and therefore complete.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces, Ian Stewart, ISBN 978-0-19-853161-6&lt;/ref&gt;

A closed subspace of a complete space is complete. [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/AClosedSubsetOfACompleteMetricSpaceIsComplete.html] Conversely, a complete subset of a metric space is closed. [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ACompleteSubspaceOfAMetricSpaceIsClosed.html]. 

If ''X'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and ''M'' is a complete metric space, then the set B(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''M'') of all [[bounded function]]s ''ƒ'' from ''X'' to ''M'' is a complete metric space. Here we define the distance in B(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''M'') in terms of the distance in ''M'' as

:&lt;math&gt;d(f,g) := \sup\left\{\,d(f(x),g(x)) : x\in X \,\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and ''M'' is a complete metric space, then the set C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''M'') consisting of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] bounded functions ''ƒ'' from ''X'' to ''M'' is a closed subspace of B(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''M'') and hence also complete.

The [[Baire category theorem]] says that every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]]. That is, the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[countable|countably many]] [[nowhere dense]] subsets of the space has [[empty set|empty]] [[interior (topology)|interior]].

The [[Banach fixed point theorem]] states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space admits a fixed point. The fixed point theorem is often used to prove the [[inverse function theorem]] on complete metric spaces such as Banach spaces.

The [[expansion constant]] of a metric space is the [[infimum]] of all constants &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever the family &lt;math&gt;\{ \overline{B}(x_\alpha, r_\alpha) \}&lt;/math&gt; intersects pairwise, the intersection
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_\alpha \overline{B}(x_\alpha, \mu r_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
is nonempty. A metric space is complete if and only if its expansion constant is &lt;math&gt;\le 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;B. Grünbaum, ''[http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.pjm/1103038634 Some applications of expansion constants.]'' Pacific J. Math. Volume 10, Number 1 (1960), 193-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion==
For any metric space ''M'', one can construct a complete metric space ''M''' (which is also denoted as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\overline{M}&lt;/math&gt;), which contains ''M'' as a [[dense subspace]].
It has the following [[universal property]]: if ''N'' is any complete metric space and ''f'' is any [[uniformly continuous function]] from ''M'' to ''N'', then there exists a [[unique]] uniformly continuous function ''f' '' from ''M' '' to ''N'', which extends ''f''.
The space ''M''' is determined [[up to]] [[isometry]] by this property, and is called the ''completion'' of ''M''.

The completion of ''M'' can be constructed as a set of [[equivalence class]]es of Cauchy sequences in ''M''. For any two Cauchy sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''M'', we may define their distance as
: d(''x'',''y'') = lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; d(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).
(This limit exists because the real numbers are complete.) This is only a [[pseudometric]], not yet a metric, since two different Cauchy sequences may have the distance 0. But &quot;having distance 0&quot; is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all Cauchy sequences, and the set of equivalence classes is a metric space, the completion of ''M''.  The original space is embedded in this space via the identification of an element ''x'' of ''M'' with the equivalence class of sequences converging to ''x'' (i.e. the equivalence class containing the sequence with constant value ''x'').  This defines an [[isometry]] onto a dense subspace, as required. Notice, however, that this construction makes explicit use of the completeness of the real numbers,
so completion of the rational numbers needs a slightly different treatment.

[[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s construction of the real numbers is similar to the above construction; the real numbers are the completion of the rational numbers using the ordinary absolute value to measure distances. The additional subtlety to contend with is that it is not logically permissible to use the completeness of the real numbers in their own construction. Nevertheless, equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences are defined as above, and the set of equivalence classes is easily shown to be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] that has the rational numbers as a subfield. This field is complete, admits a natural [[total ordering]], and is the unique totally ordered complete field (up to isomorphism).  It is ''defined'' as the field of real numbers (see also [[Construction of the real numbers]] for more details). One way to visualize this identification with the real numbers as usually viewed is that the equivalence class consisting of those Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that &quot;ought&quot; to have a given real limit is identified with that real number. The truncations of the decimal expansion give just one choice of Cauchy sequence in the relevant equivalence class. 

For a prime ''p'', the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]]s arise by completing the rational numbers with respect to a different metric.

If the earlier completion procedure is applied to a [[normed vector space]], the result is a [[Banach space]] containing the original space as a dense subspace, and if it is applied to an [[inner product space]], the result is a [[Hilbert space]] containing the original space as a dense subspace.

==Topologically complete spaces==
Note that completeness is a property of the ''metric'' and not of the ''[[topology]]'', meaning that a complete metric space can be [[homeomorphic]] to a non-complete one.
An example is given by the real numbers, which are complete but homeomorphic to the open interval (0,1), which is not complete.
Another example is given by the [[irrational number]]s, which are not complete as a subspace of the real numbers but are homeomorphic to '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; (see the sequence example in ''Examples'' above).

In [[topology]] one considers '''[[complete topological space|topologically complete]]''' (or '''completely metrizable''') '''spaces''', spaces for which there exists at least one complete metric inducing the given topology.
Completely metrizable spaces can be characterized as those spaces that can be written as an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of countably many open subsets of some complete metric space. Since the conclusion of the [[Baire category theorem]] is purely topological, it applies to these spaces as well.

A topological space homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space is called a [[Polish space]].

==Alternatives and generalizations==
Since [[Cauchy sequence]]s can also be defined in general [[topological group]]s, an alternative to relying on a metric structure for defining completeness and constructing the completion of a space is to use a group structure. This is most often seen in the context of [[topological vector space]]s, but requires only the existence of a continuous &quot;subtraction&quot; operation. In this setting, the distance between two points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is gauged not by a real number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; via the metric &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; in the comparison &lt;math&gt; d(x,y)&lt;\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;, but by an open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; via subtraction in the comparison &lt;math&gt; x-y \in N&lt;/math&gt;.

A common generalisation of these definitions can be found in the context of a [[uniform space]], where an [[Uniform space#Entourage definition|entourage]] is a set of all pairs of points that are at no more than a particular &quot;distance&quot; from each other, and the ''uniform structure'' is the given collection of entourages for the space and outline of the paper.

It is also possible to replace Cauchy ''sequences'' in the definition of completeness by Cauchy ''[[net (topology)|net]]s'' or [[filter (mathematics)#Filters in uniform spaces|Cauchy filters]].
If every Cauchy net (or equivalently every Cauchy filter) has a limit in ''X'', then ''X'' is called complete.
One can furthermore construct a completion for an arbitrary uniform space similar to the completion of metric spaces. The most general situation in which Cauchy nets apply is [[Cauchy space]]s; these too have a notion of completeness and completion just like uniform spaces.

A topological space may be completely [[uniformisable]] without being completely [[metrisable]]; it is then still not topologically complete.

:''For the mentalist Kreskin (born 1935), see [[The Amazing Kreskin]].''

'''Jeron Criswell King''' (August 18, 1907&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; October 4, 1982), born '''Jeron Criswell Konig''', and known by his stage-name '''The Amazing Criswell''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|z|w|ɛ|l}}), was an [[United States|American]] [[parapsychology|psychic]] known for wildly inaccurate predictions. In person, he went by '''Charles Criswell King''', and was sometimes credited as '''Jeron King Criswell'''.

Criswell was flamboyant with spit curled hair, a [[wikt:stentorian|stentorian]] speaking style and a [[sequin]]ed [[Black tie|tuxedo]]. He owned a [[coffin]] in which he claimed to sleep. He grew up in a troubled family in [[Indiana]] with relatives who owned a funeral home, and said that he became comfortable with sleeping in caskets in the storeroom. The casket appeared in one of [[Ed Wood|Ed Wood's]] later works, the 1971 [[pornography|pornographic]] film, ''[[Necromania]]''.

==Career==
Criswell said he had once worked as a [[radio announcer]] and news broadcaster. He began buying time on a local Los Angeles television station in the early 1950s to run [[infomercials]] for his &quot;Criswell Family Vitamins&quot;. To fill the time, he began his Criswell Predicts part of the show. They made him a minor, off-beat celebrity in Los Angeles and around Hollywood, and his friendship with old show-business types like [[Mae West]] and rising fringe celebrities like [[Korla Pandit]] made Criswell an entertaining presence at parties. His fame brought him appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show|The Jack Paar Show]]'' (1957–1962) and he published two books of predictions.
Criswell found cinematic infamy in the movies of Ed Wood.

==Predictions==
[[File:Plan 9 from Outer Space - Criswell Predicts.ogv|thumb|250px|&quot;Criswell Predicts&quot; scene in [[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]]]
Criswell's predictions were nationally syndicated and he appeared on the television show ''Criswell Predicts'' on KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP-13) in Los Angeles as well as being recorded for syndication. His announcer was Bob Shields, who later played the judge on ''[[Divorce Court]]''. Criswell wore heavy makeup in public after his live program was broadcast in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Only selected people were allowed in the KCOP studio during his broadcast. They were often taken to the [[Brown Derby]] restaurant afterwards as his guests.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  

Criswell wrote several books of predictions, including 1968's ''Criswell Predicts: From Now to the Year 2000.'' In it, he claimed that [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] would be struck by a ray from space that would cause all metal to adopt the qualities of [[Natural rubber|rubber]], leading to horrific accidents at amusement parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deeky.blogspot.com/2010/02/criswell-predicts-pt-1.html Dharma Pancakes: Criswell Predicts (Part 1)]&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted mass [[cannibalism]]&lt;ref name=predicts&gt;[http://deeky.blogspot.com/2010/02/criswell-predicts-pt-5.html Dharma Pancakes: Criswell Predicts (Part 5)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[end of planet Earth]], which he set as happening on August 18, 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;predicts&quot;/&gt; 

Criswell was a student of history. He believed history repeated itself, that the [[United States]] were the &quot;modern Romans&quot;. Each day, he read the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' looking for clues for his predictions. In later years, he became obsessed with the [[Maya calendar]] and read all he could find. Just prior to his death, he told people that his &quot;end of the world predictions&quot; were incorrect by a dozen years and that the world would end on the morning of the [[winter solstice]] in 2012, the [[Mayan calendar ending|last day of current 5,000-plus years cycle of the Mayan calendar]].

Some sources claim Criswell's most famous prediction was on ''[[Jack Paar|The Jack Paar Program]]'' (1962–65) in March 1963, when he predicted [[John F. Kennedy]] would not run for reelection in 1964 because [[John F. Kennedy assassination|something]] was going to happen to him in November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c-e-n-t-e-r.com/ed_interview.html C-E-N-T-E-R ART PROJECT interview with Criswell biographer Edwin L. Canfield]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources say that Criswell never claimed to be a real psychic however, those who knew him, such as actress and fellow ''Plan 9'' alumna [[Maila Nurmi]] (&quot;Vampira&quot;), believed he was. According to writer [[Charles A. Coulombe]], whose family rented an apartment from him, Criswell told Coulombe's father &quot;[I] had the gift, but&amp;nbsp;... lost it when I started taking money for it.&quot;

==Private life==
Criswell married a former [[speakeasy]] dancer named [[Halo Meadows]], who appeared on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', and whom Coulombe describes as &quot;quite mad&quot;: &quot;Mrs Criswell had a huge standard [[poodle]] (named &quot;Buttercup&quot;) which she was convinced was the [[reincarnation]] of her cousin Thomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;criswellpredicts.com&quot;&gt;http://www.criswellpredicts.com/criswell.htm&lt;/ref&gt; She spent a great deal of time [[Sun tanning|sunbathing]]&amp;nbsp;... which, given her size, was not too pleasing a sight.&quot;

[[Mae West]] used Criswell as her personal psychic, he once predicted her rise to [[President of the United States]], whereupon she, Criswell and George Liberace, the brother of showman [[Liberace]], would take a rocket to the moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;criswellpredicts.com&quot;/&gt; Criswell and West were great friends and she would lavish him with home-cooked food she had delivered to the studio that he shared with [[Maila Nurmi]] (&quot;Vampira&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hulu.com/watch/85365/haunted-world-of-ed-wood-jr&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that West sold Criswell her old luxury cars for five dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;criswellpredicts.com&quot;/&gt;

==In popular culture==

On Mae West's 1955 album ''The Fabulous Mae West'', she recorded a song, &quot;Criswell Predicts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;criswellpredicts.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://musicnotmusic.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/mae-west-sings-about-criswell/&lt;/ref&gt;

Criswell has been portrayed by many different actors over the years. Perhaps the most notable portrayal was by [[Jeffrey Jones]] in the 1994 [[Tim Burton]] biopic, ''Ed Wood''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109707/&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, several stage actors, including Sean Phillip Mabrey,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o3L539Xb5g&lt;/ref&gt; have played Criswell in ''Plan 9 from Outer Space: The Musical'', written by David G. Smith. Another incarnation of Criswell would appear in the 1999 homage to low budget films, ''Devil Girls'',&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198417/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;/&gt; played by Rob Gorden (in a poorly styled wig). Craig Brown played Criswell in ''Plan Live From Outer Space'', the 2006 stage adaptation of ''[[Plan 9 From Outer Space]]'' which won a Canadian Comedy Award in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1108860/&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 2009, a teaser trailer&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh-gdpJxJo&lt;/ref&gt; was released by Darkstone Entertainment for the upcoming John Johnson film ''Plan 9'',&lt;ref&gt;http://plan9movie.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a remake of ''Plan 9 From Outer Space''. The voice of popular television [[horror host]] [[Mr. Lobo]] can be heard narrating the trailer as Criswell. He will also star in the film as Criswell who has a much larger role in this re-imagining of the original [[Ed Wood]] story. In addition, for the purpose of promoting the film on the internet, Mr. Lobo has produced 62 episodes of ''Criswell Predicts!''&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/11636849&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/11616048&lt;/ref&gt; which is a parody and homage to Criswell’s original television program of the same name ''sans'' the exclamation mark.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|chain reactions in chemistry and physics}}
A '''chain reaction''' is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions to take place. In a chain reaction, [[positive feedback]] leads to a self-amplifying [[chain of events]]. 

==Chemical chain reactions==

In 1913 the German chemist [[Max Bodenstein]] first put forth the idea of chemical chain reactions. If two molecules react, not only molecules of the final reaction products are formed, but also some unstable molecules, having the property of being able to further react with the parent molecules with a far larger probability than the initial reactants. In the new reaction, further unstable molecules are formed besides the stable products, and so on. 

In 1923, Danish and Dutch scientists [[Christian Christiansen]] and [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers]], in an analysis of formation of polymers, pointed out that such a chain reaction need not start with a molecule excited by light, but could also start with two molecules colliding violently in the traditional way classically previously proposed for initiation of chemical reactions, by [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|
van' t Hoff]].

Christiansen and Kramers also noted that if, in one link of the reaction chain, two or more unstable molecules are produced, the reaction chain would branch and grow. The result is in fact an exponential growth, thus giving rise to explosive increases in reaction rates, and indeed to chemical explosions themselves. This was the first proposal for the mechanism of chemical explosions. 

A quantitative chain chemical reaction theory was created by Soviet physicist [[Nikolay Semyonov]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?&amp;id=29264&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; Semyanov shared the Nobel Prize in 1956 with Sir [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]], who independently developed many of the same quantitative concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/press.html History of the chemical chain reaction from 1913 to the Nobel work recognized in 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

The main steps of chain reaction are the following.
* Initiation (at this step an active particle, often a [[free radical]], is produced);
* propagation (may comprise several elementary steps, as, for instance,  reaction elementary acts, where the active particle through reaction forms another active particle which continues the reaction chain by entering the next elementary step); particular cases are:
:: * chain branching (the case of propagation step when more new active particles form in the step than enter it);
:: * chain transfer (the case in which one active particle enters an elementary reaction with the inactive particle which as a result becomes another active particle along with forming of another inactive particle from the initial active one);
* termination (elementary step in which active particle loses its activity without transferring the chain; e. g. [[recombination]] of the free radicals).

A nuclear chain reaction was proposed by [[Leo Szilard]] in 1933, shortly after the neutron was discovered, but some years before [[nuclear fission]] was discovered. Szilard proposed to use neutrons from certain nuclear reactions in lighter isotopes, to induce further reactions in light isotopes that produced more neutrons. He did not envision [[nuclear fission]] as one of these reactions, since this reaction was not known at the time. Experiments he proposed using [[beryllium]] and [[indium]] failed.

Later, after [[nuclear fission]] was discovered in 1938, Szilard immediately realized the possibility of using neutron-induced fission as the particular nuclear reaction needed for a chain-reaction, so long as fission also produced neutrons. In 1939, with Enrico Fermi, Szilard proved this neutron-multiplying rection in uranium. In this reaction, a [[neutron]] plus a [[fission]]able [[atom]] causes a fission resulting in a larger number of neutrons than the single one that was consumed in the initial reaction. Thus was born the practical [[nuclear chain reaction]] by the mechanism of neutron-induced nuclear fission. 

Specifically, if one or more of the produced neutrons themselves interact with other fissionable nuclei, and these also undergo fission, then there is a possibility that the macroscopic overall fission reaction will not stop, but continue throughout the reaction material. This is then a self-propagating and thus self-sustaining chain reaction. This is the principle for [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[atomic bomb]]s.  

[The above description is somewhat simplified.  The crucial issue is whether enough of those secondary neutrons themselves produce a further fission.  The nuclear chain reaction is described in significantly more detail in the article on [[Stan Ulam]], who &quot;discovered&quot; or realized the details of the amplification concept, when fission by prompt fission neutrons were the mechanism].

Demonstration of a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was accomplished by [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, in the successful operation of [[Chicago Pile-1]], the first artificial nuclear reactor, in late 1942.

==Chain Reactions in Economics==

In 1963 Friedman and Schwartz &lt;ref&gt;Friedman and Schwartz 1963: P.419: The Banking Crisis in USA:&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a positive feedback loop as a mechanism for catastrophic failures in economics: “It happens that a liquidity crisis in a unit fractional reserve banking system is precisely the kind of event that trigger- and often has triggered- a '''chain reaction'''. And economic collapse often has the character of a cumulative process. Let it go beyond a certain point, and it will tend for a time to gain strength from its own development as its effects spread and return to intensify the process of collapse”.

*For example in a [[chemical reaction]] every step of  [[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] chain reaction consumes one [[molecule]] of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, one [[free radical]] H· or Cl· producing one [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]] molecule and another free radical.
*[[Electron avalanche]] process: Collisions of [[free electron]]s in a strong [[electric field]]  releasing &quot;new&quot; electrons to undergo the same process in successive cycles.
* A [[cascading failure]], a failure in a system of interconnected parts, for example a [[Power grid|power transmission grid]], where the service provided depends on the operation of a preceding part, and the failure of a preceding part can trigger the failure of successive parts.
*[[Polymerase chain reaction]], a technique used in [[molecular biology]] to amplify (make many copies of) a piece of [[DNA]] by ''[[in vitro]]'' [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[DNA replication|replication]] using
